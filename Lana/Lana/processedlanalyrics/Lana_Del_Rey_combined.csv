but finally its mine
with drippin peaches im cameraready
almost all the time
but i still get lonely and baby only then
do i let myself recline
can i let go and let your memory dance
in the ballroom of my mind
across the county line
it hurts to love you but i still love you
its just the way i feel
and id be lyin if i kept hidin
the fact that i cant deal
and that ive been dyin for somethin real

will i die or will i get to that tenyear mark
where i beat the extinction of telomeres
and if i do will you be there with me father sister brother
charlie stop smoking
caroline will you be with me
will the baby be alright
will i have one of mine
can i handle it even if i do
its said that my mind
is not fit or so they said to carry a child
i guess ill be fine
it wasnt my idea the cocktail of things that twists neurons inside
but without them id die
they say theres irony in the music its a tragedy i
see nothing greek in it
give me a mausoleum in rhode island with dad grandma grandpa and dave
who hung himself real high
in the national park sky its a shame and im crying right now
to get to you save you if i take my life
find your astral body put it into my arms
give you two seconds to cry
take you home i ill give you a blanket
your spirit can sit and watch tv by my side
cause baby i
ran through a time when i felt you were doing it
see lana del rey liveget tickets as low as you might also like
i couldnt handle it i was in monaco
i couldnt hear what they said on the telephone
i had to sing for the prince in two hours
sat in the shower
gave myself two seconds to cry
its a shame that we die
when i was fifteen naked nextdoor neighbors did a driveby
pulled me up by my waist long hair to the beach side
i wanted to go out like you swim with the fishes
that he caught on rhode island beaches
but sometimes its just not your time
caroline what kind of mother was she to say id end up in institutions
all i wanted to do was kiss aaron greene and sit by
the lake twisting lime into the drinks that they made
have a babe at sixteen in the town i was born in and die
aaron ended up dead and not me
what the fucks wrong in your head to send me away never to come back
exotic places and people dont take the place of being your child
i give myself two seconds to cry
let it crash over me
like the waves in the sea
call me aphrodite as they bow down to me
sunbather moon chaser queen of empathy
i give myself two seconds to breathe
and go back to being a serene queen
i just needed two seconds to be me

from the ordinary world
to the reveal of my heart
undoubtedly that will for certain
take the dead out of the sea
and the darkness from the arts
this is my commitment my modern manifesto
im doin it for all of us who never got the chance
for and for and all my birds of paradise who never got to fly at night cause they were caught up in the dance
sometimes it feels like ive got a war in my mind
i wanna get off but i keep ridin the ride
i never really noticed that i had to decide
to play someones game or live my own life
and now i do i wanna move
out of the black into the blue finally gone is the burden
of the crowley way of bein
that comes from energies combined

i was in the winter of my life
and the men i met along the road were my only summer
at night i fell asleep with visions of myself dancing and laughing and crying with them
three years down the line of being on an endless world tour and my memories of them were the only things that sustained me
and my only real happy times
i was a singer
not a very popular one
i once had dreams of becoming a beautiful poet
but upon an unfortunate series of events saw those dreams dashed and divided like a million stars in the night sky
that i wished on over and over again sparkling and broken
but i didnt really mind because i knew that it takes getting everything you ever wanted and then losing it to know what true freedom is
when the people i used to know found out what i had been doing how i had been living they asked me why but theres no use in talking to people who have a home
they have no idea what its like to seek safety in other people
for home to be wherever you lie your head
i was always an unusual girl
my mother told me that i had a chameleon soul
no moral compass pointing due north
no fixed personality
just an inner indecisiveness that was as wide and as wavering as the ocean
and if i said i didnt plan for it to turn out this way id be lying
because i was born to be the other woman
who belonged to no one
who belonged to everyone
who had nothing
who wanted everything
with a fire for every experience and an obsession for freedom that terrified me to the point that i couldnt even talk about it
and pushed me to a nomadic point of madness that both dazzled and dizzied me
see lana del rey liveget tickets as low as every night i used to pray that id find my people
and finally i did
on the open road
we had nothing to lose nothing to gain nothing we desired anymore
except to make our lives into a work of art
live fast
die young
be wild
and have fun
i believe in the country america used to be
i believe in the person i want to become
i believe in the freedom of the open road
and my motto is the same as ever
i believe in the kindness of strangers
and when im at war with myself
i ride
i just ride
who are you
are you in touch with all of your darkest fantasies
have you created a life for yourself where you can experience them
i have
i am fucking crazy
but i am free
oohoohoohooh oohoohooh
oohoohoohooh oohoohooh
i been out on that open road
but you can be my fulltime daddy white and gold
singing blues has been gettin old
but you can be my fulltime baby hot or cold
dont break me down i been traveling too long i been tryin too hard with one pretty song i hear the birds on the summer breeze i drive fast

been trying hard not to get into trouble but i

monsters still under my bed that i could never fight off
