theres somethin in the wind i can feel it blowin in
its comin in softly on the wings of a bomb
theres somethin in the wind i can feel it blowin in
its comin in hotly and its coming in strong
lately ive been thinkin its just someone elses job to care
who am i to sympathize when no one gave a damn
ive been thinkin its just someone elses job to care
who am i to wanna try but
change is a powerful thing people are powerful beings
tryin to find the power in me to be faithful
change is a powerful thing i feel it comin in me
maybe by the time summers done
ill be able to be honest capable
of holdin you in my arms without lettin you fall
when i dont feel beautiful or stable
maybe its enough to just be where we are because
every time that we run we dont know what its from
now we finally slow down we feel close to it
theres a change gonna come i dont know where or when
but whenever it does well be here for it
theres somethin in the wind i can feel it blowin in
its comin in softly on the wings of a song
theres somethin in the water i can taste it turnin sour
its bitter im coughing but now its in my blood
lately ive been thinkin its just someone elses job to care
who am i to sympathize when no one gave a damn
ive been thinkin its just someone elses job to care
cause who am i to wanna try but
