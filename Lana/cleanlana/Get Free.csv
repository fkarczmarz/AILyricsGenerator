finally im crossing the threshold
from the ordinary world
to the reveal of my heart
undoubtedly that will for certain
take the dead out of the sea
and the darkness from the arts
this is my commitment my modern manifesto
im doin it for all of us who never got the chance
for and for and all my birds of paradise who never got to fly at night cause they were caught up in the dance
sometimes it feels like ive got a war in my mind
i wanna get off but i keep ridin the ride
i never really noticed that i had to decide
to play someones game or live my own life
and now i do i wanna move
out of the black into the blue finally gone is the burden
of the crowley way of bein
that comes from energies combined
like my part was i was not discernin
and you as we found out
were not in your right mind
theres no more chasing rainbows and hoping for an end to them
their arches are illusions solid at first glance
but then you try to touch them theres nothing to hold on to the colors used to lure you in and put you in a trance sometimes it feels like ive got a war in my mind
i wanna get off but i keep ridin the ride
i never really noticed that i had to decide
to play someones game or live my own life
and now i do i wanna move
out of the black into the blue out of the black into the blue out of the black into the blue
