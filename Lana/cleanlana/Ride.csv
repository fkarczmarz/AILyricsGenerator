oohoohoohooh oohoohooh
i been out on that open road
but you can be my fulltime daddy white and gold
singing blues has been gettin old
but you can be my fulltime baby hot or cold
dont break me down i been traveling too long i been tryin too hard with one pretty song i hear the birds on the summer breeze i drive fast
i am alone at midnight
been trying hard not to get into trouble but i
ive got a war in my mind
so i just ride just ride
i just ride i just ride
dying young and playing hard
thats the way my father made his life and art
drink all day and we talk til dark
thats the way the road dogs do it light til dark
dont leave me now dont say goodbye dont turn around leave me high and dry i hear the birds on the summer breeze i drive fast
i am alone at midnight
been trying hard not to get into trouble but i
ive got a war in my mind
i just ride just ride
i just ride i just ride
im tired of feeling like im fucking crazy
im tired of driving til i see stars in my eyes
its all ive got to keep myself sane baby
so i just ride i just ride
i hear the birds on the summer breeze i drive fast
i am alone at midnight
been trying hard not to get into trouble but i
ive got a war in my mind
i just ride just ride
i just ride i just ride
