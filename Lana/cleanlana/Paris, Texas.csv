i went to paris with a suitcase in my hand
i had to leave
knew they wouldnt understand
when you know you know
when you know you know
its time its time to go
when you know you know
then the more you know
its time to go
i took a train to spain
just a notebook in my hand
then i went to see some friends of mine
down in florence alabama
when you know you know
when you know you know
its time its time to go
when you know you know
that its time to leave
like the summer breeze
when everyones star is bright
brighter than you are
its time to go
and youre the only one left
dancin while theyre on the floor
time to go
i flew back home
it seems everythings the same except that you werent home
hello i call to no one when youre home youre home when youre home youre home youre home when youre alone
when youre right youre right
when youre right youre right
even when youre wrong
