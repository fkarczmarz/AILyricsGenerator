flames so hot that they turn blue
palms reflecting in your eyes
like an endless summer

if time stood still id take this moment make it last forever
your halos full of fire
im rising up rising up
my hot loves full of fire

screw your anonymity loving me is all you need
to feel like i do
we could slow dance to rock music kiss while we do it
talk til we both turn blue
baby if you wanna leave come to california
be a freak like me too
leather black and eyes of blue sun reflecting in your eyes
like an easy rider

looking back my past
it all seems stranger than a stranger
so lets dance in slow motion
tear it up tear it up
and lets dance by the ocean
