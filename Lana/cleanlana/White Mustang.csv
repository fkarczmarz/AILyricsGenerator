packin all my things for the summer
lyin on my bed its a bummer
cause i didnt call when i got your number
but i liked you a lot
slippin on my dress in soft filters
everybody said youre a killer
but i couldnt stop the way i was feelin
the day your record dropped
the day i saw your white mustang
your white mustang
the day i saw your white mustang
your white mustang
caught up in my dreams and forgettin
ive been actin like armageddon cause you
held me in your arms just a little too tight
thats what i thought
summers meant for lovin and leavin
i was such a fool for believin that you
could change all the ways youve been livin
but you just couldnt stop
the day i saw your white mustang
your white mustang
the day i saw your white mustang
your white mustang
and youre revvin and revvin and revvin it up
and the sound it was frightenin
and you were gettin a part of that
youre gonna hit me like lightnin
white mustang
your white mustang
the day i saw your white mustang
said youre a wild mustang
youre gonna hit me like lightnin
youre gonna hit me like lightnin
