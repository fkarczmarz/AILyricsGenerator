i come from a small town how bout you
i only mention it cause im ready to leave la
and i want you to come
eighty miles north or south will do
i dont care where as long as youre with me
and im with you and you let me
let me love you like a woman
let me hold you like a baby
let me shine like a diamond
let me be who im meant to be
talk to me in poems and songs
dont make me be bittersweet
let me love you like a woman
let me hold you like a baby
let me hold you like a baby
i come from a small town far away
i only mention it cause im ready to leave la
and i want you to come i guess i could manage if you stay
its just if you do i cant see myself having any fun so
let me love you like a woman
let me hold you like a baby
let me shine like a diamond
let me be who im meant to be
talk to me in songs and poems
dont make me be bittersweet
let me love you like a woman
take you to infinity
let me love you like a woman take you to infinity
let me love you like a woman take you to infinity
we could get lost in the purple rain
talk about the good ol days
we could get high on some pink champagne
baby let me count the ways
let me love you like a woman
let me hold you like a baby
let me shine like a diamond
let me be who im meant to be
talk to me in songs and poems
dont make me be bittersweet
let me love you like a woman
