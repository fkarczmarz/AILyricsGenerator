you can whistle for it
baby youll never grow old in my eyes
with your golden grill true love never dies
you wanna watch me while i watch tv
while youre tttttouching me
were forever young in paradise
as long as you got the chevrolet i will ride
were gonna party like its were in that chevrolet from july to july
gonna see it all before he says goodbye
every man deserves to see the sunrise
every man gets his wish
every man gets his wish
you told me this
where is mine
you said id never make it out outta here alive
at the rate i was going id be lucky to die
i was born so bad not naturally right
the brightest star on hollywood and vine
were gonna party like were running outta time
were getting drunk and driving fast on cherry wine
never do belong to anyone i find
leaving everything i ever knew behind
every man gets his wish
every man gets his wish
you told me this
where is mine
every man gets his wish
every man gets his wish
promised me this
well you lied
i learned how to make love from the movies
he found me waitressing at ruby tuesdays
he said i wanna buy you a classic white milkshake
i said ill serve you up a special side of heartbreak
special side of heartbreak
i was working down in the corner cafe
you drove by in a chevrolet
whistle at me as my hips go sway
lana del rey how you get that way
how you get that way
i said he loves my heart shaped sunglasses
he loves the heart shape my ass is
cristal crystal champagne glasses
every man gets his wish
every man gets his wish
you told me this
where is mine
every man gets his wish
every man gets his wish
promised me this
well you lied
