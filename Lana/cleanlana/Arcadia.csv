my body is a map of la
i stand straight like an angel with a halo
hangin out the hilton hotel window
screamin hey you baby lets go
my chest the sierra madre
my hips every high and byway
that you trace with your fingertips like a toyota
run your hands over me like a land rover
in arcadia arcadia
all roads that lead to you as integral to me as arteries
that pump the blood that flows straight to the heart of me
america america
i cant sleep at home tonight send me a hilton hotel
or a cross on the hill im a lost little girl
findin my way to you arcadia
my body is a map of la
and my heart is like paper i hate you
im not from the land of the palms so i know i cant stay here
im not native but
my curves san gabriel all day
and my lips like the fire licks the bay
if you think that you know yourself you can come over
lay your hands on me like youre a land rover
in arcadia arcadia
all roads that lead to you as integral to me as arteries
that get the blood flowing straight to the heart of me
america i need a miracle
i cant sleep at home tonight send me a hilton hotel
or a cross on the hill im a lost little girl
findin my way to you arcadia
they built me up threehundred feet tall just to tear me down
so im leavin with nothing but laughter and this town
arcadia
findin my way to you
im leavin them as i was fivefooteight western belt
plus the hate that they gave
by the way thanks for that on the way ill pray for you
but youll need a miracle america
