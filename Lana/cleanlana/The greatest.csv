i miss long beach and i miss you babe
i miss dancing with you the most of all
i miss the bar where the beach boys would go
dennis last stop before kokomo
those nights were on fire
we couldnt get higher
we didnt know that we had it all
but nobody warns you before the fall
and im wasted
dont leave i just need a wakeup call
im facing the greatest
the greatest loss of them all
the culture is lit and i had a ball
i guess im signing off after all
i miss new york and i miss the music
me and my friends we miss rock n roll
i want shit to feel just like it used to
when baby i was doing nothin the most of all
the culture is lit and if this is it i had a ball
i guess that im burned out after all
im wasted
dont leave i just need a wakeup call
im facing the greatest
the greatest loss of them all
the culture is lit and i had a ball
i guess that im burned out after all
if this is it im signing off
miss doing nothin the most of all
hawaii just missed that fireball
la is in flames its getting hot
kanye west is blond and gone
life on mars aint just a song
oh the live streams almost on
