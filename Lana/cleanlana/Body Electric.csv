elvis is my daddy
marilyns my mother
jesus is my bestest friend
we dont need nobody
cause we got each other
or at least i pretend
we get down every friday night
dancing and grinding in the pale moonlight

mary prays the rosary for my broken mind i sing the body electric
i sing the body electric baby
i sing the body electric
i sing the body electric
sing that body electric
sing that body electric
im on fire
sing that body electric
whitman is my daddy
monacos my mother
diamonds are my bestest friend
heaven is my baby
suicides her father
opulence is the end
we get down every friday night
dancing and grinding in the pale moonlight
grand ole opry
were feeling alright
mary prays the rosary for my broken mind i sing the body electric
i sing the body electric baby
i sing the body electric
i sing the body electric
sing that body electric
sing that body electric
im on fire
sing that body electric
my clothes still smell like you
and all the photographs say youre still young
i pretend im not hurt
and go about the world like im having fun
we get crazy every friday night
drop it like its hot in the pale moonlight
grand ole opry

mary swaying softly to her hearts delight
i sing the body electric
i sing the body electric baby
i sing the body electric
i sing the body electric
