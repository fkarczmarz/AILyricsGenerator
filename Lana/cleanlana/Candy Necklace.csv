white fire cinnamon on my teeth
and im sittin at the stoplight northern town
i feel lucky
i drive somewhere out of range i dont know where
white noise comin all in my brain
turns off for nothing
rockafella my umbrella
god i love you baby
storyteller us forever
is my favorite song
youve been actin pretty restless
dancin like the young and restless
and im obsessed with it
candy necklaces
youve been actin pretty reckless
dancin like the young and restless
and im obsessеd with this
all his candy necklaces
sittin on the sofa feelin supеr suicidal
hate to say the word but baby hand on the bible i do
feel like its you the one whos bringin me down
thought that we were cool and we were kickin it like tribe called quest
you the best but baby youve been bringin me down
i can see it now
rockafella my umbrella
god i love you baby
fortune teller favorite ever
thats the story of us
youve been actin pretty restless
dancin like the young and reckless
and im obsessed with this
candy necklaces
i think that we should address this
actin like the young and restless
im obsessed with this
all his candy necklaces
weve been actin pretty restless
dancin like the young and restless
im obsessed with this
candy necklaces
candy necklaces
candy necklaces
candy necklaces
candy necklaces candy necklaces candy necklaces candy necklaces
candy necklaces
candy necklaces candy necklaces candy necklaces
candy necklaces
candy necklaces
candy necklaces
