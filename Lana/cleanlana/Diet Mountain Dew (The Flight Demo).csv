lets take jesus off the dashboard
got enough on his mind
we both know just what were here for
saved too many times
maybe i like this roller coaster
maybe it keeps me high
maybe the speed it brings me closer
i could sparkle up your eye
hurt me and tell me youre mine
i dont know why but i like it
scary my god youre divine
