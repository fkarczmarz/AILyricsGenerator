i havent done a cartwheel since i was nine
i havent seen my mother in a long long time
i mean look at me
look at the length of my hair and my face the shape of my body
do you really think i give a damn
what i do after years of just hearing them talking
i say i live in rosemead really im at the ramada
it doesnt really matter doesnt really really matter
call him up come into my bedroom
ended up we fuck on the hotel floor
its not about havin someone to love me anymorе
this is the experiеnce of bein an american whore
called up one drunk called up another
forensic files wasnt on
watching teenage diary of a girl
wondering what went wrong
im a princess im divisive
ask me why why why im like this
maybe im just kinda like this
i dont know maybe im just like this
i say i live in rosemead really im at the ramada
it doesnt really matter doesnt really really matter
call him up he comes over again
yeah i know im over my head but oh
its not about havin someone to love me anymore
no this is the experience of bein an american whore
i mean look at my hair
look at the length of it and the shape of my body
if i told you that i was raped
do you really think that anybody would think
i didnt ask for it i didnt ask for it
i wont testify i already fucked up my story
on top of this so many other things you cant believe
did you know a singer can still be
looking like a sidepiece at thirtythree
got a cop who turned on the backbeat
puts the shower on while he calls me
slips out the back door to talk to me
im invisible look how you hold me
im invisible im invisible
im a ghost now look how you hold me now
its not about havin someone to love me anymore no this is the experience of bein an american whore
its not about havin someone to love me anymore
no this is the experience of bein an american whore
this is the experience of bein an american whore
this is the experience of bein an american whore
this is the experience of bein an american whore
