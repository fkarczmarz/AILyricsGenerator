three white butterflies to know youre near
i know they think that it took somebody else
to make me beautiful beautiful
as they intended me to be
but theyre wrong
i know they think that it took thousands of people
to put me together again like an experiment
some big men behind the scenes
sewing frankenstein black dreams into my songs
but theyre wrong
god if yourе near me send mе three white butterflies
or an owl to know youre listening sitting while im drinking
grandfather please stand on the shoulders of my father
while hes deepsea fishing for sharks in the pacific
cause im good in spirit warmbodied
a fallible deity wrapped up in white
im folk im jazz im blue im green
regrettably also a white woman
but i have good intentions even if im one of the last ones
if you dont believe me my poetry or my melodies
feel it in your bones
i have good intentions even if im one of the last ones grandfather please stand on the shoulders of my father
while hes deepsea fishing for all the things hes wishing
god if youre near me send me three white butterflies
or a map to know your vision impart on me your wisdom
it took somebody else to make me beautiful wonderful
as they intended me to be
but theyre wrong
three white butterflies to know youre near
