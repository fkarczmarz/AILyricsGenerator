all the ladies of the canyon
wearing black to their house parties
crosby stills and nash is playing
wine is flowing with bacardi
but sometimes girls just want to have fun
the poetry inside of me is warm like a gun
i bought me a truck in the middle of the night
itll buy me a year if i play my cards right
photofree exits from babys bedside
cause they dont yet know what car i drive
im just tryna keep my love alive
with my bartender hold me all night
bartender our loves alive
baby remember im not drinking wine
but that cherry coke you serve is fine
and our loves sweet enough on the vine

all the ladies of the canyon
wearing white for their tea parties
playing games of levitation
meditating in the garden
and i love the little games that we play
from the valley to the beach
and when at last the day is done i grab my keys
i bought me a truck in the middle of the night
itll buy me a year if i play my cards right
photofree exits from babys bedside
cause they dont yet know what car i drive
im just tryna keep my love alive
with my bartender hold me all night
bartender our loves alive
baby remember im not drinking wine
but that cherry coke you serve is fine
and our loves sweet enough on the vine
