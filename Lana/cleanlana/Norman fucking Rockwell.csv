goddamn manchild
you fucked me so good that i almost said i love you
youre fun and youre wild
but you dont know the half of the shit that you put me through
your poetrys bad and you blame the news
but i cant change that and i cant change your mood ah
cause youre just a man
its just what you do
your head in your hands
as you color me blue
yeah youre just a man
all through and through
your head in your hands
as you color me blue
blue blue blue
goddamn manchild
you act like a kid even though you stand six foot two
selfloathing poet resident laurel canyon knowitall
you talk to the walls when the party gets bored of you
but i dont get bored i just see it through
why wait for the best when i could have you you
cause youre just a man
its just what you do
your head in your hands
as you color me blue
yeah youre just a man
all through and through
your head in your hands
as you color me blue
blue blue
you make me blue
blue blue
blue blue blue
