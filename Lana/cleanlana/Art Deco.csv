club queen on the downtown scene
prowling around at night
youre not mean youre just born to be seen
born to be wild
a little party never hurt no one thats why its alright
you want in but you just cant win
so you hang in the lights
youre so art deco out on the floor
shining like gunmetal cold and unsure
baby youre so ghetto youre looking to score
when they all say hello you try to ignore them
cause you want more you want more you want more cause you want more
young thing on the downtown scene
rolling around at night
got things that have yet to be seen
like your rappers delight
a little party never hurt no one thats why its alright
you want in but you just cant win
so you stay in the lights
youre so art deco out on the floor
shining like gunmetal cold and unsure
baby youre so ghetto youre looking to score
when they all say hello you try to ignore them
cause you want more you want more you want more cause you want more
a little party never hurt no one
so you stay out late
a little party never hurt no one
thats what your friends say
you put your life out on the line
youre crazy all the time
put your life out on the line
youre crazy all the time
youre so art deco out on the floor
shining like gunmetal cold and unsure
baby youre so ghetto youre looking to score
when they all say hello you try to ignore them
cause you want more you want more you want more cause you want more
a little party never hurt no one
not you and me
a little party never hurt no one
we were born to be free
