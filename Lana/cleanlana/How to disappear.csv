john met me down on the boulevard
cry on his shoulder cause life is hard
the waves came in over my head
what you been up to my baby
havent seen you round here lately
all of the guys tell me lies but you dont
you just crack another beer
and pretend that youre still here
this is how to disappear
this is how to disappear
joe met me down at the training yard
cuts on his face cause he fought too hard
i know hes in over his head
but i love that man like nobody can
he moves mountains and pounds them to ground again
i watched the guys getting high as they fight
for the things that they hold dear
to forget the things they fear
this is how to disappear
this is how to disappear
now its been years since i left new york
ive got a kid and two cats in the yard
the california sun and the movie stars
i watch the skies getting light as i write
as i think about those years
as i whisper in your ear
im always going to be right here
no ones going anywhere
