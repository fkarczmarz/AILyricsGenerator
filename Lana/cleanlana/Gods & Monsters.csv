in the land of gods and monsters
i was an angel living in the garden of evil
screwed up scared doing anything that i needed
shining like a fiery beacon
you got that medicine i need
fame liquor love give it to me slowly
put your hands on my waist do it softly
me and god we dont get along so now i sing
no ones gonna take my soul away
im living like jim morrison
headed towards a fucked up holiday
motel sprees sprees and im singing
fuck yeah give it to me this is heaven what i truly want
its innocence lost innocence lost
in the land of gods and monsters
i was an angel looking to get fucked hard
like a groupie incognito posing as a real singer
life imitates art
you got that medicine i need
dope shoot it up straight to the heart please
i dont really wanna know whats good for me
gods dead i said baby thats alright with me
no ones gonna take my soul away
im living like jim morrison
headed towards a fucked up holiday
motel sprees sprees and im singing
fuck yeah give it to me this is heaven what i truly want
its innocence lost innocence lost
when you talk its like a movie and youre makin me crazy
cause life imitates art
if i get a little prettier can i be your baby
you tell me life isnt that hard
no ones gonna take my soul away
im living like jim morrison
headed towards a fucked up holiday
motel sprees sprees and im singing
fuck yeah give it to me this is heaven what i truly want
its innocence lost innocence lost
