blue hydrangea cold cash divine
cashmere cologne and white sunshine
red racing cars sunset and vine
the kids were young and pretty
where have you been where did you go
those summer nights seem long ago
and so is the girl you used to call
the queen of new york city
but if you send for me you know ill come
and if you call for me you know ill run
ill run to you ill run to you
ill run run run
ill come to you ill come to you
ill come come come
oh oh oh oh oh
oh oh oh oh
ah ah ah ah ah
ah ah ah ah
the power of youth is on my mind
sunsets small town im out of time
will you still love me when i shine
from words but not from beauty
my mothers glamour lives on and on
yet still inside i felt alone
for reasons unknown to me
but if you send for me you know ill come
and if you call for me you know ill run
ill run to you ill run to you
ill run run run
ill come to you ill come to you
ill come come come
oh oh oh oh oh
ah ah ah ah ah
and if you call ill run run run
if you change your mind ill come come come
oh oh oh oh oh
ah ah ah ah ah
