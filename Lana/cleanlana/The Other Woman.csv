the other woman has time to manicure her nails
the other woman is perfect where her rival fails
and shes never seen with pin curls in her hair anywhere
the other woman enchants her clothes with french perfume
the other woman keeps fresh cut flowers in each room
and there are never toys thats scattered everywhere
and when her old man comes to call
he finds her waitin like a lonesome queen
cause to be by her side
its such a change from old routine
but
the other woman will always cry herself to sleep
the other woman will never have his love to keep
and as the years go by the other woman will spend her life alone
alone
baby dodo
ah ah ah ah
ah ah
ooh
