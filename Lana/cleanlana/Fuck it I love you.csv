i like to see everything in neon
drink lime green stay up til dawn
maybe the way that im living is killing me
i like to light up the stage with a song
do shit to keep me turned on
but one day i woke up like
maybe ill do it differently
so i moved to california but its just a state of mind
it turns out everywhere you go you take yourself thats not a lie
wish that you would hold me or just say that you were mine
its killing me slowly
dream a little dream of me
make me into something sweet
turn the radio on dancing to a pop song
fuck it i love you
fuck it i love you
fuck it i love you
i really do
i used to shoot up my veins in neon
and shits even brighter youre gone
so many things i would say to you
i want you
you moved to california but its just a state of mind
and you know everyone adores you
you cant feel it and youre tired
baby wish that you would hold me or just say that you were mine
but its killing me slowly
dream a little dream of me
turn this into something sweet
turn the radio on dancing to a pop song
fuck it i love you
fuck it i love you
fuck it i love you
i really do
it turns out californias more than just a state of mind
i met you on the boulevard braids in my hair you blew my mind
and if i wasnt so fucked up i think id fuck you all the time its killing me slowly
fuck it i love you fuck it i love you fuck it i love you i really do california dreamin got my money on my mind jazz in my veins running out of time california dreamin got my money on my mind jazz in my veins running out of time california dreamin got my money on my mind jazz in my veins running out of time california dreamin got my money on my mind jazz in my veins running out of time
