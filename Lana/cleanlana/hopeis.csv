i was reading slim aarons and i got to thinking that i thought
maybe id get less stressed if i was tested less like
all of these debutantes
smiling for miles in pink dresses and high heels on white yachts
but im not baby im not
no im not that im not
ive been tearing around in my fucking nightgown sylvia plath
writing in blood on my walls
cause the ink in my pen dont work in my notepad
dont ask if im happy you know that im not
but at best i can say im not sad
cause hope is a dangerous thing for a woman like me to have
hope is a dangerous thing for a woman like me to have
i had year dances
church basement romances yeah ive cried
spilling my guts with the bowery bums
is the only love ive ever known
except for the stage which i also call home when im not
servin up god in a burnt coffee pot for the triad
hello its the most famous woman you know on the ipad
calling from beyond the grave i just wanna say hi dad
ive been tearing up town in my fucking white gown
like a goddamn near sociopath
shaking my ass is the only thing thats
got this black narcissist off my back
she couldnt care less and i never cared more
so theres no more to say about that
except hope is a dangerous thing for a woman like me to have
hope is a dangerous thing for a woman with my past
theres a new revolution a loud evolution that i saw
born of confusion and quiet collusion of which mostly ive known
a modern day woman with a weak constitution cause ive got
monsters still under my bed that i could never fight off
a gatekeeper carelessly dropping the keys on my nights off
ive been tearing around in my fucking nightgown sylvia plath
writing in blood on your walls
cause the ink in my pen dont look good in my pad
they write that im happy they know that im not
but at best you can see im not sad
but hope is a dangerous thing for a woman like me to have
hope is a dangerous thing for a woman like me to have
hope is a dangerous thing for a woman like me to have
but i have it
yeah i have it
yeah i have it
i have
