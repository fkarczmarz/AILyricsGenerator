wish i may wish i might
find my one true love tonight
do you think that he could be you
if i pray really tight
get into a fake bar fight
while im walking down the avenue
if i lay really quiet
i know that what i do isnt right
i cant stop what i love to do
so i murder love in the night
watching them fall one by one they fight
did you think youll love me too
baby im a sociopath
sweet serial killer
on the warpath
cause i love you just a little too much
i love you just a little too much you can see me drinking cherry coke
sweet serial killer
i left a love note
said you know i love the thrill of the rush
you know i love the thrill of the rush
you send me right to heaven
sweet serial killer
i guess ill see you never
do it for the thrill of the rush
love you just a little too much much
you send me right to heaven
sweet serial killer
i guess ill see you never
i love you just a little too much
love you just a little too much much
my black fires burning bright
maybe ill go out tonight
we can paint the town in blue
im so hot i ignite
dancing in the dark and i shine
like a light im luring you
sneak up on you really quiet
whisper am i what your heart desires
i can be your ingenue
keep you safe and inspired
baby let your fantasies unwind
we can do what you want to do
baby im a sociopath
sweet serial killer
on the warpath
cause i love you just a little too much
i love you just a little too much you can see me drinking cherry coke
sweet serial killer
i left a love note
said you know i love the thrill of the rush
you know i love the thrill of the rush you send me right to heaven
sweet serial killer
i guess ill see you never
do it for the thrill of it all
love you just a little too much much
you send me right to heaven
sweet serial killer
i guess ill see you never
i love you just a little too much
love you just a little too much much

wanna play you like a gameboy
i dont want one
lost the thrill of the same toy
lala lala la lala lala lie down down
just have fun
wanna play you like a gameboy
i dont want one
