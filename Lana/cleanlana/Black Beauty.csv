i paint my nails black
i dye my hair a darker shade of brown
cause you like your women spanish
dark strong and proud
i paint the sky black
you said if you could have your way
youd make a nighttime all today
so itd suit the mood of your soul
oh what can i do
nothing my sparrow blue
oh what can i do
life is beautiful but you dont have a clue
sun and ocean blue
their magnificence it dont make sense to you
black beauty ahah
black beauty ahah
i paint the house black
my wedding dress black leather too
you have no room for light
love is lost on you
i keep my lips red
to seem like cherries in the spring
darling you cant let everything
seem so dark blue
but oh what can i do
to turn you on or get through you
oh what can i do
life is beautiful but you dont have a clue
sun and ocean blue
their magnificence it dont make sense to you
black beauty ahah
black beauty ahah
black beauty ahah
black beauty ahah
black beauty ahah
black beauty baby
black beauty baby
oh what can i do
life is beautiful but you dont have a clue
sun and ocean blue
their magnificence it dont make sense to you
black beauty ahah
black beauty ahah
black beauty ahah
black beauty ahah
