blue is the color of the planet from the view above
long live our reign long live our love
green is the planet from the eyes of a turtle dove
til it runs red runs red with blood
we get so tired and we complain
bout how its hard to live
its more than just a video game
but were just beautiful people
with beautiful problems yeah
beautiful problems god knows weve got them
but we gotta try every day and night blue is the collar of the shirt of the man i love
hes hard at work hard to the touch
but warm is the body of the girl from the land he loves
my heart is soft my past is rough
but when i love him get a feeling
something close to like a sugar rush
it runs through me but is it wasted love but were just beautiful people
with beautiful problems yeah
beautiful problems god knows weve got them
but we gotta try every day and night oh oh
mmm mmm
yeah weve gotta try we gotta walk through fire because were just
beautiful people with beautiful problems beautiful problems god knows weve got them beautiful people with beautiful problems beautiful problems god knows weve got them
so beautiful
