stars in my eyes hiking up griffith
thinking about who was sad and what didnt
get said in the midwest wish i could tell you now
i wrote you a note but i didnt send it
cause thats the best method the women here taught me about
what you dont really understand
ive got magic in my hand stars in my eyes
im a different kind of woman
if you want some basic bitch go to the beverly center and find her
im sweet bare feet
if you wanna go where nobody goes
thats where youll find me
in the sweet north country
if im not there comе to my house on genesee
what you doin with your lifе do you think about it
do you contemplate where we came from
lately weve been makin out a lot
not talkin bout the stuff thats at the very heart of things
do you want children do you wanna marry me
do you wanna run marathons in long beach by the sea
ive got things to do like nothing at all
i wanna do them with you
do you wanna do them with me
if you want someone then just call me up
and remember where ill be
sweet in barefeet
you can find me where no one will be
in the woods somewhere in the night
in the heart of a valley
in the sweet north country
if im not there come to my house on genesee
