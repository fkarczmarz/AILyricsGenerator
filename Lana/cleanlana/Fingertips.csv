when i look back tracing fingertips over plastic bags
thinking i wish i could extrapolate some small intention
or maybe just get your attention for a minute or two
will i die or will i get to that tenyear mark
where i beat the extinction of telomeres
and if i do will you be there with me father sister brother
charlie stop smoking
caroline will you be with me
will the baby be alright
will i have one of mine
can i handle it even if i do
its said that my mind
is not fit or so they said to carry a child
i guess ill be fine
it wasnt my idea the cocktail of things that twists neurons inside
but without them id die
they say theres irony in the music its a tragedy i
see nothing greek in it
give me a mausoleum in rhode island with dad grandma grandpa and dave
who hung himself real high
in the national park sky its a shame and im crying right now
to get to you save you if i take my life
find your astral body put it into my arms
give you two seconds to cry
take you home i ill give you a blanket
your spirit can sit and watch tv by my side
cause baby i
ran through a time when i felt you were doing it
i couldnt handle it i was in monaco
i couldnt hear what they said on the telephone
i had to sing for the prince in two hours
sat in the shower
gave myself two seconds to cry
its a shame that we die
when i was fifteen naked nextdoor neighbors did a driveby
pulled me up by my waist long hair to the beach side
i wanted to go out like you swim with the fishes
that he caught on rhode island beaches
but sometimes its just not your time
caroline what kind of mother was she to say id end up in institutions
all i wanted to do was kiss aaron greene and sit by
the lake twisting lime into the drinks that they made
have a babe at sixteen in the town i was born in and die
aaron ended up dead and not me
what the fucks wrong in your head to send me away never to come back
exotic places and people dont take the place of being your child
i give myself two seconds to cry
let it crash over me
like the waves in the sea
call me aphrodite as they bow down to me
sunbather moon chaser queen of empathy
i give myself two seconds to breathe
and go back to being a serene queen
i just needed two seconds to be me
