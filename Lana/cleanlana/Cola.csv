my pussy tastes like pepsi cola
my eyes are wide like cherry pies
i gots a taste for men who are older

harveys in the sky with diamonds and hes making me crazy all he wants to do is party with his pretty baby
come on baby lets ride
we can escape to the great sunshine

we made it out to the other side
we made it out to the other side

i fall asleep in an american flag
i wear my diamonds on skid row
i pledge allegiance to my dad
for teaching me everything he knows
harveys in the sky with diamonds and hes making me crazy all he wants to do is party with his pretty baby
come on baby lets ride
we can escape to the great sunshine
i know your wife and she wouldnt mind
we made it out to the other side
we made it out to the other side
we made it out to the other side
drugs suck it up like vanilla icys
dont treat me rough treat me really niceys
decorate my neck diamantes ices

we can escape to the great sunshine
i know your wife and she wouldnt mind
we made it out to the other side
come on baby lets ride
we can escape to the great sunshine
we made it out to the other side
we made it out to the other side
come on come on come on baby
come on come on come on baby
