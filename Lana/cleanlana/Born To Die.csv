why who me why feet dont fail me now take me to the finish line
oh my heart it breaks every step that i take
but im hoping that the gates theyll tell me that youre mine
walking through the city streets is it by mistake or design
i feel so alone on a friday night
can you make it feel like home if i tell you youre mine
its like i told you honey dont make me sad dont make me cry
sometimes love is not enough
and the road gets tough i dont know why
keep makin me laugh lets go get high
the road is long we carry on
try to have fun in the meantime
come and take a walk on the wild side
let me kiss you hard in the pouring rain
you like your girls insane choose your last words this is the last time
cause you and i we were born to die
lost but now i am found
i can see that once i was blind
i was so confused as a little child
tried to take what i could get scared that i couldnt find
all the answers honey dont make me sad dont make me cry
sometimes love is not enough
and the road gets tough i dont know why
keep makin me laugh lets go get high
the road is long we carry on
try to have fun in the meantime
come and take a walk on the wild side
let me kiss you hard in the pouring rain
you like your girls insane choose your last words this is the last time
cause you and i we were born to die we were born to die we were born to die
come and take a walk on the wild side
let me kiss you hard in the pouring rain
you like your girls insane
so dont make me sad dont make me cry
sometimes love is not enough
and the road gets tough i dont know why
keep makin me laugh lets go get high
the road is long we carry on
try to have fun in the meantime
come and take a walk on the wild side
let me kiss you hard in the pouring rain
you like your girls insane choose your last words this is the last time
cause you and i we were born to die we were born to die
