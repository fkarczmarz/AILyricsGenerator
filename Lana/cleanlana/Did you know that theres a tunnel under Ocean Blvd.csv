did you know that theres a tunnel under ocean boulevard
mosaic ceilings painted tiles on the wall
i cant help but feel somewhat like my body marred my soul
handmade beauty sealed up by two manmade walls
and im like
whens it gonna be my turn
whens it gonna be my turn
open me up tell me you like it
fuck me to death love me until i love myself
theres a tunnel under ocean boulevard
therеs a tunnel under ocean boulеvard
theres a girl who sings hotel california
not because she loves the notes or sounds that sound like florida
its because shes in a world preserved only a few have found the door
its like camarillo only silver mirrors running down the corridor
oh man
whens it gonna be my turn
dont forget me
whens it gonna be my turn
open me up tell me you like me
fuck me to death love me until i love myself
theres a tunnel under ocean boulevard
dont forget me
theres a tunnel under ocean boulevard
harry nilsson has a song his voice breaks at something about the way he says dont forget me makes me feel like

lennon in my back whisperin in my ear
come on baby you can thrive
but i cant
