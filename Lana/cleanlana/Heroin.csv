topanga is hot tonight the city by the bay
has movie stars and liquor stores and soft decay
the rumblin from distant shores sends me to sleep
but the facts of life can sometimes make it hard to dream
life rocked me like mötley
grabbed me by the ribbons in my hair
life rocked me ultra softly
like the heavy metal that you wear
im flyin to the moon again dreamin about heroin
how it gave you everythin and took your life away
i put you on an aeroplane destined for a foreign land
i hoped that youd come back again and tell me everythings okay
ayy babe yeah
topangas hot today mansons in the air
and all my friends have gone cause they still feel him here
i wanna leave ill probably stay another year
its hard to leave when absolutely nothings clear
life rocked me like mötley
bad beginnin to my new year
life rocked me ultra softly
like the heavy metal that you hear
im flyin to the moon again dreamin about heroin
and how it gave you everythin then took your life away
i put you on the aeroplane destined for a foreign land
i thought that youd come back again to tell me everythings okay
babe babe yeah winter in the city
somethin bout this weather made these kids go crazy even for february
somethin bout this sun has made these kids get scary
oh writin in blood on my walls and shit
like ah oh my god
jumpin off from the walls into the docks and shit
