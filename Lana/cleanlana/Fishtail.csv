dont you dare say that youll braid my hair babe
if you dont really care
you wanted me sadder you wanted me sadder
fishtail whats the matter with that
skippin rope in the bayou bayou
slip softly in terrain
not that smart but ive got things to say
palm trees in black and white
i like to watch them sway
youre so funny i wish i could skinnydip inside your mind
lately ive been thinkin about how things used to be
swingin in a nightgown underneath the old oak tree
almost victorian with you you can talk to me
but lately i can see
you wanted me sadder you wanted me sadder
cant you see it
for me you are the one
and if im not the one for you dont just say it
i was on the stairs ella fitzgerald in the air
feelin hella rare
baby if you care
baby dont you dare say
youll braid my hair babe
dont you dare say that youll braid my hair babe
if you dont really care
you wanted me sadder
dancin there in the hot hot sun
i know that weve got problems
i plan to address them another day
palm trees in black and white
i see in technicolor
maybe ill take my glasses off so i stop painting red flags green
lately ive been sunnin in the la riverbed
wearin nothin but the summer bruises on my knees
i like how you talk how you speak how you look at me
but lately i can see
you wanted me sadder you wanted me sadder
you wanted me sadder
cant you see it
for me you are the one and if im not the one for you

i was on the stairs ella fitzgerald in the air
feelin hella rare
