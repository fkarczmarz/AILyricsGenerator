we both know
that its not fashionable to love me
but you dont go
cause truly theres nobody for you but me
we could cruise to the blues
wilshire boulevard if we choose
or whatever you wanna do
we make the rules
our honeymoon
our honeymoon
our honeymoon
say you want me too
say you want me too
dark blue
dark blue
we both know
the history of violence that surrounds you
but im not scared
theres nothing to lose now that ive found you
and we could cruise to the news
pico boulevard in your used
little bullet car if we choose
mr borntolose
our honeymoon
our honeymoon
our honeymoon
say you want me too
say you want me too
dark blue
dark blue
there are violets in your eyes
there are guns that blaze around you
there are roses in between my thighs
fire that surrounds you
its no wonder every man in town
had neither fought nor found you
everything you do is elusive too
even your honey dew
our honeymoon
our honeymoon
our honeymoon
