theres a certain point the body cant come back from
in one year weve learned the turn of the mouth
the depth that the chest cavity takes
chucky was there for three out of three
i was there for the third cause i couldnt be
there for the one who was closest to me
but i cant say i run when things get hard
its just that i dont trust myself with my heart
but ive had to let it break a little more
cause they say thats what its for
thats how the light shines in
thats how the light shines in
thats how the light gets in so everyone was there they were standin laughin
and im on the side with my tears streamin down
theres somethin about the clutch of the wrist
he thought mine was his to cough into his mouth
weve only got hours
and i just cant stop cryin cause all of the ways
when you see someone dyin
the sea of your days flash in front of you
and you think about who would be with you
and then theres donoghue
daddy i miss them
im in the mountains
im probably runnin away from the feelings i get
when i think all the things about them
daddy i miss them
im at the roadrunner café
im probably runnin away from the thoughts in the day
that have things to do with them but they say
thats how the light gets in
thats how the light gets in
thats how the light gets in
think by the third of march i was cracked open
finally the ground was cold they wouldnt open
brought by the sunlight of the spirit to pour into me
theres a name for it in japanese its kintsugi
they sang folk songs from the s
even the fourteenyearold knew froggie came acourtin
how do my blood relatives know all of these songs
i dont know anyone left who knows songs that i sing
thats how the light gets in
thats how the light gets in
but daddy i miss them
im at the roadrunner café
probably runnin away from the feelings today
in the snowcapped mountains of the desert
daddy i miss them
im in the mountains
probably runnin away ive been meaning to say
that theres nothing to do except know that this is
how the light gets in
by cracking the light gets in
its how the light gets in
thats how the light gets in
thats how the light gets in
then youre golden ahahah
ahahah ahah
just another folk song but anyway
i try so hard but thats okay
its how the light gets in
its how the light gets in
its how the light gets in
