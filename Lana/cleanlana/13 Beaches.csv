i dont belong in the world thats what it is
something separates me from other people
everywhere i turn theres something blocking my escape
it took thirteen beaches to find one empty
but finally its mine
with drippin peaches im cameraready
almost all the time
but i still get lonely and baby only then
do i let myself recline
can i let go and let your memory dance
in the ballroom of my mind
across the county line
it hurts to love you but i still love you
its just the way i feel
and id be lyin if i kept hidin
the fact that i cant deal
and that ive been dyin for somethin real
that ive been dyin for somethin real
it took thirteen beaches to find one empty
but finally im fine
past ventura and lenses plenty
in the white sunshine
but you still can find me if you ask nicely
underneath the pines
with the daisies feelin hazy
in the ballroom of my mind
across the county line
it hurts to love you but i still love you
its just the way i feel
and id be lyin if i kept hidin
the fact that i cant deal
and that ive been dyin for somethin real
that ive been dyin for somethin real
it hurts to love you but i still love you
its just the way i feel
and id be lyin if i kept hidin
the fact that i cant deal
the fact that i cant deal
