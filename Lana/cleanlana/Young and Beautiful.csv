ive seen the world done it all
had my cake now
diamonds brilliant and bel air now
hot summer nights midjuly
when you and i were forever wild
the crazy days city lights
the way youd play with me like a child
will you still love me when im no longer young and beautiful
will you still love me when i got nothing but my aching soul
i know you will i know you will i know that you will
will you still love me when im no longer beautiful
ive seen the world lit it up as my stage now
channeling angels in the new age now
hot summer days rock and roll
the way youd play for me at your show
and all the ways i got to know
your pretty face and electric soul
will you still love me when im no longer young and beautiful
will you still love me when i got nothing but my aching soul
i know you will i know you will i know that you will
will you still love me when im no longer beautiful
dear lord when i get to heaven
please let me bring my man
when he comes tell me that youll let him in
father tell me if you can
all that grace all that body
all that face makes me wanna party
hes my sun he makes me shine like diamonds
and will you still love me when im no longer young and beautiful
will you still love me when i got nothin but my aching soul
i know you will i know you will i know that you will
will you still love me when im no longer beautiful
will you still love me when im no longer beautiful
will you still love me when im not young and beautiful
