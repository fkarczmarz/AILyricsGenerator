if you dance ill dance
and if you dont ill dance anyway
give peace a chance
let the fear you have fall away
ive got my eye on you
ive got my eye on you
say yes to heaven
say yes to me
say yes to heaven
say yes to me
if you go ill stay
you come back ill be right here
like a barge at sea
in the storm i stay clear
cause ive got my mind on you
ive got my mind on you
say yes to heaven
say yes to me
say yes to heaven
say yes to me
if you dance ill dance
ill put my red dress on get it on
and if you fight ill fight
it doesnt matter now its all gone
ive got my mind on you
i got my mind on you
say yes to heaven
say yes to me
say yes to heaven
say yes to me
ive got my eye on you
ive got my eye on you mm
ive got my eye on you
ive got my eye on you
