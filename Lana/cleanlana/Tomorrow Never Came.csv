hey what you doin not a lot
shakin and movin at my local spot
baby dont ask me why dont ask me why
why why why why why why why
lay lady lay on that side of a paradise
in the tropic of cancer
cause if i had my way you would always stay
and id be your tiny dancer honey
i waited for you
in the spot you said to wait
in the city on the park bench
in the middle of the pourin rain
cause i adored you
i just wanted things to be the same
you said to meet me up there tomorrow
but tomorrow never came
tomorrow never came
hey what you thinkin penny for your thoughts
those lights are blinkin on that old jukebox
but dont ask me why just swallow some wine
wiwiwiwiwiwiwine
stay baby stay on the side of a paradise
in the tropic of cancer
cause if i had my way you would always stay
and youd be my tiny dancer baby
i waited for you
in the spot you said to wait
in the city on the park bench
in the middle of the pourin rain
cause i adored you
and i just wanted things to be the same
you said youd meet me up there tomorrow
but tomorrow never came
tomorrow never came
roses out in your country hoouse
we played guitar in your barn
and every day felt like sunday
and i i wish we had stayed home
and i could put on the radio to our favorite song
lennon and yoko we would play all day long
isnt life crazy i said
now that im singin with sean woah
i could keep waitin for you
in the spot wed always wait
in the city on the park bench
in the summer on the pourin rain

you said youd love me like no tomorrow
i guess tomorrow never came

tomorrow never came
oh no
tomorrow never came
