sometimes i wake up in the morning
to red blue and yellow skies
its so crazy i could drink it like tequila sunrise
put on that hotel california
dance around like im insane
i feel free when i see no one
and nobody knows my name
god knows i lived
god knows i died
god knows i begged
begged borrowed and cried
god knows i loved
god knows i lied
god knows i lost
god gave me life
and god knows i tried
god knows i tried
god knows i tried
god knows i tried
sometimes i wake up in the morning
to red blue and yellow lights
on monday they destroy me
but by friday im revived
put on that hotel california
wear my blinders in the rain
ive got nothing much to live for
ever since i found my fame
god knows i lived
god knows i died
god knows i loved
god knows i lied
god knows i begged
begged borrowed and cried
god knows i lost
god gave me life
and god knows i tried
god knows i tried
god knows i tried
god knows i tried
so let there be light
let there be light
light up my life
light up my life
let there be light
let there be light
light up my life
light up my life
and god knows i tried
god knows i tried
god knows i tried
god knows i tried
god knows i tried
god knows i tried
god knows i tried
god knows i tried
