look at you kids with your vintage music
comin through satellites while cruisin
youre part of the past but now youre the future
signals crossing can get confusin
its enough just to make you feel crazy crazy crazy
sometimes its enough just to make you feel crazy
you get ready you get all dressed up
to go nowhere in particular
back to work or the coffee shop
doesnt matter cause its enough
to be young and in loove
to be young and in loove
look at you kids you know youre the coolest
the world is yours and you cant refuse it
seen so much you could get the blues
but that dont mean that you should abuse it
though its enough just to make you go crazy crazy crazy
i know its enough just to make you go crazy crazy crazy
but you get ready you get all dressed up
to go nowhere in particular
back to work or the coffee shop
it dont matter because its enough
to be young and in loove
to be young and in loove
mmm mmm mmm
dont worry baby
mmm mmm mmm
dont worry baby
and its enough just to make me go crazy crazy crazy
its enough just to make me go crazy crazy crazy
i get ready i get all dressed up
to go nowhere in particular
it doesnt matter if im not enough
for the future or the things to come
cause im young and in loove
im young and in lo lololo love
mmm mmm mmm
dont worry baby
mmm mmm mmm
dont worry baby
mmm mmm mmm
dont worry baby
