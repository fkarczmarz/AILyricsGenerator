he used to call me dn
that stood for deadly nightshade
cause i was filled with poison
but blessed with beauty and rage
jim told me that he hit me and it felt like a kiss
jim brought me back reminded me of when we were kids
with his ultraviolence
ultraviolence

ultraviolence
i can hear sirens sirens
he hit me and it felt like a kiss
i can hear violins violins
give me all of that ultraviolence
he used to call me poison
like i was poison ivy
i could have died right there
cause he was right beside me
jim raised me up he hurt me but it felt like true love
jim taught me that loving him was never enough
with his ultraviolence
ultraviolence

ultraviolence
i can hear sirens sirens
he hit me and it felt like a kiss
i can hear violins violins
give me all of that ultraviolence
we could go back to new york
loving you was really hard
we could go back to woodstock
where they dont know who we are
heaven is on earth
i would do anything for you baby
blessed is this union
crying tears of gold like lemonade
i love you the first time i love you the last time
yo soy la princesa comprende mis white lines
cause im your jazz singer and youre my cult leader
i love you forever i love you forever
with his ultraviolence ultraviolence ultraviolence ultraviolence i can hear sirens sirens
he hit me and it felt like a kiss
i can hear violins violins
give me all of that ultraviolence
