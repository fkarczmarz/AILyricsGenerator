this is a simple song gonna write it for a friend
my shirt is inside out im messy with the pen
he met margaret on a rooftop she was wearin white
and he was like i might be in trouble
he had flashes of the good life he was like
should i jump off this building now or do it on the double
cause baby if your love is in trouble
baby if your love is in trouble
baby if your love is in trouble
when you know you know
when you know you know
it kinda makes me laugh
runnin down that path
when youre good as gold
cause when you know you know
word to all my friends
with their rеd flags their white knights
their black еyes and their blue lies
if youre askin yourself how do you know
then thats your answer the answer is no
you gotta run gotta run run run run like your heads on fire
run away like your head is on fire
cause baby if your love is in trouble
baby if your love is in trouble
baby if your love is in trouble
when you know you know
when you know you know
it kinda makes me laugh
runnin down that path
when youre good as gold
cause when you know you know
and when youre old youre old
like hollywood and me
the diamond on your ring
the soul that you bring to the table
the one that makes me sing
in a minor key
cause when you know you know
when you know you know
so if you dont know dont give up
cause you never know what the new day might bring
maybe tomorrow youll know
maybe tomorrow youll know
maybe tomorrow youll know
i mean join the party
by the way the party is december cause when you know you know
and when youre old youre old
like hollywood and me
that diamond on your ring
the soul that you bring to the table
the one that makes me sing
in a minor key
diamond on your ring
cause when you know you know
when you know you know
