understand this im not looking for true love tonight
if you wanna be my little baby
you can meet me in the pale moonlight
i been workin every day to and
serving coke and fries at the movie blue drivein
if you want me you know where to find me
i can be your one time baby
i can be your little dairy queen
i dont wanna care tonight i dont wanna fight
you dont have to give me anything
just put your sweet kiss kiss on my lips now baby
understand this i been likin you since i was small
i dont wanna get you runnin scared
when theres no pressure there at all
i been workin to every day
and think about you almost all the time all the time and
if i wanna see you i drive by
i can be your one time baby
i can be your little dairy queen
i dont wanna care tonight i dont wanna fight
you dont have to give me anything
just put your sweet kiss kiss on my lips now baby
