"But I'm really lit right now
A couple drinks in your head
Your calling me daddy instead
Mommy how that dress fit tight
Is it heaven between your thighs
She wanna know what's my name
Lil mama look you can call me
Baba
Baby you can call me Baba
Baby you can call me Baba
Baba
Baby you can call me Baba
Baby you can call me Baba
African so I can hit it proper
My stroke game good  check this
He buy you nice things girl that's reckless
I'd rather give ya my password to Netflix
Look
I know I'm a black boy  brown skin
White girl think I taste like chocolate
Badder then average
Shawty's a savage
Face from the heavens with a ass on Dallas
And her first name lavish
Material girl like Gucci and Prada
I used to rock Fubu and Dada
Two different types of people
But I know we equal
If you give me one chance I don't need a sequel
Singin'
Your body's like a temple to me
If feels like tetherball's in the sky
Soaring free from the worlds fallacies
One hit is all you need to fly

I was  down
But I'm really lit right now
A couple drinks in your head
Your calling me daddy instead
Mommy how that dress fit tight
Is it heaven between your thighs
She wanna know what's my name
Lil mama look you can call me
Baba
Baby you can call me Baba
Baby you can call me Baba
Baba
Baby you can call me Baba
Baby you can call me Baba
African so I can hit it proper
I reside in the 503  it's the west side nigga
I try to give you everything
Gold diggers we no wife'm we no give them wedding rings like
I wanna know you
You wanna know me
We busy as fuck so we in and we out
No time for us now
Material girl like Gucci and Prada
I used to rock Fubu and Dada
Two different types of people
But I know we equal
If you give me one chance I don't need a sequel
Singin'
Your body's like a temple to me
If feels like tetherball's in the sky
Soaring free from the worlds fallacies
One hit is all you need to fly
አንቺ ቆንጆ ነሽ ፣ ባባ ነኝ እንደምነሽ

Fuck a fortune teller  they can't tell me who I am
I'm a yellow mellow fellow and my cousin is the sun
I'm Aminé to my niggas and Animé to a punk (hey)
When I give her Jimmy  then my baby give me Neutron
Verses I be shoppin'  you can bet I got them deals (shit)
I could die tomorrow  so my future got some pressure
Pay tuition for my sis and cop my mom a Tesla
Old me is stuck in the new one
Red pill cause don't take the blue one
Wonderland doesn't seem too bad
I think I'm gonna wallow in tomorrow like yeah
Who knows what the future holds?
I don't  if the truth be told
They say play it safe  young soul
Fuck that  Imma take control
I was dead until I sought out (yeah)
Took my time (woo) and then I found out (true)
Got some tears  they made me ball out (woo)
Took my fears  and threw 'em all out (all out)

I don't care what people think  I'm perfect in my psyche
Life could change in a blink  don't know what the future holds
Old me is stuck in the new one
Red pill cause don't take the blue one
Wonderland doesn't seem too bad

All out  I'm goin' all out
If you try to stop me you can bet I'm goin' all out
Runnin' up the numbers 'cause I can and I want to
This your favorite song  you gon' sing it 'til it's past due
All out  I'm goin' all out
This your favorite song  you gon' sing it 'til I ball out
Bitch I'm in the clouds....
Runnin' in a trance  got you runnin'....
I don't know when I'm gonna die
My watch can't tell the time
Hopefully there's some hope in me
I won't trip if it's meant to be
I don't know when I'm gonna die

I'm fed up with the looks that we get in restaurants
I'm fed up with a world that I know I can't change
I'm fed up with your fam  you fed up with my fam
We try and tell 'em  but they try and tell us that we can't
I'm fed up with a world that I know I can't change
Now I'm fighting the ways in enlight'ing you
And your friends clench their purse
Lock their doors when I'm around
And we both know how that sounds
And your parents  your parents
They don't know about me
And I'm tired  so this ain't worth the risk

My cup ain't full  but it's got me empty
Only drink to mingle 'cause I'm single
Waiter  can you break this 20?
I'm not about the flashiness  I'm only about you and this
Drink that's in my hand  has got this plan
And has got me wasted  got me faded

It's funny how I always find myself in Dakota
Knocking on my conscious every morning like Jehovah
I'm afraid of heights but my feelings roller coaster
So I'ma chug  chug
I'd like to pay the tab if you let me make a statement
But then she tell me No the same way they did David
Cabernet for my fitness sake
My confidence a raisin but I wish it was a grape
Holes in my soul 'cause I feel like Zero
Patch me up quick with a stitch like Lilo
Red wine like my red coupe  white girls want the proof
Jay Rock to a Kate Moss  get out
Fingers on the edge of my glass  making it last
Thinking about a girl from Portland all in my past
Got groupies fanning out like Dakota
But I'd rather get shy on my sofa

Compassion ain't a man's best friend
But it's somewhere next to his pride
Illuminate the bullshit and give him some time
Gazing at the bottom of my glass
Searching for an answer to mistakes from my past
I ain't been to Saturn and I ain't been to Mars
I haven't met Elon but I have met a star
It's hard to relish how I really feel about you
I cry with my hands up high
Just so I can get by when I truly feel alone
I see the fire
In your eyes I wonder if this is real or if I'm underwater
It makes you want to see what we could have become
My face look like I don't wanna chat
I told that bitch I'm fresh ('Cause my drip too clean!)
I'm starin' at the window of this Buick (yuh!)
Hoes say I'm heroic but I told her I'm historic (hey!)
I'm out here with Topanga like I'm white and my name Cory
(Woo!) Scene! That's the end of the movie

Comes like my ex girl and next girl
Used to rock the S curl  wanted me a Nextel
But my mama copped a Razr  that's why I couldn't blame her
Flippin' through my past like I used to flip the phone
They kickin' out the blacks and all the houses getting clones
Friends used to do pills and only eat at Du's Grill
The food was pretty good but the times was better (Hmm)
These are the only days I missed  like the first shawty I kissed
I used to have dreams  now I dream
I look around and I see nothing in my neighborhood
Not satisfied  don't think I'll ever wanna stay for good
And once I do  they'll finally see the inner me

Who knows who I am  who knows who I are
Most people pretty sketch like a night at Echo Park
That's why I just keep it cool but my time is in a leisure
Everytime I'm home I catch emotion like a seizure
I slip and slide through the times in my youth
What's age? Too young to worry  too old to dream
What's age? Imagination to me  tragedy to some
What's age? I guess we'll find out when we're older. Touché
