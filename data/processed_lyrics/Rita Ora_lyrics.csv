" location
 wanna belong in
 take me anywhere
 take me anywhere
 little less fun
 empty faces
 let me in
 I could take it
 wanna belong in
 take me anywhere
 little less fun
 anywhere
 we'll find the start of something new)
 take me anywhere (Anywhere)
 little less fun
Try to reinvent the wheel
Thinkin' I don't see them runnin' the game
Are they for real?
And I wonder if they ever will see
Why I keep on saying no
Maybe you can be enough to believe
There's something more
You're looking like a good time
You're looking like you're my type
Are we gonna play? Play?
I just can't wait any longer
Are we gonna play? Play?
We ain't gettin' any younger
Are we gonna play?
Cause all I wanna do is...

I don't wanna mess around with a scrub
Tell them they can hit the road
Need a lover with a bit of a thug
You're looking like a good time
You're looking like you're my type
Are we gonna play? Play?
I just can't wait any longer
Are we gonna play? Play?
We ain't gettin' any younger
Are we gonna play?
Cause all I wanna do is...
I feel like I'm doin' it good
Steer your hips like a car and go under the hood
So let's take this time to figure out what the hell time knows
I feel like you the one so I'ma prove that there
Are we gonna play? Play?
I just can't wait any longer
Are we gonna play? Play?
We ain't gettin' any younger
Are we gonna play?
And I don't want it to end  oh yeah
I met this man  I think about him all night
And my cheeks pull back to return that
Before I talk to you  I rehearse it
Come and lay your love on me
All I want  all that I want is your body
Since it's been so long  ever so long
Since I let a man hold me
And now I see  I ain't gon' leave
Baby  what you want from me?
All I want  all that I want is your body
Since it's been so long  ever so long
Since I let a man hold me
And now I see  I ain't gon' leave
Baby  what you want from me?

Before I talk to you  I rehearse it
Come and lay your love on me
All I want  all that I want is your body

And now I see  I ain't gon' leave

Baby  what you want from me?
All I want  yeah
All I want  yeah
All I want  yeah
All I need
Hold me longer
Yours forever
I put every other man on ice
Raise my price
You don't have to tell me twice
Don't wanna roll no dice
I want this man on my side
Right-hand grippin' on my thighs
Come here with those eyes
I fall to my knees
Ask and you shall receive
All I want  all that I want is your body
Since it's been so long  ever so long
Since I let a man hold me (Hold me  yeah)
And now I see  I ain't gon' leave
Baby  what you want from me?
All I want  yeah
All I want  yeah
All I want  yeah
All I need
Hold me longer
Yours forever
I wear them to hide my tears from you
And I'm tired of you asking why
My heart has been through hell and back
I'm only dressed and pretty in black
Middle finger when it comes to love
Act like I don't really give a fuck
I don't always say what I wanna say
I tattoo myself to show my pain
Lonely in a crowded space
Even though we're both face to face
'Cause I've been lying to you (You)
Hurry up and wait for the spotlight
Looks like another whiskey night
They only see what the camera shows
'Cause I've been lying to you (You)

Looking around wearing a smile
This ain't me

I don't mean to make you run away
 and a swingin' hot spot

City lights  blurry face
Been missing the feeling  the mistakes
Took a walk  fast pace
Shoes off  only four blocks to your place
Had to climb through the window 'cause you lost your key
Gettin' high with the lights low  had a few more drinks
And the next thing we know  your lips on me
Put it on so you can take it off of me
Cashmere  left it lying by your bed
It's the colour red  how could I forget?
Cashmere (Cashmere)  last night we made such a mess
I knew when I left  I'd see you again
So what if I did it on purpose?
So what? Yeah  I did it on purpose
Cashmere (Cashmere)  left it lying by your bed
I knew when I left  I'd see you again
Yeah  yeah  yeah

Cashmere (Cashmere)  last night we made such a mess
We're already past temptation
We've already crossed that line
I've never felt more alive
Love's a risky bid

A lot of battles left me battered and bruised
There were a lot of times I stumbled and crashed
So many times when I was so convinced that
To rise above it all
I'm grateful for the storm
Made me appreciate the sun
I'm grateful for the wrong ones
Made me appreciate the right ones
I'm grateful for the pain
For everything that made me break
I'm thankful for all my scars
'Cause they only made my heart
Grateful
The weight of all the pain was weighing me down
Pulled it together and I pulled myself out
'Cause they got me here

(But am I good enough to)
Be the everything that he could want?
He told me that he loved me more than most
Been lookin' for a non-material love
Like I ain't made a mess here often enough
Will no one ever show me how to be lonely?
End up on my own almost every night
I must be the only
Feeling like losing you'll show me how to be lonely

Tongue-tied forever
I was better at this when I was seventeen
I will be makin' the move the way you're lookin' at me
Now we're writin' a song on your bedroom floor
I don't wanna be your friend  I wanna wake up in your bed
I'm losin' just a little more sleep and a bit of self confidеnce
'Cause if I let out the truth  I can never take it back
I don't wanna be your friend  I wanna wake up in your bed
I'd write it out a million times  but then I get scared to send
'Cause if I let out the truth  I can't take it back

I don't know what you did
But you did something to me
All of my doubts have disappeared
I'd had enough  I'd given up
Watched all my friends get married
Lonely under the chandelier
Always kept up my guard
Wasn't ready for love
Just a beat in my heart with no use
On the bench  watching out
But it's clear to me now
All this time  I was waiting for you
For you  ooh
For you  ooh  ooh
Now you're here by my side  look at you smilin' at me
Sun in the sky don't shine so bright (Shine so bright)
Finally  I believe in all these love stories
They will come find you when it's time

Tryna figure out how they would work for me
I just wanna dance with somebody
Somebody who loved me
Now I see you standing in our garden lights
That I finally found that somebody
To stand by me
I will ride for you
Spare my life for you
If you asked me to
Now I'm dancin' in your arms to Eternal Flame
There's a lifetime in those eyes
Now we're singin' all the words to Sweet Caroline
Until I found you and I
Always thought that the one thing waitin' for me
But you went and rewrote our whole story
To an everlasting love

I'm outside your house again  freezing in the cold
Waiting for the moment I learn to let go
I've been messed up a thousand times with tears in my eyes
To tell myself it's alright
'Cause I'm terrified
You only love me when
The whiskey's pouring
Four in the morning
You only love  you only love
You only love me when the
Night is over
No one to hold ya
You only love  you only love

With my dress and my lipstick on
You should see it on me
It's such a shame
But I know about the girl you called
The one from the park with the pink heels on
I won't sit back if you want my love
You act like my love is not enough
Don't make me erase you from my phone
'Cause I can always go out alone
Who said you were the first and last?
They say a love can lead you blind
Got my hands in the air
Gonna fill my tank and go
Me and all my girls gonna run around town
We can do whatever we want
London to New York City
