lyrics
"We're one in the river and one again after the fall
'Cause we are the ones that wanna play
And we are the ones that wanna choose
Aerials in the sky
Life is a waterfall
We drink from the river then we turn around and put up our walls
'Cause we are the ones that wanna play
And we are the ones that wanna choose
Aerials in the sky

I've been walking through your streets
Where all your money's earning
Where all your buildings crying and clueless neckties working
(Oh  oh-oh-oh)
Revolving fake lawn houses  housing all your fears
Desensitized by TV
(Oh  oh-oh-oh)
Overbearing advertising  god of consumerism
And all your crooked pictures looking good
(Oh  oh-oh-oh)
Mirrorism  filtering information for the public eye
Designed for profiteering your neighbor  what a guy
Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom!
Every time you drop the bomb
You kill the God your child has born
Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom!
(Oh  oh-oh-oh)
Modern globalization  coupled with condemnations
Unnecessary death
(Oh  oh-oh-oh)
Matador corporations
Puppeting your frustrations with the blinded flag
Manufacturing consent is the name of the game
(Oh  oh-oh-oh)
The bottom line is money  nobody gives a fuck
4000 hungry children leave us per hour from starvation
(Oh  oh-oh-oh)
While billions are spent on bombs  creating death showers

Will soon proclaim itself a god
