lyrics
"Something separates me from other people
Everywhere I turn  there's something blocking my escape
It took thirteen beaches to find one empty
But finally  it's mine
With drippin' peaches  I'm camera-ready
Almost all the time
Do I let myself recline
Can I let go  and let your memory dance
In the ballroom of my mind?
Across the county line
It hurts to love you  but I still love you
It's just the way I feel
And I'd be lyin' if I kept hidin'
The fact that I can't deal
And that I've been dyin' for somethin' real
That I've been dyin' for somethin' real

It took thirteen beaches to find one empty
But finally  I'm fine
Past Ventura and lenses plenty
In the white sunshine
But you still can find me  if you ask nicely
Underneath the pines
With the daisies  feelin' hazy
In the ballroom of my mind
Across the county line
It hurts to love you  but I still love you
It's just the way I feel
And I'd be lyin' if I kept hidin'
The fact that I can't deal
And that I've been dyin' for somethin' real
That I've been dyin' for somethin' real
It hurts to love you  but I still love you
It's just the way I feel
And I'd be lyin' if I kept hidin'
The fact that I can't deal
 long time
 look at me
 the shape of my body
 Come into my bedroom
 we fuck on the hotel floor
 called up another
 I'm divisive
 maybe I'm just like this
 he comes over again
 this is the experience of bein' an American whore
 look at my hair
 I already fucked up my story
 so many other things you can't believe
 look how you hold me
 I'm invisible
 look how you hold me now
 okay)
 this is the experience of bein' an American whore
 this is the experience of bein' an American whore
 you can be my light
 you can be my light (Mm)
 you can be my light
Walked into the room  you know you made my eyes burn
It was like James Dean for sure
You're so fresh to death and sick as ca-cancer
You were sorta punk rock  I grew up on hip-hop
But you fit me better than my favorite sweater
And I know that love is mean (Oh-oh) and love hurts (Oh-oh)
I will love you 'til the end of time
I would wait a million years
Promise you'll remember that you're mine
Baby  can you see through the tears?
Love you more than those bitches before
Say you'll remember (Oh  baby)
Say you'll remember (Oh  baby)
Ooh  I will love you 'til the end of time
Big dreams  gangsta
Said you had to leave to start your life over
We don't need no money  we could make it all work
But he headed out on Sunday  said he'd come home Monday
I stayed up waiting  anticipatin' and pacing
But he was chasin' (Oh-oh) paper (Oh-oh)
Caught up in the game  that was the last I heard

Ooh  I will love you 'til the end of time
'Cause I'm a ride or die whether you fail or fly
But when you walked out that door  a piece of me died
Told you I wanted more  that's not what I had in mind
I just want it like before  we were dancin' all night
Then they took you away  stole you out of my life
You just need to remember
I will love you 'til the end of time
I would wait a million years
Promise you'll remember that you're mine
Baby  can you see through the tears?
Love you more than those bitches before
Say you'll remember (Oh  baby)

Who? Me? (Louder)
Why? (Got that?)
I feel so alone on a Friday night
Can you make it feel like home if I tell you you're mine?
Try to have fun in the meantime
Come and take a walk on the wild side
Let me kiss you hard in the pouring rain

Caroline  will you be with me?
Will the baby be alright?

Can I handle it even if I do?
It's said that my mind
I guess I'll be fine
It wasn't my idea  the cocktail of things that twists neurons inside
But without them  I'd die
See nothing Greek in it
Who hung himself real high

I wanted to go out like you  swim with the fishes
That he caught on Rhode Island beaches
Caroline  what kind of mother was she to say I'd end up in institutions?
All I wanted to do was kiss Aaron Greene and sit by
The lake  twisting lime into the drinks that they made
Have a babe at sixteen in the town I was born in  and die
Aaron ended up dead and not me
What the fuck's wrong in your head to send me away  never to come back?
Exotic places and people don't take the place of being your child

Let it crash over me
Like the waves in the sea

Out of the black (Out of the black) into the blue (Into the blue)

Of the Crowley way of bein'
That comes from energies combined

Not through love  but through revenge
Through the fire  we're born again

Haven't seen you 'round here lately
You just crack another beer
And pretend that you're still here

Cuts on his face 'cause he fought too hard

And the men I met along the road were my only summer
At night I fell asleep with visions of myself dancing and laughing and crying with them
Three years down the line of being on an endless world tour and my memories of them were the only things that sustained me
And my only real happy times
I was a singer
Not a very popular one
I once had dreams of becoming a beautiful poet
But upon an unfortunate series of events saw those dreams dashed and divided like a million stars in the night sky
But I didn’t really mind because I knew that it takes getting everything you ever wanted and then losing it to know what true freedom is
They have no idea what its like to seek safety in other people
For home to be wherever you lie your head
I was always an unusual girl
My mother told me that I had a chameleon soul
No moral compass pointing due north
No fixed personality
Just an inner indecisiveness that was as wide and as wavering as the ocean
And if I said I didn’t plan for it to turn out this way I’d be lying
Because I was born to be the other woman
Who belonged to no one
Who belonged to everyone
Who had nothing
Who wanted everything
With a fire for every experience and an obsession for freedom that terrified me to the point that I couldn’t even talk about it
And pushed me to a nomadic point of madness that both dazzled and dizzied me

Every night I used to pray that I’d find my people
And finally I did
On the open road
Except to make our lives into a work of art
Live fast
Die young
Be wild
And have fun
I believe in the country America used to be
I believe in the person I want to become
I believe in the freedom of the open road
And my motto is the same as ever
I believe in the kindness of strangers
And when I'm at war with myself
I ride
I just ride
Who are you?
Are you in touch with all of your darkest fantasies?
Have you created a life for yourself where you can experience them?
I have
I am fucking crazy
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh  ooh-ooh-ooh

He's my sun  he makes me shine like diamonds
And will you still love me when I'm no longer young and beautiful?
Will you still love me when I got nothin' but my aching soul?
Will you still love me when I'm no longer beautiful?
Will you still love me when I'm no longer beautiful?
Maybe I'd get less stressed if I was tested less like
All of these debutantes
Smiling for miles in pink dresses and high heels on white yachts
I've been tearing around in my fucking nightgown
24/7 Sylvia Plath
Writing in blood on my walls
'Cause the ink in my pen don't work in my notepad
'Cause hope is a dangerous thing for a woman like me to have
Hope is a dangerous thing for a woman like me to have
I had 15-year dances
Spilling my guts with the Bowery Bums
Is the only love I've ever known
Servin' up God in a burnt coffee pot for the triad
See Lana Del Rey LiveGet tickets as low as $200You might also like
I've been tearing up town in my fucking white gown
Like a goddamn near sociopath
Shaking my ass is the only thing that's
Got this black narcissist off my back
So there's no more to say about that
Except hope is a dangerous thing for a woman like me to have
Hope is a dangerous thing for a woman with my past
Born of confusion and quiet collusion of which mostly I've known
Monsters still under my bed that I could never fight off
A gatekeeper carelessly dropping the keys on my nights off
I've been tearing around in my fucking nightgown
24/7 Sylvia Plath
Writing in blood on your walls
'Cause the ink in my pen don't look good in my pad
But hope is a dangerous thing for a woman like me to have
Hope is a dangerous thing for a woman like me to have
Hope is a dangerous thing for a woman like me to have
But I have it"
