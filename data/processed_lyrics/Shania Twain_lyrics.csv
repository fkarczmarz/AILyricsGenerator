lyrics
"Mind if I sit down?
Can I buy you a round?
Haven't seen your face before
Are you new in town?
It's the same old line
Oh every time
Are you here alone?
Can I take you home?
Now every woman sees
With every pretty please
There's a pair of lying eyes
And a set of keys
He says  come be a star (Ooh)
In the back seat of my car
Oh  but baby  slow down
You're going way too far
Let me make it clear
To you  my dear  yeah

You're not in it for love
I'm outta here!
Babe  I can change your world
Make you a cover girl
Yeah  you could be a beauty queen in a magazine
Now tell me  what's your sign? (Ooh)
Why always the same old line?
I'll be in number 409
If you change your mind
Let me make it clear
To you  my dear

Heaven looked me in the eye
Exhaled and said goodbye
I'm flying
I'm flying
Always knew I had to go
Find the me I did not know
Who I'd be when I got old
Just how far the wind would blow
I'm sailing

All in all this much is true
Cause love and hate and they both burn
All in all there's nothing new
Things I always thought were strange
Aren't that strange at all
All in all

Any man of mine better be proud of me
And I can be late for a date—that's fine
But he'd better be on time
Any man of mine'll say it fits just right
When last year's dress is just a little too tight
And anything I do or say better be okay
When I have a bad hair day
And if I change my mind
A million times
I wanna hear him say
Any man of mine better walk the line
I need a man who knows how the story goes
Any man of mine

You gotta shimmy shake
Make the earth quake
'Til your boots wanna break
'Til your feet and your back ache
Keep it movin' 'til you just can't take anymore
Come on everybody on the floor
I know this well
But I finally found love
Without losing myself
I'm so much happier sharing my life
All of the good things and bad things alike
I'm not afraid of the truth
I'm not me without you
I know that I'm better when we're together
The most beautiful sound I ever heard
Is you breathing at night
When you're asleep and don't know I can hear
Sounds like an angel whispering in my ear
I don't know what I would do
If it wasn't for you

I know that I'm better when we're together
I put on my favorite song to remind you
Just remember who you got
I'll remind you that's who you are
You always take the blame and you know I'd do the same
You always take the blame and you know I'd do the same for you
We've both made the same mistakes
Wakin' up in the wrong places wasted
Remember we've still got the shirts
That we probably should've burned in Vegas (Let's go out to Vegas)
I bet they hate us at that casino bar
But it made us who we are

I don't appreciate it

Headed out west to Arizona

How to treat a woman right
If you're looking for a place in her heart
It ain't gonna happen overnight
First you gotta learn to listen
To understand her deepest thoughts
She needs to know you can be friends
Before she'll give you all she's got
If you start from the heart
You'll see love is gonna play it's part
If you wanna get to know her (Know her)

Hope life's been good to you
Since you've been gone

It's not so bad — I'm not that sad
I'm not surprised just how well I survived
I'm over the worst  and I feel so alive
I can't complain — I'm free again
And it only hurts when I'm breathing
My heart only breaks when it's beating
My dreams only die when I'm dreaming
So  I hold my breath — to forget
Don't think I'm lyin' 'round  cryin' at night
There's no need to worry  I'm really alright

Tomorrow  you may still be out of reach
But someday  you and I will be possible
We'll be alone  making love on the beach
By then we won't remember what it was like
Before you and I fell in love
We were at a knot together in this life
Hard to imagine the way it was
You are the light of my life
My little piece of the pie
American beauty  apple of my eye
You are the light of my life
I've heard people say that if they could
Do it all over again  they never would
It's better to have loved someone and lost
Than to have never loved at all
I am not afraid to give my heart
Even though it don't know I exist

Life was goin' great
Love was gonna have to wait
Was in no hurry
Had no worries

Didn't need a steady man

And I gol' darn gone and done it

Guess I fell in love (Gone and done it)
Must've been the way he walked (Gone and done it)

I want a heartbreak Harley
A full of steam dream machine
Or just a little late night sexy long stretch limousine
You win my love
You win my soul
You win my heart
You win my love
You make my motor run
You win my love
You win my love
You win my love
I said you win my love
You win my love
I said you win my love
And the first time you touched me  I felt love
And after all this time
You're still the one I love
Mmm  yeah
Looks like we made it
Look how far we've come  my baby
We mighta took the long way
We knew we'd get there someday
They said  I bet they'll never make it
But just look at us holdin' on
We're still together  still goin' strong
(You're still the one) You're still the one I run to
The one that I belong to
You're still the one I want for life
(You're still the one) You're still the one that I love
The only one I dream of
You're still the one I kiss goodnight

Ain't nothin' better
We beat the odds together
I'm glad we didn't listen
Look at what we would be missin'
They said  I bet they'll never make it
But just look at us holdin' on
We're still together  still goin' strong
(You're still the one) You're still the one I run to
The one that I belong to
You're still the one I want for life
(You're still the one) You're still the one that I love
The only one I dream of
You're still the one I kiss goodnight
You're still the one
Yeah
(You're still the one) You're still the one I run to
The one that I belong to
(You're still the one) You're still the one that I love
The only one I dream of
You're still the one I kiss goodnight
I'm so glad we made it
Somehow you got me to believe
In everything that I could be
You've got a way it seems
You gave me faith to find my dreams
You'll never know just what that means
Can't you see?
You've got a way with me
It's in the way you want me
It's in the way you hold me
The way you show me just what love's made of
It's in the way we make love
You've got a way with words
You get me smiling even when it hurts
There's no way to measure what your love is worth
I can't believe the way you get through to me
It's in the way you want me
It's in the way you hold me
The way you show me just what love's made of
It's in the way we make love

Like no one before you
I love you just the way you are
It's in the way you want me
The way you show me just what love's made of
It's in the way we make love"
