"It's a kind of magic
A kind of magic
One golden glance of what should be
(It's a kind of magic)
One shaft of light that shows the way
No mortal man can win this day
(It's a kind of magic)
The bell that rings inside your mind
Is challenging the doors of time
(It's a kind of magic)
The waiting seems eternity
The day will dawn of sanity
Is this a kind of magic?
(It's a kind of magic)
There can be only one
This rage that lasts a thousand years
Will soon be done
You might also like
This flame that burns inside of me
I'm hearing secret harmonies
(It's a kind of magic)
The bell that rings inside your mind
Is challenging the doors of time
(It's a kind of magic)
(It's a kind of magic)
This rage that lasts a thousand years
Will soon be done!
This is (this is) a kind (a kind)
Of magic (yeah)
There can be only one
This rage that lasts a thousand years
Will soon be done (done!)
It's a kind of magic
Ha-ha!
Woo-hoo!
A babe without a name
So much ado about nothing
Is what she'd try to say
So many games we played
Through every fleeted summer
Through every precious day
All the dreams we had
And I wonder why I still live on
And alone I'm spared
My sweeter half instead
All dead and gone
All dead
At the rainbow's end
And still I hear her own sweet song
Take me back again
You know my little friend's
All dead and gone

Her ways are always with me
I wander all the while
I am old but still a child
But I should not grieve
But in hope I breathe
You're dead and gone
Steve walks warily down the street
With the brim pulled way down low
Ain't no sound but the sound of his feet
Machine guns ready to go
Are you ready? Hey  are you ready for this?
Are you hanging on the edge of your seat?
Out of the doorway the bullets rip
To the sound of the beat  yeah
Another one bites the dust
Another one bites the dust
And another one gone  and another one gone
Another one bites the dust  yeah
Hey  I'm gonna get you too
Another one bites the dust
How do you think I'm going to get along
Without you  when you're gone
You took me for everything that I had
And kicked me out on my own
Are you happy  are you satisfied?
How long can you stand the heat?
Out of the doorway the bullets rip
To the sound of the beat
Look out

There are plenty of ways you can hurt a man
And bring him to the ground
And leave him when he's down  yeah
But I'm ready  yes I'm ready for you
I'm standing on my own two feet
Out of the doorway the bullets rip
Repeating the sound of the beat
Oh yeah
Another one bites the dust

And another one gone  and another one gone
Another one bites the dust  yeah

 life had just begun
 carry on as if nothing really matters
 my time has come
 body's aching all the time
 ooh (Any way the wind blows)
 nobody loves me
 we will not let you go
 we will not let you go
 just gotta get right outta here
 anyone can see
Met his little Jenny on a public holiday
A happy pair they made  so decorously laid
'Neath the gay illuminations all along the promenade
It's so good to know there's still a little magic in the air
I'll weave my spell
Nothing e'er need come between us
Oh no  I must away to my Mum in disarray
If my mother should discover
How I spent my holiday
It would be of small avail to talk of magic in the air
I'll say farewell
Oh  Rock of Ages
Do not crumble  love is breathing still
A little people magic if you will

Hanging out and stealing all the limelight
Messing with the beat of my heart

You break the law and you breach
Screw my brain till it hurts
You've taken all my money and you want more
Misguided old mule
With your pigheaded rules
With your narrow-minded cronies
Who are fools of the first division
Death on two legs
You're tearing me apart
Death on two legs
You never had a heart of your own
Big talking small fry
You're just an old barrow boy
Have you found a new toy to replace me?
Can you face me?
But now you can kiss my ass goodbye
Feel good? Are you satisfied?
Do you feel like suicide? (I think you should)
Is your conscience all right?
Does it plague you at night?
Do you feel good? (Feel good!)

Shark!
Death on two legs
Tearing me apart
Death on two legs
You never had a heart (You never did)
Of your own (Right from the start)

Should be made unemployed

Friends will be friends

It can happen to anyone
It's a chance you have to take with love
But now you say it's over
And I'm falling apart

To trust in one another
Right from the start
When you're in love
(Yeah!) It's a hard life

I'm a man of the world  they say that I'm strong
But my heart is heavy  and my hope is gone
Out in the city  in the cold world outside
I don't want pity  just a safe place to hide
Mama please  let me back inside
I don't want to make no waves  but you can give me all the love that I crave

They said we made a perfect pair
I clothed myself in your glory and your love
The years of care and loyalty
I love you 'til I die
I can't face this life alone
I'm naked and I'm far from home
The slate will soon be clean
I’ll erase the memories
To start again with somebody new
I hang my head and I advertise
A soul for sale or rent
I have no real intent

And lady preachers
I descend upon your earth
From the skies
I command your very souls
You unbelievers
Bring before me what is mine
The seven seas of Rhye
Can you hear me you peers
And privy counselors?
I stand before you naked to the eyes
I will destroy any man
Who dares abuse my trust
I swear that you'll be mine
The seven seas of Rhye

Be gone with you

Give out the good
Leave out the bad evil cries

And with a smile
I'll take you to the seven seas of Rhye
Oh I do like to be beside the seaside!
Oh I do like to be beside by the sea
Where the brass band plays: tiddely-om-pom-pom!
Oh I do like to be beside the seaside!
Oh I do like to be beside by the sea

Sammy  who do you think that you are?
You should've been sweepin' up the Emerald Bar
Spread your wings and fly away
Fly away  far away
Spread your little wings and fly away
Fly away  far away
Pull yourself together 'cause you know you should do better
That's because you're a free man
He spends his evenings alone in his hotel room
Keepin' his thoughts to himself
He'd be leaving soon
Wishin' he was miles and miles away
Nothin' in this world  nothin' would make him stay
Since he was small  had no luck at all
Nothin' came easy to him
Now it was time  he'd made up his mind
This could be my last chance
You've got no real ambition  you won't get very far
Sammy boy  don't you know who you are?
Why can't you be happy at the Emerald Bar?

Listen to the warning  the seer he said
Beware the storm that gathers here
Listen to the wise man!
I dreamed I saw  on a moonlit stair
Spreading his hand on the multitude there
A man who cried for a love gone stale
And ice cold hearts of charity bare
I watched as fear took the old man's gaze
Hopes of the young in troubled graves
I see no day  I heard him say
So grey is the face of every mortal
Oh-oh  people of the earth
Listen to the warning  the prophet he said
For soon the cold of night will fall
Summoned by your own hand
Oh-oh  children of the land
Quicken to the new life  take my hand
Ooh  fly and find the new green bough
Return like the white dove

The earth will shake  in two will break

For those who hear and mark my words
Listen to the good plan
Oh  oh

Things seemed so perfect  you know?
The sun was always shinin'  we just lived for fun
Sometimes it seems like lately  I just don't know

Those were the days of our lives
The bad things in life were so few
Those days are all gone now  but one thing is true
When I look and I find I still love you
You can't turn back the clock  you can't turn back the tide
Ain't that a shame?
Ooh  I'd like to go back one time on a roller coaster ride
When life was just a game
No use in sittin' and thinkin' on what you did
When you can lay back and enjoy it through your kids

Too much love will kill you every time

In the days when lands were few
Here the ship sailed out into the blue and sunny morn
Sweetest sight ever seen
And the night followed day  and the storytellers say
That the score brave souls inside
For many a lonely day
Sailed across the milky seas
Don't you hear my call?
Though you're many years away
Don't you hear me calling you?
Write your letters in the sand
For the day I take your hand
In the land that our grandchildren knew
In the year of '39
Came a ship in from the blue
The Volunteers came home that day  and they bring good news
Of a world so newly born
Though their hearts so heavily weight
For the Earth is old and grey

For so many years are gone
Though I'm older but a year
