135
I'm so done with thinking through all the things I could've been
All it takes is that one look at you and I run right back to you
You cross the line and it's time to say F you
What's the point in saying that when you know how I'll react?
When it don't work out for the better
I'll be fine
I'll be fine
You're the drug that I'm addicted to
Why wе fight? I don't know
We say what hurts the most
All these firing shots and making ground

When it don't work out for the better
I'll be fine
I'll be fine
You're the drug that I'm addicted to and I want you so bad
But I'll be fine
I said I'm fine
When it don't work out for the better (For the better)
When it all falls down (When it all falls down)
I'll be fine (I'll be fine)
You're the drug that I'm addicted to and I want you so bad
I wanna know
Am I losing my mind?
Never let me go
If this night is not forever
At least we are together
I know I'm not alone
I know I'm not alone
I know I'm not alone
I know I'm not alone
I know I'm not alone
I know I'm not alone
Unconscious mind
I'm wide awake
Wanna feel one last time
Take my pain away
If this night is not forever
At least we are together
I know I'm not alone

I know I'm not alone
Said I was doing dumb shit all the time
'Cause broken dreams won't pay your bills at all
I heard it was the wrong things I get right
I blame it on the monsters in my mind
With stories from outside these prison walls
'Cause even if we're hopeless
And we know that this will hurt
Tomorrow is just a word
And they can't control
Believers
We are believers
Believers
I said I wouldn't run but I'm terrified
Headed for the sun but I'm scared of heights
So you and me go falling through the dark
You told me be someone that I like
Instead of being someone in their eyes
Your battle scars make you look like a star

Left a little trail of exes
I'll be on a plane by breakfast
Au revoir  thanks a lot
Scratch another off of my checklist
One more time and not my necklace
Jealous judge me  I'm the bad sheep
Donne-toi  whatcha got?
Here tonight  gone by day
I live my life like a runaway
You can try  maybe wanna stay
Catch me if you can  I'm a runaway
I'm a runaway
I'm a runaway
Country boys with real good manners
Hustlers from Louisiana
All go crying to their mamas
When I leave  ç'est la vie

We're not in love
We share no stories
Just somethin' in your eyes
Don't be afraid
The shadows know me
Let's leave the world behind
Take me through the night
Fall into the dark side
We don't need the light
We'll live on the dark side
While we're still young and fearless
Let go of the light
Fall into the dark side
Fall into the dark side
Give in to the dark side

Let go of the light
I know you'll be the death of me
Feel like the morning after ecstasy
I am drowning in an endless sea
Hello  old friend
Here’s the misery that knows no end
So I'm doing everything I can
To make sure I never love again
I wish that I did not know
Where all broken lovers go
I wish that my heart was made of stone
Yeah  if I was bulletproof
I'd love you black and blue
If I was solid like a jewel
I’d give you all my love if I was unbreakable
You could shoot me with a gun of gold
If I was unbreakable

Bendin' like a tulip  blue-eyed and foolish
Never mind the bruises
Into the fire  breakin' through the wires

Never break the pattern
Diamonds don't shatter  beautiful and battered
Into the poison  cry you an ocean
Give you all I've got
If...
Goodbye  so long
I don’t know if this is right or wrong
Am I giving up where I belong?
’Cause every station's playing our song
Goodbye  my love
You are everything my dreams made up
You’ll be Prince and I'm the crying dove
If I only were unbreakable

Left untold
Beaten by a broken dream
Nothing like what it used to be (Used to be)
We've been chasing our demons down an empty road
Been watching our castle turning into dust
Escaping our shadows just to end up here
Once more
And we both know
This is not the world we had in mind
But we got time
We are stuck on answers we can't find
But we got time
And even though we might have lost tonight
The skyline reminds us of a different time
This is not the world we had in mind
But we got time
I can feel your longing heart

And add a sweeter harmony
A symphony we'll make
So sing for all the tears we cry
A song for when we say goodbye
Then every time we close our eyes

I got you stuck in my head
Did you think I would forget

Love is chemical
Hearts so flammable

Your eyes call out my namе

We're not made for war
Not unbreakable
We're just lost in the night
Love is chemical
Heart so flammable
Seen this show like a thousand times
It's a side effect
Loneliness without no reply
In my mind I just keep pretending
Dancing on the tables
City full of angels
Dreams of diamonds and gold
All the different faces
Ones I used to hate
I miss them now that they're gone
Oh my god did we go too far?
Did we waste it all
Like we're running out of roses
Plastic cups did we laugh enough?
Looking back on us
Now that everything is over
Oh my god did we go too far?
Did we waste it all
Like we're running out of roses
Plastic cups did we laugh enough?
Looking back on us
Now that everything is over

On a night like this
In the life I've lived
All the things I wanna do again
When the silence ends
Dancing on the tables
City full of angels
Dreams of diamonds and gold
All the different faces
Ones I used to hate
I miss them now that they're gone
Oh my god did we go too far?
Did we waste it all

Remind me how it feels to hear your voice
Your lips are movin'  I can't hear a thing
Livin' life as if we had a choice
Anywhere  anytime
I would do anything for you
Anything for you
Yesterday got away
Melodies stuck inside your head
A song in every breath
Sing me to sleep now
Sing me to sleep
Won't you sing me to sleep now?
Sing me to sleep
A song in every breath
Remember me now  time cannot erase
I can hear your whispers in my mind
I've become what you cannot embrace
Our memory will be my lullaby

Cause I got everything I need here in this heart
It might not be easy
Ooh what you believe in

Like you didn't bring my tempo up again (Tempo up again)
My head's in a spin
You send my body to a place it's never been
Baby  won't you let me
Keep you up all night  let the morning come closer
You send me so high now  the ceiling can't hold us
Listen to my heart  let the rhythm control ya
I'll be there when you need my love
Just follow the beat of my drum
Ooh  I can't pretend

Bound to your bed
Can you stay a while?
Keep me by your side
Feel my scattered heart
Fix me I said
We could lay here
Underneath the river
We could sleep here

We could go home

Nobody knows where we will go
Can we stay inside?
Lay here by the fire
Please dont let me go
Say it ain't so
Leave me in the night

Hello  hello  do you need me before I fade away?
Is this the place that I call home
To find what I've become?
Walk along the path unknown
We live  we love  we lie
Deep in the dark I don't need the light
There's a ghost inside me
It all belongs to the other side

We live  we love  we lie
Deep in the dark  I don't need the light

I feel so helpless inside
Just let me love you when your heart is tired
Packed your bags at midnight
They've been there for weeks
I don't know what came by me
Just roll up a cigarette
Just forget about this mess
Been waiting on the sidelines
From the sidelines
I see those tears in your eyes
And I feel so helpless inside
Just let me love you when your heart is tired
If your ghost pulls you apart
And it feels like you've lost who you are

'Cause this is where dreams are born
Million miles away
But it still feels like home
In the land of heroes
يلا كلنا نغني أمانينا
نعيش الحلم، نصدق معانينا
نغم يشبهنا ويردد أسامينا
Step into the unknown
'Cause this is where dreams are born
Million miles away
But it still feels like home"
