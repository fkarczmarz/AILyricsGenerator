"All my time is ours
All my reckless dreams and
All my restless hours
I'll be there
All my love is yours
All my time is ours
All my reckless dreams
All my restless hours
And all those setting suns
And all those rising moons
From the Eiffel Tower to those deep lagoons
I'll be there

All my love is yours
All my time is ours
All my reckless dreams
All my restless hours
It's been tipping down lately
That you don't need to worry about it
I'll be there
All my love is yours
All my time is ours
All my reckless dreams
All my restless hours
'Cause today's just scares him
Thinks of yesterday's blues
'Cause today's are just far too grim
And I see him down in the morning
Lying blind without no warning
Seen him running through the night
Through the fall lead his enemies inside
And I'm learning how to walk
Learning how to take my time
Lay his body six feet 'neath clay
And I see him burning to dust
Seen him falling through the shadows
Shed a tear and his cheek rusts
Seen him falling through the shadows

And I'm learning how to walk
Learning how to turn my back
Lay his body six feet 'neath clay
I'll walk and then I'll walk
He's as angry as the hills
Maybe that he may learn to walk
And maybe that he may learn to take his time
Maybe that I may learn to walk
She just turned twenty-one
If you're needing anyone
I could love you  I could be
Anything you want of me
And in the darkness of the night
Baby  let me be your light
I could love you  I could be
Anything you want of me
And in the darkness of the night
Baby  let me be your light
Be your light
Be your light (Yeah)
Well  I gave her love but it wasn't enough
So she called me up just to call it off
I can't afford to make that mistake this time
And if you're flying over the Serengeti
Tiger lily  don't forget me

Anyone for you
I could love you  I could be

Oh
 oh
 know
He gets along fine doing just how he please
And I believe that we first met
Around three years ago
Well it feels like a lifetime funny how fast it goes
And I remember how this one time
Well I stole his sister's car
And he didn't even mind no he jumped in for the ride
We'd got miles away from anywhere
When the panic soon kicked in
We'd got it back safe and sound no one asked us where we'd been
Ohh Oh Oh
Ohh Oh Oh
Let me tell you why his sister
Why she didn't second guess
And oh by God she knows she's worth it
Any boy would tell you so
Well a girl like that is worth her own weight in gold

And the music box kept singing on and the song I won't forget
Well 1 and 2 and and 3 and 4 walked past the man so fast
I found 50 of his currency and dropped it in his tin
He said when your adventure ends your next one will begin
When this adventure ends your next one will begin
You'll find a blind man in Amsterdam with a box around his neck
And the music box kept singing on and the song you won't forget
The song you won't forget
He won't tell her what is going on
He won't tell her what is going on
You may think that he's a demolition expert
When he's finished with your self-esteem
It may be true we all need knocking down a few
Break away
She don't like to disturb the peace
She's got diamonds to show for it
That tree of gold for it
She don't like to disturb the peace
You may think that he's a master of disguise
You lost your dignity you compromised

Gotta get herself away

So what a Christmas to have the blues
My baby's gone  I have no friends
To wish me greetings once again
Now I hear them singing 'Silent Night'
Christmas carols by candlelight

Come on home for Christmas  babe
Come on home for Christmas
Come on home for Christmas  babe
Come on home for Christmas
Now won't you tell me you're never wrong

These nights  we'll remember
Tumbling through heaven
Won't you love me a little?
Love me a little
No flights to Manila

Set up camp beneath the trees
In heavenly surroundings watching down
And my heart keeps beating
And I'm still dreaming of me and you
Me and you
Oh my heart keeps beating
And I'm still dreaming of you
Although you had to go
Although you had to go
My heart keeps beating
And I'm still dreaming of me and you
Me and you
Oh my heart keeps beating
And I'm still dreaming of you
And all those things we did
Still fill me up with butterflies
Whenever I remember your sweet smile

Wind up the music box and watch the city go
Always the same
Watch your neighbours on the pavements rock 'n' roll
Flicking through your inbox hundred miles an hour
If it's a new day
Why don't we invent a new world to explore?
Why don't we create a moment to remember in five years?

 lover
 I'll be there
 I'm in paradise whenever I'm with you
 I will hold you and I'll be there
 we'll be out whatever the weather
Heading to the wishing well  we've reached our last resort
I fear I'm on an island in an ocean full of change
Can't bring myself to dive in to an ocean full of change
Am I losing touch
Am I losing touch now?
If you're prone to overthinking and?
If you're prone to second-guessing and-
Hey  pretty smiling people
We're alright together  we're alright together
Hey  pretty shining people
Took it in turns to dream about the lottery
What we might have done if we had entered and had won
We're each convinced that nothing would have changed
But if this were the case  why is it a conversation anyway?
Are we losing touch?
Are we losing touch now?

Take me back to that midnight moon
Cradle me at that midnight moon
All of me is all for you
And what I've got to give is not enough
It's a dark night
All of me is all for you

Crying out  Christ you're bad
Smoke was rising  trains flew by

 I haven't spend a night
 searching for a home
 searching for a reason
 waiting for the sunrise
We're just window shopping
Won't you dance with me?
I'm gonna knock you down
Have you after hours
Too many sherbet dips  you'll get licked
If you carry on this way
Beautiful punchbag
I'm gonna lay you down
Just call me Mr. Brown
I'm not that kind of man in the day
Won't you hold me steady spectacular rival?
And I've had my medicine
Although you're not my friend
I love you 'till the end

I missed it deliberately

Underneath the debris
