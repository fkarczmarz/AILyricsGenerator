lyrics
"Do I hold you too tight?
Have you had enough?
Shake me off in the night
If I had a gun
If I had a knife
If I had your love
If I was your wife
If I go on my own
And I see you in my dreams
And I hope to again
I have silently schemed
If I had a gun
If I had a knife
If I was the one
I thought love was a game
One would win or would lose until
I found you
Until I found you  my dear
I thought love was a shame
So I threw it away
And then there was you
I thought I was right
But now it seems I was wrong
I just waited so long
And I feared love had gone
Another question's at my door
To believe in this again?
Can we believe?
Can we believe?
I walk down the street
With shadows at my feet
And words in my head
So much left unsaid
Do you know how we got here?
Do you know how we got here?
I drank to clear my throat
Enough to eat the words you wrote
I've said these words before
Are you a stranger?
Are you a stranger?
Never seemed to bother me
Now I find it hard to breathe
Everything that you wrote
Sticks inside and chokes my throat
Do I think way too much?
Are we running out of luck?

Can a nation built on blood
Find its way out of the mud?
Will the people at the top
Lose their way enough to stop?
Can we begin again?
Can we begin again?
Can we begin again?
In disguises no one knows
Hides the face  lies the snake
The sun in my disgrace
Boiling heat  summer stench
'Neath the black the sky looks dead
Call my name through the cream
And I'll hear you scream again
Black hole sun  won't you come
And wash away the rain?
Black hole sun  won't you come?
Won't you come? Won't you come?
Stuttering  cold and damp
Steal the warm wind tired friend
Times are gone for honest men
And sometimes far too long for snakes
In my shoes  a walking sleep
And my youth I pray to keep
Heaven send Hell away
No one sings like you anymore

 were you the one?

 I'd never keep
 I've never found
 yet peace surrounds

 leave it behind

You were going to bed
But I'm not done with the night
So I stayed up and read
But your words in my head
Got me mixed up so I turned out the light
And I don't know how to slow it down
My mind's racing from chasing pirates
Now an ambulance screams
While the silliest things
(Are) flopping around in my brain
And I try not to dream
Up impossible schemes
And I don't know how to slow it down
Oh my mind's racing from chasing pirates

And I don't know how to slow it down
Oh my mind's racing from chasing pirates
My mind's racing from chasing pirates
Yet you're afraid each thing I do
Is just some evil scheme
A memory from your lonesome past
Keeps us so far apart
Why can't I free your doubtful mind
And melt your cold cold heart?
Another love before my time
Made your heart sad and blue
And so my heart is paying now
For things I didn't do
That make the teardrops start
Why can't I free your doubtful mind
And melt your cold cold heart?
There was a time when I believed
That you belonged to me
But now I know your heart is shackled
To a memory
The more I learn to care for you
The more we drift apart
Why can't I free your doubtful mind
Come away with me
And I will write you a song
Come away with me on a bus
Come away where they can't tempt us
With their lies
And I want to walk with you
On a cloudy day
In fields where the yellow grass grows knee-high
So won't you try to come
Come away with me and we'll kiss
On a mountaintop
Come away with me
And I'll never stop loving you
And I want to wake up with the rain
Falling on a tin roof
While I'm safe there in your arms
So all I ask is for you
To come away with me in the night
Goes right through the sole
Of this old shoe
And the water on the ground
Ain't got no place else it's found
So it's only got one thing left to do
Just creep on in
Creep on in
And once it has begun
It won't stop until it's done
Sneakin' in
There's a silver moon
Came a little too soon
It shines brightly on my bed
And the shadows overhead
Won't let me sleep as long as it's there
Just creep on in
Creep on in
And once it has begun
It won't stop until it's done
Sneakin' in

Mama said to her
Your daddy's leaving home today
Think he's gone to stay
We packed up all the bags
And drove out to Anchorage
They got to Anchorage
She checked in to school
She wore white Chucks on her feet
She learned the golden rule
The punches came fast and hard
Lying on her back in the school yard
Well pretty soon she met a friend
She played guitar
Used to sit on the steps at school
And dream of being stars
They started a band
They played all night

Businessmen crowded around
They came to hear the golden sound
There they were on the Sunset Strip
Playing their songs for the highest bid

She's a pauper in a naked disguise
A millionaire through a businessman's eyes
Oh friend of mine
I don't know why I didn't come
I left you by the house of fun
I don't know why I didn't come
I don't know why I didn't come
When I saw the break of day
I wished that I could fly away
Instead of kneeling in the sand
Catching teardrops in my hand
My heart is drenched in wine
But you'll be on my mind forever
Out across the endless sea
I will die in ecstasy
But I'll be a bag of bones
Driving down the road alone
My heart is drenched in wine
But you'll be on my mind forever

Maybe I'll find it in the end

And you give me lots of lovin' and you eat meat
And that's how you became my only man of the hour
You never lie and you don't cheat
And you don't have any baggage tied to your four feet
And take you to the park at dawn?
Will you really be my only man of the hour?
I know you'll never bring me flowers
And though we'll never take a shower together
I know you'll never make me cry
And I like the way you let me lead you when we go outside and walk

Tell me your tale
Was your journey far too long?
All the voices that are spinnin' around me
Trying to tell me what to say
Can I fly right behind you
And you can take me away
And tell me that you'd like to see me too
'Cause my heart is full of no blood
And my cup is full of no love
Couldn't take another sip even if I wanted
It's not too late for love
My lungs are out of air
And yours are holding smoke
And it's been like that now for so long
And I've seen people try to change
And I know it isn't easy
But nothin' worth the time ever really is
It's not too late for love
For love
For love
And your mind just picked up on the sound
Now you know you're wrong
Because it drifts like smoke
And it's been there playing all along
Now you know
Now you know
The reeds and brass have been weaving
Leading into a single note
In this place
Where your arms unfold
Here at last you see your ancient face
Now you know
Now you know
The cadence rolls in broken
Plays it over and then goes
One flight down
There's a song on low
And it's been there playing all along
Now you know
If that's the only way for you to be with me
We'd be there together
Just like we used to be
Underneath the swirling skies for all to see
And I'm dreaming of a place
Where I could see your face
And I think my brush would take me there
But only...
If I were a painter
And could paint a memory
I'd climb inside the swirling skies to be
With you
Where the sycamores grow
And daffodils have their fun
Where the cares of the day
Seem to slowly fade away
In the glow of the evening sun
Peace when the day is done
If I go there real late
Let my mind meditate
On everything to be done
If I search deep inside
Let my conscience be my guide
Then the answers are sure to come
Don't have to worry none
When you find peace of mind
Leave your worries behind
Don't say that it can't be done
With a new point of view
Life's true meaning comes to you
And the freedom you seek is won
Peace is for everyone
Peace is for everyone
A little girl with nothing wrong
Is all alone
Eyes wide open
Always hoping for the sun
And she'll sing her song to anyone
That comes along
Fragile as a leaf in autumn
Just fallin' to the ground
Without a sound
Crooked little smile on her face
Tells a tale of grace
That's all her own
Fragile as a leaf in autumn
Just fallin' to the ground
Without a sound
Dancing to her favorite song
She's a little girl with nothing wrong
And she's all alone
A little girl with nothing wrong
And you'll never know how it makes me blue
Does it make you happy?
I'm holding on to the thing that's wrong
'Cause we don't belong
But you like my songs
And you make me happy
Does she make you happy?
You can throw away
Every word I say
I'm standing still on this hidden hill
And I'm looking around for the right way down
To your distant valley
Your flowers grow in the frozen snow
And I'd like to know if it's all a show
'Cause you sure look happy
Are you really happy?
You'll just throw away
Every word I say
You can throw away

To you
By the fire
The long day is over
The wind is gone
Asleep at dawn
The embers burn on
With no reprise
The sun will rise
Though I said I'd go before us
And show the way back home
Is there a light up ahead?
I can't hold on very long
But I always take the long way home
Money's just something you throw
Off the back of a train
I got a head full of lightning
And a hat full of rain
And I know that I said
I'd never do it again
But I always take the long way home
I put food on the table
And a roof overhead
But I'd trade it all tomorrow
For the highway instead
Love's the only thing I've ever known
I always take the long way home
More than the whole wide world
I'm your woman
You know you are my pearl
So let's go out past the party lights
Where we can finally be alone
Come with me
And we can take the long way home
Come with me
Together we can take the long way home
Come with me
Oh no
It's just the nearness of you
It isn't your sweet conversation
That brings this sensation
Oh no
It's just the nearness of you
When you're in my arms and I feel you so close to me
All my wildest dreams came true
I need no soft lights to enchant me
If you would only grant me the right
To hold you ever so tight
And to feel in the night
Moving through the dark
A million miles an hour with somewhere to be
So why does it seem like a picture
That's hangin' up on someone else's wall?
Lately I just haven't been myself at all
It's heavy on my mind
And I'm dreamin' again
Like I've always been
Way down low
I still know
That the prettiest thing I ever did see
Was dusty as the handle on the door
Rusty as a nail stuck in the old pine floor
It looks like home to me
Now I'm dreamin' again
Like I've always been
Way down low
Thinkin' of the prettiest thing
Dreamin'
But my ears won't stop ringin'
Long enough to hear those sweet words
What did you say?
End of the day
The hour hand has spun
But before the night is done
I just have to hear those sweet words
Spoken like a melody
All your love is a lost balloon
Rising up through the afternoon
Till it could fit on the head of a pin
'Cause the heavy moon was keepin' me awake
And all I know is I'm just glad to see you again
See my love like a lost balloon
Rising up through the afternoon
And then you appeared
What did you say?
I know what you were singing
But my ears won't stop ringing
Long enough to hear those sweet words
And your simple melody

Spoken like a melody
It's a tragedy
It's a tragedy
It's a tragedy
He was only 25
Had an open heart and tender mind
He sang through all the hymns he knew
He was searching for a higher sign
When his water was turned to wine
All the darkness became light
Babies and a patient wife
They just weren't enough to keep him high
So he gave them up
Just to fill his cup
Every sip would make him feel alive
No bones in his body were dry
It's a tragedy
It's a tragedy
It's a tragedy
It's a tragedy

Now he's finally coming around
He's got wrinkles and a crooked frown
He holds back tears thinking of the years
That the bottle had him all tied down
So he'd sit and have another round
Singing Hallelujah till he drowns
It's a tragedy
It's a tragedy
It's a tragedy
It's a tragedy
It's a tragedy
It's a tragedy
It's a tragedy
Like a lightbulb in a dark room
I'm just sitting here waiting for you
To come on home and turn me on
Like the desert waiting for the rain
Like a schoolkid waiting for the spring
I'm just sitting here waiting for you
To come on home and turn me on
Since you've been gone
But you're the only one who can turn me back on
My hi-fi is waiting for a new tune
My glass is waiting for some fresh ice cubes
I'm just sitting here waiting for you
To come on home and turn me on
I've hungered for your touch
And time goes by so slowly
And time can do so much
Are you still mine?
I need your love
I need your love
God speed your love to me
I need your love
I am waiting here
Waiting for you to come home
Sinking embers glow
Melting icy snow
I am waiting here
Waiting for you to come home
And I watch them burn
When will I ever learn?
You will return
And I watch them burn
When will I ever learn?
You will return
Now all the stars have gone
Faded into cracks of dawn
And I'm still waiting here
Waiting for you to come home
I'm waiting here
To me  you are the sea
Vast as you can be
The deepest shade of blue
When you're feelin' low
To whom else do you go?
See  I'd cry if you hurt
I'd give you my last shirt
Because I love you so
Now if my sky should fall
Would you even call?
I've opened up my heart
I never want to part
I'm givin' you the ball
When I look in your eyes
I can feel the butterflies
I will love you when you're blue
But tell me  darlin'  true
What am I to you?
If my sky should fall
Would you even call?
I've opened up my heart
I never wanna part
I'm givin' you the ball

I can feel the butterflies
Could you find a love in me?
Would you carve me in a tree?
Don't fill my heart with lies
I will love you when you're blue
But tell me  darlin'  true
In the summertime and the fall
In the spring when the house is dark
Doesn't bother me at all
The shadows start to move
There's a hurt in the wintertime
Makes it hard for you
There's a dream  a dream I had
That makes me sad on the road
That the sun keeps running from
Everyone I love
I'm leaning on you
Much that you can do
I'll make it through
In the wintertime  there's a kind of light
I only get from you

It's only light to you
But there's a thing called the wintertime
I can't make it through
I'm leaning on you
Much that you can do

In the wintertime  there's a kind of light"
