lyrics
"She got gold doorknobs where her eyes used to be
One turn and I learned what it really means to see
Bye-bye to the too good to be true kind of love
I've been sleepin' for 60 days and
Nobody better pinch me
She got jumper cable lips
She got sunset on her breath now
I inhaled just a little bit
Now I got no fear of death now
Bye-bye to the too good to be true kind of love
Ohh Ahh Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah
Bye-bye to the too good to be true kind of love
 love is something to believe in
 free is something to believe in
We don’t have to talk  let’s dance
For all the times you felt alone  dreaming better
I see better  better days
Too dumb to say goodbye
That's some cliché shit  make me wanna cry
Just know that every time I look in your eye
Try to remember  that you can’t forget
Down with history  up with your head
For sweet tomorrow  she never fell from grace
We might still know sorrow but we got better days
I seen better ways  some won’t believe
But I don’t need much more than faith
For all the times you felt alone
Too dumb to say goodbye
Now that’s some give up shit  make me wanna cry
Just know that every time I look in your eye

Try to remember  that you can’t forget
Down with history  up with your head
For sweet tomorrow  she never fell from grace
We might still know sorrow but we got better days
Better days
Mountains in reconstitutions embrace
Guns and steel
And the Germs of Love
Toe to toe
In the world of Mud
Guns and Steel
And the Germs of Love
Blow For Blow
For my aching heart
Spread your words on me
Waste me with a BANG
Guns and steel
And the Germs of Love
Toe to toe
In the world of Mud
Guns and Steel
And the Germs of Love
Blow For Blow

Chickens in love  bawk  bawk
Chickens in love  bawk  bawk
I've got a chicken  I've got a chicken in love
Chicken in a car  with a chick
They're running away  from the farm
 just lovesick
Running around  on and on and on and on
Chickens in love  bawk  bawk
Chickens in love  bawk  bawk
Chickens in love  bawk  bawk
I've got a chicken  I've got a chicken in love
Kiss her on her way  
To ride in a tunnel of love
To give that chicken

Head low don't show oceans in my eyes
As the waves clap goodbye to sorrow
Daddy's on the mountain yellin' at the bloody sky
Mama's in the mirror actin' out another life
Children in the schoolyard singin' 'everybody dies'
And I am on the corner with a sentimental eye
I am on the corner singin' sentimental lies
Hopped up on a gypsy train with tracks that you can hide
That way no storm could follow our tomorrows
But shackled to a suitcase full of automatic thunder
CLAP!
All hail to death's boy-wonder
JJ's in the kitchen talking bout the end of times
Mo's thowin' Kerouac to Catcher In the Rye
Tempermental yogis bakin' merryweather pie
And I am on the corner with a sentimental eye
I am on the corner singin' sentimental lies
Sometimes said it's suntime
Let it sunshine on my mind
You might also likeAll the same its conscience waiting
Cross the line
Last night I dreamed myself upon a golden glade
The clouds passed in and out of my reflection
And everyone I've known held my hands till they were clay
And the storm finally bled from my complexion
Now Jadey's on the mountain singing 'We will never die'
The band is in the rainbow playin' love for you and I
Heath is riding shotgun aimin' at the paper sky
And I am only 'I am' now I've opened up my eye
I am only 'I am' that I've opened up my eye
Sometimes said its suntime
Let it sunshine on my mind
Healing I need healing
A good feeling I can Shine
Feel it like you can see it
Like you can dream it in your mind
Sunny Hallelujah comin' to ya
Rain or shine
All the same its Conscience waiting
 tired of breathing dirt
 yeah I got to leave LA
 yeah I got to leave LA
 hold on
 hold on
 gonna raise a family there
 where I was born
 yeah I've got to leave LA
 hold on
 hold on
 of you
Let the octave belong to the next
And lifting us soundly back into the world
May we sing the Earth  Heaven's breath
But the son you have grown still resists
Through glory of this  Heaven's breath
Paradise has its hunter
Call me blind  call me fool
I don't mind chasing thunder
I say reaching for Heaven is what I'm on Earth to do
Dear believer  I've no cause to go on
Save for if you take my case
See  the world was good and heavy on my shoulders as a child
But I let it all go to my waist
Now comfort's rooting pigs for my blood
To stick in my mud a flag of white
Dear believer of fire and rebirth
May we shine the Earth  Heaven's light

Dear believer  come sing us a song
Like we sang upon younger days
When the world was good and heavy on our shoulders as a child
'Fore we let it all go to waste
Paradise has its hunter
Call me wise  call me fool
I don't mind chasing thunder
I say reaching for Heaven is what I'm on Earth to do
I say reaching for Heaven is what I'm on Earth to do
Now my mama keeps saying
Run to the desert
You will be all that you need to be
Run to the desert
You will see all that you need to see
I woke up to the shadow of a man standing over me
Here in the land of frozen hands
I came out here to kill you father like a Sergio Leone picture
Gee I hope you understand
And as the red soaked the sand – shhh
Run to the desert
You will see all that you need to see
Run to the desert
Interwoven waters in the universal womb
If you follow how the river finding her way to the sea
Know this every part of you is just another part of me
You in the light and dark
With the eyes to see it
Love
Go ahead
Love stand beside us!
Love is within each heart to guide us
And I thank the sun for shining that light
And lettin' love blaze like
Fire!
Water!
We're all still learning
The river forgives
All tides are turning
(You know) some say the river won't flow
They say it's gonna stay run dry
For every time it was dry
We'll all be sharing a river of love
And letting love blaze like fire
You might also likeLove like a river
The river it flows
However dark or long the night is

Is your reflection
It's true
We're one
We're all each other
Lay down your arms
Lay down your gun
Open your arms
Free your heart
And know one day I'll see you all
Farther down this river
Tonight out son will finally know the sound of love delivered
To its hidin' place beneath the winter snow
Everybody taking my hey!

Do you remember that day you fell out of my window?

Well  you fell out in the concrete and nearly broke your ass
And you were bleeding all over the place and I rushed you off to the hospital
Do you remember that?
Yes  I do.

Thin memories in love with you  my hoary fire
In love with you
Get the fuck out my sight
Cold eats the flesh of broken hearts
Tender the strike of tinder gods
Hot coals
Embers across a rayless sky
Still warm my soul  I often cry
Hot coals
Slag reveries in love with you
My hoary fire  in love with you
Stay the fuck in my heart
Hot coals to die  Cimmerian
Heavy the tongue of tinder ray
Shot by the road  a slow decay
Hot coals
Heady  the musk of cinder love
Ashes beneath her tender rug
Hot coals

And bow at the boots of our well-oiled thugs
If it were me
I would yell out I love you! to all I passed
I would disrobe and disco and rip off my mask
Minding our reflections at the bottom of the sea
What did you see?
I saw that you and I forever have been free
The light became too heavy and I fell into a dream
What did you dream?
I dreamed a wind that would sweep
Every castle made of sand
Out across the old far holy land
If this were free
We'd be free of the terror of the graves
And fear masquerading as the brave
The circus got too heavy so we fell into the zoo
What did you feel?
I felt the fear that every queer does in his head
What did you dream?
What did you see?
I saw that you and I forever have been free
 I feel the love
 I feel the love
 there's a heart a-breaking by the fire
 there's a flame that want to be the waterfall
 there's a fishy swimming by the lovers
 there's a tear that gonna be the inferno
 there's a heart breaking by the fire
 there's a heat to melt the cage around your soul
 I was holidaying as a vegan
 there's a price in heating by the fire
 there's a heat to melt the cage around your soul
 I feel the love
 I feel the love

Isn't this a perfect love?
If I could stop the world
From turning round and round and round and round
The world turn round
And all I see is
Eartha  homey
Soft and boney
Isn't it a simple love?
Sweet as honey
Strangely funny
How can other mad men meshed in chains
Conjure such an angel in my name?
Aren't you the freshness of a dream?
If only I could protect you from me
If only but i fear it will be my fault
If ever my dear you act adult
And round and round and round and round
The world turn round
And all I see is
Round and round and round and round and round
The world turn round and all I see
If only you could learn not of man rude
If only you could go on in the nude
If only but I fear it will be my fault
If ever my dear you act adult
And sad as though my dear but when I'm gone
And you have a child all of your own
With one guitar and two dancing feet
Only one desire that's left in me
I want the whole damn world
To come dance with me
Come set you free over heartache and shame
I wanna see our bodies burning like the old big sun
I wanna know what we've been learning and learning from
Everybody want safety (Safety love)
Everybody want comfort (Comfort love)
Everybody want certain (Certain love)
Everybody but me
I'm a man on fire walking down your street
With one guitar and two dancing feet
Only one desire that's left in me
I want the whole damn world
To come dance with me
Come set us free over panic and strange
I wanna see our bodies burning like the old big sun
I wanna know what we've been learning and learning from

Sunny day shootings
Breakfast beheadings
Lunchtime wartime
Armaggedon
God. tell me what to do
It's a perfect time for love
Never a punk smiled so wide
Never have teeth seen so much sky
And smash up my junk and iy screws up my eyes
And sings like a song 'fore you die
Mountaintop chokings
Afternoon rapists
Primetime wartime
I can't take it
Is it time for love?
Whatever colors you wear
Some rainbow day
We'll have the perfect time
It's a perfect time for love
Joy!
Joy!
Of man's repressed libido
Love!

Feel the love
Hear the love
See the love
Please!

Hear the angels singin'
Remember to remember! (turn around)

When it's kisses I'm on a rocket
I believe I'm going somewhere
She got a belly full of baby
I believe we're going somewhere
Somewhere along
I found her wandering
Lonely and wandering
So lovely and wandering
Now we've come together
And we're wandering home
Every day a hole in my pocket
Every night I'm alright
When it's kisses I'm on a rocket

Hear me flying on the freeway
Me and you and baby Ebert

I seek your help so that my song may become free
Two voices carry farther than me
Two voices carry farther than one
Together we can bridge a chorus to the dawn
Two voices carry far... all the days
