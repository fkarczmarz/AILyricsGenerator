lyrics
"Because you can really see what you're getting
Most beaches are— of chicks
And they’re— and they're— and they're— and they’re— and they're
And they're— and they're— and they're
I've been moving in backward directions
During astral projections
I plaster my ass on the wall for attention
I need faster connections
If I didn't care what my friends did
Ends with a sniff or a huff or injection
I can't handle rejection
Should I be kind or remind that I’m weak?
So I fall more behind every week
I’m the 'shine when the guys take a peek
I cry from my eyes to my feet
When I mutter in my sleep
You’re testin' the masters
So guess what the fact is? My ex is a bachelor
Someone hexed all the bottles (Someone hexed all the bottles)
Sigh
Better luck next time

Kinda hard to force what's natural
Maybe you don't want what you need most
Is it crazy I'm not scared to be alone?
Now I barely need ya
Do what you do best and be alone
Gotta tell him  Rest in peace
Bet you thought I'd die alone
It don't make sense to me
But I keep my head up high alone
You ain't even there for me
But now  you're scared to be alone
Too many drinks to think about you
I had too many thoughts to let you wander
Now you're an afterthought  I lost ya
And now you want me  babe
You want me  but it's bye
Givin' mе reasons to fly
Pack up my shit and be wise
Jump in thе ride
Hit up my dude on the side
Like  look what you threw to the side
You get the vibe
Either we fuck or we fight
But I got the feelin' you're right
I'm out my mind
Doesn't make sense when I cry
If we can't make up  'least we try

Baby  when you fought me at the door (Fought me at the door)
Is it crazy I'm not scared to be alone? (Yeah)
I ain't wanna share my dreams when it involves you
Not the man I need (Yeah)
Started feelin' like I failed my team
Missin' gigs for you  bet you never felt like me
Different levels to the game  that's fast
Spendin' bands last week while your ass act cheap (Yeah)
Lonely at the top while your ass miles deep
Got me thinkin' that you scared of yourself  not me
Impossible  from a Prius to gold carriages
Middle finger to you so you see what a whole karat is
I need a answer  a reader of more tarots
You couldn't tell that the both of us needed a whole therapist
I made you fam when I greeted your whole parents
But later  I realized they ain't teach you what no sharin' is
I know you hearin' this  I know you scared of it
But bein' lonely better than 'needs control ' cherish it
Baby  when you fought me at the door (Fought me at the door)
Is it crazy I'm not scared to be alone?
Now I barely need ya (I barely need ya)
Do what you do best and be alone
Gotta tell him  Rest in peace
Bet you thought I'd die alone
It don't make sense to me
But I keep my head up high alone
You ain't even there for me
But now  you're scared to be alone
Alone
This one doesn't bite  it doesn't get aggressive
Show you how to touch it  hold it like it's precious
It don't need your lovin'  it just needs attention
(Love me) It needs  it seeks affection
(So sweet) Hungry  it fiends attention
(Hungry) It needs  it seeks affection
(Baby) Hungry  it fiends (Yeah  yeah)
Look at me  look at me  you lookin'?
My taste good  but I just had to redirect my cookin'
I coulda been an opener  I redirect the bookin'
I readed all the comments sayin'  D  I'm really shooketh
D  you need to see a therapist  is you lookin'?
Yes  the one I got  they really are the best
Now I feel like I can see you bitches is depressed
I am not afraid to finally say shit with my chest
Lost a lil' weight  but I ain't never lost a tushy
Lookin' good  but now my bald head match my
Lookin' good  but now they all sayin' that I'm ugly
Boo-hoo  my nigga  I ain't sad you won't fuck me
I'm sad that you really thought your ass was above me
You're lucky 'cause I just paid your bill with a reply
I just made your money pile knee-high
I just made your stats peak  now you got a blue check
Now you can afford to go and reinstall a new wig
Now you can afford to not be lousy  go and do shit
Talk your shit about me  I can easily disprove it  it's stupid
You follow me  but you don't really care about the music

Look at me  look at me  I'm naked
Vulnerability earned me a lot of bacon
I put a thong all in my ass and taught you how to shake it
I paid all my respect to those who taught me how to make it
And now I reap the benefits with no confrontation
Y'all fall into beef  but that's another conversation
I'm sorry  but we all find it really entertainin'
'Cause we all wanna see them slip and fall right on their faces
And we all wanna be the one to see the devastation
Not be in it  but ain't the bad press good?
The disrespect's real  how this Patek look?
Pull out the checkbook  now why yo' neck crook?
I never learn to superstar from a textbook
Talkin' 'bout  She fallin' off  why she get booked?
Man  I been humble  I'm tired of all the deprecation
Just let me flex  bruh  just let me pop shit
Why she think she Nicki M? She think she hot shit
I got y'all head all in the dirt just like an ostrich

Glass houses  I don't really like to keep my stones there
Oh well  I'll buy another property for four mill'
