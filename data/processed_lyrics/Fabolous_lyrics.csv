"We're gathered down below as we say goodbye to 1989
Oh  can you ever hear 'em
They know when it hits the bottom it'll be 1990  goodbye to the 80's
Happy new year!
Baby work  go on bust it wide
It's that new money  let the drawers drop
I cut my bitch off when the ball drop
I just don't know why

Hatin' hoes ain't happy
And happy hoes ain't hatin'
Better check the situation
I could fix your situation
I cut them bitches off when the ball drop
Cut them niggas off when the ball drop
'Cause them real niggas ain't haters
And them hatin' niggas ain't real
And baby I could help your situation
No top  smokin' medication
This the new year resolution
We gotta be the winners cause the rest is losin'
I told em get money  that's the best solution
When you do  wear your rocket like you rest in Houston
When niggas stole my style  I ain't stress the boostin'
It's time to make more money  less excuses
My old bitch on death row  it's time for execution
My new bitch is bad ass  she the best since Boosie
And I just don't know why
12 o' clock then the call dropped
Cut them niggas off when the ball drop
Young boy  hard head in the soft top
'Cause when them shots ain't ringin'  you can't call shots (ba ba ba!)
Mix some white and brown on the corner strap
Might be the next Mike Brown where you rollin' at (ba ba ba!)
V with hundred on the Lincoln (bling)
Niggas scared to play it like jail or Richard Mellor (Mellor)
I hope I never Tom Heller  die (die)
Scramble like a dope fiend (dope mean)
Keep your head up like your nose bleedin (ahh!)
My right hand got 30 on his left arm (bling)
On that left lane nigga  what a bitch for? (haan)
And I just don't know why
Baby work  go on bust it wide
It's that new money  let the drawers drop
I cut my bitch off when the ball drop
I just don't know why
Hatin' hoes ain't happy
And happy hoes ain't hatin'
Better check the situation
I could fix your situation
I cut them bitches off when the ball drop
Cut them niggas off when the ball drop
'Cause them real niggas ain't haters
And them hatin' niggas ain't real
And baby I could help your situation
No top  smokin' medication
Cuttin' off hoes when the ball drop
Ridin' with my woes til' the casket drop
Quiet 'fore you suckas hear a pin drop
I'll buy this muh'fucker like the price drop
Shawty bag it up  let that ass drop
Mommy killin 'em  tat a tear drop
Bitch I'm on fire  need to stop drop
Nigga this the flow that got your artist dropped
Heard he was a rat  heard he dime dropped
Hit 'em in the head  watch the body drop
Dollars comin' down like rain drops
The debris of beauty flickers
In the sadness of a smile
It’s the perfection of your imperfection
Beauty's when you just got out the shower
Beauty's when you ready in a hour
Beauty’s when the strut compliments sass
You know ya booty look good with ya confident ass (shit)
You know it's beauty when the smile is her best curve
Wait until I'm looking then you throw it at me
Probably give your ex nightmares
Miss Brooklyn New York
I'll give you whatever to get to your heart
This Soul Tape shit
Put it down

Beauty is knowing nobody's real as you
Truly condolences for that pairs of shoes
When Im her jeans I'm still in tune with the inner being
Beauty is loyalty to the fullest
'Cause cupid made me a target for she had received a bullet
Before I pull out and sex is a weapon
But beauty don’t need a bullet
Beauty is the beauty that her mother gave her
The heart to tell you they see potential in how you do it
I pray you know your worth
You just gotta recognize it
Shoutout to the people who do
And I feel sorry for the people who don't
 woo  woo!

Baby girl  you know my situation
And sometimes I know you get impatient
But you don't put on a show to get ovations
Take it to court and go through litigations
And I respect you  gangsta
Treat you like a princess and put some on your neck to thank ya
She's my pinch hitter
When the startin' lineup ain't playin' right
I come off the bench wit' her
It might sound like I'm gassin' ya
But it take time to get from the backseat to the passenger
We been creepin' and sneakin' just to keep it from leakin'
We so deep in our freakin' that we don't sleep on the weekend
Wifey's a little bit uptight
Wonder why I keep coming home in the middle of the night
It'll be alright  if y'all bump heads  it'll be a fight (Mmm)
But I said it'll be alright  c'mon
I really wanna be wit' you (Be wit' you)
But I gotta be real wit' you (Real wit' you)
I can't leave you alone (No)

You ain't never step outta line or get outta pocket

To protect you  I'll get out and cock it
And you know the barrel of my gun is big enough to spit out a rocket (Oh)
You gon' play dumb if cops do come through
I gotta keep the top up if my drop do come through
But I know the boutiques and shops you run through
So I cop her one and cop you one too
You always get a daily page  weekly ring
Plus you ain't too shy to do them freaky things
I ain't gotta put a band on your finger
Or worry 'bout you tellin' the whole world I'm your man while I spring her
At first you was somethin' I denied
Somethin' I would slide just to do somethin' in the ride
But shorty  there's somethin' you provide
'Cause the entrée ain't as good (Mmm)
Without somethin' on the side  you know?

It's gon' be a clip tossed if I go back
With stains of your lip gloss on my throwback
She won't care if I'm a platinum rapper
If she catch me wit' a empty Magnum wrapper (Ooh  yeah)
You seen what happened with Mr. Bigg and R Kelly  uh
You know I care for you (Care for you)
Anytime this chick is there for you (There for you  yeah)

How they turn a top dog to an underdog
Like a hunnid missed calls in my number log
I talk to God 'fore I talk to people from them blogs
Gotta see through it when it's thick as London fog
Turn the dark to daylight
Bosses park where they like
Don't you let them trick you out your spot and put that guy on
Rather cut 'em off and let a bygone be a bygone
So I think I know just how it feel to be a Zion
You gon' have to make quotes and take notes
And some can't take smoke so they may choke

Reservations to eat and you’re my dinner guest
Shawty cleaned up nice  never been a mess
Could take a little pain  I see them tattoos in her flesh
But I ain’t try to hurt her  ‘cause i’ve always been the best
I’m making my shawty feel it till she feel it in her chest
Sex excellent  get a hundred when I test
I’m a fan of her talent  so i’ve always been impressed
Sex in the city on my black satin sheets
Wet as Hurricane Sandy on the Manhattan streets
Lit a few candles like my power hadn’t reached
Then I took you places that her last nigga hadn’t reached
Bitch so bad know her parents went through hell
Smart mouth when we argue  you would swear she went to Yale
I wanna touch her  not using my hands
Make her dance without using the bands
Know it's easy to get caught up in the moment
When you say it 'cause you mad then you take it all back
Then we fuck all night 'til things get right
Then we fuck all night 'til things get right

The club popping but she ain’t trying go there
Her friends know where she going every time she tell them “nowhere”
I’m the only one that get up in the vip
Slide her something just to come through  host money
At least niggas know you’re getting through the most money
Club my place  you wear what you wanna wear
But you’re overdressed if you’re wearing underwear
I turn up  couple js to burn up
Couple spots to hide out  now let that playlist right out
Where I live on sunday  her place monday
Her hand in my pants  call that Al Bundy
Bad bitch good girl around the christmas  though
Know it's easy to get caught up in the moment
When you say it 'cause you mad then you take it all back
Then we fuck all night 'til things get right

Pussy sweeter than some fresh fruit
She gushing and I drink the best juice
I’m drinking till nothing left to
And she playing with herself  too
I be thinking about her all day
She perform like it’s Broadway
Got the windows down  broad day
Just look at her  spectacular
Throw her on the stove  flip her like a spatula
Other niggas want her  but you see the niggas whack to her
Side bitch tripping ‘cause i’ll never get back to her
My bitch like bitches  but none of my bitches bad to her
She’s said Trigga  why I never seen her with a bad bitch?
Unless she’s meeting on these other bitches average
Hundred percent real while these bitches is plastic
Moroccan goddess  she walk like she need her ass kissed
Walk like she need her ass kissed
Diced pineapples  super fine at you
If she’s giving head  she’s throwing her mind at you
Never faking  why they hella friend?
Somethin' 'bout to alchemy  she don't ever disappoint
London on the balcony  we’re about to smoke another joint
Miami on the yacht  she pulling on my pistol saying how she love my cock
And she got a little sister  that’s what she ever with
Game like a nigga man  that’s all she ever speak
Montreal was our first time  swear pussy just like the first lines
Try to beg mine  my nigga out of bootie
Back on another leer
I leave niggas here  all in another year
All in another lane  all in another gear
All of you niggas lame  all of your niggas here
Listen up  bitch niggas bitching up
I guess you’re doing what you’re supposed to
Let a real nigga hold you
Know it's easy to get caught up in the moment
When you say it 'cause you mad then you take it all back
Then we fuck all night 'til things get right
See you can't just do it
Go ahead
You gotta do it well
Why don't you stop talking 'bout it and come do it then?
She say when she done with me I better go and change them
Still giving ol' boy nightmares
Last night was a movie and it was X-Rated
Tonight we make the sequel and call that shit Wetter

We go back to when we got that white from Bolivia
We was candy shopping before 50 and Olivia
That's when you would go uptown  'cause you had to re' there
Everybody broke back then  you had to repair
Drug dealing was cool back then  you had to beware
That was the 90's  y'all wouldn't get it  you had to be there
That's why I'm glad to be here  some of us never made it
It's hard to get off the ground  y'all think I just levitated
Y'all think it was all love and nobody ever hated
Y'all think 'cause I never state it  I never been devastated
All y'all see is sunshinin'  think I was never shaded
Ya' think these calendar models is all that I ever dated
Nigga  nothing was the same  HOT 97 played it
Every day they made it that I stayed with 57 plated
Can't trust nobody  the crib is heavy gated
You ask  why? I tell them even heaven's gated
You know why? 'Cause when you good the  devil hate it
And even if you heavy weighted people want you feather weighted
Attention I never payed it  me and this clever lady
She brains  do some thangs  then we lay together faded
And while I chill  loaded up a steel
Just wishin' a nigga would but knowin' a nigga will
But for real nigga good is how you feel
But soon as a nigga good is as soon as a nigga will
Still  I don't owe these niggas nothing  put that in a nigga will

On the streets at night when the freaks is out
Butterfly tat on her back that she tried to hide
Until her father found her secret out
Now he flipping out  he kicked her out

Years go by now I got her in my room
And I'm thinking of the best way to kick her out

She fell in love with a street nigga
Tattoo my name on her petite figure

She said I wanna hold you down  but we ain’t never gonna be right
'Cause you too caught up in the street life
But that’s the only life I know
She said them niggas that's around you  they ain't never gonna be right
‘Cause everybody wanna be right
Instead of focusing on their own  dough
But this the only life I know
But this the only life I know
There’s always money to be made  that you can’t deny
I always made mine  never one who can't decide
I’m only human so if I don’t eat I can’t survive
And mama said you’re not a man if you can’t provide
The sun must know a shortcut  it beats me home
I worked so hard to get here  now it keeps me going
By the time I get in what she made the eat be old
When I slide in bed she complain my feet be cold
Caught up in the street life just like my bitch said
And when a new nigga come they gonna stop thinking of me
Shawty watch the hustle movie she can never get
How they make so much money  but they never quit
I tell her quit for what? That’s the only life they know
She said I wanna hold you down  but we ain’t never gonna be right
'Cause you too caught up in the street life
But that’s the only life I know
She said them niggas that's around you  they ain't never gonna be right

Young or old  fat or skinny
Have a problem being true to theyself
They have a problem looking into the mirror
And looking directly into their own soul
That's the reason I am who I am today
Cause I can look directly in my face and find my soul
I’m old enough to know better  young enough to not give a fuck
Rather hold my head high and die than live and duck
If you’re cool being taken down and giving up
Your lifestyle’s a blow job  the way you’re living sucks!
I done felt pain  waited but no help came
Went through some crazy shit still kept myself sane
You ever been dying of thirst and smelt rain
Ever been told “go to hell” and felt flames
The water’s to your neck and only gets deeper
Its all down hill and it only gets steeper
Gotta get over it  be a hurdle leaper
It cost to be the boss  and it ain't get no cheaper
But there’s a man above that we all under bro
No bread truck but he work wonders though!
After you wake up  everything is wonderful
You can overcome anything you undergo
As an artist I’m just tryna paint the perfect picture
But see where tryna wait for somebody thats perfect gets you
That usually lead to nothing like virgin kisses
And I be tryna cut  surgeon bitches
Dreams of splurging riches  pretty but curvy missus
Chef to serve the dishes  driver to swerve the ditches
I’m just another kid on the curb with wishes
And the streets is tough  on the verge of viscious
So I sold weed and crack  merged the business
That white girl helped a nigga  Fergalicious
But getting money bring jealousy and verbal disses
So when you killing shit watch out for the murder witness
An old head told me let nothing disturb your business
Beef is only good when you in the burger business
So I chilled  but loaded up the steel
Like I wish a nigga would  but I know a nigga will
But for real you loaded up to kill
Cause soon as a nigga could the sooner a nigga will
And I don’t owe these niggas nothing

Seeing your family scrambling  that's sanity damaging
Gotta  make a move can't just stand and be mannequin

Remember I was down to die just to live it up
But life’s a bitch and that judge is quick to give her up
Sometimes you get caught by people lookin' from a far
That’s how it is when you out here takin' cookies from the jar

These the rainy days they say you should be savin' for
But when sun shines no one carries umbrellas
I’m here to beat the odds that was set against me
Wished the worst luck to anyone who bet against me

But I’m here now and I don’t plan to recede
Sometimes I think I lucked up at right time
It hurts to even think about it
And put that iron to your clothes like I’m taking wrinkles out it
So as you hear me dropping this rhyme
Know my opportunity could've been stopped at a dime
The life you choose come from lack of options sometimes
Someone who get money without dropping a dime
And transform to your leader in my optimus prime
But soon as a nigga good is as soon as a nigga will
And we don’t owe these niggas nothing

The saddest stories comes from those who once had the glory
Had the foreigns  diamond watches and the baddest shorties
No respect from the neglect  they call they daddy Corey
I'm from a different cloth  that ain't the pattern for me
It's levels to this shit  it's different categories (yea)
Can't be like them niggas out here looking fat and gaudy
They ain't never won no rings but be mad at Horry
Talking 'bout  ”man that nigga don't deserve that shit”
Like ”I was really in these streets  I used to serve that shit”
We started from the bottom  had to topsy-turn that shit
Get it while the gettings good after that preserve that shit
My ex texted me last night  but I curve that shit
Coulda end up hitting it  be too late to swerve that shit (ERR!)
That's a young mistake  Lord knows I made me some (word)
I love getting brain  that never made me dumb
All that did was made me cum  swear these hoes made me numb (yea)
Only feelings caught is bitch you been shoulda gave me some
I knew niggas who had some bread never gave me crumbs (feel me)
Drink the whole fucking juice and never saved me some (feel me)
I know how young niggas feel  I had to live through shit
See the world as constipated  nobody gon give you shit
I learned that niggas gon be niggas  yeah we shouldn't do it
But hoes gon be hoes  they just ain't admitting to it
Where I been? Getting to it  going through and getting through it
Running round killing shit and telling cops I didn't do it (Niicee)
That's why they call me ”Young OG”
And I'ma spit this dope shit until my tongue OD
I flew my shorty in from Cali and she brung OG
She got me chilling in my city but my lungs OT
And fuck them niggas online  reply why?
Broke niggas talking cause it's free WiFi

I hear you  you know the problem with you lil niggas?
You think you know everything about the damn world  and you don't know shit
Well I see you got yourself a lil business goin'
Well that's good  that's good when you make that paper
But when you makin' paper you gotta learn some rules to go with it
You gotta learn the difference between guns and butter
There are two types of niggas in this world: there are niggas with guns and niggas with butter
Now what are guns? The guns  that's the real estate
That is what it's all about - guns and butter baby!"
