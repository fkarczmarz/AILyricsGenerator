lyrics
"Touch me gently like a summer evening breeze
Take your time  make it slow
Make your fingers soft and light
Let your body be the velvet of the night
Touch my soul  you know how
I'm your music (I am your music and I am your song)
I'm your song (I am your music and I am your song)
Play me time and time again and make me strong
(Play me again 'cause you're making me strong)
Make me sing  make me sound
(You make me sing and you make me)
There's a shimmer in your eyes
Like the feeling of a thousand butterflies
You might also like
I'm your music (I am your music and I am your song)
I'm your song (I am your music and I am your song)
Play me time and time again and make me strong
(Play me again 'cause you're making me strong)
Make me sing  make me sound
(You make me sing and you make me)
Make me sing  make me sound
(You make me sing and you make me)
I keep thinking
Last night I was taking a walk along the river
And I saw him together with a young girl
And the look that he gave her made me shiver
Because he always used to look at me that way
And I thought maybe I should walk right up to her and say
He'll take your heart and you must pay the price
And one day you'll find out he wears a disguise
Don't look too deep into those angeleyes
Keep thinking about his angeleyes
I keep thinking
Sometimes when I'm lonely I sit and think about him
And it hurts to remember all the good times
When I thought I could never live without him
And I wonder does it have to be the same?

He'll take your heart and you must pay the price
And one day you'll find out he wears a disguise
Don't look too deep into his angeleyes
He took my heart and now I pay the price
And one day you'll find out he wears a disguise
Don't look too deep into those angeleyes
Keep thinking
Keep thinking about his angeleyes
I keep thinking
Keep thinking
Keep thinking about his angeleyes
I keep thinking
Tu dolor hoy te encadena
En tus ojos hay una sombra de gran pena
No quisiera verte así
Aunque quieras disimularlo
Si es que tan triste estás  ¿para qué quieres callarlo?
Chiquitita  dímelo tú
En mi hombro  aquí llorando
Cuenta conmigo ya  para así seguir andando
Tan segura te conocí
Y ahora tu ala quebrada
(Duele verte triste)
(Y duele verte llorar)
Déjamela arreglar  yo la quiero ver curada
Chiquitita  sabes muy bien
Que las penas vienen y van y desaparecen
Otra vez vas a bailar y serás feliz
Como flores que florecen
Chiquitita  no hay que llorar
Las estrellas brillan por ti allá en lo alto
Quiero verte sonreír para compartir
Tu alegría  Chiquitita
Otra vez quiero compartir
Tu alegría  Chiquitita

You're enchained by your own sorrow
In your eyes  there is no hope for tomorrow
How I hate to see you like this
There is no way you can deny it
Chiquitita  tell me the truth
I'm a shoulder you can cry on
Your best friend  I'm the one you must rely on
You were always sure of yourself
Now I see you broken and fettered
(How it hurts to see you cry)
(And how it hurts to see you sad)
I hope we can patch it up together
Chiquitita  you and I know
How the heartaches come and they go
And the scars they're leaving
You'll be dancing once again
And the pain will end
You will have no time for grieving
Chiquitita  you and I cry
But the sun is still in the sky
And shining above you
(Even though you cry)
(The sun is shining in the sky)
Let me hear you sing once more
(So let me hear you sing some more)
Like you did before
(The way you used to do before)
Sing a new song  Chiquitita
Try once more  like you did before
Sing a new song  Chiquitita

How the heartaches come and they go
And the scars they're leaving
(You and I  we know)
(How all the heartaches come and go)
You'll be dancing once again
(You’ll be dancing once again)
And the pain will end
(And all the pain you take will end)
You will have no time for grieving
Chiquitita  you and I cry
But the sun is still in the sky
And shining above you

Sing a new song  Chiquitita
Try once more  like you did before
Sing a new song  Chiquitita
Try once more  like you did before
Having the time of your life
Digging the dancing queen
Friday night and the lights are low
Looking out for a place to go
Where they play the right music  getting in the swing
You come to look for a king
Anybody could be that guy
Night is young and the music's high
With a bit of rock music  everything is fine
You're in the mood for a dance
And when you get the chance
You are the dancing queen
Young and sweet  only seventeen
Dancing queen
Feel the beat from the tambourine  oh yeah
You can dance  you can jive

So you're blue  but I can't take a chance on a chick like you
That's something I couldn't do
There's that look in your eyes
I can read in your face that your feelings are driving you wild
Well I can dance with you  honey
If you think it's funny
Does your mother know that you're out?
And I can chat with you  baby
Flirt a little  maybe
Does your mother know that you're out?
Take it easy  take it easy
Better slow down  girl
That's no way to go
Does your mother know?
Take it easy  take it easy
Try to cool it  girl
Take it nice and slow
Does your mother know?

Well I can dance with you  honey

Now it's quiet  so I guess they left the park
This wooden bench is getting harder by the hour
The sun is going down  it's getting dark
I realise I'm cold  the rain begins to pour
As I watch the windows on the second floor
The lights are on  it's time to go
It's time at last to let him know
I believe it would be fair to say
You look bewildered
And you wonder why I'm here today
And so you should  I would
When I left  I felt I'd had еnough
But in the shape and form I appear now
I havе learned to cope
And love and hope is why I am here now
I'm fired up  don't shut me down
I'm like a dream within a dream that's been decoded
I'm not the one you knew
I'm now and then combined
And I'm asking you to have an open mind (And I won't be the same)
I'm not the same this time around (Ooh)
I'm fired up  don't shut me down

Will you leave me standing in the hall
Or let me enter?
The apartment hasn't changed at all
I got to say I'm glad
Once these rooms were witness to our love
My tantrums and increasing frustration
But I go from mad
To not so bad in my transformation (So now)
I'm fired up  don't shut me down (Don't shut me down)
I'm like a dream within a dream that's been decoded
I am not the one you knew (I'm not the one you knew)
I'm now and then combined
And I'm asking you to have an open mind (And I won't be the same)
I'm not the same this time around (Ooh)
I'm fired up  don't shut me down
You asked me not to leave
Well  here I am again
And I love you still and so I won't pretend
I have learned to cope
Me recuerda tiempo atrás  estrellas y una noche allá
En la lumbre azul  Fernando
Tarareabas tu canción con ese suave guitarrear
Yo podía escuchar esos tambores con un sordo redoblar
Se acercaban más  Fernando
Y el momento que pasaba parecía eternidad
Y sentí temor  Fernando
Por la vida y juventud  nadie pensaba en morir
Y no siento hoy vergüenza al confesar que tuve ganas de llorar
No pensábamos jamás perder ni echar atrás
La vejez llegó  Fernando
Y con ella  una paz que hoy logramos disfrutar
Se durmió el tambor  Fernando
Pareciera que fue ayer que lo vivimos tú y yo
Y en tus ojos veo aún aquel orgullo que refleja tu valor

 my friend  Fernando
 all alone
 no one in sight
And the fireworks are through
Feeling lost and feeling blue
It's the end of the party
And the morning seems so grey
So unlike yesterday
Now's the time for us to say
May we all have a vision now and then
Of a world where every neighbour is a friend
If we don't we might as well lay down and die
You and I
Sometimes I see
How the brave new world arrives
And I see how it thrives
In the ashes of our lives
And he thinks he'll be okay
Never knowing he's astray
Keeps on going anyway

Seems to me now
That the dreams we had before
Than confetti on the floor
It's the end of a decade
In another ten years time
Who can say what we'll find
What lies waiting down the line
In the end of eighty-nine
May we all have a vision now and then
Of a world where every neighbour is a friend
If we don't we might as well lay down and die
The kind of girl who likes to follow a trend
She has a personal style
You hear her voice everywhere
Taking the chair
She's a leading lady
Pushing through unknown jungles every day
She's a girl with a taste for the world
(The world is like a playing-ground where she goes rushing)
Running the gauntlet in a whirl of lace
Her man is one I admire
He's so courageous but he's constantly tired
Each time when he speaks his mind
Exert that will of your own
When you're alone
Now we'd better hurry

Honey  honey  nearly kill me  aha  honey honey
I'd heard about you before
I wanted to know some more
And now I know what they mean  you're a love machine
Oh  you make me dizzy
Honey  honey  let me feel it  aha  honey honey
Honey  honey  don't conceal it  aha  honey honey
The way that you kiss goodnight
(The way that you kiss me goodnight)
The way that you hold me tight
(The way that you're holding me tight)
I feel like I wanna sing when you do your thing
I don't wanna hurt you  baby  I don't wanna see you cry
So stay on the ground  girl  you better not get too high
But I'm gonna stick to you  boy  you'll never get rid of me
There's no other place in this world where I rather would be
You look like a movie star
(You look like a movie star)
But I know just who you are

(I heard about you before)
I wanted to know some more
(I wanted to know you some more)
And now I know what they mean
You're a love machine
And she looks straight up at me
The reproach in her eyes is imagined
But the pain that I feel is real
She jumps down and her tail is swishing
Like a feather right under your nose
And then you wake up and you're bleary-eyed
You look frail as you stand before me
Then you curse and kick a chair
But she jerks every time you swear
I feel sick and my hands arе shakin'
This is how all our fights have begun
I say I love you and I know it's true
You're not the man you should have been
I let you down somehow (Not the one I could've been)
I'm not the woman I could have been (I can be that woman)
But I can be that woman now

You're confused when you turn to face me
Is it true or is she drunk?
But it's clear that I've hit my rock bottom
I'm aware of how far I've sunk

(Not the one I could've been)
You're not the man you should have been (I let you down)
I let you down somehow (Not the one I could've been)
I'm not the woman I could have been (I can be that woman)
 I do  I do

 I do  I do
 I do  I do

To help me cope with anything
If you see the wonder of a fairy tale
You can take the future  even if you fail
I believe in angels
Something good in everything I see
I believe in angels
When I know the time is right for me
I'll cross the stream
I have a dream
I have a dream  a fantasy
To help me through reality
And my destination makes it worth the while
Pushing through the darkness  still another mile
I believe in angels
Something good in everything I see
I believe in angels
When I know the time is right for me
I'll cross the stream

I'll cross the stream
I have a dream
I'll cross the stream
I see it now
There was a union
Of heart and mind
The likes of which are rare and oh-so hard to find
Do I have it in me?
I believe it is in there
For I know I hear a bittersweet song
In the memories we share
I still have faith in you
And I will say
I never really thought I'd feel this way
But I remind myself
Of who we are
How inconceivable it is to reach this far
Do I have it in me?
I believе it is in there
For I know I hear a bittеrsweet song
In the memories we share

New spirit has arrived
The joy and the sorrow

And it survived

I still have faith in you
It stands above the crazy things we did
It all comes down to love
Do I have it in me?

Passion and courage

And we still have it in us
We've only just arrived
(Do I have it in me?)
We stand on a summit
Humble and grateful
To have survived
I still have faith in you
It stands above the crazy things we did
It all comes down to love
Keeping me so busy all the day through
They're the things that keep me from thinking of you
And I lose my temper ten times a day
Still it's even worse when the night's on its way
Somehow I'd be doing alright if it wasn't for the nights
(If it wasn't for the nights I think that I could make it)
I'd have courage left to fight if it wasn't for the nights
(If it wasn't for the nights I think that I could take it)
How I fear the time when shadows start to fall
Sitting here alone and staring at the wall
Even I could see a light if it wasn't for the nights
(Even I could see a light I think that I could make it)
Somehow I'd be doing alright if it wasn't for the nights
(If it wasn't for the nights I think that I could take it)
No one to turn to  you know how it is
I was not prepared for something like this
Now I see them clearly  the things that I miss
I got my business to help me through the day
People I must write to  bills I must pay
But everything's so different when night's on its way

I thought I would no more
Manage to hit the ceiling
Still  strange as it seems to me
You brought it back to me
That old feeling
I  I don't know what you do
You make me think that you
Possibly could release me
I think you'll be able to
Make all my dreams come true
And you ease me
You thrill me  you delight me
You please me  you excite me
You're something I'd been pleading for
I love you  I adore you
I've laid my life before you
I'll have you want me more and more
And finally it seems my lonely days are through
I've been waiting for you

And finally it seems my lonely days are through
I've been waiting for you
Oh  I've been waiting for you
Just a funny feeling deep inside (Ah-ha-ha)
That you're out there waiting
You're not sure I'm alone
And you wonder if I'm occupied (Ah-ha-ha)
So you're hesitating
Just a notion
That you'll be walking up to me in a while
And you'll smile and say hello
And we'll be dancing through the night
Knowing everything from there on must be right
Just a notion
But somehow  I know I'm not wrong
There's something happening that I just can't explain
If I try  it's all in vain
Because it's just a notion  that's all
Just a feeling that you're watching me (Ah-ha-ha)
Every move I'm making
Am I reading your mind?
'Cause it's almost like you're touching me (Ah-ha-ha)

It is our destiny  there's nothing we can do
And tonight is very special  it's a night for me and you
Ah-ha-ha  ah-ha-ha
Ah-ha-ha
Ah-ha-ha
Ah-ha-ha
Ah-ha-ha (I  I think it's more than a notion)
(Even more than your dream is about to come true)
Ah-ha-ha

And I feel so bad
And he loves his dad
And I loved him  too

But it's over
Keep an eye on Dan
Promise me you can
He gets out of hand if you let him

And don't forget (And don't forget)
I'll be back on Sunday to get him

Certain that I'm out of sight  I pull over and turn off the car

Make an effort not to upset him
Just keep an eye on Dan (Keep an eye on Dan)

Now every woman I see is a potential threat
You've heard me saying that smoking was my only vice
But now it isn't true
Now everything is new
And all I've learned has overturned
I beg of you
Don't go wasting your emotion
Lay all your love on me
It was like shooting a sitting duck
I still don't know what you've done with me
A grown-up woman should never fall so easily
I feel a kind of fear
When I don't have you near

Don't go wasting your emotion
Lay all your love on me
Don't go sharing your devotion
Lay all your love on me
I've had a few little love affairs
They didn't last very long and they've been pretty scarce
I used to think that was sensible
It makes the truth even more incomprehensible
'Cause everything is new
And everything is you
And all I've learned has overturned
What can I do?
Don't go wasting your emotion
Lay all your love on me
Don't go sharing your devotion
Lay all your love on me
Don't go wasting your emotion
Lay all your love on me
Don't go sharing your devotion
Lay all your love on me
Don't go wasting your emotion
 that so little can achieve so much
 for packing
 for packing

So I made up my mind: it must come to an end
There's a fire within my soul
Just one look and I can hear a bell ring
Blue since the day we parted
I've been angry and sad about things that you do
I can't count all the times that I've told you we're through
I think you know that you won't be away too long
You know that I'm not that strong

And still  there never seems to be a single penny left for me
That's too bad
In my dreams  I have a plan
If I got me a wealthy man
I wouldn't have to work at all
I'd fool around and have a ball
Money  money  money
Must be funny
In the rich man's world
Money  money  money
Always sunny
In the rich man's world
A-ha  ah
All the things I could do
If I had a little money
It's a rich man's world
A man like that is hard to find  but I can't get him off my mind
Ain't it sad?
And if he happens to be free  I bet he wouldn't fancy me
That's too bad

So now we'll go separate ways
Never again we two
Like an image passing by
In the mirror of your eyes
I can see it all so clearly (See it all so clearly)
Answer me sincerely (Answer me sincerely)
Like reflections of your mind
Are the words you try to find
But I know I don't possess you
You are still my love and my life
Still my one and only
I've watched you look away
Sitting here close to you
Knowing that maybe tonight we're through

 I felt  robbing me of my rightful chances
 everything seemed so easy
 one of us had to go
 I want you to know
 one of us is lying
 one of us is only
 feeling stupid  feeling small
 stubborn and misconceiving
 one of us had to go
 one of us is lying
 one of us is only

 the Paris night
 philosophy
 yes
 that was the time
 a fear of slowly dying
 a football fan
I was waiting all alone
Baby by myself I sit and wait and wonder about you
It's a dark and dreary night
Seems like nothing's going right
Won't you tell me honey how can I go on here without you?
Yes I'm down and feeling blue
And I sit all alone impatiently
Won't you please understand the need in me
You were here and now you're gone
I just can't believe that I could be so badly mistaken
Was it me or was it you?
Won't you hear me cry and you will know that my heart is breaking

Please forgive and then forget
And I sit all alone impatiently
Won't you please understand the need in me
 but you have closed your mind
 it used to be so good
 how can I even try to go on?
 but something died I fear
 I wish I understood
 how can I even try to go on?
 how can I even try to go on?
 how can I even try to go on?
Waving goodbye with an absent-minded smile
I watch her go with a surge of that well-known sadness
And I have to sit down for a while
The feeling that I'm losing her forever
And without really entering her world
I'm glad whenever I can share her laughter
That funny little girl
Slipping through my fingers all the time
I try to capture every minute
The feeling in it
Slipping through my fingers all the time
Do I really see what's in her mind?
Each time I think I'm close to knowing
She keeps on growing
Slipping through my fingers all the time
Sleep in our eyes  her and me at the breakfast table
Barely awake  I let precious time go by
Then when she's gone  there's that odd melancholy feeling
And a sense of guilt I can't deny

Slipping through my fingers all the time
Do I really see what's in her mind?
Each time I think I'm close to knowing
She keeps on growing
Slipping through my fingers all the time
Sometimes I wish that I could freeze the picture
And save it from the funny tricks of time
Slipping through my fingers
Slipping through my fingers all the time
Schoolbag in hand  she leaves home in the early morning
But I won't feel blue
Like I always do
I was sick and tired of everything
When I called you last night from Glasgow
All I do is eat and sleep and sing
Wishing every show was the last show
(Wishing every show was the last show)
So imagine I was glad to hear you're coming
(Glad to hear you're coming)
Suddenly I feel all right
(And suddenly it's gonna be)
And it's gonna be so different
When I'm on the stage tonight
Shining like the sun (Sup-p-per Troup-p-per)
Feeling like a number one
But I won't feel blue (Sup-p-per Troup-p-per)
Like I always do (Sup-p-per Troup-p-per)

If I tell a joke  you've probably heard it before
But I have a talent  a wonderful thing
'Cause everyone listens when I start to sing
I'm so grateful and proud
All I want is to sing it out loud
So I say thank you for the music  the songs I'm singing
Thanks for all the joy they're bringing
Who can live without it? I ask in all honesty
What would life be?
Without a song or a dance  what are we?
So I say thank you for the music  for giving it to me
Mother says I was a dancer before I could walk
Mhm  she says I began to sing long before I could talk
And I've often wondered  how did it all start?
Who found out that nothing can capture a heart
Like a melody can?
So I say thank you for the music  the songs I'm singing
Thanks for all the joy they're bringing
Who can live without it? I ask in all honesty
What would life be?
Without a song or a dance  what are we?
So I say thank you for the music  for giving it to me

What if I ain't worth the while
Not the style you'd be looking for?
If I'm sweet tonight
Things look different in the morning light
I'm jealous and I'm proud
If you hurt my feelings I'll cry out loud
That's me
Are you sure you wanna hear more?
Would I be the one you seek
Mild and meek like the girl next door?
Don't you realise
I may be an angel in disguise
It's lonely to be free
That's me
I don't believe in fairy tales
Sweet nothings in my ear
But I do believe in sympathy

Like an eagle flying with a dove
I'll find it in the end
 left the station just when it was due
 the usual bunch
 a single episode of Dallas that I didn't see
Only a week since we started
It seems to me  for every time
I'm getting more open-hearted
I was an impossible case
No one ever could reach me
But I think I can see in your face
There's a lot you can teach me
So I wanna know
What's the name of the game?
Does it mean anything to you?
What's the name of the game?
Can you feel it the way I do?
I'm a bashful child beginning to grow

What I'm trying to conceal (Doo-doo  doo-doo)

The sound so ominously tearing through the silence
Numb and frozen
Among the things I love so dearly
Help me
The signal's sounding once again and someone tries the doorknob
None of my friends would be so stupidly impatient
And they don't dare to come here
Anymore now
But how I loved our secret meetings
We talked and talked in quiet voices
Smiling
Now I hear them moving
Muffled noises coming through the door I feel I'm
Cracking up
And I'm close to fainting
Cracking up
They must know by now I'm in here trembling
In a terror ever-growing
Cracking up
Cracking up

About things we've gone through
Though it's hurting me
Now it's history
I've played all my cards
Nothing more to say
No more ace to play
The winner takes it all
The loser's standing small
Beside the victory
That's her destiny
I was in your arms
Thinking I belonged there
I figured it made sense
Building me a fence
Building me a home
Thinking I'd be strong there
But I was a fool
Playing by the rules

Why should I complain? (Why complain)
Like I used to kiss you?
Does it feel the same
When she calls your name?
Somewhere deep inside
You must know I miss you
But what can I say?
Rules must be obeyed
The judges will decide (They decide)

Spectators of the show (Of the show)
Always staying low (Staying low)

I don't wanna talk
If it makes you feel sad
And I understand
You've come to shake my hand
I apologise
If it makes you feel bad
Seeing me so tense
No self-confidence
The winner takes it all

Never walk alone after midnight
If you don't believe me  you'd better beware
Of me
I am behind you  I always find you
I am the tiger
People who fear me never come near me
I am the tiger
The city is a nightmare  a horrible dream
Some of us will dream it forever
Look around the corner  and try not to scream
It's me
I am behind you  I always find you
I am the tiger
People who fear me never come near me

My resistance running low
And every day the hold is getting tighter and it troubles me so
(You know that I'm nobody's fool)
I'm nobody's fool and yet it's clear to me
I don't have a strategy
It's just like taking candy from a baby and I think I must be
Under attack  I'm being taken
About to crack  defences breaking
Won't somebody please have a heart
Come and rescue me now 'cause I'm falling apart
Under attack  I'm taking cover
He's on my track  my chasing lover
Thinking nothing can stop him now
Should I want to  I'm not sure I would know how
This is getting crazy  I should tell him so
Really let my anger show
Persuade him that the answer to his questions is a definite no
(I'm kind of flattered I suppose)
Guess I'm kind of flattered but I'm scared as well
Something like a magic spell
I hardly dare to think of what would happen  where I'd be if I fell

Giving out a spark

Deep inside  both of us can feel the autumn chill
Birds of passage  you and me
We fly instinctively
When the summer's over and the dark clouds hide the sun
Neither you nor I'm to blame when all is said and done
In our lives  we have walked some strange and lonely treks
Slightly worn  but dignified  and not too old for sex
We're still striving for the sky
No taste for humble pie
Thanks for all your generous love and thanks for all the fun
Neither you nor I'm to blame when all is said and done
It's so strange  when you're down  and lying on the floor
How you rise  shake your head  get up and ask for more
Clear-headed and open-eyed
With nothing left untried
Standing calmly at the crossroads  no desire to run
There's no hurry anymore when all is said and done

When I kissed the teacher
And they must have thought they dreamed
When I kissed the teacher

Nearly petrified 'cause he was
My whole class went wild

When I kissed the teacher

One of these days
Leaning over me
He was trying to explain the laws of geometry

Someone to lean on  well I understand
It's only natural  but why did it have to be me?
Nights can be empty  nights can be cold
So you were looking for someone to hold
That's only natural  but why did it have to be me?
I was so lonesome  I was blue
I couldn't help it  it had to be you and I
Always thought you knew the reason why
I only wanted a little love affair
Now I can see you are beginning to care
But baby  believe me
It's better to forget me
Men are the toys in the game that you play
When you get tired  you throw 'em away
That's only natural  but why did it have to be me?
Falling in love with a woman like you
Happens so quickly  there's nothing to do
It's only natural  but why did it have to be me?
I was so lonesome  I was blue
I couldn't help it  it had to be you and I
Always thought you knew the reason why
I only wanted a little love affair
Now I can see you are beginning to care
But baby  believe me"
