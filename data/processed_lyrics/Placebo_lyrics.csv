lyrics
"Waxing with a candlelight  and burning just for you
Allocate your sentiment  and stick it in a box
I've never been an extrovert  but I'm still breathing
Someone tried to do me ache
Someone tried to do me ache
Someone tried to do me ache  (it's what I'm afraid of)
Someone tried to do me ache  (it's what I'm afraid of)
Thought I was getting carat gold  and what I got was you
Stuck inside the circumstances  lonely at the top
I've always been an introvert
Happily bleeding
Someone tried to do me ache
Someone tried to do me ache
Someone tried to do me ache  (it's what I'm afraid of)
Someone tried to do me ache  (it's what I'm afraid of)
I gotta breathe to stay alive
Feels like I'm gonna suffocate
This skin that turns to blister blue
Shoulders toes and knees  I'm thirty-six degrees
Shoulders toes and knees  I'm thirty-six degrees
Shoulder toes and knees  I'm thirty-six degrees
Shoulders toes and knees  I'm thirty-six degrees
Shoulder toes and knees  I'm thirty-six degrees
My heart
Now my mistakes are haunting me
Like winter came and put a freeze on
My heart
I've lost the power to understand
What it takes to be a man with
My heart
I saw you wanted this to end
You tried your best to be a friend to
My heart
But I'm leaving this worry town
Whenever I was feeling wrong
I used to go and write a song from
My heart
But now I fear I've lost my spark
No more glowing in the dark for
My heart

So I'm leaving this worry town
Please no grieving

You are the birth and you are waste
You are the one who took my place
You took a jump into forever
A leap of faith I could not take

So tender when I spoke your name

Hard to breathe I try and try  I'll get asphyxiated
Swinging from the tallest height  with nothing left to hold on to
Every sky is blue  but not for me and you
Glass of petrol vodka gin  it feels like breathing ethane
Throw yourself from skin to skin  and still it doesn't dull the pain
Vanish like a lipstick trace  it always blows me away
Every cloud is grey  with dreams of yesterday
Always goes against the grain  and I can try and deny it
Give a monkey half a brain  and still he's bound to fry it
Now the happening scene is dead  I used to want to be there too

Keep this scene inside your head
As the bruises turn to yellow and the swelling goes down
And if you're ever around in the city or the suburbs of this town
Be sure to come around
Saw you crashing 'round the bay
Never seen you act so shallow or look so brown
Remembered all the things you'd say
How your promises went hollow  as you threw me to the ground
And if you're ever around in the backstreets or the alleys of this town
Be sure to come around
When I dream  I dream of your lips
When I dream  I dream of your kiss
When I dream  I dream of your fists
Your fists
Your fists...
Leave me bleeding on the bed
See you right back here tomorrow  for the next round
Keep this scene inside your head
As the bruises turn to yellow  and the swelling goes down...

We open the latch on the gate of the hole that we call our home
Protect me from what I want  protect me from what I want
Maybe we're victims of fate  remember when we'd celebrate?
We'd drink and get high until late  and now we're all alone
Wedding bells ain't gonna chime with both of us guilty of crime
And both of us sentenced to time  and now we're all alone

L'épidémie qui s'étend
La fête est finie on descend
Les pensées qui glacent la raison
Surgissent les fantomes de notre lit
On ouvre le loquet de la grille
Du taudit qu'on appelle maison
Protect me from what I want
Protect me from what I want
Protect me from what I want
Sommes nous les jouets du destin
Souviens toi des moments divins
Et maintenant nous sommes tout seuls
Perdus les reves de s'aimer
Les temps où on avait rien fait
Il nous reste toute une vie pour pleurer
Et maintenant nous sommes tout seuls

A friend in need's a friend indeed

Like the roadkill  I'm paralyzed
You see through my disguise
At the drive-in  double feature
Pull the lever  break the fever
And say your last goodbye
Since I was born I started to decay
Now nothing ever-ever goes my way
One fluid gesture  like stepping back in time
Trapped in amber  petrified
And still not satisfied
Airs and social graces  elocution so divine
I'll stick to my needle  and my favorite waste of time
Both spineless and sublime
Since I was born I started to decay
In our comfort zone
Reminds me of the second time
That I followed you home
We're running out of alibis
On the second of May
Reminds me of the summertime
On this winter's day
See you at the bitter end
See you at the bitter end
Every step we take that's synchronized
Every broken bone
Reminds me of the second time
That I followed you home
You shower me with lullabies
As you're walking away
Reminds me that it's killing time
On this fateful day
See you at the bitter end

(See you at the bitter end)
Love's reached his side
Grab this gentleness inside
Heard a cry
Six feet down
(See you at the bitter end)
In six weeks' time
The mess you left
Of cigarette burns on my chest
I wrote a poem that described her world
And put our friendship to the test
And late at night
Whilst on all fours
She used to watch me kiss the floor

On the Champs-Élysées
As I was walking home
This is my last communiqué
Down the superhighway
All that I have left to say in a single tome
I got too many friends
Too many people that I'll never meet
And I'll never be there for
I'll never be there for
Cause I'll never be there
If I could give it all away
Will it come back to me someday?
Like a needle in the hay or an expensive stone
But I got a reason to declaim
The applications are to blame
For all my sorrow and my pain
A feeling so alone
