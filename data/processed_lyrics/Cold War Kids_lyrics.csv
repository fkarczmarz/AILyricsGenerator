lyrics
"The dreamin' broke my heart
There were no borderlines
Keepin' us apart
But then I wake up
To the sound of cryin' kids
No mothers here to hold
We can only wish
So I'll sing you a song
To show you my mind
It's all that I can do
To help us pass the time
One by one
Countin' my mistakes
One by one
At the gates
To see your face again
Walked a thousand miles
To this promise land
But little did we know
We were already there
How can I find sleep
When they won't turn off the light
My stomach's rumblin'
No more dreams tonight
I'll sing you a song
'Cause our soul feel down
The hardest to do
Is make a joyful sound

One by one
Countin' my mistakes
One by one (One by one)
At the gates
To see your face again
One by one
We will come
One by one
(We will come)
I'm countin' my mistakes
One by one (One by one)
You make me wait
I have heard your sad luck misfortune speech
But I'll have sympathy when you get off your seat
Before this bitterness becomes a disease
I have cracked the code on this old machine
Ten thousands hours to be released
But I've been wondering why can't you see
If the door opens up  then go where it leads
And I have been waiting
For you to find
That all of this could be yours
Be yours tonight
Could be yours
Could be yours
Could be yours
Could be yours
Could be yours

You were packing up but I gave you a bed
You would rather crash than go straight ahead
I wrote this years ago but it's finished today
With the help of a friend who has feelings to say
And I have been waiting
But you need a sign
That all of this could be yours
Be yours tonight
I have been patient
But you've got to try
Then all of this could be yours
Be yours tonight
Could be yours
Could be yours
Could be yours
Could be yours
Could be yours
Could be yours
Could be yours
Could be yours
Could be yours
Could be yours
Could be yours
Could be yours
All this could be yours
And all this could be yours
And all this could be yours
And all this could be yours  could be yours
Like velvet cake
Sweetheart can bargain
Half-price mistakes
She will go down with her ship
Like a good captain
You're sitting on the dock
Playing for an audience of one
Pacing your apartment
Linoleum floors
Get a call from an old friend
She never liked them before
He will drive all over three lanes
Windshield wipers waving for an audience of one
You came out from the country
Wearing mama's clothes
You were born in the city
Daddy's dominos

You need a record you can move to
Well we got one
Drop the needle
We are playing for an audience of one
Drop the needle
We are playing for an audience of one
One gets all of you
Two's jealous
Three gets even less
Four divides you up then you're left
Pleasing all your guests
Reach out your pointer finger
And touch the globe
Spin it round and where it stops
You've got to pack your bags and go
Land in the Mojave Desert
Sing for the sun
Three's too many when you're playing for an audience of one
Two's too busy when you're playing for an audience of one
One is the only way you're playing for an audience of one
These hotel walls all look the same
I'm numb from all this traveling
And I'll be yours beyond the pale
There's temptation all around me
And I should look away
Just a simple conversation
It don't mean anything
'Cause I've already got somebody
Somebody waiting at home
Who's in the background whispering?
Some new friends I'll never see again

You really are
You wanna feel wanted
You really are
Then I'll look above you
Away in the rain
I can’t wait to see what you become
When you became
And even when you lose
You pushed us all
You pushed us all
A little bit further
Reminded me of you
As I'm nodding off
As I’m nodding off
In a massage parlor
I don’t even know whose side I’m on
Are both sides the same?

Away in the rain
I can’t wait to see what you become
When you became
And even though it’s late
The promise stands
It doesn't fade
The best laid plans
Can fall down broken all around you now
Oh I can’t hear you
Are you talking to me?
No I can’t hear you
Did you say that you’re happy for me?
Did you say that you’re happy for me?
The cathedral out into the moon
Your flashback is airtight
Like an elephant  never hurt a fly
Mother instinct never gonna die
Alright  stay
You got my attention
All my pain
Is bottled affection
Now it's my turn to play cool
Nothing you can say can even break through
I see the weapons  I pulled out
I met my match  so why am I proud?
I'm not the same kid  I grew up
Didn't I? Or did I get stuck?
You get older  it gets worse
You be the good one that gives it up first
Or the bad one that never gets hurt

I think about the old days
What we've been through to survive

Looking back to the start  who we were when we met
And I can barely recognize us  back then we were obsessed
Can we cut out this madness and get back to the best?
Think about the old days

That was just the beginning
Look at me now

Of  good times never call
On you because the good times never call
When you're waiting by the phone
The good times never call
On you unless you do it too

Boredom made you small
Asphalt and the oil

Love and Hate are tattoed on his knuckles and
My name is on his back
Every man I fall for
Works the graveyard shift
He kisses me softly to wake me up
Then takes my place in bed
And I fall
I leave with one concern
It's the law of diminishing returns
It's the law of diminishing returns
Every man I fall for keeps his anger on
A string and holds it tight
When other man walk by blinking their eyes at me
He always pick a fight
I go walk alone down Ocean Boulevard
Peaking your windows
Is this the life you chose?
And I fall
I leave with one concern

Went underground and I found what I was worth
All alone and I know I can't stay
But we're walking up and down the streets to stay awake
You learn to love what you get in return
But you have to slow down and breathe one breath at a time
Where you can stay forever
You can be so sure
That it will only get better
You and me together
Through the days and nights
I don't worry 'cause
Everything's going to be alright
But all I know is everything's going to be alright
Can get in the way of what I'm feeling
Can get in the way of what I feel for you
When the rain is pouring down
And my heart is hurting
You will always be around

What if all my decisions are fear based?

I've tried to fly solo
It's not a question of whether I will fall
It's how hard I hit the floor

Till I'm black and blue
And do you think we all hide from the truth?

Got me a passport and a driver

Such a struggle just to keep an ordinary love
Ain't got the time for friends
Why am I working so hard and barely keeping up?

Who to call when it stops?

We're taking Communion and passing the offering hat
Around at the same time

And slide it into my ragged coat sleeve
And leave in its place a note to explain
All of the reasons the spirit has led me to leave
If there was a worthy cause for to give to
May I be so bold as to say
That givers not knowing where their money's going
Is as sinful as throwing away
Stained glasses shine on my red wine
And the sweat on my brow drips to my shaking knees
A small sacrifice to benefit one man's
Journey away from America's seas
