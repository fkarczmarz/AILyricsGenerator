lyrics
"Frozen I held my breath
Right from the start
I knew that I'd found the home for my
Heart beats fast
Colors and promises
How to be brave
How can I love when I'm afraid to fall?
Watching you stand alone
All of my doubt suddenly goes away somehow
One step closer
I have died everyday waiting for you
Darling don't be afraid I have loved you
For a thousand years
I'll love you for a thousand more
Time stands still
Beauty in all she is
I will be brave
I will not let anything take away
What's standing in front of me
Every breath
Every hour has come to this
You might also like
One step closer
I have died everyday waiting for you
Darling don't be afraid I have loved you
For a thousand years
I'll love you for a thousand more
And all along I believed I would find you
Time has brought your heart to me
I have loved you for a thousand years
I'll love you for a thousand more
I'll love you for a thousand more
One step closer
I have died everyday waiting for you
Darling don't be afraid I have loved you
For a thousand years
I'll love you for a thousand more
And all along I believed I would find you
Time has brought your heart to me
I have loved you for a thousand years
How to be brave? How can I love when I'm afraid to fall?
But watching you stand alone
All of my doubt suddenly goes away somehow
One step closer
I have died every day waiting for you
Darling  don't be afraid
I have loved you for a thousand years
I'll love you for a thousand more
Time stands still  beauty in all she is
I will be brave  I will not let anything take away
What's standing in front of me
Every breath  every hour has come to this
One step closer
I have died every day waiting for you
Darling  don't be afraid
I have loved you for a thousand years
I'll love you for a thousand more
And all along  I believed I would find you
Time has brought your heart to me
I have loved you for a thousand years
I'll love you for a thousand more
You might also like
One step closer
One step closer
I have died every day waiting for you
Darling  don't be afraid
I have loved you for a thousand years
I'll love you for a thousand more
And all along  I believed I would find you
Time has brought your heart to me
I have loved you for a thousand years
The colors had faded to gray
Just when I'd given up on hoping
There's a bright light in the sky tonight
Guiding us safely to shore
Not afraid anymore
All that matters now is where we go from here
There's an easier way if we live for today
Remember all you've forgotten
The joy and the simplest of things
Refuse to take life for granted
But choose to celebrate all that life brings
There's a bright light in the sky tonight
Guiding us safely to shore
Not afraid anymore

There's a bright light in the sky tonight
Guiding us safely to shore
Not afraid anymore
All that matters now is where we go from here
There's an easier way if we live for today
There's an easier way if we live for today
 right now?
 call it anything but love
 I'm having trouble breathing
 right now
'Cause all that's waiting is regret
And don't you know I'm not your ghost anymore?
You lost the love I love the most
I learned to live half-alive
And now you want me one more time
And who do you think you are
Runnin' 'round leaving scars
Collecting your jar of hearts
And tearing love apart?
You're gonna catch a cold
From the ice inside your soul
So don't come back for me
Who do you think you are?
I hear you're asking all around
If I am anywhere to be found
But I have grown too strong
To ever fall back in your arms
You might also like
And I've learned to live half-alive
And now you want me one more time
And who do you think you are
Runnin' 'round leaving scars
Collecting your jar of hearts
And tearing love apart?
You're gonna catch a cold
From the ice inside your soul
So don't come back for me
Who do you think you are?
Remember how to put back the light in my eyes
I wish I had missed the first time that we kissed
'Cause you broke all your promises
And now you're back
You don't get to get me back
And who do you think you are
Runnin' 'round leavin' scars
Collecting your jar of hearts
And tearing love apart?
You're gonna catch a cold
From the ice inside your soul
So don't come back for me
Don't come back at all
And who do you think you are
Runnin' 'round leaving scars
Collecting your jar of hearts
Tearing love apart?
You're gonna catch a cold
From the ice inside your soul
Don't come back for me
Don't come back at all
Who do you think you are?
Who do you think you are?
But I still have a wish to make
A special one for you
Merry Christmas Darling
We're apart that's true
But I can dream and in my dreams
I'm Christmasing with you
Holidays are joyful
There's always something new
But everyday's a holiday
When I'm near to you
Oh the lights I wish you could see
I wish it every day
Logs on the fire fill me with desire
To see you and to say
That I wish you Merry Christmas (Merry Christmas Darling)
Happy New Year too
I have just one wish on this Christmas Eve (On this Christmas Eve)
I wish I were with you
Logs on the fire fill me with desire
To see you and to say
That I wish you Merry Christmas (Merry Christmas darling)
Happy New Year too
I have just one wish on this Christmas Eve (On this Christmas Eve)
I wish I were with you
I wish I were with you
Mama's whistling takes me back again
There's something 'bout December
We're hanging mistletoes
And hoping that it snows
I close my eyes and then
I can still remember
How to get back home
Let all your memories hold you close
No matter where you are
You're not alone
Because the ones you love are never far
If Christmas is in your heart
Who really needs a gift
When love is meant to give?
I can still recall
Carry with me always
Every Christmas dream
They live in you and me
Let all your memories hold you close
No matter where you are
You're not alone
Because the ones you love are never far
If Christmas is in your heart
You might also like
Lights around the tree
Mama's whistling takes me back again
There's something 'bout December
Let all your memories hold you close
No matter where you are
You're not alone
Because the ones you love are never far
The rest of the world fades from view
And all of the love I see 
Please please say you feel it too
And all of the noise I hear inside 
And all that you need to say
To make it all go away
Is that you feel the same way too
And I know
The scariest part is letting go
Cause love is a ghost you can’t control
I promise you the truth can’t hurt us now
So let the words slip out of your mouth
And all of the steps that led me to you
And all of the hell I had to walk through
But I wouldn’t trade a day for the chance to say:
And I know
The scariest part is letting go
Cause love is a ghost you can’t control
I promise you the truth can’t hurt us now
So let the words slip out of your mouth
You might also like
I know that we’re both afraid
We both made the same mistakes
An open heart is an open wound to you
And in the wind of a heavy choice
Love has a quiet voice
And I know
The scariest part is letting go
Let my love be the light that guides you home
And I know
The scariest part is letting go
Cause love is a ghost you can’t control
I promise you the truth can’t hurt us now
In dreams you will lose your heartaches
Whatever you wish for you keep
Have faith in your dreams and someday
Your rainbow will come smiling through
No matter how your heart is grieving
If you keep on believing
The dream that you wish will come true
Have faith in your dreams and someday
Your rainbow will come smiling through
No matter how your heart is grieving
If you keep on believing
Colors and promises
How to be brave?
How can I love when I'm afraid to fall
But watching you stand alone?
All of my doubt suddenly goes away somehow
One step closer
I have died everyday waiting for you
Darling don't be afraid I have loved you
For a thousand years
I'll love you for a thousand more
Time stands still
Beauty in all she is
I will be brave
I will not let anything take away
What's standing in front of me
Every breath
Every hour has come to this
One step closer
I have died everyday waiting for you
Darling don't be afraid I have loved you
For a thousand years
I'll love you for a thousand more
And all along I believed I would find you
Time has brought your heart to me
I have loved you for a thousand years
All those years outside looking in
All that time never even knowing
Just how blind I've been
Now I'm here blinking in the starlight
Now I'm here suddenly I see
Standing here it's all so clear
I'm where I'm meant to be
And it's like the fog has lifted
And it's like the sky is new
And it's warm and real and bright
And the world has somehow shifted
Now that I see you
All those days chasing down a daydrеam
All those years living in a blur
All that time nеver truly seeing
Now she's here shining in the starlight
Now she's here suddenly I know
If she's here it's crystal clear
I'm where I'm meant to go

And it's like the fog has lifted
And it's like the sky is new
And it's warm and real and bright
And the world has somehow shifted
Now that I see you
But you came around and you knocked me off the ground from the start
You put your arms around me
And I believe that it's easier for you to let me go
You put your arms around me and I'm home
How many times will you let me change my mind and turn around?
I hope that you see right through my walls
I'll never let our love get so close
You put your arms around me and I'm home
The world is comin' down on me and I can't find a reason to be loved
You put your arms around me
And I believe that it's easier for you to let me go
You might also like
I hope that you see right through my walls
I'll never let our love get so close
You put your arms around me and I'm home
I tried my best to never let you in to see the truth
'Til you put your arms around me
And I believe that it's easier for you to let me go
I hope that you see right through my walls
I'll never let our love get so close
You put your arms around me and I'm home
That went right back to you and me
For a minute
I wouldn't get in it
Press some buttons and turn the dial
To that summer
Where my heart felt younger
I'm not sayin' things were better then
But I wish I could see you smile at me again
I was yours and you were mine
Think of you and I don't know why
'Cause I can't go back in time
If I had the chance again
To stop the ending when it came
I wouldn't do it
That we went through
It doesn't mean I was meant for you
You might also like
I was yours and you were mine
Think of you and I don't know why
'Cause I can't go back in time
I guess life is full of things that we can live without
But that doesn't change the truth
Part of me was made by you
I was yours and you were mine
Think of you and I don't know why
'Cause I can't go back in time
If I had a time machine
That went right back to you and me
For a minute
This world is too heavy
For a feather falling quickly
And I wrote your story
But I'm afraid of how it ends
And though my friends are doing well
And I'm still on the mend
I'm going to lay back down
Hope the wind takes me around
I gotta find some courage in this town
'Cause nobody's going to save
Somebody who won't change
I tried to be brave
I feel a little queasy
Won't you please come and be with me?
It's not like there's much better
Nobody's grass is as green as mine
I can't say that I'm satisfied
Three thousand miles from your kiss goodbye
You might also likeI'm going to lay back down
Hope the wind takes me around
I gotta find some courage in this town
And everybody's afraid
'Cause chances come from change
And everybody's afraid
'Cause chances come from breaking
The chances are you're breaking open
I'm going to lay back down
Hope the wind takes me around
I gotta find some courage in this town
'Cause nobody's going to save
Somebody who won't change
There's been so many fights that I've fought and I've never won
So I decided that I should just give up on trying to right your wrongs
And word on the street is that she did to you what you did to me
To the ground where you left my heart to bleed
To the ground where you left my heart to bleed
So unfortunately  for girls like me there are more like you
Bending and breaking the rules and we're making exceptions too
But how does it feel to swim in your own tears?
To the ground where you left my heart to bleed
To the ground where you left my heart to bleed
To the ground where you left my heart to bleed
To the ground where you left my heart to bleed

 so don't let go
 darling?
 we got time
 we got love
 mmm
 we got time
 we got love
 you're my life
 so don't let go
 we got time
 we got love
My heart isn't black and blue anymore
And your words don't mean a thing
Maybe I was wrong
I only remember feeling so alone
This isn't where I meant to lay down
But you dug this grave
Fits me perfectly
And if you're asking if I'm over love
You're a fool to believe
That you gave me some
It's been raining here like it never should
And I can't help but believe it's because you're coming
But don't come following your fantasy
'Cause you might be surprised she'll run right back inside
Maybe I was wrong
I only remember feeling so alone
This isn't where I meant to lay down
But you dug this grave
Fits me perfectly
And if you're asking if I'm over love

This isn't where I meant to lay down
But you dug this grave
Fits me perfectly
And if you're asking if I'm over love
Too young to never ask for help
From then 'til forever
It's the cold that keeps me warm at night
'Cause the blue of my mother has always been my color
The love that I offer is deep and out of tune
But you hold me 'cause you know me
All that I can do is turn a lighter shade of blue
I wear my shadow like a dress
I'm not afraid of loneliness
Can I run into your arms at night?
'Cause the blue of my mother has always been my color
The love that I offer is deep and out of tune
But you hold me 'cause you know mе
All that I can do is turn a lighter shade of blue
A lightеr shade of blue
I used to hide my broken side
Now I wear it on my sleeve
I hope in time you'll see

That the blue of my mother has always been my color
The love that I offer is deep and out of tune
But you hold me 'cause you know me
All that I can do is turn a lighter shade of blue

Get back together when it’s torn apart
Teach itself to start
Beating again ba-ba-ba-ba
This little blue bird
Came looking for you
I said that I hadn’t seen you
In quite some time
This little blue bird
She came looking again
I said we weren’t even friends
She could have you
Don’t you think it was hard?
I didn’t even say that you died
But it wouldn’t have been such a lie
Cause then I started to cry
This little blue bird
Sure won’t give it a rest
She swears that you may be better than all the rest
I said no you’ve got it all wrong
If he was something special I wouldn’t have this song

Don’t you think it was hard
I didn’t even say that you died
But it wouldn’t have been such a lie
Cause then I started to cry
How the hell does a broken heart
Get back together when it’s torn apart
Teach itself to start
Beating again ba-ba-ba-ba
What if when she comes over I am in your arms
Taking all I want from you again
How the hell does a broken heart
Get back together when it’s torn apart
Teach itself to start
Beating again ba-ba-ba-ba
How the hell does a broken heart
Get back together when it’s torn apart
Teach itself to start
Beating again ba-ba-ba-ba
Beating again ba-ba-ba-ba
This little blue bird
Don’t come around here anymore
So I went looking for her
I can see the path that leads away
Mama never left and daddy needs me here
I wish the wind would carry a change
Looking through the window to a world of dreams
I can see my future slip away
I wish the wind would carry a change
I need I need a change
I've had enough of chasing luck
I'm setting fire to the life that I know
Lets start a fire everywhere that we go
We're starting fires we're starting fires
Until our lives are burning gold
Until our lives are burning gold
Looking for my ticket to a higher place
I can see my chance begin to fade
One step forward and two back again
I wish the wind would carry a change

I've had enough of chasing luck
I'm setting fire to the life that I know
Let's start a fire everywhere that we go
Until our lives are burning gold
I'm setting fire to the life that I know
Let's start a fire everywhere that we go
Until our lives are burning gold
You'll never land inside my hands
Your home is in the sky
And there's a lesson waiting to be learned
The fire starters always get the burns
And the good guys never get the girl
And shooting stars cannot fix the world
And I've made the same mistakes
But I won't this time
No I won't this time
And you're a pretty butterfly
And I believed all your lies
I'm blinded by your sideways smile
And the kindness in your eyes
But there's a limit to your flight
I can offer you a better life
But you keep on flying from the light
And I've lost my faith in wrong and right
And I've made the same mistakes
But I won't this time
No I won't this time
You might also likeI know exactly what you do
I made damn sure I studied you
You won't pick me
I am just a breeze underneath your wings
So I pray each night you'll change your mind
That maybe I am worth the fight
But I am wrong every time
You only know how to fly
You only know how to fly
 right now?
 call it anything but love
 I'm having trouble breathing
 right now
Birds singin' in the sycamore tree
Dream a little dream of me
Say nighty-night and kiss me
Just hold me tight and tell me you'll miss me
While I'm alone and blue as can be
Dream a little dream of me
Still craving your kiss
Just saying this
Sweet dreams 'til sunbeams find you
Sweet dreams that leave all worries behind you
Dream a little dream of me
To times I thought we'd always have
Who knew the world could spin so fast? I didn't
I write letters to you in my head
Things we did and things we said
Today I heard someone say your name again
In your hopes and dreams
In your memories
In the songs we sing
In the ones we leave
We carry on
But no one is evergone
No one is evergone
No one is evergone
In your hopes and dreams
In your memories
No one is evergone
I think about a better place
And learn to live with the heartache
And every time I think of you
I feel you in the things I do

We carry on
But no one is evergone

No one is evergone
I don't wanna keep going on without you
Grow around the pain if I have to
So I make a space inside my heart
No one is evergone
In your hopes and dreams
In your memories
In the songs we sing
In the ones we leave
We carry on
But no one is evergone
In your hopes and dreams
In your memories (No one is evergone)
In the songs we sing
In the ones we leave
We carry on
No one is evergone
No one is evergone
No one is evergone
In your hopes and dreams
In your memories
No one is evergone
Thoughts of you bring me back
To times I thought we'd always have
With my drawings of flowers all over the walls
My mom downstairs pushin' all of our problems under the rug
My friends comin' 'round on a Friday night
'Cause they know I got cigarettes and homemade wine
And everyone's talkin' too loud
Nobody here even sees me
Can we go right now?
LA's fine when the sun does shine
But I wanna go back to the Eastern Time
To the people I know
To the people you don't
So won't you take me home?
I wanna go back to the moment in time
Out the sounds of my mind
I hate everyone at this party
'Cause they're so in love with themselves
Nobody here understands me
I wish I was somewhere else

New York's fine in the summertime
But I wanna be far from the city lights
With the people I know
And the people you don't
So won't you take me home?
I don't belong at this party
I don't belong in this town
I need to go back where we started
Can we leave right now?
(LA's fine when the sun does shine
But I wanna go back to the Eastern Time)
(LA's fine when the sun does shine
But I wanna go back to the Eastern Time)
I can bite my tongue
I can stay awake for days if that's what you want
Be your number one
I can fake a smile
I can force a laugh
I can dance and play the part if that's what you ask
Give you all I am
I can do it
I can do it
I can do it
But I'm only human
And I bleed when I fall down
I'm only human
And I crash and I break down
You build me up and then I fall apart
'Cause I'm only human
I can turn it on
Be a good machine
I can hold the weight of worlds if that's what you need
Be your everything

'Cause I'm only human

Just a little human
I can take so much
'Til I've had enough
'Cause I'm only human
And I bleed when I fall down
I'm only human
And I crash and I break down
You build me up and then I fall apart
I believe that the words that he told you are not your grave
I know that we are not the weight of all our memories
I believe in the things that I am afraid to say
I believe in the lost possibilities you can't see
And I believe that the darkness reminds us where light can be
I believe that you fell so you would land next to me
'Cause I have been where you are before
And I have felt the pain of losing who you are
I believe that tomorrow is stronger than yesterday
And I believe that your head is the only thing in your way
I wish that you could see your scars turn into beauty
I believe that today it's okay to be not okay

But I'm no Cinderella

Just as fast as the sunset
Where my dreams lay
And just as quick as you left
Just as quick as you left my heart undressed
You took my wish back to the well
And I remember all the words that you said
That love is just a spark that starts in your heart
And ends your head
You'll lose yourself in the clouds
Your world's spinning around
May your untamed heart stay restless running wild
Just as dark as the night
Just as dark as the night
You let me sell my love for my soul
And I remember all the words that you wrote
That love is just a sound that plays in your heart
And gets caught in your throat

Your world's spinning around

Give me a moment to catch my breath
And hold me every second left
Proud of me  that's the only way I want you to be
Look at me and love what you see
I won't make it alone
I need something to hold
Kiss me on my shoulder
Tell me it's not over
I promised to always come home to you
Remind me that I'm older
To be brave smart  sweet and bolder
And don't give up on what we're trying to do
Don't count the miles  count the I love you's
We made it out
And all the other people are asking how
This doesn't even sound like truth
To grow from a bruise
But one day we will realize
How hard it was  how hard we tried
And how our hearts made it out alive

A secret’s safe behind a pretty smile
What’s with all the late-night liquored phone calls?
I don’t think your lover likes me at all
A secret's safe behind a pretty smile
To find out why I can’t love you
I can’t love you
And who said it was cool
To be asking me these questions
Your who what and when where and why
Are making my head spin
And when was it an option to put your lips upon my lips
And how did this happen and
Why are you laughing and how do I get back together again
To find out why
To find out why
I can’t love you
I can’t love you
That are having trouble feeding
To the mothers who feel empty
That aren't sure they're even ready
To be alone and responsible for somebody so small
To the mothers who are falling and don't even make a sound
Who don't know that they're broken until they hit the ground
This ones for you
I've been there too
I've been there too
To the mother that's at home
Scrolling through her phone
Watching everybody else make family look easy
To the mom with her career
Who can't take off a whole year
So she has to pay somebody else to take care of her baby
To the mothers who are falling and don't even make a sound
Who don't know they're broken until they hit the ground
This ones for you
I've been there too
You might also like
Going from a woman to a mother
It might break you
But it might save you
To the mother in the mirror
Who wishes she was thinner
'Cause now her body isn't somebody that she knows
To the mothers just like me
Who fell apart so suddenly
I hope you realize you're not alone
This one's for you
This one's for you
'Cause I've been there too
I've been there too
I see that you are lonely
If you could I know you'd leave with me
It's more than curiosity
And I've never longed for winter
Until your presence made me shiver
Untethered you'd be better
If you'd only come with me
One night
I will be the moon
Hanging over you
Spilling all over your body
Covering all your wounds
One night
I will be the star
Falling where you are
Swimming in the deep of my love
Filling your empty heart
One night
One night
One night
One night
One night
One night

You've come so close to tasting
Now my innocence is breaking
Like the ocean in a perfect storm
It makes me want you even more
And I've never been so jealous
I've never felt so helpless
So out of breath and hungry for you
One night
I will be the moon
Hanging over you
Spilling all over your body
Covering all your wounds
One night
I will be the star
Falling where you are
Swimming in the deep of my love
Filling your empty heart
One night
One night
One night
One night
One night
One night
Hurry the sun is waking
Darling don't leave me waiting
One night
I will be the moon
Hanging over you
Spilling all over your body
Covering all your wounds
One night
I will be the star
Falling where you are
Swimming in the deep of my love
Filling your empty heart
One night
One night
One night
One night

The hardest parts you'll get through
Can you find the time to let your lover hold you?
He needs somebody to hold too
And he's the one that you were born to love
For even if I'm far away  I hold you in my heart
I sing a secret song to you each night we are apart
Remember me  though I have to travel far
Remember me  each time you hear a sad guitar
Know that I’m with you the only way that I can be
Plough to hanging low around my heart  the air is cool
I've got the strangest feeling like I'm waiting for a dream
Looking out the window at the roses in the rain
Walked around the supermarket talking to myself
The man behind the counter asked me if I need some help
I knew that he could see it
'Cause he didn't know what to say
So  I asked him if knew about the roses in the rain
Maybe in a little while  I'll put some coffee on
Can't stop wondering wherе do spirits go when they are gonе
Maybe it was tomorrow  but it felt like today
You and I were walking
You and I were walking
You think I'd learn better now cause I can't get any rest
Cause I keep trying to find happiness in everybody else
And please move that finger that's been pointing to my mistakes
I want no part in the feelings your words make
So let go let me love you today
And you're so damn difficult
You'd lose a heart in your hand
And I can't believe you made me work for it
No one understands why I don't run as fast as I can
And I don't believe there's a way out of this mess
I'll never love again
Again
See right through my wounds
See I'm just like you
All your lies
All your lies
All your lies

 how will I get home?
 don't let me go
 don't let me go
 don't let me go
A chill has found each bone
I am overcome
There is an icy breath that escapes my lips
And I am lost again
A certain type of darkness has stolen me
Under a quiet mask of uncertainty
I wait for light like water from the sky
And I am lost again
In the sea of lovers without ships
And lovers without sight
You’re the only way out of this sea
Lovers losing time
And lovers losing hope
Will you let me follow you
Wherever you go
Bring me home
A certain type of silence has filled my voice
I scream beneath the water and make no noise
And I am lost again

Will you let me follow you
Wherever you go
But we fall down
Its no surprise
'Cause here we go fighting
There you go again
Lie on your own
Let this love turn to stone
'Cause there we go fighting
There you go again
Here we go again
So let me go  let me go
I don't know how we broke something incredible
Woah oh
You shot me in the heart this time
I hope you know hope you know you let it go
Lost it all something incredible
Woah oh
You shot me in the heart this time
Don't call me home
You only gave what you've stole
There I go hurting
There I go again

Surrender  mm
I can make a list  a million things I need to fix
I make everyone crazy  is it somethin' about me?
I keep tightenin' my grip  but I aim so much I miss
And I'm fightin' the river
When I try to hold it all together
But it's just not gettin' better
Surrender  mm
Surrender  mm (Ooh-ah)
It's breakin' my heart 'cause I don't understand
Why so much is out of my hands
I have to remember
Surrender
Oh  I keep learnin' the hard way
Oh  keep forgettin' how to pray
Someone tell me I'm okay
I climbed a mountain  I could not rеsist
And I hit bottom at the top of it
I was broken wide opеn

Crying off my face again
The silent sound of loneliness
Wants to follow me to bed
I'm a ghost of a girl that I want to be most
I'm the shell of a girl that I used to know well
Dancing slowly in an empty room
Can the lonely take the place of you?
I sing myself a quiet lullaby
Let you go and let the lonely in
To take my heart again
Too afraid to go inside
For the pain of one more loveless night
But the loneliness will stay with me
And hold me 'til I fall asleep
I'm the ghost of a girl that I want to be most
I'm the shell of a girl that I used to know well

Broken pieces of
A barely breathing story
Where there once was love
Now there's only me
And the lonely
Dancing slowly in an empty room
Can the lonely take the place of you?
I sing myself a quiet lullaby
And let you go and let the lonely in
There were birds in the sky  but I never saw them winging
No  I never saw them at all 'til there was you
Then there was music and wonderful roses
They tell me in sweet fragrant meadows of dawn and dew
There was love all around  but I never heard heard it singing
No  I never heard it at all 'til there was you
Then there was music and wonderful roses
They tell me in sweet fragrant meadows of dawn and dew
There was love all around  but I never heard it singing
No  I never heard it at all 'til there was you
The meanest things  all the meanest things
Some days  I'm holding my self-worth up
By a string  a string
But every day that I don't hide myself away
To me  is a tiny victory
Some days  it feels like a wrecking ball swinging
Through my ribcage  my ribcage
Some nights I'm just a million broken pieces singin'
On a stage
I'm a little more broken open  but a little more free
And that's a tiny victory
And if battles can win a war
I can keep picking my sword up off the floor
And learn to treasure these
Tiny victories  tiny victories
Some days  givin' up on myself looks so
So easy to do  it's so easy to do
The struggle is slow  I'm barely movin' the needle
And the cracks may be few  but there's light coming through

But tonight you belong to me
But tonight you belong to me
Way down by the stream (Way down by the stream)
How sweet it will seem (How sweet it will seem)
Once more just to dream in the moonlight
With the dawn that you will be gone
The meaning of a tragedy
Surprised to hear it's you and me
But when it comes down to it
You never made the most of it
And I won't be made a fool of
Don't call this love
When did you decide
That I didn't have enough to buy
Forgive and forget you a thousand times
For the fire and the sleepless nights
And I won't be made a fool of
Don't call this love
Don't call this love

To trust the lies that slip from my mouth
Trust the heart I’m so quick to sell
I knew better than to trust love again
Memories that won’t stop stinging
Promises I can’t believe in
I knew better than
I knew better than
To trust myself
To trust someone else
To trust the doubt in the back of my mind
Trust the trail of pain left behind
I knew better than to trust love again
And I’m so quick to lose what was never mine to keep
And I cannot stand on what’s broken under me
And I don’t know how to forgive myself for everything
But I must learn trust
Like the wind is blowing
Change is fast and growing
I knew better than
 how much I love you
 as I laid sleeping
 I was mistaken
 how much I love you
Darling  you are sweeter than I ever dreamed
Darling  you make me believe in make-believe
Darling  you mean the whole wide world to me
What do I do with all this love for you?
It's so much more than I ever knew
Baby girl  it’s bigger than the whole wide world
Darling  you mean the whole wide world to me
Darling  you light up everyone you meet
With a smile you give away so easily
Darling  you mean the whole wide world to me
What do I do with all this love for you?
It's so much more than I ever knew
What do I do with how I feel inside?
If you ever wonder how much I love you  girl
It's bigger than the whole wide world
When the road looks rough ahead
And you're miles and miles from your nice warm bed
You just remember what your old pal said
You got a friend in me
You've got a friend in me
You got a friend in me
There isn't anything I wouldn't do for you
We stick together and see it through
'Cause you got a friend in me
Some other folks might be a little bit smarter than I am
But none of them will ever love you the way I do
It's me and you
And as the years go by
Our friendship will never die
You got a friend in me"
