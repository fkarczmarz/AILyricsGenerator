I don't wanna say I've given up but I've just seen everybody make me promises and make me promises on promises and never really fulfill  like
I was always looking for a caretaker
Looking for someone that would protect me  take initiative for me
And just be the greatest person they could for me
And that may be selfish  I don't know
And every time I've kinda let myself be led on by someone  they either deceive me or
I'm a very genuine person and I'm far too emotional and I care too much
 trying not to be ignored
 let them soar
 yeah

 do I cross your mind?

I love Trippie Redd
Get up off the block if I don't know you
Pop a nigga head like Amoxicillin
I'm high saditty to these bitches
How you hot and shitty? Wait
My shit make the whole city rock
Then he shook his body like a macarena
Give this dog a bone and think I wasn't gon' catch it like that shit was farfetched
Just a young nigga but I been doin' it for so long they gotta praise the vet
P. Soul on the track
Can you rap like me? Huh
My vision a place I visit while lifted
They told me to go and get it  I got it so now I'm winning (Remember)
Revolution of fury  the lean got my vision blurry
Balling' like Stephen Curry  gold fangs in my mouth so purty
Trippie bring demolition and I ain't talking no derbies
Absorb your flow like I'm Kirby  the lies you tell will not hurt me
Try to reach for the stars  yet people don't get too far
They want all of the money  all the expensive cars
It's few people that ever make it but yet I still gotta go hard
Okay  and this is for every rapper that had a shot at sendin' me
Your efforts ain't getting you anywhere in this industry
My venomous rhymes wine and dine on you mentally
Motivated the motivations  say I got too much chemistry
Fatality  like Liu Kang told me to finish 'em
Even the Hulk couldn't take this much intensity
I'm the bullet in the barrel in the gun that shot Kennedy
Mind is racin' 'bout hating  contemplation with Haitians
Jamaicans sitting on 5G5 pacing  back and forth waiting in Dayton
You get the picture  don't take this
Throw it up  regurgitation
Can't shit on me  you constipated
Is you mad 'cause we do this on a daily basis?
Yeah  or is you mad 'cause we made it?
Every day faded  we out here paper chasing
