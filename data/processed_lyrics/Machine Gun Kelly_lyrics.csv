lyrics
"Then at least I know I died a legend
And keep the vibe alive inside forever
And feel me forever
I'm living like it's my last day
Smoke as if there's not already 27 roaches in the ashtray
Smile as if no one hated at all
As if anyone understood anytime I evolved
Buy a Bentley and look just like you?
How am I supposed to write a song when I'm famous
And all the pain is created?
Why don't you just go home?

And kiss my baby girl goodnight
And if this really is goodbye
Then let's set the city on fire
Can you take me higher?
Can you take me higher?
Then at least I know I died a legend
Will you roll and ride like we're together?
And keep the vibe alive forever
Keep the vibe alive forever
Then at least I know I died a legend
Will you roll and ride like we're together?
And keep the vibe alive forever
Keep the vibe alive forever
I let these words seep through my soul
And speak through the song
Then at least I give you my voice to listen to
What is a beautiful life without a beautiful death?
Kells
Always be those crazy kids running wide-eyed down the boulevard
I love my life  gonna run it in the ground
Can't sleep for days  got your name in my brain
I'm writing this at 5:3666 in the morning
Wide awake still  not even yawning
Not even sure why I'm up at dawn like I'm celebrating
When my agent told me that no one's calling
It's a ounce in my living room on the couch
Next to a couple homies that smoked it and passed out
So I'm alone with my thoughts in this glass house
In the cabinet are glass vials  I just poured all the last out
I smelled her  now she's on my mind
I met her the first time my light turned lime
Hate it when she's gone  but she ain't hard to find
Left her on my desk  she made designs in little lines
It's 5:3666
It's 5:3666
Some days  I feel like I let myself down
I love my life  gonna run it in the ground
Can't sleep for days  got your name in my brain

In my head  talking to these demons (Demons)
In my bed  staring at these ceilings
I just bleached my hair and changed my whole appearance
I'm just fed up with these smoke and mirrors
My uncle sold some pictures of me with no clearance
What the fuck is family? I can't take that serious
Thank God everybody sucks so I can write these lyrics
Go pick her up  I need to lift my spirits
They don't know that we hook up  I don't let cameras near us
Like that week I spent locked in a room with her in Paris (Fuck)
It's 5:3666 (Yeah)
It's 5:3666
Some days  I feel like I let myself down
I love my life  gonna run it in the ground
Can't sleep for days  got your name in my brain (Name in my brain)
It's 5:3666 (Yeah)
It's 5:3666 (Man)
It's 5:3666 (Yeah)
Somebody  tell me why I'm still awake
But my voice couldn't save this home
You're proud of the guns you hold
What's left now? Where can we go?
And for a minute there was no pain
Instead of presidents and old sayings
I heard lyrics from Kurt Cobain
Then I wake up to see the world's ill
Oceans tainted from the oil spills
How many kids have these wars killed?
How many families can't afford bills?
I wish that I could let the world know
That it's okay to let the pain show
And even though times seem bad
It always rains before the rainbow
I screamed at the top of my lungs
But my voice couldn't save this home
You're proud of the guns you hold
What's left now? Where can we go?

(I think we all) We all need a little more love
(I think we all) We all need a little more love
(We just need) A little more love
(The world needs) A little more love (Kells)
In my hood money equals power
And in the world money controls everything we believe in
I can see we're in our darkest hour
'Cause it feels like the government just as crooked as the police
I spent the weekend catching up on the news
A girl committed suicide after she was bullied at school
'Cause some dudes told her she wasn't cool
But you would rather gossip about a famous person breaking the rules
I'm confused
I screamed at the top of my lungs
But my voice couldn't save this home
You're proud of the guns you hold
What's left now? Where can we go?
(I think we all) We all (Just need) need a little more love
(I think we all) We all (Just need) need a little more love
Be scared to dream for the top like they tell you
​But I'm trying to tell you
Fuck what they tell you
(I think we all) ​And in these dark times
​As a part of a generation they claim can't be saved
It's important to know we're not blind
​We see the truth through blue and dark eyes
​And I would rather die on my feet then live on my knees
If I can't live free
A little more love
We just lettin' motherfuckers know we coming
It's real  it's a real motherfuckin' movement
Whether you like it or not
Whether you support it or not
It's a real motherfuckin' movement  man
I am the alpha omega  black flag swinger
Fuck a driveway  I'm in airplane hangars
Me and my gang poppin' champagne like players
For all of them days with no lights and no cable
No one can save you  my city fatal
Make it up out of it  how can they hate you?
C-L-E-V-E-L-A-N-D's the greatEST
I'll light this bitch  I make it look like it's Vegas
The first one to blow since Bone
Thinkin' back when I had a backpack full of fat raps
Didn't no one wanna hear my song
Made it and I never left home
Where I'm from enemies bust off their shells like King Koopa (Bah)
Roll through these streets come up  gone like Bermuda (Uh)
I'm just a boy in the hood like I'm Cuba
So soon as I moved out  I bought me a Ruger
You come to my house  you blow loud as a tuba
I bring your bitch here  she'll go down like a scuba
All of y'all shits out of style like a scooter
Put all of y'all shits in the ditch like a sewer
Make all of y'all bow like my name is Anubis
Talk out your medulla get hit with bazookas  bah

And sleep is its cousin so I shot my bed
Paranoia got me using these meds
Now I'm Smokey as Chris on a Friday like Craig
Retract that statement  I'm stoney as Fred
Evacuate when my homies get mad
You better pray to your God for a blessing
Before they make your world look like Armageddon
Knew I was trouble since I was eleven
Ripped up my jeans and I bought me a leather
My friends saw me as a King like Coretta
My music sounds like the devil
Turn that shit off or get out of my temple
Right after that he go back to his Ketel One vodka
And drink it all up 'til he's mental
I have no issue  I am official
Let them come at me  I practice jiu-jitsu
Only fear two things with three letters  dog
Doctors called up to the news to report to them what they discovered (What they discovered)
Said I'm the first of a species that they call a real motherfucker (Kells)
And I'm sorry if you get a lot of hits from all my followers
If you acknowledge us in any other way the positive
But you shouldn't be hollerin' or talkin' about Superman
When you're living in Metropolis (Woo)
And if you follow astronomy  I'm a Taurus
That means I don't give a fuck what you thought of me
I walk into an interview lookin' like a lobotomy
Flippin' my middle finger at everybody who watchin' us (Uh)
F-f-fuck that  bring the beat back
Kill this instrumental leave the body where the reef at
Sprinkle a little bit on a quarter of my weed sack
My competition on my dick  they like the zip on my denim
What-what-what's your religion?
I wanna know what God you're seein' in a couple of seconds
I wanna see the criticism about my lyricism
When I'm in your face rippin' this rhythm up like cannibalism
It's Kells

EST run shit  you better quit playin'
They start a war if you mention my name
I wrote this song as a message for help
On behalf of anybody findin' their-self
I wrote this letter to numb your pain
'Cause everyday I wake up  I'm feelin' the same
I got issues just like you got issues
I've been hurt  I seen the scar tissue
If I showed you  would you run away?
Do I gotta hide 'em for you to wanna stay?
Do I  even need you? Should I leave you?
Through my heart? Quit tearin' mine apart
But if you can't take me at my worst
You don't deserve me at my best

Until I'm killing everybody like in Auschwitz
Until I'm revolutionary like a Gandhi is
Until I'm poppin' all these bottles to accomplishments

You said goodbye when I was trying to say
Something ain't right inside of me
I wanna run away (I want to run away  run away)  yeah
I don't wanna stay (I don't wanna stay  I don't wanna stay here)
I wish you could relate
I'd wish upon a star— fuck that  leave it up to fate
We are who we are so don't judge me
Just 'cause it's hard to smile
Read between thin white lines
See what's in my mind
I fell in love with a very bad habit
But I was alive for the very first time
You said goodbye when I was trying to say
Something ain't right inside of me
I wanna run away  yeah
Yeah  they're making us crazy
Don't give up on me  baby
Oh  these times are hard
Yeah  they're making us crazy (crazy)
Don't give up on me  baby (baby)
I'm just out here chasing my dreams  girl
But it's crazy cause that dream cost me my Dream Girl
Promised you I wouldn't change before I left
Now I think leaving is the one thing I regret
Cause the one thing I possess
It was you  and without that in my life I'm depressed
You became the new drug I couldn't get
And every time you came over I was on some shit
Either too fucked up  or bitching about how you dress
Even though I remember when you would lay with me when I ain't have a bed
Buy me food and come wake me up with some head
Instead got on that bus and left you blowing in the wind
Shit  and it's fucked up cause every girl I'm with I see your face
Now summers here and I'm sitting outside your place singing this shit

I never thought for a minute if you showed me a picture of my life now  that you wouldn't be in it
Took me a couple years to say I loved you  but I meant it when I said it
Wasn't much of a romantic  but you get it
And we lit it up - shotgunning our kisses
Staring up at all your pictures that you sent me on my birthday
Remember that? Cause I couldn't forget it
Like I forgot yours  but I'm sorry and I said it
I don't know what home is because I'm lost without you
Just like our favorite song  yeah blink-182
Now I just turn it off when it comes on  I wish I hated you
I used to have someone at 3am that I could call
Now it just rings and I don't get nothing at all
Where you at girl?

The pressures of bein’ boss exhausted every bone in my body
I'm so close to the dream that I can't go to sleep
You sat at the table with my daughter
Promisin' you got us right after you finished sayin’ grace
Why don’t you tell her what you're hiding in the bank?
It’s time to cut my lawn and see the snakes
It's time to tell the truth to every fan who doesn't understand
That it's because of you they had to wait
While you left me here to deal with all the hate
I still smile but feel so fake
So much shade I read on one page
I can't even look at your name without gettin' the shakes
And if fate send us both to Heaven

My counselor said I need to find a way to block the pain
I told him it was already too late she is in my veins and he said
Nobody gives me the high that she do
But the way she makes me feel inside that girl can do no wrong
Now all my family hates me since I started fuckin' with her

Left shoe all tattered up from this long journey my feet ache
And my street days are still here
Never changed like I still wear
