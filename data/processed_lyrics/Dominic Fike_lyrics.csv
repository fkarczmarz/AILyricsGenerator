"Colors changing  colors changing
Your scars are thick and your blood is changing
Pigment changing  pigment
Your skin is breaking  your blood is changing
Colors changing  colors
Your scars are thick and your blood is changing
Pigment changing  pigment
Windin' the clock back like it's a ch-ch-ch-chemical imbalance  human nature
Remember everything before you met me
And we were fully in the time machine
Gravity started pulling me inside the seams
Then everything was spinnin' in her dad's garage
And then she was in love and then the plans were small again
Your skin is breaking  your blood is changing
Colors changing  colors changing
Windin' the clock back  it was only a chemical
She took it in the calendar (Changing)
And we were fully in the time machine
Gravity started pulling me inside the seams
Then everything was spinnin' in her dad's garage
And then she was in love and then the plans were small again

 wishing you luck everywhere you go
Under streetlights in the City of Palms
And you can call me names if you call me up
Three nights at the motel
Under streetlights in the City of Palms
And you can call me names if you call me up
Feel like the least of all your problems
Green lights in your body language
Seems like you could use a little company from me
But if you got everything figured out like you say
It's only a matter of time for you-ooh-ooh-ooh to-ooh-ooh-ooh
Three nights at the motel

And you can call me names if you call me up (Call me up)

I can't fix each and all your problems
I'm no good with names and faces
She sent me naked pictures from her neck down to the waist
Her flaws turned into walls and barricades
And I'm too far gone in all the wrong ways
And now every long day is a bad one
I can't make you call or make you stay or take you off the pedestal
I'm up too late thinkin' 'bout you in MIA for
Three nights at the motel
Under streetlights in the City of Palms
And you can call me names if you call me up (Call me up)
Three nights at the motel
Under streetlights in the City of Palms
A flower across your chest
A tear on a smile as you pray to a sky
But it won't bring back your breath
You know it isn't the love that you wish for
That you were misinformed as a child
'Cause everything in those beautiful stories
Was only a part of the lie
That told you every tongue that you kissed was a royal
And you know that your godmother flies
And it all seems so important
'Til you're drifting off at night
And the weight of your eyes and your face when you cry
Make the days you were young seem ages ago
Four-by-four
You build your own life story
Build your own life story
Build your own

A million miles and a year went by
And you still can't find your breath

'Cause you knew everything in the stories
Were only a part of a lie
And the weight of your eyes and your face when you cry

And I treat it like life or death
Won't do twenty-five to life just for killing time with me

Somebody tied you to an ant pile (Ant pile)

We went to high school (Uh-huh)
And on the first day (First day)
You pushed me up against the brick wall (Brick wall)
You pushed me up against the locker (Locker)
Said let's get home before your mom does (Uh-huh)
Know what your mom does (Uh-huh)
She takes a different lover every day
She threw her wedding ring away
Sometime around eighth grade remember our bodies were changing
You looked at me different
And held me like you missed me
We started to feel different
And that was when you kissed me

What's the worst thing to happen next evening?
The higher-ups will tell you what you can't eat
I've seen you fall to pieces
Seen you completely naked
There's no more ways you can surprise me
Since you looked at me different
And held me like you missed me
We started to feel different
And that was when you kissed me
I bought two bottles of red
Unless you made reservations
Oh look  you thought all ahead''
Takin’ up all the space beside ya
And you took a day out of your work life
Said you'll find a way to make it work right
Love it when you bite  bite
She said '’I dressed in your favorite
I bought two bottles of red

All of your clothes are bound  they’re physical
Articles float around my living room
Mix up your soul with mine tonight

I remember waking up with shawty on the couch
I had no money (Mhm  mhm)
And when they locked me up  she never listened to her friend
They told her  Move on movin' on (Mhm)
And now she tells that same bitch  ''My shoes Prada
My boo bought ’em  I do love him''
You know them bitches mad as fuck
I let my smile show 'til these bitches had enough
She let her mind roam 'cause she know I got it covered
And that's simple enough  I guess
She said  ''I dressed in your favorite
I bought two bottles of red
Unless you made reservations
Waitin' on calls  flippin' through stations
I'm outclassed and it's outrageous (Ooh)
And I'll take it all  babydoll
Whatever's been weighin' you down (Eeh)
Find me on Miami concrete
My mama had her issues but I miss her anyway
Please don't call me for the wrong reasons
We both know exactly what I'm thinkin'
Weeks pass and I never grow tired
'Cause I never said never and I barely ever lie
I'm on the road to an original place in outer space
I didn't make it up  but you can't find it on a phone or a globe
And I can take you with me if you really wanna go
And I can't move on  babydoll
Waitin' on calls  flippin' through stations
I'm outclassed and it's outrageous (Ooh)
And I'll take it all  babydoll
Where everyone that knows you wants to take you on a date
Not 'cause you're lookin' good  or actin' like a fake
But 'cause you got it all figured out in the end
I think I'm batshit crazy  or maybe you're just stupid
I took my shit out on you  don't get arrested
Or roll up that domestic  it would be catastrophic
And we've all had enough of it
I'm goin' through six months of it
Not exactly in love with it (Ooh  hey)
Take a break  rollin' through outer space
Where everyone that knows you wants to take you on a date
Not 'cause you're lookin' good  or actin' like a fake
But 'cause you got it all figured out in the end
Don't complain 'bout anything
You know how fortunate you are
And I hope you don't hesitate
To tell me your feelings (How fortunate you are)

What's a bad day when she's with me two four
I was on time right before she moved on
And apart from the fights we had and nights that gone bad
I miss the old days and I wish she did too
One time for all of your bodies from college
One more for every boy that came beforе me
Sometimes I gеt so dramatic

We settle  but it never felt right 'cause we can't keep still

There was a movement in the sky this morning
The clouds tore open and it started storming
On me  looking at the roof in this broke apartmеnt
Watch in case the walls start closing on me
I usеd to have an old beat black guitar
I used to sleep in all of these trashy cars
I used to make the beat and spit the rap in the closet
Before anybody cared who the rapper was
And now my food got no taste
And my room got no space
And my head got so big
Don't remember who you is  dawg
Don't remember when it switched but

I felt a hole in my soul this evening
I thought it would be different after I left treatment
I stood up to a demon
Mama  you shoulda seen it
Remember back when Alex had no front teeth?

Remember back when it was the four of us like ghostbusters?
Remember that?

Now it's mostly politics
Now I work on holidays
Now I'm worth all kinda things
Now kids pin me up in living rooms in they mama's place
Man  I moved out my mama's place
And then I bought my mama place
Then I replaced my mama with a white bitch from the palisades
I would break promises that I would make to my favorite people
I'd cheat on my favorite bitch and then I would lie through my teeth
You remember when Alex had no front teeth?
I don't remember shit
I don't have a good memory
Yeah
That's what you have? Like flashes
What about babyhood  do you have any babyhood shit in the back of your head?
Like  I don't remember nothing as a toddler
Do you remember like? No? I figured as much  so you got my memory
What's your earliest memory? Any?
Um
What house do you remember? What's your first house you remember?
'Cause I don't even remember

Scary watchin' it wearin' off on me so fast
Last night  it was bad
She asked me come back and then I said
No problem  I'll send my location
She hit me four times  I was in the whip before I knew it

What's worse to you? Oh-oh
What's worse?
Mmm
What's worse  the carry or the curse?
She was paired with a maniac and married on the first
It was much worse than anyone could tell
But he couldn't stick it out so he ended up in jail
It was eight months and twenty-seven days
And when he got out  he told her  We should go our separate ways
And the whole world learned about a tape he had recorded
They gavе a bunch of money to the maniac  a fortune
What's worsе  the lonely or the fame?
He got everything he wanted and now everything's the same
Much worse when he was back in jail
But the feeling wasn't different so he really couldn't tell
'Til the girl showed up and changed it
She had braids in her hair  old age in her stare
But she came to a realization
That his heart was in love but his brain wasn't there  and then

And he did the same shit with the same exact drugs

But he came to a realization

Slow enough to watch 'em rise off your skin  oh

When everything keeps turning when I close my eyes
And half the world's awake under a different sky
I tried to tell you  babe
Plastic people  plastic scissors
Cut the heads off my action figures
Playin' with fire  burnin' bridges
Melt like plastic into liquid
I tried to tell you  babe
All of her skirts went past her ankles
Pitch-black  no TV on after nine
She picked the phone up and she wrapped the cable on her finger
And I spoke gently
And then I tried to pretend to hold her against me
