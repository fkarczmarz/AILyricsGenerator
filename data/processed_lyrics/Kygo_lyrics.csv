"There's a price tag
Do you see how
You're holding me down
They say
Don't let the player hate the game
But the player has the power all the same
They don't want you to know
That you're choosing where the money goes
It's funny that they're playing with their ace
But the King controls our fate
So hold Him close if you wanna play
Or you'll end up in someone else's game
Seems to be the lonely
Dreams is what you sold me
But do you really want to know?
Seems to be that baby
The seeds that you sold me
You don't want to see them grow

Dreams is what you sold me
But do you really want to know?
Seems to be that baby
The seeds that you sold me
You don't want to see them grow
Only the open hearts survive
We're standing on the outside
We're all for love
A love for all
I'll fight for us
And take the fall
How can I make you see no one's the enemy?
How can I make you see this could be heavenly?
We're all for love
We're all for love
We're all for love
Only love is gonna sеt us free
Only love will be the rеmedy

Could you carry me?

Like a flag after a war
When you're gone or when you're first born
Could you carry me?
Could you carry me?
Cause I don't know how we
So I need to know
Could you carry me?
Back into your heart again
Could you carry me?
Right into your distant hands
Could you carry me?

Remember when we would dance all night
Parking lots and velvet skies
I was there for you
And you were there for me
Every time we would start a fight
We'd make love till the morning light
I was there for you
And you were there for me
So I don't know how we
So I need to know
Could you carry me?
Back into your heart again
Could you carry me?
Right into your distant hands
Could you carry me?
Right back to where we started from
Could you carry me?
Back to where we started from
Back to where we started from
We'll never be so young
Checking wishes  shock on kisses
Tripping off my tongue
See I'm giving up the fire
They said it was too late for us
But we are coming back to life
A little every time we touch
I wanna run away tonight
I feel like I'm in love with you
Tomorrow we can face the lie
Right now  let's just

Open windows  all four fingers
Dancing on the wind
My heart's thumping  goosebumping

My strength in days gone mad
But I spent my time in shallow sheets
I should've seen your hand
I didn't see the signs
Was blinded by the lights
And lost where I belong
I thought that we'd grow old
Give kids our bad advice
Now I'm alone
You went and left me with these sleepless nights
You took my warmth and soul
Left me with doubt and cold
Is this where I belong?
Gone are the days of young
Better run for cover
There's no one here to save you from yoursеlf
And you'll discover it's hard

We're watching  watching as the credits all roll down
And crying  crying  you know we're playing to a full house  house
No heroes  villains  one to blame
While wilted roses fill the stage
And the thrill  the thrill is gone
Our debut was a masterpiece
But in the end  for you and me
Oh  the show  it can't go on
We used to have it all  but now's our curtain call
So hold for the applause  oh
And wave out to the crowd  and take our final bow

But I'm just looking out for you tonight
We used to run around this ghost town
Always thinking out loud
Are we gonna get out?
I remember
We dream of places that we could go
Castles with the strange glow
People that we don't know
I remember
We left a life
That's ordinary from the start
We looked for stranger things
'Cause that's just who we are
Found me the edge of something beautiful and loud
Like I'm picturing now
Castles glitter under Spanish skies
But I'm just looking out for you tonight
Snow white mountains in a foreign state
Tell me someday we'll get there

Someday
I see a Technicolor shadow
Underneath your window
Just in case you don't know
I can see it
You cast an unfamiliar day glow
Different than what I know
Shining like a halo
I can feel it
We turned our back on ordinary from the start
We looked for stranger things
'Cause that's just who we are
Found me the edge of something beautiful and loud
Show me the sky falling down
Castles glitter under Spanish skies
But I'm just looking out for you tonight
Snow white mountains in an ancient place
Tell me someday we'll get there

My eyes are heavy and I need some sun
Nothing can keep me from you
Nothing can keep me from you
Something 'bout the things you told me
I took on with me to the place we found
And I'll be waiting for you
I follow the moon
From the dark to the break of dawn
We let it loose
Smoking weed and writing songs
Call my name
'Cause I'm so lost and I don't know this place
And I got this feeling that I just can't shake
Nothing can keep me from you
