lyrics
"And the truth out there is cold
And nothing to keep you warm
Jealousy and lies within me
And I gotta know right now
I stop myself and look to the sky
The only truth is in the sky
Nobody else can tell 'cause I'm stuck in a spell
Of greed and anger and hate
But it comes right back
Creeps up on me and it hits me double time
This can't be my fate
It's never too late
I wake up holding on to this pain
And there's nothing else I can do
But to give myself up to the sky
And why not me when you're down on your knees
You don't need no faster car
Or no bigger house
All you really need is friends and love (To the sky)
Just throw up your heart
You might also like
I'm comin' home
Come on home
Some say that your behavior is preposterous
You’re just an imaginary friend
Dangerous to my pursuit of happiness
Trouble’s bound to get me in the end
You got your cure for anxious
You got your pill for bad
But your fancy shoes and handbag
Can’t help you when you’re sad
Cause There ain’t no hat for that
Ain’t no hat for that
There ain’t no hat for that
Ain’t no hat for that
Some say her temperament’s obstreperous
She’s only nice when something is at stake
And speaking for her friends there is a cost to us
We pay the price for riding in that wake
You might also like
Shopping for your superficial treasures
Stopping short of offering your heart
Stranger to the simplest of pleasures
Distance is to you a work of art
Ain’t no hat for that
Ain’t no hat for that
There ain’t no hat for that
They don't mean a thing
And all the words spoken before this
Won't be said again
Suddenly so much of me has
No need to pretend
There's nothing like the truth
To bring her back to you
And everyone I've met before this
Ain't seen me with you
You're the only one who knows what I go through
And I don't know how I ever got by without you
There's nothing like the truth
When you've got nothing left to lose
And every night I thank the universe that I found you
You might also like
And I don't have to wonder
What the world thinks about me
And if we all explode
But I just hope the pieces of my soul
Reach out to you to find my angel

There’s a black tar cloud all because of me

There’s a black tar cloud (black tar)
All because of me (911)
(Tell ‘em the truth)
You’re packing up quickly  the baby’s at grandma's
The raging coast is far from clear (truth)
You’re yelling and screaming and smacking me
How could you do this? You spoiled little rich kid (truth)
A rock in the TV
You bashin' my ride up  you smashed my guitar
(Tell ‘em the truth)
Chasing me around the house
Swinging trying to hit me with my favorite golf club (truth)
You revved up the car
You smashed through the gate
I ran up the street (truth)
I waited an hour to cool off
When I came back it was too late (truth)
You were lying in bed (truth)
Said you took twenty pills (truth)
Now I’m calling the ambulance  police
I’m freakin' out till you said  Chill baby
I didn't really take them pills
I’m just desperately crying for help

Good morning manipulation and control

Or put fire in your eyes
Or give you a chance to fly
When you need the wings
When all that you've got is doubt
And nothing can stop you from feeling down
I know exactly how you feel
But can you believe now
When you're on your knees now
Begging and pleading now
Can you believe
When all that you've got is doubt
And no one to pull you out
When your heart is slowing down

And no other medicine or promise is
Gonna heal me up right
But I got to believe
That her and me
Will be together

Man  it hurts to see a cop kill a black man alert
News flash  police shoot blacks  distort facts
Quick attack  unarmed men  murder them
It's captured on cellphone video and they still let 'em go
When will they stop killin' 'em? Askin' why is they killin' for?
White man with a gun apprehended  he still alive
Black man with a gun  he has no chance to survive
They gon' shoot him dead soon as they see the brown of his eyes
And they ask me  Why you ain't smilin' Nas?
Cause I have a son and I die inside when I gotta tell him what was told to me
Can't play with your water gun son 'cause the police see
A seven years old as a threat
They think it's right to kill a seven years old on sight 'cause he ain't white
So baby if I'm actin' uptight
When our conversation is weak  it ain't you
It's just it ain't that deep
We could be everything  everything that we ever needed
Everything that we ever wanted to be  we could still be
It ain't that deep  it ain't that deep

If you look in my mind  I don't wanna spend a lifetime for it
It's alright  I don't want to play this over
Living in a world I can't explain
It ain't that deep  we ain't gotta lose sleep baby
We could be everything  everything that we ever needed
Everything that we ever wanted to be  we could still be
It ain't that deep  it ain't that deep
Tell the truth  was it you? What do you want from me?
Is it you? Are we fools? What do you want from me?
I was in love with you  what do you want from me?

In your eyes  I don't wanna stop the fire burnin'
If you look in my mind  I don't wanna see your wheels keep turnin'
It's alright  I don't want to play this over
When I know that you're the one for me
It ain't that  that  that...
Suspicion got you livin' in your own prison
You need to leave that alone
Before you sittin' in an old folk's home alone with no visits
So exquisite but mess it up when you're tone's risen
And any day when you don't get your way
Gettin' mad at everything I say
And you don't think it's an emergency
A toupee wearin' liar's tryna run the U.S.A
You makin' our lives harder  you're like the argument queen
There's women out here going hard doing positive things
Slam dunkin' in games  directing movies like Selma
World's startin' to change and you actin' the same
'Cause you don't even see what I see in you
Next female president could even be you
Bringing' kids in the world that we gotta teach
Just give me good sex and give me peace
It ain't that deep  it ain't that deep
(Nah shawty)
We could be everything  everything that we ever needed
Everything that we ever wanted to be  we could still be
 and everything would be alright
 yeah
 and no one would stop me from drinking my wine
 I'd let things go by
 she'd appear right by me
 that's my dreamworld
 there's no need to cry
 the world just treat my wife right

The lights from above seemed to shine on only you
And you made me feel like I was fly
When I made you sparkle in your eyes
We ain’t even 20 baby
I ain’t learned to love you right yet
Good thing I thought I was the shit back then
I sang in your ear cause I wanted you to know
That I had soul baby
I called you all the time
I guess I tried too hard to make you mine
You'd have nothing to do with me baby
Thank God that you changed your mind
For the rest of my life you know I wanna be yours
For the rest of my life you know I wanna be yours
For the rest of my life for you I’m gonna be strong
Baby will you stay
Baby will you stay
Baby will you stay
Baby will you stay mine
Finally convinced you to come over and just say hi
I sang Forever My Lady and kissed you for the very first time
Normally I’d be playing basketball or something like that in the park
Then I messed up like boys tend to do
It’d be a year till I got back with you
Thank God that you called me back baby
Cause I’d never be the man that I am today

You said you were at home alone

Keep love alive
Good thing for you I stole my daddy’s car
Cause no one’s ever gonna love you baby
Better than I do
How could I have ever belonged?
Pushed you right out of my world
I know that you and I have tried very hard to find a different result
But how can we be patient when we're always racin'
And no one’s ever there to hold
Any time you need a friend baby
I will be the one that you want
And if you're ever down and out baby
I will be there biggin' you up
And you can lean on me anytime baby
For anything you want and need
Oh I don't need a reason
Memory or a season
It's longer than always could be
And farther than the eyes can see

2. The basis of the Gaye defendants' claims is that Blurred Lines and Got To Give It Up feel or sound the same. Being reminiscent of a sound is not copyright infringement. The intent in producing Blurred Lines was to evoke an era. In reality  the Gaye defendants are claiming ownership of an entire genre  as opposed to a specific work  and Bridgeport is claiming the same work.
3. The reality is that the songs themselves are starkly different. Since that is the salient factor in a claim for copyright infringement  in the face of the threats of defendants to commence lawsuits  plaintiffs must seek declaratory relief from this Court that confirms plaintiffs' unfettered right to exploit Blurred Lines free of defendants' claims.
JURISDICTION AND VENUE
4. This action is brought  and this Court has subject matter jurisdiction  pursuant to 28 U.S.C. Sections 1331  1338 and 2201. This Court has federal question jurisdiction in this matter in that plaintiffs seek a declaration of rights under the Copyright Act of 1976  17 U.S.C. § 101 et seq.

Three  four  she locked the door
I keep knocking and knocking and knocking and knocking

She was born in Paris at the age of 21
Love knew her  but she didn’t know love
Love didn’t hear her when she cried  love didn’t stand by her side
On the most important nights  oh yeah
But now she’s flying high you can’t hurt her no more
Now she’s locked the door cause you broke the key
And she got a bright smile on her face now that she got that little
Taste
She just wants more  she just wants more
She locked the door
(I kept trying to tell you you were pushing me too far)
She locked the door
(I kept trying to warn you you were slowly breaking my heart)
She locked the door
(I kept giving you all I had but you took way too much)
(And I don’t know what this is but I know this ain’t love)
