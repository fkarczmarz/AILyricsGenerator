Surrounded by bad bitches and my dogs

On a field trip to the bando

Ain't no way I'm killin' myself
If I'm thinking suicide
It must be them phantom doors
Your boy 'bout bringing toys out
Maybe they should call me Santa Claus
Picture me Cobain-ing  Belushi cocaine-ing
Why would I go blaming or even stoop to go naming?
Proclaiming shorty the reason
I'm thinking of trigger squeezing
I'm cold as winter season
Be cool as autumn breezes
I do what I pleases

I wanna lose
But she brighten up my day when I see her (When I see her)
Then she turn right back around and be a cheater
Them sexy lips and them sexy hips
They make me come back
We fight at day and sex at night
And I'm loving that

Well this ah di big bod Nicki Minaj (Kingston!)

I was just a player in the game of love
'Til she came and turned mi tables around
Stacking up mi chips lining up all mi cars
Still they all came tumbling down
Take them stealin' me up on the run
If love is the beat she’s the stead of my drum
Love was just a word 'til I bought me a ballah
Oh you everything for holding me down
I'm tellin all my homies that mi find mi a queen
In the jungle so you facing the crowd
Take them stealin' me up on the run
If love is the beat she’s the stead of my drum
I'mma go bonkers I'mma go crazy
I'mma get reckless and have a baby
Then hang the baby off of the balcony

And let me know if it's a problem 'cause we late-night creepin'

Tought to be a hustla
Mommy gone gotta stick together
Stay strong through the stormy weather
