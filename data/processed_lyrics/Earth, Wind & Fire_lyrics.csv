lyrics
"We were young and we knew
In our eyes  we're alive
Deep inside  we knew our love was true
For awhile  we paid no mind to the past
We knew love would last
Every night  something right
Would invite us to begin the day
Something happened along the way
What used to be happy is sad
Something happened along the way
And yesterday was all we had
How could you lead me on
And not let me stay around?
What used to be right is wrong
Can love that's lost be found?
For awhile  to love each other with all
We would ever need
Love was strong for so long
Never knew that what was wrong
We tried to find what we had
'Til sadness was all we shared
We were scared
This affair would lead our love in two

We never spend time talking to ya
So we figured we'd lay it on ya
Let you know how we feel about love
Hmm  paint a pretty smile each day
Lovin' is a blessing  yeah
Never let it fade away
It's all 'bout love  yeah
Build yourself a true romance
Beauty that surround you
You deserve just one more chance
My dear  my dear  mm

Pretty smile will always say
My dear  yeah
We want to take this moment
To run down a couple of things
About things we see everyday
Now  I want you to stop
Whatever you're doing
Just stop
'Cause I'm gonna rap to you
You know  they say there's beauty
In the eyes of the beholder  you know
Which I say is a natural fact
Because you are as beautiful
As your thoughts  right on?
You know  like with us  for instance
You know like  we study all kinds of occult sciences
And astrology and mysticism and world religion
And so forth  you dig?
All these things help
Because they give you an insight
To your inner self
Have mercy
Now  there's an outer self we got to deal with  you know?
The one that like to go to parties
One that like to dress up and be cool
And look pretty  on ego-trips and all this
You gotta love you
Gotta learn all the beautiful things around you
The trees and the birds
And if there ain't no beauty
You gotta make some beauty
Have mercy
Listen to me  y'all
Feel it... feel it
Feel it (talkin' about beauty)
Yeah-eah-ay!
Yeah  yeah  yay-ee-yay-ee!
Ah!
Ahh  with the feelin' (gotta make you believe)

Time is right for you tonight
Find your place among the broad day light
Is be ever wonderful in your own sweet way
Time is right in your life tonight
May not be as you see
Is be ever wonderful in your own sweet way
Don't let the world change your mind
Dance  boogie wonderland
Midnight creeps so slowly into hearts of men
Who need more than they get
Daylight deals a bad hand to a woman
Who has laid too many bets
The mirror stares you in the face
And says Baby  uh  uh  it don't work
You say your prayers though you don't care
You dance and shake the hurt
Dance  boogie wonderland  hah  hah

I chase my vinyl dreams to boogie wonderland
I find romance when I start to dance in boogie wonderland

One glowing look upon a ragged canvas
Tells the story of our past and our present situation
That old bush just keeps on burning
Shares the hope of future learning
Nobody seems to show they're learning
That old bush just keeps on burning
And I wonder will we ever feel the flame?
This way of life on total exhibition
Shows the way in which we live of an impatient nation
Share a little love to improve our situation
That old bush just keeps on burning
Nobody seems to show they're learning
Flow of light could really stand a listen
Bring the dark to the light
Show what we've been missing
Not many men are satisfied
Gonna shout it from the mountaintop this evenin'
Will we ever feel the flame?
There's gonna come a time
Things that's on your mind
Judgement you will find
Planted right in your mind
True love is here to find
Simple as the number 9
Multiply you will find
Peace and love all the time
Peace and love all the time
Peace and love all the time

And were meant to stay
Nations bloom today
On gifts of yesterday
Born of the Earth are nature's children
Fed by the Wind  the breath of life
Judged by the Fiery hands of God
World moves by the hand of the master plan
Can't you understand you're but a grain of sand?
Do you need a guide to make you feel satisfied?

Born of the Earth are nature's children
Fed by the Wind  the breath of life
Judged by the Fiery hands of God

Shining down on this great beyond
Then turn your face to the wind
And taste his love within
You'll find a friend
Everlasting love you can depend
Our spirits perpetuate
Our spirits meditate love and faith
We must make our brother see
That the light is he
Shining on you and me
And the land he gave
Roads we must pave
Looking through each other's eyes
Humanity will rise
In love

And our spirits
Spaces near and far
Calling out who you are
And smiling in the night
Stars hide from the rain
It turns against the pain
Fooling many in the game
While smiling in the night
I can feel the dark
Take the night apart
But then the stars come out
To lift my heart
Believing there's a star for everyone
Makes it easier to recall
There's a star smiling for us all
Cultivating my desire
Graceful in the sky

It's crazy if you think we're just friends
Loving when infatuation ends
You sigh when I come close to your heart
You cry from the start
Please wait for me
Your mind shows places you go
And things you don't know
Someday you will grow
Climbing a mountain high
Love I desire
Inside my heart cries for you
I never felt this way
It's crazy if you think we're just friends
Loving when infatuation ends (Infatuation)
I know the wait will end
I know the wait will end
Would you mind if I said
How I felt tenderly tonight again?
'Cause I never ever (Never felt)
Love has found its way
Would you mind if I looked in your eyes
Till I'm satisfied once again?
'Cause I never ever felt (Ever felt)
Love has found its way (Oh)
Let love steal us away
Holding charts to guide us through the storm
You and I will be together
From a past that's lived too many lies
All that I can see
You and I living together
You and I groovin' forever
Trusting every word
Just to mean what has been handed down in time
We've known hurt before
Masters of my dreams
Create a place to feel this love of mine
Never hurt no more
You and I will be together
From a past that's lived too many lies
All that I can see
You and I groovin' forever
We must trust the dark
For showing us the stars
We must trust the rain
And open up our hearts
Just you and I living together
You and I groovin' forever
You and I living together
There is a mirror in her eyes
All the world with cherry painted skies
I would be a fool not to notice who
Could make me want to give it all
And love has got a hold
I know that love won't let me fall
You light the way  you brighten up my day
You make me want to stay
I guess you know that I'm in love with you
It's true  you changed my point of view
And now I look at life the way you do
When I am true with my dreams
Life is so sincere in what it means
I am truly hypnotized
With a love that took me by surprise
I would be a fool not to notice who
Could make me want to give it all
I need your love around
To open up this lonely heart
You make me want to stay
I guess you know that I'm in love with you
It's true  you changed my point of view
And now I look at life the way you do
With a beauty shining through
You light the way  you brighten up my day
You make me want to stay
I guess you know that I'm in love with you
It's true  you changed my point of view
You make it all seem right"
