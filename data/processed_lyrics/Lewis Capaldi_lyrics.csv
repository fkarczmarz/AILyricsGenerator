lyrics
"Dressed in all the clothes I had on
When yesterday decided I didn't need to fight with
The hours and the seconds no more
Doing all the things that I'm supposed to
Working every day the way that most do
Smiling while I'm hiding what I'm going through
That  if I'm being honest
I couldn't tell you this is all I wanted
I struggle sleeping 'cause the house feels haunted
Filled with the shadows of regret and the things I should've said
I'm terrified that all my youth is fading
Man  growing old is so excruciating
Is there a cure for minds unwell? 'Cause my head's a living hell
If I'm honest with myself
Second seems to struggle to find
A solitary reason to continue seeking
Any use in walking this line
You might also like
Doing all the things that I'm supposed to
Working every day the way that most do
Smiling while I'm hiding what I'm going through
That  if I'm being honest
I couldn't tell you this is all I wanted
I struggle sleeping 'cause the house feels haunted
Filled with the shadows of regret and the things I should've said
I'm terrified that all my youth is fading
Man  growing old is so excruciating
Is there a cure for minds unwell? 'Cause my head's a living hell
If I'm honest with myself
So  how am I supposed to see an end
To my all-consuming  constant fear and dread
When I can't even seem to make it out of bed?
Yeah  if I'm being honest
I couldn't tell you this is all I wanted
I struggle sleeping 'cause the house feels haunted
Filled with the shadows of regret and the things I should've said
I'm terrified that all my youth is fading
Man  growing old is so excruciating
Is there a cure for minds unwell? 'Cause my head's a living hell
I'm drowning my head till I figure it out
And you're not hard to find
I guess I fell short
Almost had it all
We were so close
The closest I've been
When you're looking for love
Maybe I'll be
All I'll ever be
'Cause I don't feel half as whole without you holding on to me
I don't wanna face the thought of letting go
When holding on is all I've ever known
I don't get tired somehow
Laying wide awake 'til I figure it out
Sleep's so hard to find
'Cause I'm still seeing your shadow when I close my eyes

I guess I fell short
Almost had it all

The closest I've gone
When you're looking for love
Maybe I'll be
All I'll ever be
'Cause I don't feel half as whole without you holding on to me
I don't wanna face the thought of letting go
When holding on is all I've ever known
It's not gonna be you
Can't pull you through
If it's not gonna be you
I can't pull you through
Maybe I'll be
All I'll ever be
'Cause I don't feel half as whole without you holding on to me
I don't wanna face the thought of letting go
A beautiful mind I can't forget
Knew from the moment that we met I'd take you home
Have all of your feelings disappeared?
'Cause I'm in no kind of frame of mind to let you go
'Cause I've been so low
And the weight of all the world's a heavy load
Keep me going till tomorrow
'Cause I just don't know if I can face another day alone
And my heart don't beat
And I can't believe in any kind of life without you here
And I can't move on
'Cause it feels so wrong
Are there any words that I could say?
I'm feeling our moment fade away

'Cause I just don't know
If I can face another day alone
And my heart don't beat
And I can't believe in any kind of life without you here
And I can't move on
'Cause it feels so wrong
The carousel of my constant pain
I'm not sure that I can hold on anymore
Became a victim of circumstance
Should've said when I had the chance
I don't want any kind of life without you here
 but I was just kidding myself
Since my love up and got lost on me
And every breath that I've been taking
Since you left feels like a waste on me
I've been holding on to hope
That you'll come back when you can find some peace
'Cause every word that I've heard spoken
Since you left feels like a hollow street
I've been told  I've been told to get you off my mind
But I hope I never lose the bruises that you left behind
There must be something in the water
'Cause every day  it's getting colder
And if only I could hold you
You'd keep my head from going under
Maybe I  maybe I'm just being blinded
By the brighter side
Of what we had because it's over
Well  there must be something in the tide

I've been told  I've been told to get you off my mind
But I hope I never lose the bruises that you left behind

You'd keep my head from going under
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
It's your love I'm lost in
Your love I'm lost in
Your love I'm lost in
And I'm tired of being so exhausted
Your love I'm lost in
Your love I'm lost in
Your love I'm lost in
Even though I'm nothing to you now
Even though I'm nothing to you now
There must be something in the water
'Cause every day  it's getting colder
And if only I could hold you
You'd keep my head from going under
There must be something in the water
'Cause every day  it's getting colder
And if only I could hold you
This all too well familiar pain
It comes and it goes
For falling in love with you
When I had nothing left to lose
And nothing more I could give
Went down with your sinking ship
Now I don't think I'll make it through
Through
Now it's only the beat of my heart
That reminds me not to stare at the sparks
Can't set fire to my soul just to keep ya
Keep ya
Keep ya from burning alone
Our salvation's slipping further away
Can't set fire to my soul just to keep ya
Keep ya
Keep ya from burning alone

Forget evеrything we've come to еxpect
It only serves to further fuck with our heads
And I don't wanna pretend
We could put this to bed for good
Can call it quits or risk sinking with this broken ship
But I don't think we'd make it through
Through
Now it's only the beat of my heart
That reminds me not to stare at the sparks
Can't set fire to my soul just to keep ya
Keep ya
Keep ya from burning alone
Our salvation's slipping further away
Can't set fire to my soul just to keep ya
Keep ya
Keep ya from burning alone
I wish I could stay
I wish I could lie
Do whatever it takes to get you through the night
I can't be the one
I can't take the fall
Can't go up in the flames to keep your body warm
Now it's only the beat of my heart
That reminds me not to stare at the sparks
Can't set fire to my soul just to keep ya
Keep ya
Keep ya from burning alone
Our salvation's slipping further away
Can't set fire to my soul just to keep ya
Keep ya
Broken and scarred
Thought we were finished
And yet here we are
Stuck in the same place
Despite what we overcame
When will it come to an end?
'Cause the price we pay
Left a mark that stains
And I don't think I'll ever be the same
We might've kept the black at bay
But all around it still remains
Lord only knows for evermore
What horizons hold for us in store
Looks like there's no way around
But I know I'll try somehow
At least it's all gone quiet for now
Tomorrow don't mean much
In the waters we wade
And my secrets are waiting for me
When I get to my grave

Looks like there's no way around
But I know I'll try somehow
Too tired to tell you I ain't coming home
Stop for a second
Guess I got caught up in leading you on
And I ain't responsible for the lump in your throat
Haven't you had enough of all of this?
Haven't you had enough of loneliness?
Don't get me wrong  I'd love to stay too long
Don't get me wrong  I'd love to tell you whatever you want
But haven't you had enough of loneliness?
And haven't we had enough of second best?
So don't get me wrong
Innocent then
Way back before we knew how to pretend
Picking up where we left
It ain't meant to be easy  shouldn't be hard as this
And I ain't responsible for letting this go
Haven't you had enough of all of this?
Haven't you had enough of loneliness?

Don't get me wrong
I just don't wanna be the devil you know
It hurts the most when you come too close
Don't get me wrong  I'd love to stay too long
Don't get me wrong  I'd love to tell you whatever you want
But haven't you had enough of loneliness?
Haven't we had enough of second best?
When we're always a heart attack away from falling in love
Running near on empty
I wish somebody would've told me
That I'd end up so caught up in need of your demons
That I'd be lost without you leading me astray
Guess that I'm a fool for the way that you caught me
But don't fade away
And when I'm just about to pass the point of it all
You come ripping all the air from out of my lungs
And now it's so hard to breathe
I wish somebody would've told me
That I'd end up so caught up in need of your demons
That I'd be lost without you leading me astray
Guess that I'm a fool for the way that you caught me

Guess I'm such a fucking fool for the way that you caught me
But don't fade away
Don't fade away
Divinely uninspired to a hellish extent
When my heart stops beating
Will it all be in vain?
It burns a little faith every time it'll fall
Looking for reconciliation with the years that I've lost
I've been falling for miles down for a while
And back again
It's only calm for a while now in the eye of the hurricane
I only wanna feel safe
Can't dig my heels in the ground
I only wanna be free
And make my family proud
And I hope I figure it out
Getting used to prying eyes to my faith I resign
Guess it's the classic roll of pay for trying to step out of line
I've been falling for miles down for a while
And back again
It's only calm for a while now in the eye of the hurricane
I only wanna feel safe
Can't dig my heels in the ground
I only wanna be free
And make my family proud
Don't wanna make no mistake
For fear of letting you down
I only wanna be free
And make my family proud
And I hope I figure it out

I hope I figure it out
 here we are  back in Hanover '99
 as beautiful as ever
 nobody said that it would last forever
 remember
 cold coffee on the table
 I would if I was able
 it stings a little
 I don't remember calling
 it does the talking
 nobody said that it would last forever
 remember
 they'll never
 remember
 you're not gone
 I'll take all the vitriol
 I hate to know I made you cry
 it'd still wreck me
 babe
 babe
 I'll take all the vitriol
 I hate to know I made you cry
 it'd still wreck me
 I hate to know I made you cry
 it'd still wreck me
I fell victim to the sound of your love
You're like a song that I ain't ready to stop
I got nothing but you on my mind
I'm not ready to be just another of your mistakes
Don't wanna let the pieces fall out of place
I was only just a breath removed from going to waste
Till I found salvation in the form of your—

A little more soul and let me know
When you feel that fire get a little less cold
Just let me know
I burned my bones getting closer than I've been before
I found myself diving headfirst through a closing door
I fall in love but I can't find a way to make it stay
It's always half the world away
Girl  you know I've always been the same
I'm a runaway
And I've never been sure
If I'll ever want more
I'm a runaway
I burned my bones getting closer than I've been before
I found myself diving headfirst through a closing door
I fall in love but I can't find a way to make it stay
It's always half the world away
I sold my soul just so I could right a wrong
I lost all hope in the road that we were walking on
I fall in love but I can't find a way to make it stay
It's always half the world away

I hope there's love  hope there's love
Left there in your heart

I found myself diving headfirst through a closing door
I fall in love but I can't find a way to make it stay
It's always half the world away
I sold my soul just so I could right a wrong
I lost all hope in the road that we were walking on
I fall in love but I can't find a way to make it stay
It's always half the world away
I burned my bones getting closer than I've been before
I found myself diving headfirst through a closing door
I fall in love but I can't find a way to make it stay
And when the going's tough  you're way too hard on yourself
I wish you'd open up  and I'd lend a little to help
Before you dive off the deep end
Will you hold me? like you want me?
But you don't give me nothin' else
Feel this happening  but you feel absent
Can you tell me what it is?
And she said this
Haven't you ever been in love before?
You heard 'em say  it takes the pain away
And it's a feelin' that you can't ignore
But it's more like a knife to me than a high to mе
And my heart can't fall apart anymore
If you knew what I  knеw you'd be terrified
Haven't you ever been in love before?
If we don't work it out  that's something I could accept
But I feel you're ruling out  a love that ain't happened yet
And maybe I'm a fool  but I just can't live with regret
I'd rather dive off the deep end

If you knew what I  knew you'd be terrified
Haven't you ever been in love before?
Well  we could be falling
Falling
There's nothing I want more than all that you got
'Cause I'm falling
And she said this
Haven't you ever been in love before?
You heard 'em say  it takes the pain away
And it's a feelin' that you can't ignore
But it's more like a knife to me than a high to me
And my heart can't fall apart anymore
If you knew what I  knew you'd be terrified
It's all that we are in the end
Well  you trapped down all the lines you drew
And I can take the hit but I'm sorry  I don't want the bruise
Your voice gets a little loud
And I'll find my lights fading out
More and more by the hour
It gets dark in here
If you got time enough for me
Sing me a song and send me to sleep
Slip into my headspace while I dream
Spin me a yarn  wrap it up around me
Dust to dust  my friend
Well  you're only blood and bones
And I know your heart's at war with your head
I am sure it hurt to see
You're more than I'll ever have
And more than I'll ever be
I know it's a little late
My timing was never great
But I'm calling  dear

I just wanted to let you know
That I won't bother you anymore
I'll be gone this time next year
If you got time enough for me
Sing me a song and send me to sleep
Slip into my headspace while I dream
Spin me a yarn  wrap it up around me
If you got time enough for me
Sing me a song and send me to sleep
I never thought that a lie could sound so sweet
Until you opened your mouth
The kind of blasphemy that makes a congregation cry
When I'm with you  it's like nothing else
Like I could run and tell the Devil to go fuck himself
It would be such a heavenly way to say goodbye
From now  until the afterlife
We could be intertwined
Whether you were heaven-sent to save mе from above
Or the only one who doеsn't hate me  that's enough
Well I need someone to save me from original sin
You call me like a chorus only angels can sing
Now I think about you all of the time
Oh  what a heavenly kind of state of mind
You bring me peace that I'd never find
There's only chaos when I'm left here to my own device
To tell the truth  I think you saved my life
Giving my heart over to you would be no sacrifice

You're the only reason that I keep believing

Losin' light  I'm missin' my same old us
Before we learned our truth too late
Resigned to fate  fadin' away
So tell me  can you turn around?
I need someone to tear me down
But either way
Hold me while you wait
I wish that I was good enough
If only I could wake you up
Won't you stay a while?
Tell me more  tell me something I don't know
Could we come close to havin' it all?
If you're gonna waste my time
Let's waste it right
And hold me while you wait

Now we're separated by oceans  vast
Couldn't make this last
I wish I'd have stayed
'Cause love can find a way to make your feet run heavy
Make your heart unsteady
Then it breaks  so I'm prayin' that you're feelin' the same
You know I spent some time in Hollywood tryin' to find
Somethin' to get the thought of you and I off my mind
Do you ever feel like goin' back to the start?
All the streetlights illuminate what home used to feel like
And when I get to thinkin'  can't sleep at night
No  I don't feel right
I wish I'd have stayed
'Cause love can find a way to make your feet run heavy
Make your heart unsteady
Then it breaks  so I'm prayin' that you're feelin' the same

Do you ever feel like goin' back to the start?
If you can hear me  does it really have to end?
I feel you close  although you're eight hours ahead
If we can pick it up  just tell me where and when
We'll go back to the start again
If you can hear me  does it really have to end?
I feel you close  although you're eight hours ahead
If we can pick it up  just tell me where and when

 it's been a minute now since I have had to tell the truth
 but self-obsessed
 on and on and on
 on and on and on
 Thought I'd be happier somehow
 but self-obsessed
 on and on and on
 on and on and on
 Thought I'd be happier somehow
 but self-obsessed
 on and on and on
 on and on and on
 Thought I'd be happier somehow
I guess that you gave up
On all that I am and all that I'm not
'Cause I'm fucking useless and full of excuses
I guess that you cut free
From all that we are and will never be
Now the flowers are dead like the hearts in our chest
And I'm hanging my head 'cause I'm tryna forget
So  this is where we ended up
All of those years that I wasted for lovе
And here it is  forevеrmore
The house is on fire and I can't find the door
If I had the heart to start it again
I'd stamp out the sparks in my own self-defence
Say  you ain't gonna like how this ends
You know  if we went back
To fix what we once had
There'd still be no chance
For you and me 'cause inevitably

All the flowers would die  and the tears from your eyes
Would come as no surprise as I tried to forget
So  this is where we ended up
All of those years that I wasted for love
And here it is  forevermore
The house is on fire and I can't find the door
If I had the heart to start it again
I'd stamp out the sparks in my own self-defence
No  you ain't gonna like how this ends
Broken with no way to mend
No  you ain't gonna like how this ends
I'm stuck here just tryna forget
So  this is where we ended up
All of those years that I wasted for love
And here it is  forevermore
The house is on fire and I can't find the door
If I had the heart to start it again
I'd stamp out the sparks in my own self-defence
 sprawled across my mind
 before you burn me to the ground
 let go
 heartache
 I'm not looking for a lasting lover
 let go
 heartache
 she said
 did we ever mean anything at all?
 she said
 she said
 let go
 heartache
Two lovers over enemy lines
I know we're broken but don't wanna believe it
You're so close to saying the words
Way past the point of any return
It's such a shame and I don't wanna believe it
Oh  if I could go back to that evening we met
Trembling hands as I'd ask for your number again
You saw me different then
Oh  when I held your heart in my hand
So  if you're gonna leave me
Just leave me slowly
Let's make it last
Just one more dance
Before the moment's passed
I'd rather that you lay here
Than leave me lonely
So  stay for a while
Just one more mile

I've been so lost since you left
Wish you kept leading me on
I bang my head against your door
But there ain't nobody home
And if you want to stay lost awhile
I'll rearrange the road I take
And meet you out in the wild
We can find a place to hide
Maybe I could change your mind
Let me hold your rolling heart of stone
Weigh down heavy like you did before
Let me hold your rolling heart of stone
If you think you might feel the same
I'll be right here where we left off
'Cause there's more life in my bones
Than you give me credit for

Never spent so long on a losing battle
But lately  giving up don't seem to matter
Every day  I'm a slave to the heartache
And you're wasting away every night
I don't wanna leave you lonely
But I've run out of love this time
You know that I adore you
Though I couldn't give enough
Hope you'll be safe in the arms of another
'Cause I can't take the weight of your love
Lately  I'm getting lost on you
I tore your world apart like it was nothing new
Never bled so much when I didn't have to

Right now  I know how it feels like the world's gonna end
But I'll get you through  if it's the last thing I do
I'm gonna love the hell out of you
Take all the pain that you're going through
I'll bring you heaven if that's what you need
'Cause you've always loved the hell out of me
You brought resoundin' techniques for my groundin' when I
Had lost it a little too far from the middle to find
Some solace from all this exhaustion and monsters of mine
So  you better know that I'll bring you home
I'm gonna love the hell out of you
Take all the pain that you're going through

I feel like I'm just wasting time
Before you pull the trigger
It's the drawing of the line
It's my ghost you're gonna give up
Got your made up mind
It hurts to see you're alright
When I'm not alright
So if you're calling it a night
I felt you slip away so slowly
I lost my grip a little more each time we touched
I've got no hope I guess I'll never get it back again

Oh
And I just don't know how we got it
There's bigger boys with broken hearts who throw their weight around
Don't it feel so good to be so small?
Cast my mind behind and think of girls I used to know
Who've all moved on to better things and found the ones they love

She brings me inner peace
I take her out to fancy restaurants
She takes the sadness out of me
I make her cards on her birthday
She makes me a better man
I take her water when she's thirsty
She takes me as I am
I love it when her mind wanders
And she loves it when I stay at home
I know when she's lost
And she knows when I feel alone
From all my airs and graces
To the little things I do
Everythin' is pointless without you
Of all the dreams I'm chasing
There's only one I choose
Everythin' is pointless without you
I light the fire when it's cold out
And she lights up the room

Has grown too much for me to block it out
I miss the tone of your heartbeat
It's such a warming and familiar sound
I hope you're finding the power
To help you make it through the darker days
If you wanna take somebody’s breath away
And I'd hate to think you're better off without me
Now does it kill you when you think about me?
Are you as close to giving up as I've been?
I pray you don't hurt too much

But fires don't burn forever

We danced to death in the fire

Since she told me we were through
Been going hell for leather
'Cause there's fuck all else to do
And she stumbled through some problems
But I've been missing something
Bring your body home to me
Am I wasting my time?
Am I wasting my time?
Replaying conversations running 'round in my mind
Didn't wanna be a love let go
Barely getting by on my own
Guess I'll always be holding on to something borrowed
Didn't wanna sing myself away
For long nights into wasted days
Saying her name like something borrowed
I'm only getting older
Feeling sorry for myself
Been wondering who she's holding
Is playing havoc with my health

For long nights into wasted days
Saying her name like something borrowed
And hold it
When the ground beneath my feet starts falling away
The cold cold press I find when I'm sick and soulless
Or the warmth I feel at the end of a damp cigarette
There must be something in the water
That keeps me from drowning
Something in the tide
That pulls me away
Something in the water
That keeps me from drowning
Something in the tide
That pulls me away
Afraid to run my mouth in case my words escape me
Cautious when I speak scared of what I might say
Hang me out to dry when the wars are all over
Cover me in red and send me away
The misery I carried to keep me some company
Is it lost on me when I don't have that much to say
There must be something in the water
That keeps me from drowning
Something in the tide
That pulls me away
Something in the water
That keeps me from drowning
Something in the tide
That pulls me away

 dear  I'm still a mess
 between every note
 dear  at all of my shows
 I know
They were playing Wonderwall
I overheard you say you hate this song
Came and tapped you on your shoulder
Spent the night there at my place
That night became a hundred days
And I shared all my deepest secrets with you
And I know
I waited all my life just to fall for someone like you

Stand and laugh at me

Think about the kind of fool
Who breaks his heart as often as the moon
Shows its face to you
Like I always do
'Cause you know that I'm beyond repair?
Everything I've ever loved
May I have your attention please?

The absolutely mind-inflaming show

For a shot at love and gold

Of everything that could have been
And I'm plagued by design
Forget all my lines
I've burned all my blessings more than half the time
Been trapped in my ways
But I'm desperate to change
'Cause you know that I'm beyond repair?
Everything I've ever loved
I will make you laugh if you need
I will play the part if you say so
You don't know that

Feeling like I'm falling even further behind

Designed to deceive

Be my best impression of what you expect from me
But what you don't see is

Feeling like I'm falling even further behind

Like I'm not on the edge of a knife
I feel like everything I do is a lie
And all the words just further pull the wool over eyes
I know I'm no good at being who I am away from the light
Designed to deceive
Is holding on to every drop of blood you drew
Is holding onto you
And every waking hour I spend
Holding out for reasons not to go to bed
I'm holding out for someone else to hold instead
If every hope of you is dead
'Cause every night since you cut and run
I feel like the only one who's ever been the lonely one
Trying to mend a heart that keeps breaking
With every step that you're taking
'Cause you've been running circles 'round
And I fell for you but hit the ground
'Cause the only love I've known has let me
Down and I need lifting up
Now you ain't here I'm sleeping rough
And I'm praying I can pray enough
So waking up without you ain’t so tough
Find it hard to find my feet
When I keep on stumbling over you and me
But I keep on trying 'cause I know I need
To outrun the memories

Now you ain't here I'm sleeping rough
And I'm praying I can pray enough
So waking up without you
Say I
Thought I was talking to you
Say I
I guess I'm talking to myself
Me and nobody else
'Cause you've been running circles 'round
And I fell for you but hit the ground
'Cause the only love I've known has let me
Down and I need lifting up
Now you ain't here I'm sleeping rough
And I'm praying I can pray enough
And hearing how your day has been
But leave out every part about him
While I'm still out here in the rain
With every day that passes by since we've spoken
It's like Glasgow gets farther from LA
Maybe it's supposed to be this way
And you were everything I need all along
You seem happier than ever now
And I guess that I should tell you I'm sorry
It seems I was the problem somehow
You might also like
Maybe I only brought you down
And you were everything I need all along
Wish I could say it's something I really mean
But I want you happy whether or not it's with me
And you were everything I need all along
 can't afford to
 but keep me closer
 I'm on my own
 I'm on my own
 I'm on my own
 I'm on my own"
