lyrics
"His voice was rusty from years as a sergeant on this man's army
They were old and crusty
She was twenty when the diner was a baby
Hair black and wavy
He was young and randy
They all run together
Time measured by the peeling of paint on the luncheonette wall
They sat together in the empty diner
Filled with cracked china
Old news was blowing across the filthy floor
They're about to let you go
And the locker slam on the plan
You had tonight
You've been messin' around with a boyfriend
Maybe better left alone
There's a wise guy that you know could
Put you right
In the lot the boy that's idling by
Doesn't rev your heart
Cause it's only lonely spots
He shares with you
And long halls and the gray walls
Are gonna split apart
Believe it or not
There's life after high school
And that's why
The student body got a bad reputation
What they need is adult education
What you want is an adult education
You might also like
The teacher don't know about how to deal
And the underclassmen are flashing
But your girlfriends care
About watch and wear
Believe it or not
That's right
The student body got a bad reputation
What they need is adult education
What you want is an adult education
You're waiting for a separation
Memories that you won't remember
And a lot of dedication
Maybe some of it'll rub off on ya
Trying to imitate their heroes
More memories you won't remember
I wonder what the junior wishes
That she could graduate to adult kisses
Adult education
Adult education
Adult education
It's a bad situation
Adult education
Adult education
And though he never has to worry
He's the only one and only one he's ever gonna need
Absolutely he's in definite need
And he knows how happy he could be
But he don't know if he can make it
Between the money and another lonely night
But now the time has come
Got to stay or run
Now the time has come
Oh maybe we've been Alone Too Long
And you don't want to be lonely
Another pretty face another body ache still awake three-thirty
Dial another number -- No one home
So then he wastes his time with TV
And he wonders if he lost the only one
And wonders if he's free
Too afraid to see
How alone he could be
Oh maybe we've been Alone Too Long
 old days
 he could sing
 Listen to him sing
 old days
 he could sing
 old days
Just in time to play
To one man and an empty table
He was drinking down the pain
All he could say was this lady's name...
Oh camellia won't you take me away
After the show  when the room was empty
No  he wouldn't go
So I asked him why he called her name
It seems she was some magic one night
With something for his pain
But all she left was a pretty name...
Oh camellia won't you take me away
To paradise tropical moon
Maybe I'm too young to know the score
But there's something inside not right
Wish I could vocalize
If I screamed would you realize
Feeling like a child without his toys
But just want to tell you...
Everything's all right
I'm just looking at you through
Crazy eyes tonight
So if I'm acting kind of strange
I'm just looking through crazy eyes
Cloudy day say it looks like rain
Is keeping me from my dreams
How do I sound to you?
I only wish I know what I should do
Believe me when tell you
Everything's all right
I'm just looking at you through
Crazy eyes tonight
So if I'm acting kind of strange
I'm just looking through crazy eyes

I don't even know my name
I wish I could place the blame on someone
But there's no one
Everything's all right
I'm just looking at you through
Crazy eyes tonight
So if I'm acting kind of strange
And when going out is coming home
If you're not an easy mark
It's a shot in the dark that hits the heart
I thought so anyway
Some things stay the same
And some are due for change
I thought I had them all nailed down
But you turned it around
When a love is real or touch-and-go
And if two can be one
Am I quick enough to see
When I'm ready and it's right for me?
I think so anyway

Well  it's the voice that I hear at the subway stop
Keep singing diddy doo wop  yeah  yeah
Well  it starts in my head and it ends when I stop
Keep singing diddy doo wop
Charlie liked the Beatles  Sam  he liked Rich Girl (Bitch Girl)
Reaching for the handle  I'm slicing through the air
Oh  the doo wop voices everywhere
And oh  the Duke is singing

Aw  sing duke
Just to see your face
I'd bare my soul to a total stranger
Just to say your name
And I'm not ashamed
Just to love you into every morning
I would change my name
And run away
I won't do it for money
I won't do it for pride
I won't do it to please somebody else
If it don't feel right
But I'll do it for you
And at least I'll try
I don't need any other reason
Than I feel it deep inside
I'll Do It For Love
I would write your name across the sky
So the world could see
What you mean to me
I'd sing songs at the top of my voice
In an empty room
Just to dance with you

But what we need is a mountain in Montana
A thousand acre world for the roadies and the girls
But you need a whole lot of money
And it'd be ennui on the mountain anyway
But it's round and round and round and round we go
Everyday we try to get higher
Any way to the dream at the end
AM airplay and a golden concept album
So they pay for what you say
And they hang on every word
You and me are just Ponce de Leon-y
Looking for something we ain't never gonna find
And it'd be ennui on the mountain anyway
But it's round and round and round and round we go
We go
And you wanna find someone who will let you out
Can't you see the heartbeat that you know so well
Is better than some strange one you're looking for
Say  you never know that strange one
Just might be me  yeah
Can't you see you have everything your heart desires
So why you want more?
If you have (if you have)  everything your heart desired
Would you still want more?
You have everything your heart desires
Why do you want more?
(If you have)
Everything your heart desires
Would you still want more?
You tell me your best friend's world seem beautiful
But don't be fooled
It's nice work if you can get it
Yeah  what goes on behind closed doors you don't know
Maybe she cries herself to sleep every night
Sorry that the heartbeat that she knows so well
Ain't what she's looking for
You never know that strange heart
Just might be me

I ain't gonna let you go
And walked right out on me
You had me thinkin' we were in the sky
Today I'd like to lay down and die  down and die
If you've gotta be leavin' me  well that's swell
I think it's fine girl  you found just what you want
Everytime I see your face  I can't believe how you lied to me
So get your laundry out of my place
Go and live with someone else for free
You had me thinkin' we was in the sky
Today I'd like to lay down and die  down and die
If you've gotta be leavin' me  well that's swell
I think it's fine girl  you found just what you want
Baby it's goodbye
Why do we lose so many tears?
Whoa  so you go again
When the leading man appears
Always the same thing
But can't you see we've got everything
Going on and on and on?
And everytime you go away
You take a piece of me with you
And everytime you go away
You take a piece of me with you  you
Go on and go free
Maybe you're too close to see
I can feel your body move
But doesn't mean that much to me
I can't go on singing the same theme
'Cause you can't see we've got everything

There ain't much to say about the weather
The shower stall is leakin'
And the ceiling's fallin' in
And I'm getting twenty bills to every letter
I've got to move myself out to the country
I'm lookin' out for any place at all
I'm gonna spend another Fall In Philadelphia
A roving band of youths beat up on Johnny
Everybody's gettin' richer sellin' that dope
Along with seven million people without a hope
I guess I have to face the fact as real
I think I feel my back up against the wall
She took her standard pose as she presented herself
She had sultry eyes
She made it perfectly plain that she was his for a price
And my bark is much worse than my bite
She wore hurt surprise
As she rechecked her make-up to protect herself
Dropped her price and pride
She made it totally clear that she was his for a night
And my bark is much worse than my bite
She gave him her look
It would have worked on any other man around
He looked her up and down
She knew he couldn't decide if he should hold his ground

Don't leave me alone 'cause I got to go home
And a long way from the family crime
But you've got your own way
You're a patent-leather lover
With your Gucci-Pucci pointed shoes
And you're swearing on your mother
That all this could be yours
Remember hard work means something
No hurt in asking
Nothing for nothing
Gino no no no no no no no no no no
No no no no no no no no no no no
No no no no no no no no no no no no!

 love your giggles on the phone
 another town another crazy day
It's time for finding
Some way to get through my sleepless nights
I can dream about you
If I can't hold you tonight
I can dream about you
Maybe that will make it all right
All right
Moving sidewalks
Uneven under my feet
My true feelings
Down deep below
'Cause the streets see me lonely for you
Just for you
I can dream about you
In my dreams we're still happy
And you're still part of me
I can dream about you
And when you're in my mind's eye
(I can dream about you)

Don't you know it's a game - it's all a game I've been playing
But what'd you say your name was...
Walk with me... just around the corner baby maybe you could even
Try to talk to me
Damn you talk to me!
Jingle bell swing and jingle bell ring
Snowin' and blowin' up bushels of fun
Now the jingle hop has begun
Jingle bell  jingle bell  jingle bell rock
Jingle bells chime in jingle bell time
Dancin' and prancin' in Jingle Bell Square

What a bright time  it's the right time
To rock the night away
Jingle bell time is a swell time
To go glidin' in a one-horse sleigh
Giddy-up jingle horse  pick up your feet
Jingle around the clock

I don't feel the need to give such secrets away

Because your kiss is on my list of the best things in life
Because your kiss  your kiss is on my list
Because your kiss  your kiss I can't resist

Songs old as the night are what I've been dreaming of
Everybody's hard as iron
Locked in a modern world
Dreams are made of a different stuff
I believe love will always be the same (Love)
The ways and means are the parts subject to change
M-E-T-H-O-D-O-F-L-O-V-E
It's the method of modern love
M-E-T-H-O-D-O-F-L-O-V-E
It's the method of modern love
I can call you
Got your number
Share my life with you a thousand miles away
If you hurt me
I haven't shown it
Time's too tight to fight
And we're never face to face

Using the bodies up as we go
I'm wakin' up to fantasy
The shades all around aren't the colors we used to see
Broken ice still melts in the sun
And times that are broken can often be one again
We're soul alone
And soul really matters to me
Take a look around
You're out of touch
I'm out of time (Time)
But I'm out of my head
When you're not around
You're out of touch
I'm out of time (Time)
But I'm out of my head
When you're not around
Reachin' out for something to hold
Looking for a love where the climate is cold
Manic moves and drowsy dreams
Or livin' in the middle between the two extremes
Smoking guns hot to the touch
Would cool down if we didn't
We're soul alone
And soul really matters to me
Too much

And suffer thru all the fools advice
Seems tome it's not so bad
To try for the kind of love that we had
Oh I need that romance
One that grows strong
When it's got no chance
Now you're gone away
And I'm left to carry on
Ain't nobody else gonna bear up to comparison
And if I can't have the real thing
Then I've got to find someone
Just like you
What you got it's what you need
There's pain in that but it's plain enough to see
I know I was satisfied
But nobody else came out of my side
I hope someone will come today
Somebody like you
Someone to take me all the way
Somebody like you
Someone to take your place
Somebody like you

Time is running out for the magic pair

Although I know the light is fading fast

Is it easier to stay
