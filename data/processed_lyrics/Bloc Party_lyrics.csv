"I can give you life  I can take it away
A heart of stone  a smoking gun
I'm working it out
Why'd you feel so underrated?
Why'd you feel so negated?
Turning away from the light  becoming adult
Turning into myself
I wanted to bite not destroy  to feel her underneath
Turning into the light
She don't think straight
She's got such a dirty mind and it never ever stops
And you don't taste like her and you never ever will
And we don't read the papers  we don't read the news
Heaven's never enough  we will never be fooled
Turning away from the light  becoming adult
Turning into myself
I wanted to bite not destroy  to feel her underneath
Turning into the light

And you couldn't tell the difference between me and you

With a shotgun
And a six pack of beer
The newscaster says the enemy's among us
As bombs explode on the 30 bus
Kill your middle class indecision
Now is not the time for liberal thought

How you looked that afternoon  there was only you
You said It's just like a full moon
Blood beats faster in our veins

Permanent midnight
Our love  our love
How we've come to depend
On each other to the end
The space between us has disappeared
You finish my  you finish my words for me
I remember how it began
So many great days in a row
Barefoot on Bishopsgate
Trying to find Blake's grave
If we could stay like this in a silver foil
Trapped in amber for a life
Permanent midnight
Our love  our love
I carry your heart here with me
I carry it in my heart
I carry your heart with me
I carry it in my heart
Who said unbroken happiness
Is a bore  is a bore?
Who said it  my love? I don't mind it
Anymore  anymore
And I reach out a hand over your side of the bed
Pull that blanket over your shoulders exposed to the night
And the hunger of those early years will never return
But I don't mind  I don't mind
Cause I love my mind when I'm fucking you
Slowed down to a crawl
Years of crime and the bread line
Have not at all dimmed your shine
So let's stay in  let the sofa be our car
Let's stay in  let the TV be our stars
I found my dancing shoes but they don't fit
All the bright lights do is bore me
They bore me
 I will never be joined
 in East Berlin
 the bitter taste
 the search continues
 the bitter taste
 the search continues
 the bitter taste
 the search continues
At the point where we kissed first
On a rooftop
Overlooking the East London mosque
You can't go around breaking young girls' hearts
And you looked so right
In that red dress
To be a rock for you
To be anything
You could rely on
But I'll get caught out
But we forget the lines
Forget the lines
And you looked so wanton
In the back of the car
Like you could start
A hundred wars

Got a fear of the ocean

But this time-fleshed out fuller face

Can you hear the stars now sing
Resounding in D major?
As the god vibration resonates
And pulls us up towards her
Take your shoes off  feel the earth
Beneath your feet respond to touch
And let our laughter now ring forth
As the love consumes us
The love within is moving upwards
Sweeter than any drug
The melody is taking over
Guide my hand through this hurt
Pull back the veil
Let your eyes meet this world
The love within is moving upwards
So don't you want to get high?
Don't you want to get high?

I'm shaking hands with a hurricane
It's a colour that I can't describe
It's a language I can't understand
Ambition tearing out the heart of you
Carving lines into you
Dripping down the sides of you
We will not be the last
We will not be the last
We will not be the last
We will not be the last
We will not be the last
We will not be the last
We will not be the last
And the power to impress
Lord  give me grace and dancing feet
Let me outshine them all
Is it so wrong to crave recognition?
Second best  runner-up
Is it so wrong to want rewarding
To want more than is given to you? Than is given to you
Tonight make me unstoppable
And I will charm  I will slice
I will dazzle them with my wit
Tonight make me unstoppable
And I will charm  I will slice
I will dazzle  I will outshine them all
Standing on the packed dance floor
Our bodies throb in time
Silent on the weekdays
Tonight I claim what's mine

You're going to need it

Strutting round here in those pum pum shorts
Twist for me  bend for me
We can do it if you like?
There you go-go
Looking like a snack
Cute like Bambi
But you're headed to a trap
Meet me in the boom boom room
And we can do what you like
I wanna be your education
I wanna be your contact high
Lick lick lick  lickety split
Raise the stakes
Talk dirty to me
You'rе so maverick  you're a bit of me

Chills
They run down my spine  they're multiplying
Feels
I'm supposed to say no
But then there

Wearing my jacket  wearing that smile
I knew that I'd found you
This could be an opportunity
This could be an opportunity
Were you unawares? Did it catch you out?
Or did it break you in right from the start?
This is pure as fire  this is pure as snow

Such longing for the past for such completion
What was once golden has now turned a shade of grey
I've become crueller in your presence
They say  Be brave
There's a right way and a wrong way

All the young people looked the same
Wearing their masks of cool and indifference
Commerce dressed up as rebellion
Because we're so handsome and we're so bored
Drink to forget your blues on the weekend
Think about more things to buy
The TV taught me how to sulk and love nothing
And how to grow my hair long
Because we're so handsome and we're so bored
So why do you go picking fights that you will lose?
(When you have entertainment
When you have things to pass the time?)
So why do you go thinking thoughts that are above you?

Well I was brave and unique
I could have been a hero
No-one can be trusted over the age of 14
We tell ourselves we're different
I've gotten so good at lying to myself
So when are you going to realise
Those are not your wrongs to right?

We're finding it hard to break the mould
We're finding it hard to be alone
We're finding it hard to have time by ourselves

Talks in circles and Greek
He's into epiphany
He's into philosophy
He's into methyl amphetamines

 I've fallen again

January is endless
Weary-eyed and forlorn
The Northern Line is the loudest
Sitting in silence in bars after work
I've got nothing to add or contest
Can I still kick a ball a hundred yards?
We cling to bottles and memories of the past
(Give me moments) Just give me moments
(Give me moments) Not hours or days
(Give me moments) Just give me moments
(Give me moments)
Grinding your teeth in the middle of the night
With the sadness of those molars
Spend all your spare time trying to escape
With crosswords and Sudoku
I'd not be so scared of falling
I'd pick and I'd eat more wild blackberries

And in her voice only sadness
Her only son taken from her
In every headline we are reminded
That this is not home for us
In every headline we are reminded
That this is not home for us
The second generation blues
Our point of view not listened to
Different worlds and different rules
A question of allegiance
Clinging to her Bible and her scapular
And the memory of the way things were
I burn with anger all the time
To the black boy

Of humility and belligerence
This tommy-rot and flag waving
Is getting me down
I want to stamp on the face of every young policeman
To break the fingers of every old judge
To cut off the feet of every ballerina
But I cannot
And I pretend that there's nothing wrong
The teeth of this world tear me in half
And everyday I must ask myself where?
Where is it?
Where is home?
Where is it?
Where is home?
In every headline we are reminded
That this is not home for us
In every headline we are reminded"
