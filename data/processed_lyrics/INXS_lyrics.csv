"Bathed in blue  the walls of my memory divides the thorns from the roses
It's you and the roses
Touch me and I will follow in your afterglow
Heal me from all this sorrow as I let you go
I will find my way when I see your eyes
Now I'm living in your afterglow
Here I am  lost in the ashes of time  but who owns tomorrow?
In between the longing to hold you again  I'm caught in your shadow
I'm losing control
My mind drifts away
We only have today
Touch me and I will follow in your afterglow
Heal me from all this sorrow as I let you go
I will find my way  I will sacrifice
'Til the blinding day when I see your eyes
Now I'm living in your afterglow (In your afterglow)

When the veils are gone
As I let you go
As I let you go
Ah  hey  hey
Ah  yeah
Oh  yeah
Touch me and I will follow in your afterglow
Heal me from all this sorrow as I let you go
I will find my way  I will sacrifice
Now I'm living in your afterglow
Bathed in blue  the walls of my memory divides the thorns from the roses

Guaranteed to take hold of you
Take a turn with a new vow
All the sympathy
Made a mess of me
Respect the sacrifice
Before the number one
Now it has begun
Baby don't cry
Baby don't cry
Baby don't cry
Running from a bad home
With some cat inside
Now where did you find her
Among the neon lights
That haunt the streets outside
Beautiful girl (stay with me)
Beautiful girl (stay with me)
She wanna go home
From doorway to doorway
Street corner to corner
With the neon ghosts in the city
And she says
Stay with me
Stay with me
Stay with me

The best in life
Becomes clear
The rest just begins
To fade by itself
That's a trick I learnt
Though it took so long
Bitter tears taste so sweet
I'm seeing my way
For the first time in years
When love around
Begins to suffer
And you can't find love
In one
In one another
Push away those bitter tears
Bitter tears
And I thought I was doing no wrong
And I thought I was doing no wrong
No wrong

When love around
Begins to suffer
And you can't find love
In one
In one another
Bitter tears
Hey!
Push away those bitter tears

Push away those bitter tears
That's what they call doing no wrong
That's what they call doing no wrong
Push away those bitter tears
The hide and seek we play with facts
It changes our demand
Tilt my hat at the sun
And the shadows they burn dark
Light me and I'll burn for you
And the love song never stops
I like the look in your eyes
When you talk that certain way
I love the day in the life
When you know that lover's way
Minding my own business
When you came along
Temperatures been running hot
The fever was so strong
Tilt my hat at the sun
And the shadows they burn dark
Light me and I'll burn for you
And the love song never stops
Don't stop it

When we're not together
It doesn't feel so bad
We could be so far apart
But our love's not sad
It's no use pretending
Cause I understand
The hide and seek we play with facts
Uncertain and anxious
I need to call you
Rooms full of strangers
Some call me friend
But I wish you were so close to me
In the dark of night
Those small hours
I drift away
When I'm with you
In the dark of night
By my side
In the dark of night
By my side
I wish you were

Who's going to teach me
Peace and happiness
We could sit here forever
Just never get old
Listen to the world
Letting gods tie us down
The right clothing
Dancing on the jetty

Watch the world argue
Argue with themselves
Who's going to teach me
Peace and happiness

Resolution of happiness
Things have been dark for too long

I found a love I had lost
It was gone for too long

You're loosing grip of what really matters
Cause you don't know where to start
You wake up in the morning
With a starfuck for a friend
The things you do are so in tune
With what you said you hate
What's giving you the will to live
Is looking for revenge
The only laugh that you've got left
Is hiding from the pain
What must have happened to your soul
Is skinnin' you alive
The thing that you fear the most is love
And that's buried deep inside
So deep inside
Don't lose your head
Cause I can't do the time
Don't lose your head
If you can't pay the price
The heart you're building out of rock
Is turning into sand
Cause you never took the time to think
What it means to be a man
You act like you got the answers
When the questions never asked
I've been to where you're coming from
But the postcards weren't so bad
The knife I carry's been sharpened
On the mouth's that won't keep shut
I'll stab at you in the darkness
Cause I'm trying to shed some light
Your point of view's so meaningless
If you ever had one at all
All you seem to care about
Is who's is gonna take the fall

A lyric in his pocket
Little girl in his heart
When you hear his songs
On the radio
I don't need to tell you
What you already know
He's on God's top ten
Where heaven never ends
You saw the world
And the world saw you on the stage
Roquefort Le Pont
Your gypsy heart is free
Pictures on the wall
Of your family
He's on God's top ten
Where heaven never ends
He's on God's top ten
Baby's got momma's eyes
She was always beautiful
When you hear his voice
Feel his arms around you
You remember mama smiling
A daddy's little girl
Bad weather
Cold media storm
He's on God's top ten
Where heaven never ends
See the sound
It crashes in
All around
It gets in
Now take your hands
And raise them up
Into to the air
That's all around ya
Now bring them down
Like a clock at two
And shake your head
You know what to do
They want to put
Guns in the sky
Someone out there
Ain't gonna like it
But it could be good
Make us love each other
Have to realize
I own the future
Hoh! Guns in the sky

Don't let anyone tell you

Or does it make you cry

And my selfish ways
Disappeared one day
With the realization
Of a new way
Images of the free
Coming into view
Our hearts full of promises
Of all we can do

Farmer's pride you know he works real hard
From a small aeroplane you can see the fields
Heart shaped hedges
Japanese gardens
Heart shaped hedges
Japanese gardens
A place to work and grow
A place to work and grow
A place to work and grow

Four long years one leaner than the rest
The animals are thin and the pastures dry
Farmer's pride if the weather doesn't lie
From a small aeroplane you can see the sea
Lot's of blue
Very deep blue
A place to work and grow
A place to work and grow

Johnson sees the fields from all the sides
Steel machines and black tar roads
Countryside where the spirit never dies

Sunshine soothing – clouds are hazy

Eden lets me in
I find the seeds of love
And climb upon the highwire
I kiss and tell all my fears
Falling down the mountain
End up kissing dirt
Look a little closer
Sometimes it wouldn't hurt

To prove that we are one
Cutting through the night
We find the seeds of lust
And lose our minds on one intent

And the sun comes
Like a god into our room
All perfect light and promises
Got a hold on you
A new sensation  a new sensation
Right now  it's gonna take you over
A new sensation  a new sensation
Dream  baby  dream

In the name of love? (Yeah)
You thought what a pity

Original sin
Your hands are tight but you're losing grip quickly
Fix me  can you read the signs?
Thumbing your way to Vegas  dirty
And dreaming of the other side
Save your tears and laughter
Because it doesn't matter what you find
It ain't pretty
After the show
It ain't pretty when the pretty leaves you
With no place to go
If you think you need it
Here's the place to feed it
But it ain't pretty
When everything that you do is wrong
And you feel like you can barely survive  yeah

Buried in the sunset alive
Thumbing your way to Vegas  dirty
And screaming like you're back from hell

I am searching
Have we lost direction
Washed our hands of blood
I'm in need of sensation
Is there more to this love
Saw a mother screaming
She had lost control
Of what she once believed in
And she was not alone
If you could face the pain
And I could do the same
It would be clear tomorrow

Though I'm miles away
And ring to let you know
Are you seeing someone
I'd better let you go

She said this was a love to end all loves

I was shaking
Like a leaf
All wrapped up
In my dirty sheets
If I agree to what comes next
I would be faking
With the best of them
It seems a crime
I would commit
Without the difference
Of all the world's gifts
Sweet sweet sweet
Could you taste it
Never never never
Never never never (taste it)
To dream
All the time
Without a scream
In the dead of night
All those faces
Come back to me

To swim that sea
Yea I made
A picture story
Make you cry
In all your glory
A need to quench
The thirst of many
To justify
And make ready
