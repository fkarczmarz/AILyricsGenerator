lyrics
"Took my heart away from money
I ain't interested in fame
And I pray that never change
Ambition is priceless
It’s something that’s in your veins
And I put that on my name
Uh  only hope I had was selling dope
Was on my grind cause times was harder than a cellar floor
My momma taught me never steal and never tell on folks
I grew up looking up to niggas that was selling coke
Oh  I was raised by the stop sign
No religion I was getting saved by the Glock nine
By the minute I was getting paid like a hot line
Well connected  well respected and well protected
Ain't get accepted  was rejected and now they regret it
Ain't get my message  was no signal when I was texting
The niggas I was calling was fraud and I learned my lesson
Now I move with aggression  use my mind as a weapon
Cause chances are never given they tooken like interceptions
So throw that pass  I’ll be the cornerback
Me and Folarin MMG gon' bring that Warner back

For my ambition
Easy to dream a dream  though it's harder to live it
They gon' love me for my Ambition
Easy to dream a dream  though it's harder to live it
They gon' love me for my Ambition
Easy to dream a dream  though it's harder to live it
Look  they gon' love me for my ambition
Beautiful music  painting pictures that be my vision
It speaks for itself
Define ambition for me
My ambition to win  just to get me some ends
Help me pay my little rent  maybe sit in a Benz
I saw momma praying as she wait on results
It was hot in the kitchen can I wait on the porch
My father was missing  War Lord Oliver North
Life was diggin’ me deeper  I kept on coming up short
Breaking so many laws  waking up in the dark
Who cut my power off? it’s time to move that powder soft
Not too many options when you coming from the projects
Sittin’ in the trap now you moving Cyndi Lauper
Girls wanna have fun  and a nigga with some change
And I doubt that ever change
Ambition is priceless that’s something that's in your veins
And I doubt that ever change
Ambition is my shit and I put that on my name
And I doubt that ever change
For my ambition
Easy to dream a dream  though it's harder to live it
They gon' love me for my Ambition
Easy to dream a dream  though it's harder to live it
They gon' love me for my Ambition
Easy to dream a dream  though it's harder to live it
Look  they gon' love me for my ambition
Beautiful music  painting pictures that be my vision
Well wishes to my opposition
You niggas probably cop a plea before you cop a pistol
I got nothing against them  they got fucking potential
But every nigga who can read gotta get his issue
Subscribe  niggas reside where all the lions and killers be
And I ain't spend a minute up in the streets
But I’m limitless mentally  I’m lyrically ZMT
Lebron shit  I was in that 6 after 23
And family is everything  and money is less important
Long as your mama love you  don’t ever love a woman
I got a lot of bitches  they got a lot of feelings
But I got that green on my eyes
And that ain’t no Donnie Simpson
I retire you niggas: fuck you and your position!
They placeholding so slippery niggas can’t even kick it
Y’all rambling  talking shit to these bitches
You know you real you don’t say it
You know you real  we gon feel it
Ralph!
Beautiful music  painting pictures that be my vision
They gon love me for my ambition
Easy to dream a dream  but much harder to live it
Look  they gon love me for my ambition
Beautiful music  painting pictures that be my vision
I'll pay your tuition  and pray with you if you ain't in to wishin
I'm tryna fuck the shit out your aspirations
She reply to me like  why you perspiring me? bitch..
Pardon me if I'm sweating you but
I wanna see something else in you before I invest in you
Ambitious girl  (what its hittin for?)
I'd rather you tell me to hit you later
Because you gotta finish a paper
Than to be in my face asking for a Rose cup
See these bitches can't cut in yo business
I'm in love with your business
And your productivity is the reason I interest  ambitious girl
See  I like the person that you are
But I'm in love with the person that you have potential to be
And all your dreams sharing with me
And your secrets baring with me
And the flaws  you ain't even got to mention to me
Then to try to chase these men
That try to chase these skirts
That try to chase these shots with flavors that ain't even as sweet as her
My ambitious girl  I won't forget you
I just reflect on how I ain't met you  yet boo
You somewhere  getting your life in order
So for this time being  I hope this open scribe might support her
Go girl

Go girl  ambition

It's like  sunshine on a rainy day
It's like a high  could you take me away?
Take me away  away
It's a beautiful bliss  oh (When you feel like this)
Beautiful bliss  oh (When you spill out hits)
Fresh out the airport  fresh out the chair with the clippers
I'm tryna get it like Sean get it
If Lord giveth  a mil' and a MILF light skinneded
It's slight blemishes and life system
But I'm giving it foundation when I write lyric
That Anvil Neidhart minus bright knickers
Maybe not quite the star but my heart's in it
When Bret Hart meet Brett Farve
A sharpshooter well exceeding any figure four
You see my figure more or less six or more
I invest in my larynx and lungs and this voice I project
My project is like what pros inject
And a nigga so fly I should be droved in jets
It's ironic they call me a fresh breath

Who woulda thought a lil nigga from the Ville could get a deal?
Ay  tell them niggas at the top we want yo spot we are for real
So you best be on your toes nigga  especially on your flows nigga
Cause man they keep on checking for me  especially all your hoes nigga
All I wanna do is eat  I'm like a freaky lesbian
Now all I wanna do is ball on TV  need ESPN
They heard I'm 'bout to blow so all my enemies say let's be friends
And all these rappers know just where I'm 'bout to go so catch me then
Where all the girls we knew that screamed fuck you going let me then
I'm definitely in a class of my own  at dinner with Hov
Hoping that he pass the baton  he just passed the Patron
For that living large  but mama I ain't done yet
Sit back and watch your sunrise  kick back and know your son set
Pac said fuck the world and I ain't come yet  you up yet
My punchlines like gut checks I'm raw-dog  I'm rough sex
So fuck stress  you can get the fuck from 'round me
And if you listening  know you wondering where the fuck they found me
Babe  you know it gets no better than this
It's like  sunshine on a rainy day
It's like a high  could you take me away?
Take me away  away
It's a beautiful bliss  oh (When you feel like this)
Beautiful bliss  oh (When you spill out hits)
Another day up in my ES  wish it was an LS
But elastic is my wallet  fuck it
I don’t be stressed like relaxed  muscles
Your feedback ain't plusing  and you can keep it running
They like A-list actors  they not no stunners
Too much practice now for me to malfunction
So any beat that function  I breathe on and puncture
Leave it like a female vagina punctu-
Waiting  showing you her beauty if she's naked
It's like the view of a painting or a lakehead
This just how beautiful my day is
Peep me how I'm raising up the capital from Nathan
Capital I'm raising like I'm through punctuating
Or shift keys or an I placement cause
Shifted keys gets your capital raised up
Motherfucker  hah!
Babe  you know it gets no better than this
It's like  sunshine on a rainy day
It's like a high  could you take me away?

Beautiful bliss  oh (When you spill out hits)

Folarin in this muh'fucker
I'm just talking to you muh'fuckers
And if it don't make your niggas proud
Then this should never be allowed
Wittingly unfuckwittable with these syllables
The realest dude in the room in my groove
And all my women come frequently as the summer's moon
Keep talking 'bout ambition shit
And all these bitches don't know which body part they gon' pick
Reminiscing upon my man Slick
As-salamu alaykum though
Dreams fulfilling they ain't capable of
As I renovate a model but do raise up your cup
And never lose us on this never-ending revenue hunt

I'ma take my mama to the Grammy's
And shoutout everybody that ever said that I can't be
And show her everything that she taught me done came in handy
On another level so they couldn't understand me
I guess I gotta take what I want it like Meyer Lansky
Barely went gold but I got money just like I went plat'
You get that? Look like I went diamond just where my wrist at
18when I took that charge
New flows and new hoes
Now I'm switching Ferraris just like I do clothes
I'm gone
I'm looking at the plan like this shit might work
But if it don't work then this shit might hurt
We made first and goal now we gotta convert
Gotta get a couple mil' then go for dessert
That negative attention be the reason we lose
You can tear they ass apart and let the pussy remain
Until the industry fuck 'em and then they no one again
I understand that no man's path is the same
And when you not lying then you harder to tame
If you ever tell the truth then you free in the game
Have yo main bitch sending me pictures
Or a time machine to make the process quicker
I ain't with the waiting but I stay patient
I'm headed to the top where I stay stationed
The flow got more crack than the trap you at
I waited for a minute for this plan to hatch
And it feel good when it go like that
To slit a nigga throat on sight
Took a whole lot of punches like the Cotto fight
Never met a beat that the flow don't like
All I do is brainstorm then I rain down lines
You little pups couldn't pee on my roots
Serve niggas quick like Denny's
Did the most with what I was taught

I'm still talking to you muh'fuckers
If it don't make your niggas proud
Then this should never be allowed

Mini fourteen stuffed in my denim jeans

Corruption over cash leave 'em leakin' in the cask'
Malcolm vision platinum in Africa when sat in that cell
Benjamins to make sure my pockets have an abnormal bulge
Niggas clockin' dollars don't know how to read with mouths to feed
We in the field buildin' muscle while you watch the house
And dustin' off that porcelain and open when they cock is out
Mini fourteen stuffed in my denim jeans
This shit was for a ticket  man -- I call that shit that free lunch
I tell a ho to speed up
She slow and she can keep up
We know we always out
But somehow they would never see us
They say that karats help your vision
But somehow it made them listen
No this ain't silver  this is my dilemma
Arrogant when I finish
I came from humble beginnings
So it's nothing to finish
I put my hundred percent in
Put my pride in the pen  cuh
And modify your opinion
Trying to give them light and a message
But you rather have some fucking V.V.S.'s
She said I'm charming and I meant it

But where I'm from there ain't no love for no broke nigga

Pray to whoever got on the biggest of crucifix
Lord Lord forgive us  personalities clash
And my license is suspended  so I hide it

Got a couple hoodrats on Section 8
Make a nigga cum  don’t procrastinate
Ass on 5-0  come crack the case
Got ass for days  come activate
This ass on fire  evacuate
Throw that ass in the air  evaporate
Where your money? Let a bitch evaluate
If you 'bout big money  elaborate

What you up to? More club moves?
I call her  no answer
Her phone in the bag  she dancin'
It's four now  the clubs over
I call her  but oh  hold up
Y'all know what  ignore button
Or the phone die  let's hope for it
That Damier bag I bought her
Caught the attention of those niggas on it
That cell phone that I bought
Is probably filled with some other niggas numbers
So it leaves me to wonder
Why do I still promise to love her?
Cut me off every time I'm talkin'
Which means she ain't never hear nothing
I say stay  she wanna leave
She get her point across so I gotta let her be
I'ma let her be by herself in peace
But five years from now I bet she see
When the club gets played
The things you crave are no longer escapes
And no longing for dates
You want a husband  but no one has a cape
Now you wonder and wait
And I ain't tryin' to hear what you want me to say
It feels good to be over you  babe
So play this shit while you contemplate
Contemplate  contemplate
Play this shit while you contemplate
Play this shit while you contemplate

Why is you over-exaggerating with all the chatter
Hangin' me on so you can holler domestic abuse
See it's time that a nigga roll
Things have gone awry and you tryna change a nigga role
Never trust a bitch just tryna be a side bitch
They just fly enough to out-connive the prior one
And it be fine to just get high and let the time run
But all that bullshit cryin' got me tryna tell you I'm done
Just give me a second to cool off
If you respect me then take a second and cool off
Wrap up a blunt and we wrap it up when it's - hol' up

Why you talking?
Mufucking Groundhog's Day
The most highly underrated of my generation
Behind them crooked smiles niggas neglect to embrace me
Lot of niggas hate to love me or they love to hate me
Labeled as reckless and crazy by my record label
It's obviously depressing counting blue faces
Battling anxiety and privately them percocets
Weight of the world on my shoulders bet I military press
I remember me and Cole would open for Hov
I was lost at Interscope
Contemplating on copping a block from Benning Road
Thoughts of suicide cause who gon' want you alive
When niggas you used to ride with cry with all that high shit
Only difference is I didn't get no sympathy calls to get back up
I just heard a song about me on a hip-hop blog from a kid I know
Some niggas say a hip-hop God

(Hol' up!)
It’s complicated to find a lady in my generation
That’s not preoccupied with social clout
We almost fazing out from the high we get from love and conversation to go on IG galavanting for likes and shit
I’m tryna say I need loyalty like Clyde Barrow was tryna get when Bonnie was shot up riding shotgun with him
I got someone who loves me so effortless
That my exes got the power with no effort to decline the next shawty I get
What I’m tryna say is I like you but it’s complicated
Should I bury you in compliments or buy gifts or
Just let you tell me bye and for that time I’ll miss you
My life is fairly complicated
You show too much of your heart I promise they confiscate it
I’m not the type to bring home to mama
I’m just crazy cause I’m broad crazy
Monogamy’s kind of hard for me
When I start throwing them curves that’s when they caught feelings
I got famous at a young age I’m spoiled
I got missed calls from porn stars and church girls
You’d be surprised who get the wildest and squirt more

Cause if I really like you I won’t... fuck it
They ain't grossing a million liquid  don't form an opinion
I'm sort of a genius  nothing short of a legend
Sort of Tommy Lasorda
The way I'm sorting these pitchers
Pictures whatever  fuck it my speech is off
Weekend trippin to wherever  only heaven is far
Metaphors in every color  these indelible bars
Jordan 4 seated floorside sitting with Mars
Only fear is mediocrity
So every time I got a beat I feel like I don't gotta sleep
You keep praying on your break  I hope you got a sling
Shot for all them shots coming out them beaks
Sort of like Socrates in a Prada tee
You can't kick it  your pockets thinner than soccer tees
People fucking with me  they ain't fucking with you
Lyrically top hmm  being generous too
I remember a nigga demo just sit in a room
Made some moves  now I'm known to spit December in June
Always keep a rubber  word to Telly In Kids
If you gon do it you gon do it  go handle your biz
Or smoke some purp take a Percocet and Xanax and chill
For real  you real then you don't need to say it
It's something to be great  it's nothing to be famous..

I'm tryna hear all your problems so I can lighten the load
Life hard and ex-lovers is like scars

With voicemails on third rings fucking me up

I thank God I'm alive to greet you with the sun
She is but a flower  and I love her cause she--
And we both agree this rap shit is all me
But the seed of this beautiful world is ours
My black Bonnie
Dream big and follow through even bigger
15 years of slavery for you lady
I put in work to be your nigga
May the sun kiss you  unconditional
I pray each and every lyric get to you
On this third rendition
For you and your ambition both  bloom
There's no need to be scared now  cause I'm with you
To be as wild and crazy as you wanna be
So baby let me see you bloom for me
To whom it may concern
Let me thank your mom for the beauty you inherited
Let me call her up and be like  Excuse me Mrs. Um...
You don't know me  but...
Thank you for your flower  but I'm tryna be your sun
Male entertainers entertain everything
But that ain't the case  let me put it this way:
If I'm tryna see you bloom  why would I do it with shade?
The pollution that you use to I illuminate such
Beautiful the evolution of your bud
Remove your make-up I need that human nature
Look  me and you just ain't enough
We fruitful as youth let's accumulate  some
Tell me 'bout your roots  and how you've came up
Good

(Be my flower  I'll be your sun)
Let me see you bloom for me  bloom for me
Just let me hold you in a dark place
And when it's cold let me warm thee
I know we both come from hard times
Cause I'm aroused you a rose of the concrete
Thorns probably on fleek  study and I go on three
I can hit it quick or chill and give you energy
Fresh out of college and they sweat you  now you got degrees
Busy to follow me  I'm tryna pollinate so won't you holla when it's gotta be
We can do whatever  be it intellect or intimate
Levitate your habitat  just know who you dealin' with
This sort of photosynthesis don't show up with the filter in ya
What  me and you just ain't enough
We fruitful as youth let's accumulate some
Tell me 'bout your roots  and how you've came up
Good
There's no need to be scared now  cause I'm with you

Let me see you bloom for me  bloom for me
(Be my flower  I'll be your sun)
Let me see you bloom for me  bloom for me
You don't have to worry about comfort
I'm the safest place that you wanna be
No longer do you have to wonder
Just open up and spread your wings
Eh oh baby  won't you (bloom bloom)
Eh baby  won't you (bloom bloom)
Eh baby  won't you (bloom bloom)
Eh baby  won't you (bloom bloom)
And I'm just trying to drive it once again
Baby  you got a body like a Benz
And I'm just trying to drive it once again
I start off with that  what you drinkin'?
Pardon if I'm road raging
But I know you heard my drive is crazy
Yeah  let me pace that with some patience
Let me do it till I fill every void
You're like a Maybach  thinking damn
They ain't even make 'em like you no more
It's like a high beam gleaming through your eye (bling)
I adore you up  baby suicide
A little wordplay  I'm hoping I can make you smile
Least until I'm out of line like a DUI
Girl  you remind me of my Jeep
Can I see what's up with that G-Wagon?
Can I take you off of these streets?
To the side of me  I'm trying to see your hazards
Trying to be with the baddest  won't be the fastest
Gotta make it last  I hope you comfortable
I need to get to you  you're like a '62
A little work then it's curtains when I'm skrrting through
Came through in the group  trying to leave in the coupe
That mean I gots a few  but I believe in you
You ain't feeling me naw  that mean I don't need the roof

Now speed it up like a Maserati  and look at me and pose
Baby  you got a body like a Benz
And I'm just trying to drive it once again
Baby  you got a body like a Benz

A good woman is scarce to us
And I wasn't prepared to love
I know it sound crazy  but your miles scare me
I'm just here cause your character good (truth be told)
A good nigga is rare to her (truth be told)
You heard it all  but hear this love
One night with dude  I be the reason you cool
Shawty straight like a concept on Bayonne Street
In the morning I slide over  she needs a ride I'm like
Tight  let's keep it AMG
Sliding down  precipitating is straight
Top down  let me kiss your physique
I'm digging your fleek  I'm checkin' your gear
Can tell you had a good year  spent a grip on your feet
She like when I drive it  I like it in park
Pull that thing over you likely to sore
I got her floating like riding on stars
So I keep it GPS  see where this going
Nothing will stop it  I slide in no prob
Ch-ch-chop it  my swipe your parts
Sex is her weapon  my snake in her garden
So know when I'm not here the viper is on
You put on a show  you don't need no clothes
Give me little bit more  always take it slow
I know you don't wanna stop  I'm trying to make it go
Now speed it up like a Maserati  and look at me and pose
Baby  you got a body like a Benz
And I'm just trying to drive it once again
Baby  you got a body like a Benz

 I wrote about her

 I didn't know how diverse my fan base was
 to be honest like
I promise you ain't never really freak out until you be out at freak hours and see each and every freak out from free couch to free couch
We go deep and we don't get no sleep
Cause we be up all night until the early light
We go deep and we don't get no sleep
Cause we be up all night until the early light
We go deep and we don't get no sleep
Cause we be up all night until the early light
We go deep and we don't get no sleep
Cause we be up all night until the early light
Man they really ain't serious
Do you know what type of women I've been dealing with?
I used to pop blues with my lil' chick
I call her boo cuz her real one I will forget
I use a Uber to scoop me to SLS
Do you know what type of women I've been dealing with?
Try to tell me adderall make her get a rush
Used to use it to study until she fell in love
Told me that lil buzz just make her think a lot
Nah Nah Nah
These women ain't serious
She sprinkled a little something up in her liq
I'm trying to get me a real woman to take out
They rather get it in

And my particular moon like a platoon and shit
You know the hitters that I'm dealing with
Politicians and niggas living it on the rip
And my position to give my lyrics to little kids
Is not official unless I'm giving them authentic
We're all living with small demons
Broads with us and they bong hitting
Let me tell you about the women I be chilling with
The really insecure ones look good in here
Nothing fill the void of a little pill
And it's hard to feel alive when you're feeling dead inside
Beside that the lime light be so real
Let me tell you about the bitches I be chilling with
Not enough for the hospital but cut it close
That's why she want to get high cuz she be feeling low
So I could numb her insides and we will never know

(My sincerest apologies  I mean it)
Look  I'll admit it  albeit pathetic
That I'm in my late 20s  still never been to a wedding
Guess the idea of that lobby empty do not sit with me well
It’s not your fault they try get me cause I'ma need the sales
Cause I'm selfish  and I need you to myself
Tryna see you afloat  but don't wanna see you excel
Cause I failed and see you 'bout to cry
Cause when I enter they city they leave without they pride
I'm sorry  and you starin' at my comments
Fearin' it's gone always be you sharin' me with all them
Wrong  how dare I say ignore them?
Preparing for that day I leave you here and switch you for them
It's hard  you know temptation and all
Bitches out here tryna see if my relationship's strong

Realest shit I ever wrote  if you ever knew love)
I’ll admit it  let me be hypothetic
The day I find a woman I prolly be scared to share it
The idea of me finding love  would run somebody off
And true my wall could use some plaques  but still I gotta floss
Brush you off  see I'm kinda lost
Now I'm up in the club with a couple of move ons
And dark  good nigga  troubled heart
Went from fallin' in love to drunk and fallin' apart
This is hard  tryna find some time to move on
Cause when we lost our baby  I got shady  shit got too dark
Soft  and I thank you baby  you strong
My ex before you married too  you solo  I say so long
Nah  good terms how that ended
But it surely put a dent on how I worry about this business
Off white picket fences  on flights with the children
On site stealin' kisses on off nights my intentions but
But I plan to do it better though
But you still sayin' let it go
We ain't gettin' any younger
Women love me now but in your eyes we forever though

Tryna keep it low
Keep 'em all on that need to know
Tell everybody that we're just friends
But to be honest that platonic shit's for TV shows
Case closed if they crack the code
Cause the feelings you ain't showin' pokin' out your clothes
Go put a sweater on or get a room
Lot of ways I can get to you
But my train of thought is tryna get you out your ch-ch-choo
Still we keep it low
Keep 'em all on that need to know
Could somebody tell somebody
I'm somebody and I'm sorry but somebody gon' need to go

 hope is killing me
 you don't care
 that indifference
 a nigga feelin' hopeless
 who am I to change perception?
 they gon' say it was self-defense
 coach shootin' at a foe
 not a damn givin'
 is my glasses confused?
 the life of a pioneer
 the Steebie show is on
 You niggas all hopeless
 hopeless
 he was told 6
 ain't shit here
 guarantee you'll make a blackjack
 look at what I go through to show you
 money respect power
 you ain't out here for the culture
 without a purpose
 of course not literal
 nigga...
I think I could save you
But I think I'm bipolar. I love you then I hate you
Grew with disdain though I hate whoever ain't you
Hate when I can't date you but I also need my space too
I made room for this love. How foolish of me
And every woman looking at you knew that you was lucky
So check the verse miss. I ain't say I'm perfect
But you was low on love  what I do  reimbursed it
And now it hurts to be around or converse with ya
And what’s worse is before this  I had worshiped you
Now war missiles hand guns and grenades
The walls I couldn't break em or take em apart with a tank
Now momma told me be careful who you love
G said just rap it up  these bitches actin up
And as for us  we was different though. Things have gotten difficult
Try to be Mr. perfect intercontinental  hold up
You spend your time with your friends all the time
And all that time with your friends put my momentum on decline
My minds gone evil. You changed with the season
You had a new clear heart. Guess I was Hiroshima
So when this war is over I'm not PTSD'ing
And I don't wanna leave her. But you know what got me wonderin'
I'm scared to lose love but even more scared to love again
You might also likeWhy we gotta argue
Why we gotta fight
I just wanna love you  I wanna make it right
It's like we both forgot what we were fightin' for
So tell me why are we at war
And nobody else can stop it
I'm catching myself depositing these feelings she withdraw from
And I ain't got the gall to tell my godzilla byebye
So I'm hurting. Me effort is apparent she not fertile
The anger I've adopted. The feelings been aborted
So now I press ignore if ever Cupid tried to call up
They call me better now. See when everything is stopped
And your loves in hindsight and you see everything its not
Notice everything it wasn't. Realizing why it shouldn't ever be again
Cause in the end its not about what you put in
Fuck kissing and hugging. They love pushing your buttons
New love is so beautiful. Time just makes it ugly
But fuck it I accept it. no longer will neglect it
If a period is late then I will mark it with a question
That mean I never trust em. And if you ever love them
Know that favorite girlfriends turn into crazy baby mommas
The war
Now why we gotta argue. Why we gotta fight
I just wanna love you. I wanna make it right
It's like we both forgot what we were fighting for
So tell me why are we at war?
Just another product of this matrix
This maze I'm in amazes me at times
I just wanted to be at peace with you
And if I gotta settle for a piece of you
Then I gotta say peace to you
With all due respect I do respect you enough to expect
Effort is all I ask
If we gonna last more  I gotta ask for more
And if that means that I'm askin for too much
I'm sure we'll end up as our last or...past
We bash
We blast
We shoot
We lose
Take this good advice
If they're gonna judge you for life
Say we can't always be fly
We gon' be good long as them sneakers white
You'll be alright
Said  you'll be alright
Said  you'll be alright
Said  you'll be alright
Gucci S. Dots  whole hood had 'em
Ice cream 'fore the hype beasts that's into fashion
When your black ass in a back class  the fronting was real
No Lauren London  we was on a budget
You know  sharin' Old Navy  so the army could be fresh in public
Where the sneaker stores and laundromats get all the money
'Cause it ain't 'bout what you're doin' but how ya lookin'
When they love you for your status and your catalog
And everybody got a jersey to play along
Back then the hoes checkin' for your zapatos
So even dirty niggas had the foams  you know?

Viotech trainers on the way to work
And we would quietly complain while Eric would lurk
That was the PG Plaza manager managin' us
Yeah  I'm standin' in Lucky 7's  but slingin' them Lugz
Still have them J's for the low  low  and I could get 'em early
But I'm not without a conscience  I see people out there hurtin'
Got 'em for Penny Foams that was bought at this very store
And I think that was my shift  then again  I'm not very sure
And that's a lot that can get to ya
When you're not sellin' drugs  but the outcome is similar
'Cause out come them niggas with pistols  tellin' you give 'em up
Now out come the moms with tissues 'cause you ain't give a fuck
Free lunch for everyone  income was very uh
On the 2nd and 16th  everyone would have every one
And Reebok would carry pump
And that's not the scary part
These niggas love white shoes so much  they'd be buried in them
I had a lady once stop me on the street. I was wearing white shoes. And she says  I'm glad you're sticking with the white shoes. She says  It makes me feel good.
You'll be alright
