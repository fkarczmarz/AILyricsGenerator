"He lifts me up and fades without a sound
He makes you know you feel
Like somewhere to go
Walking with a man called Sun
I think my journey's just begun
Do you think he'll mind?
And then he's gone
But you know you need him more
When he's gone

Walking with a man called Sun
I think my journey's just begun
Do you think he'll mind?

The radio plays the sounds we made
And everything seems to feel just right
Coming through your lonely mind
Well I've seen things
That scarred and bruised and left me blind
I think you need a little company
And how long will I run for?
Who am I running from?
And it makes sense
The youth coming up and making you dance
'Cause I've got some living inside of me
And how long will I run for?
Who am I running from?

But now I've seen my face in a cardboard wall
How long will I run for?
Who am I running from?
Teenage tears sting my eyeballs
In a town where I wasn't born
And I will never suffer
But now I've seen my face in a cardboard wall
If you're looking for
I'll be looking for you
If you're looking for me
Then I'm looking for you
If you're looking for me
Then I'm looking for you
If you're looking for me
He's coming from that same old road
You know the one your folks don't know
I want to see if you know me
I was born in a rented room
My mother didn't get no flowers
I'm alive with something inside of me
And I don't think I'm coming back
Let's spread it all around
Give me your powder and pills
I want to see if they cure my ills
I've no time for love and devotion
No time for old fashioned potion
I wanna see if you know me
Take a look into my eyes
I tell you so many lies and then I'll
I'll let you go into the night
I'm alive with something inside of me
And I don't think I'm coming down
I'm alive with something inside of me
And I can't seem to get it out

This is a tale of a northern soul
Looking for his way back home
And your speakers are telling the truth
Coming through right into your room on a river of sound
This is a tale of a northern soul
Looking for his way back home
And if he sees it I know I'll know
And if he sees it I know I'll know
And there's fighting on the street below
I know there's fighting on the street below
And I'm looking for a way back home
And I'm looking for a way back home
Too busy staying alive
Too busy staying alive
Wishing you was with me
Grant me a promise
Away from time and space
If only it could last
Tomorrow you'll be fine
We are only passing time
Billion grains left in the sand
And left the proof before
Let the apples grow to red
For I know where I stand
I'm standing here with you
I ain't got a single thing
And I ain't got a single thing
Some things stay
Some things return
Some days return
Breaking my heart
Breaking my heart
Breaking my heart
Stealing my soul
Your God can give me grace
God can forgive me
Oh Jesus forgive me
Lord I didn't know
Would I burn?
Lord I didn't leave you
You're walking in the race
I'm already there
Seen it all
I'm already there
Save your books and your pills
Save your books and your pills
You can do anythin' you want to
All you've gotta do is try
You can do anythin' you want to
All you've gotta do is try
I thought the best days had left me
My best years had left me behind
Then I watched them come
Then I watched them come back to me
And all the wild eyes
All the wild eyes know what I mean
If trees cut stars and eyes to heaven
(If trees cut stars and eyes to heaven
If my skin looks tired and old from living
I'll turn right back and live it again
(If my skin looks tired and old from living
I'll turn right back and live it again)
You better pray when the music stops
And you're left alone in your mind

Well that explains it
You were walking round like some kind of angel
Well that explains it
You know the thing you cannot trade or ever own
Does anybody know where we're really gonna go?
I was wondering if we've got that real soul
You know the thing we cannot trade or ever own
The sacred mood
Appalachian Springs
All my things
Took a step to the left
Took a step to the right
I saw myself and I wasn't quite right
Does anybody know where we're really gonna go?
I was looking for answers in a soul
In the feelings that a man can't control
I let the fire burn bright in the dead of night
Disappointed she'd get I told a lie
I said that I would never be on their side

Took a step to the right

I took a step to the left

And I saw myself and it wasn't quite right
I know which one I'm gonna end upon
You say you will but you never promised thoughts
A smile and a hand mix like water with sand
As far as you're concerned
A road and a sign I know which one catches my eyes
And then it all came to me
Sometimes I just don't know what I believe in
Don't you wanna know when I suffer
It doesn't show
A smile and a hand mix like water with sand don't you know?

I don't really need to live here

And all alone I'll help you
Conceived in a chrome dream I was a crease
In the shirt that this world wears
Loosen up who do you wanna be?
We could steal a car and listen to the stars
I can see you've choked on them too
Had enough of late night films
Just shelve them for an hour or two
Spike danced for ten days long
We were just heading for the sun
You shot him down there's blood on my face
His heart's in the right place

Trying to find out the reasons why?
Baby don't believe them when they say it
Love is just a feeling that you give
You’re the universe and you'll know all I need

And I'm proud to be here
But when my lover cries  I feel his tears
I was gonna drive you home
I was going to tell you who I wanted
We came back to the same place
We didn't speak  just danced in our minds
Oh lover  I know this ain't what it should be

I've been here since I can remember when
My life is a boat  being blown by you
With nothing ahead  just the deepest blue
To me you're like a setting sun
You rise then you're gone
To me you're like a setting sun
You rise then you're gone
Come back  come back again and again
I've been here since I can remember when
The world just spins whilst mine stands still
Nothing's changed in your gravity grave
To me you're like a setting sun
You shine then you're gone
To me you're like a setting sun
You shine then you're gone
Go down on your light
So bright it burns my eyes
Sounds like a perfect way
To end my life
To me you're like a setting sun
Behind where the old Thames does flow
And in every face I meet
Reminds me of what I have run from
That living is for other men
I hope you do understand
I've got to tell you my tale
Of how I loved and how I failed
I hope you understand
These feelings should not be in the man
I hope that I know
So come with me in bed
There ain't nothing left to say
When I will get you alone

And I'm living for history
And I think you know about me
Cause I am
And one and one is two
But three is company
When you're thinking about the things you do
And you're thinking about the things you do
I want to tell you my tale
How I fell in love and jumped out on my bail
Do you understand?
There's more in a smile than in a hand
There's one thing that you might have missed
And why am I going to
A place that now belongs to you?
But you were mean and so am I
It is mine
Is that a crime?
Is that a crime?
This life is mine
I've got a skin full of dope
Rows and rows of red bricks
I see black cars
Some blood-stained exit
I get this feeling that I
I've been here before
How many lives will I waste?
How many tears must I taste
Before my freedom?
Ah-ah-ah
Before my freedom?
Ah-ah-ah
I see mountains
Blood-red sunsets
I see a billion stars
Love deafened and betrayed

Only feelings
Feelings
Only feelings
And for a dream to happen
Gotta let it go
You let it go
You let it go
But there must be
Some answer
Need to wait
You let it go
I'm running
In the sky
Slipping round
Hold me up high
Woohoo
The dream's just begun
The dream's just begun
I know you're still holding on
Too much emotion
Dragging me down
Ready for the game
Take a line of fickle flame
Imagine the future
Woke up with a scream
I was buying some feelings
From a vending machine
Say that I will see
Something more than I have
There's something inside of me
Crying out for something else
And if someone hears this scream
Put it in a letter to me

Walk on soles that are made in China?
Through the bright prosaic malls
And the corridors that go on and on and on
Are we blind - can we see?
Are we blind - in the shade?
Love is these blues that I'm singing again
Will those feet in modern times
Understand this world's affliction?
Recognize the righteous anger?
Understand this world's addiction?
I was blind - couldn't see
What was here in me
I was blind - insecure

It's just a change in me  something in my liberty
Happiness  coming and going
I watch you look at me  watch my fever growing

But how many corners do I have to turn?
How many times do I have to learn

Happiness  something in my own place

Another Friday night waiting for a revelation
I can see a million faces in the condensation
In a moment you'd changed
Things weren't the same
You were talking at me not with me
And your tongue was burning up in flames
In a moment you'd changed (Are you coming back?)
Things weren't the same (Are you coming back?)
When Monday comes you'll be alone
With the whole world staring at you
Hey  my friend  are we gonna make it till Monday?
You said I suffer from inner frustration
In a moment you changed
Things weren't the same
You were talking at me not with me
And your tongue was burning up in flames
In a moment you changed (And when you turn him off)
Things weren't the same (Where does he go?)
You were talking at me not with me (Where've the years gone?)
And your tongue was burning up in flames (I don't know)
In a moment you changed (Hey  my friend  are we gonna make it till Monday?)
Things weren't the same
You were talking at me not with me (Hey  my friend  are we gonna make it till Monday?)
He was restless
Escape loneliness
Find a new address
Stood before I sink
In a neon wilderness
Spilled my last drink (He was restless)
Said goodbye to my new friends (Escape loneliness)
In a neon wilderness
He was restless
Escape loneliness
And I don't like the way that the pills you take
They just keep you down
Shiny little minds
Trying to find my way in life
String of broken hearts
Never wanna see you cry
Never wanna see you burn
To get close to you
Shiny little minds
Trying to find my way in life
String of broken hearts
I never wanna see you cry
Never wanna see you die
'Cause I never wanna see you cry

She took me into a wind blown alley way
She showed me a world a boy should see
I'll thank her till the day that I die
No knock on my door
Believe it till you see what living has done to me
And I'm sure that I need holding
I took her to a room and I showed her myself
She made me feel proud and I was thankful

A face in the crowd

Seven suns

She got my love
Got my head

And I don't want it to go
I can feel her love

Got my hand
Took the dreams
Right outta my head
She bought the world
I paid the bills
I took those pills
It was wind in her sails

She's in the air
And I don't want it to go
I can feel her love
 I often wonder
 I fall to pieces
 her cheeks like peaches
 we are mistaken
 Lord

 Lord
I wonder if you're here just to use my mind
Don't take it slow
You know I've got a place to go
You always do that
Something I'm not quite sure of
But just for today
Let go and slide away
I was thinking maybe we could go outside
Let the night sky cool your foolish pride
Don't you feel alive
These are your times and our highs
So take your time
Because you always do that something
Something I'm not quite sure of
But just for today
Let go and slide away
'Cause I read your mind
I read it because it takes me where I can't find
Because you always do that something
Something I'm not quite sure of
But just for today
Let go and burn away

Roll my die
Change this life
You said this movie was mine
But now you go and change your mind
This is my life
So it goes
You come in on your own in this life
You know you leave on your own
'Cause I don't need no cause
When my feelings fall
You showed me things I didn't want to see
I don't believe that love is free
Sure fine way to treat a man

Eyes open wide
Looking at the heavens with a tear in my eye

To keep our love alive
We have existence and it's all we share
There ain't no real truth

Keep on pushin' cause I know it's there
It's all right (It's all right)
Let me sleep tonight
Tonight (It's all right)
Make it all seem fine
I just can't make it alone
I just can't make it alone
There'll be no lullabies
There'll be no tears cried
We feel numb 'cause we don't see
That if we really care
And we really loved
Think of all the joy we'd feel

Callin' out I can see you
Hello  it's me  cryin' out
Cryin' out  are you there?
Hello  it's me  it's me
I want to touch you
It's me throwing stones from the stars
On your mixed-up world
Been sailin' round for twenty years
And in that time I've seen all the fires and all the liars
I've been callin' home for twenty years
And in that time I heard the screams rebound to me while you were making history
I could see the fire
And I'll throw the fire back down
And I'll throw it back down
It grows and grows and grows
How my life seemed to change in a matter of days
The heavens break I am walking tall
How come change always seems to bring the rain
So hop on the train Cause it kills the pain
Blues player going to another town
Believe me this boy here is sinking
Just drinking
 my love
 they just make you worse
 they just make you worse
 then just let me know
 they just make you worse
 just like you said
 I'm better off dead
 waiting to drown
 they just make you worse
 just like you said
 I'm better off dead
 then just let me know
 they just make you worse
 I know I'll see your face again
 I know I'll see your face again
I got one more life
Can you see it wasting away?
Do you understand?

Because the day has come when you have won
It's myself I fear
She calls me  calls me
I know it's not for today
Alone in my room  you're there on the floor
Open up your eyes  let me get inside
Learned to love on TV  learned to come on TV
Can I help you?
Can I guide you?
It amazes me how I broke free
Then got brought back in
'Cause when the feelings there
Shattered and scared
Alone in my room  you're there on the floor
Open up your eyes  let me get inside
Said you learned to come on TV  then hold onto me
Can I help you?
Can I guide you?

For being born without a silver spoon
Stood at the top of a hill
Over my town I was found
I've been on the shelf too long
Sitting at home in my bed too long
Got my things and now I'm gone
How's the world gonna take me?
Finding myself used to be hard
But now I see the light
If love is a drug
Then I don't need it
I've been on the shelf too long
Sitting at home in my bed too long
Now it's time to hear my song
How are you gonna take it?
I've been on the shelf too long
Think the words without the song
Never had a way to go
Tell me now I'll take it

Jesus never saved me
I've got a little sticker on the back of my boot
This is music
And now I see the light shining bright in my eyes
If love is the drug then it ain't for me
Well music is my life
And loved by me
I'm gonna move on the floor with my sweet young thing
Down down down we go till we reach the bottom
You know that all I see are things I coulda changed
I should have done
Where did the good times go?
Good times so hard to hold
Looking back on my life
You know that all I see are things I coulda changed
I could have done
No time for sad lament
A wasted life is bitter spent
So rise into the light
In or out of time
I'm gonna rise straight through the light
In or out of time
Woke up another day
The pain won't go away
I am growing
In peculiar ways
Into a light I pass

How do you stop yourself from giving in?
Seems like the whole world is frying

She got all I need
When it comes to my valium skies
She don't mind if I cry

How do you stop the world from imploding?

We hide our eyes and our lungs ache
Ain't nothin' strange
It was in our hands from 6 to 10
It slipped right out again
There'll be no better time

There'll be no better day to save me
Save me
I hope you see like I see
I hope you see what I see
I hope you feel like I feel
And the world don't stop
There is no time for cracking up
Believe me friend

You know it has to end
