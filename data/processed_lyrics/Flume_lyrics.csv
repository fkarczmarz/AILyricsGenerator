"Tread lightly  get ready to explode
Hush now  those eyes cannot harm you
Keep your wits about  don't let it bring you down
Don't let it bring you down
Don't let it bring you down
Don't let it bring you down
Don't let it bring you down
Don't let it bring you down
Don't let it bring you down
How can we disguise this awful truth?
I've seen it all before  your eyes are wet
Your head is on the floor
And it's only a matter of time
Before we hit the ground running  running
Don't let it bring you down
Don't let it bring you down
Don't let it bring you down
Don't let it bring you down
Don't let it bring you down
Don't let it bring you down
How can we disguise this awful truth?

Hush now  you're standing on a land mine
Tread lightly  get ready to explode
Hush now  your eyes cannot harm you
Keep your wits about  don't let it bring you down
And never let go
And I'm afraid of being too wrong
And I'm afraid of being too wrong in this side  oh
Don't let it bring you down
Don't let it bring you down
Don't let it bring you down
Don't let it bring you down

I could tell you what the Porsche cost  what my wrist like
What a brick weigh  what your bitch like
Ace bottles and late models  niggas happy with the base model
Fashion God from Bape model  they follow
I'm the culture  KRS in a roadster
My bitch got the poker face  she a soldier
Might let you fuck just so she can show me the safe
Yugh! I did live through drug wars  open suicide doors
Fuck the bitch on mink floors but it ain't enough
Yugh! Seen the world on these tours  pour champagne 'til I'm bored
Yugh! I partied off shores but it ain't enough  yugh!
Motivate or I can be a menace  you got two choices
I got one chopper  I'm hearing voices
I'm seeing visions  these Rolls Royces
Oyster perpetual lifestyle  look at the watch on me right now
Bezel blinding like a bright cloud
It's a drug dealer's dream
Everything that I say is everything that I mean
Let's weigh it up

Real shooter's on deck  but it ain't enough
Her girlfriend brought the checks  she ain't enough
Everybody get the tech  all you niggas hit the deck
Bitches think he got next  but it ain't enough
Fuckin' fantastic
Television show  a sitcom classic
Fuzzy screen static
Bad milk got my Raisin Bran tasting bad
Getting fibre-tastic
Say you'll go  say you're someone imagined
Life's lookin' tragic
Think Finn is the raddest  Jake is past it
Little yellow bastard
What a romantic
Heart is full on acid
Jenny bitchin' 'bout her ex again  making me
Melodramatics
Intergalactic
Warmth fast be escaping me  escaping me
Life in the attic
It's automatic

All the way up to the highest building
I didn't look down on the way in
(All the way up to the highest building)
Everything you said I believed it
Dedicated to the maze  the illusion
The only one path  one decision
Was the way up to the highest building
(All the way up to the highest building)
Thousand stories to climb
On my own (Oh  oh)
But all I've found was a thousand more (Oh  oh)
Waiting there in an ocean of clouds (Oh)
When there's nowhere to go
Find your way to the ground
Baby  baby  I'vе been where you told me
All thе way up to the highest building
I didn't look down on the way in
(All the way up to the highest building)
Every single step  I could hear you
Dedicated to the maze  I could feel you
The only one path  one decision
Was to detonate the highest building

Shimmering this way forth
All seems too clear
Let it wash over me
Don't disappear
Visions are hyperreal

Don't deserve it

Guess I'm sick of things being the same
Just recycling things I thought were true when I was younger
Let it wash over me

You don't even have to be brave

And I'm Tom Cruise  you know what I'm saying?
Speeding through  man
Ohio  what up? Uh
Aight!
All you niggas' days is numbered
I'm speeding past niggas  Days of Thunder
Tom Cruise  been bombin' crews since the pager numbers
Lumberjack brown tats  started jackin' with the gold up under
A dope boy without selling dope
Twist a tree  inhale the smoke
Money the colour of Cuban coke
Cuban chains and gold ropes
Black flags  black locs
Triple gold Dayton spokes
Triple stacks pourin' fo'
Rubber band  my stacks is dough
This is old money from '94
Buckets  no bench seats when I roll
I roll my windows down and turn my music up
Hit the switch and drop it low
808s and tons of low end
And light another one  this made the smoke end
Don't hop yo' ass in if you ain't down to roll in (Roll in)
'Cause they don't understand that shining bright
They can't understand this kind of life
When you sittin' clean behind halogen lights
They start throwin' Hollows out of spite
Tryin' to take your life
I came from the wrong side of the tracks
Tryin' to make it right
When they turn white to green
Young niggas turn to fiends at fifteen
Wiggled out  shootin' AR-15s and Glock nines
Bullet holes in every stop sign
Ignore cop signs  they kill one of us? Then a cop dyin'
Drop-top riding  middle finger to the wind
And I keep poppin' iron 'til all my niggas win
And every nigga with me sittin' on gold rim
Been wanting that since Maximums with the gold trim
My dog's been in all gold before the gold trend
Dead stock Jordan 10s  orange juice and Seagram's gin
Turned onto all of that before the age of ten
Fluffy leaves on that green stem gettin' rolled up
A nigga come from another city  he get fold up
And girls with they nose up  acting like they ain't slut
White boys get they nose stuffed with that pure uncut
Man  this world where I'm livin' at
That's why I rap through these songs down to my Fifty cap
I said  this world where I'm livin' at
That's why I rap through these songs to my Fifty cap
To my Fifty cap
So raw where I'm living at
It's just a sound beating of my lobes
It's just a sound beating of my lobes
It's just a sound beating of my lobes
It's just a sound beating of my lobes
It's just a sound beating of my lobes
Goin' down but not for long
Got no love to be someone
All I want is to be left alone
Left alone
Cannot swallow blue found proud
All I need is softened bones
Breathe in sorrow
Gonna watch you fake it now
And I take it all at a loss
Breathe in sorrow
Gonna watch you fake it now
And I take it all at a loss
Breathe out sorrow

Make your decisions now  weigh it up
Facing a long road down or keeping your head above
Saying the same thing twice won’t make it right
Held up in your desires  but

Does it matter when you act like this?
Yeah  you got into something
Let it take control of you  oh
'Cause you say it but you won’t admit it  oh
Numb and getting colder  physical existence disappears
Said you begged to leave

If I feel like losing my mind

I should have been making up my mind
And now I'm running out of time
Sometimes I dream about going back
Keeping all the things I left behind
But now I know you can't change the past

And it all comes rushing back
I feel the gravity pulling me
Faster than it ever has before
Had me rush out of the door
Looking at old pictures on the floor

All these faces lookin' funny when I'm drivin' by
Headed to my whip  my name is buzzin'
Know they plan on killin' mine
Aim it at your temple  we were taught to kill a nigga mind
Genocide buried in the tide  cleanse it in the sand
Blood is sittin' in my hands  I'll never be the bigger man
I know they'll never understand  but I don't give a fuck
Lift your hands up high before I stick you up  yeah
I held you to the ground 'cause you were floating
Told me you're afraid of disappointing
Pushing on your physical existence
Pushing only 'cause you felt resistance
Can't help but think about the situation
Tryna get to sleep but my mind's racing
Only got each other we can turn to
Lying here  I know they'll never break you free
You and me nobody else
If it can't be that way then I'll just be all by myself
I love the way you stay away from me  you make me melt
Those nights you used to come and stay with me
Replaying in my memory  it's no such thing as meant to be
The way you leave your mark
Just can't break you from my thoughts
Walkin' through Ramona Park like they wasn't tryna shoot me up
Doing all we did  we still ain't do enough

Leaving through the night and starting fires
Going through society's desires
Smoke and retribution  keep it burning
Only 'cause of sorrow I'll be learning
Can't help but think about the situation
Tryna get to sleep but my mind's racing
Only got each other we can turn to
Lying here  I know they'll never break you free
Nah  I ain't scared of six feet
'Cause I ain't scared to be free
All I seen while on this earth
Know that hearse can't be too worse
Tell the woman that I hurt
That I apologize for all my lies
And tell my mama blame my karma
Hate she had to see me die
I just wanna see the sky
Shinin' from the other side
Lookin' down on all my friends
Makin' sure they're walkin' right
'Cause ain't nobody watch our back
And this life way too hard for that
I made it out with my heart intact
Something warm that I could say  but I admit it won't come
Somehow I don't care  though I love the clothes she wears
And I love her body bare  bare
Don't think that I can't see it in your eyes
Some minds are better kept apart
Here  I pass the day in a most peculiar way
Watching ships out in the bay and I swallow so hard
Am I too weak to fight? As the day becomes the night
And I don't want to be right  right
Don't think that I can't see it in your eyes
Some minds are better kept apart
I pray that it won't feel the same  and
Don't think that I can't see it in your eyes
Can't stop spacing  on a daydream
Can't stop spacing
And when I'm on the ground
My feet square on the ground
My head up in the clouds
Looking down  out of this town
You know I gotta try
My fuckin' brain's on fire
Just gotta toke again  after that
Can't stop spacing out  oh  no
Can't stop spacing  on a daydream
Yo  yeah  nigga
Shoot 'em all  show 'em right now
Yo  yo  ayo
Starin' at ya sweatin' my Wallys
My mind got vivid thoughts of what I'm supposed to be doin'
Got the blue and the cream  me and Rah blowin' steam
Sittin' with Tarantin'  nigga stackin' the green
Roll rockin'  fan fuckin'
Snatchin' up mics at award shows  rollin' up O's
Wu clothes  my flows are so detrimental
Space cadet keep a cassette of instrumentals
Sling-slang the track like dick the hoes
Super intelligent  verbally diminish the pros
A visionary  my mind's like a rhyme war zone
You can't postpone the inevitable  king of the thrones
Ghostface

Stretching your big wings over waters turning gold
Will you be the one to take a chance?
Will you be the one to take a stand
Make the girls dance
Spill your thoughts
Will you be the one to take a chance?
Will you be the one to take a stand
Make the girls dance
You could break up clouds with your fist in the air
We're singing out loud as we march up the square
He always goes to put you in your place
And now you're chanting out loud so you can't be erased

All the faces you read
When the grass ain't green
When you fix everything
I don't know about you
But I got to get it out and I don't know how soon
But if we die
I want to bring the whole thing
Who cares about a game
When it's all been replaced?
Each level feels the same
It really goes either way
I don't know about you
But I got to get it out and I don't know how soon
But if we die
I want to bring the whole thing

Now did I  think I better go home?
All I said I needed was gone
But I thought I heard it all wrong
Now can it ever be a safe place?
When they never seem to forget
So it hurted more than you said
Burn it down inside of your head
Oh  she is following me in my head when I am all alone
(Why can't I go down into her world?)
Thinking of her every time I want to try to let her go
But it's never easy when you think you have it in control
Somehow you get caught up in the moment and you never know
All these tiny cities that you're holding in your little hand
(Why can't I go down into her world?)
Glittering like diamond lights that blow away in desert sand
It was never perfect and was never meant to last
It was never perfect and was never meant to last

You know I trust in reason that I would go back
And I'm over you
And I better make it and not go back

If they would’ve listened I coulda kept my cool today
Put some bread on his head and make sure he arrive
They said they had ‘em in one of my warehouses by the dock
Pillow case on his head and the blood stains dried up
The moment I been waiting for is finally here
Who I seen? My little niece boyfriend I seen
Why should I spare this maggot life to live?
I lit the match and watched his frame go up in flames

But not if you use caution"
