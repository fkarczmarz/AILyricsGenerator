"Disconnected from the world again
So why you keep acting like I don't exist?
I'd set myself on fire to feel the burn
I'm scared that I'm never gonna be repaired
Reliving my memories and they're killing me one by one
Sabotaged myself again
Got a brain like a hurricane
Got me sinking to a dark place (Outta love)
Evil twin under the staircase (Oh my God)
Think I'm looking at a long night

Reliving my memories and they're killing me one by one
And I'm staring into the void again
No one knows what a mess I'm in
The voices in my head say I'm just being paranoid
Reliving my memories and they're killing me one by one
 slay the infidel
 heretic
 my brethren)
 the child is possessed
 my brethren)
 just let me
 corrupted our faith
 purify
There's a few quid to be made
(Worms come out of the woodwork) And the snakes start to sing
Do you feel the chill clawing at the back of your neck?
I start to spill  did you really think that you could fix me?
They'll sell your bones for another roll
Worms come out of the woodwork
Leeches crawl from out of the dirt
Rats come out of the holes they call home
I fall apart and the snakes start to sing
Don't say I'm better off dead
'Cause Heaven's full and Hell won't have me
Won't you make some room in your bed?
Well  you could lock me up in your heart and throw away the key
Won't you take me out of my head?
Never was and never ever will be
Never was and never ever will be

If you can't soar with the eagles  then don't fly with the flock
Are you still getting high?
Did you catch your own reflection in the knife my mother held?
Or the hell in my father's eyes?
If you can't soar with the eagles  then don't fly with the flock
Are you still getting by?
Was I your knight in shining armour  the apple of your eye?
Or just a step to climb?
If you can't soar with the eagles  then don't fly with the flock
Are you still getting high?
Did you catch your own reflection in the knife my mother held?
Or the hell in my father's eyes?
If you can't soar with the eagles  then don't fly with the flock
Are you still getting by?
Was I your knight in shining armour or the apple of your eye?
I'm sick to death of swallowing every single thing I'm fed
Middle fingers up if you don't give a fuck
You think you're changing anything? Question everything
The ones you think guard you are out for your blood
But what exactly do you think you're gonna do?
Give up 'cause you're making it so much worse
Middle fingers up if you don't give a fuck
I'm sick to death of swallowing every single thing I'm fed
Middle fingers up if you don't give a fuck
You think you're changing anything? Question everything
Self-serving pricks
If you really believe in the words that you preach
Get off your screens and onto the streets
There will be no peaceful revolution
No war without blood
You can say I'm just a fool that stands for nothing

Middle fingers up if you don't give a fuck
You think you're changing anything? Question everything
Middle fingers up if you don't give a fuck
I'm sick to death of swallowing every single thing I'm fed
Middle fingers up if you don't give a fuck
 'cause I can't keep wondering why
 I feel myself go under
 my heart has frozen over
 'cause I feel like suicide
 'cause I'm running out of time
 now what can you prescribe?
 I feel myself go under
 my heart has frozen over
 'cause the square doesn't fit the circle
 'cause my head wasn't wired for this world
 'cause the square doesn't fit the circle
 'cause my head wasn't wired for this world
 I feel myself go under
 my heart has frozen over
 'cause a square doesn't fit the circle
 'cause my head wasn't wired for this world
 'cause a square doesn't fit the circle
It's blasphemy  but the words don't make sense no more
What would your mother say? Your faith has you immured
So don't try and tell me that you still believe
No  don't preach to me
Ask no questions and you'll get no lies
Turn the cheek and blind the eye
Let it go…
Bend the knee and give away your life
Bite your tongue and close your mind
Never know…
'Cause you got hell to pay  but you already sold your soul
It's blasphemy  but the words don't make sense no more
What would your mother say? Your faith has you immured
So don't try and tell me that you still believe
No  don't preach to me

It makes no sense  but it must be right
The blood and sweat you sacrificed
Was it all… for nothing?
'Cause we've found no sign and we've seen no light
We hear no voice when we pray at night
But we swore… and now it's too late to turn back
You're not blessed  you're cursed
And it's getting worse now
You got hell to pay  but you already sold your soul
It's blasphemy  but the words don't make sense no more
What would your mother say? Your faith has you immured
So don't try and tell me that you still believe
No  don't preach to me
No  don't preach to me
Don't preach to me (You're not blessed  you're cursed)
No  don't preach to me (And it's getting worse now)

It's on the tip of my tongue

And I'm gonna keep it
Now fallin' and failin' is all I know
This disease is getting worse
The only thing I really know: I can't sleep at night
I'm buried but breathing in regret
I'm buried but breathing in regret
I've got a secret

Think my angel's fallen
Safe place plundered
Bastards kicked the doors in
Don't give a fuck if my heart stops beating
My dark side won today
My heart keeps breaking
Over and over
Can't trust myself tonight
My heart keeps breaking
Can you talk me off the ledge again?
Something haunts me
Footsteps in the basement
Out of body
But there's no escaping

A sickness taking over

Maybe I won't miss me when I'm gone
My dark side won today
My heart keeps breaking
Over and over
Can't trust myself tonight
My heart keeps breaking
Can you talk me off the ledge again?
Can't trust myself tonight
Can't trust myself tonight
Can't trust myself
The dog won't stop barking and I think my TV is bust
Every channel is the same  it's sending me insane
And earlier  somebody bit me  what a fucking day
The sky is falling  it's fucking boring
I'm going braindead  isolated
God is a shithead and we're his rejects
Traumatised for breakfast
I can't stomach anymore Survival Horror
Dear diary  I feel itchy like there's bugs under my skin
The dog's gone rabid (Shut the fuck up!) doing my head in
I keep fading in and out  I don't know where I've been
I feel so hungry  what the hell is happening?
The sky is falling  it's fucking boring
I'm going braindead  isolatеd
God is a shithead and we're his rеjects
Traumatised for breakfast

You know that I'd die for you

Let me see my halo  even though it's painful
I'm prepared to lose
You know that I'd die for  I'd cry for
You know that I'd die for you
I keep holding my breath for a miracle
Hoping the hole in my heart would've healed somehow
Feeling so fucking close to the edge right now
You know you're everything I hate  wish I could escape
But you know I would die for you
You know that I'd die for  I'd cry for
You know that I'd die for you

This isn't love  this is a bloodbath
This isn't love  this is a sentence
It's a bullet in the head (It's a bullet in the head)
This isn't love  this is a car crash
This isn't love  this is a bloodbath
This isn't love  this is a sentence
It's a bullet in the head

You know that I'd die for you (I'd die for you)
You know that I'd breathe for  I'd bleed for
You know that I'd breathe for you
Let me see my halo  even though it's painful
I'm prepared to lose
You know that I'd die for  I'd cry for
Got out alive but with scars  I can't forget
This kid back in school  subdued and shy
An orphan and a brother and unseen by most eyes
I don't know what it was that made a piece of him die
Took a boy to the forest  slaughtered him with a scythe
Stamped on his face  an impression in the dirt
Do you think the silence makes a good man convert?
We all have our horrors and our demons to fight
But how can I win when I'm paralysed?
They crawl up on my bed  wrap their fingers 'round my throat
Is this what I get for the choices that I made?
God  forgive me for all my sins
God  forgive me for everything
God  forgive me for all my sins
Don't go  I can't do this on my own
Don't go  I can't do this on my own
Save me from the ones that haunt me in the night
I can't live with myself  so stay with me tonight

Before we make you swallow it?
It's moments like this where silence is golden (Golden)
And then you speak
No one wants to hear you
No one wants to see you
So desperate and pathetic  I'm begging you to spare me
The pleasure of your company
When did the diamonds leave your bones?
I'm burning down every bridge we made
I'll watch you choke on the hearts you break
I'm bleeding out every word you said
Go to hell  for heaven's sake

I've had enough
There's a voice in my head  says I'm better off dead
But if I sing along a little fucking louder
To a happy song  I'll be alright
You want to give up
Gave it all that you've got and it still doesn't cut
But if you sing along a little fucking louder
Every now and again we get that feeling
And the great big void inside us opens up
And I really wish that you could help  but my head is like a carousel
And I'm going 'round in circles  I'm going 'round in circles

And I really wish that you could help  but my head is like a carousel
And I'm going 'round in circles  I'm going 'round in circles
The world has coalesced
Into one giant mess of hate and unrest
So let's all sing along a little goddamn louder
To a happy song and pretend it's all okay (Let's go)
So let's sing along

Even Hell can get comfy once you've settled in
I just wanted the numb inside me to leave
No matter how fucked you get
Sorrow is there when you come back down
There's glimpses of heaven in every day
I just had to start again
The days are a deathwish
A witch-hunt for an exit
I am powerless
Sit in circles and stay unspoken
We are powerless
Because we all walk alone on an empty staircase
Silent halls and nameless faces
I am powerless
Why explore the universe when we don't know ourselves?
There's an emptiness inside our heads that no one dares to dwell

(How do I) Form a connection when we can't even shake hands?
You're like a phantom greeting me
We plot in the shadows  hang out in the gallows
Stuck in a loop for eternity

Will you retry or let the pain resume?
I need a new leader  we need a new Luden
So come outside  it's time to see the tide
It's out of sight  but never out of mind
I need a new leader  we need a new Luden
Sticks and stones may break my bones but soon the sting will pass
But names can dig so many graves  you won't know where to stand
And I don't feel secure no more unless I'm being followed
And the only way to hide myself is to give 'em one hell of a show

I bit off more than I could chew when I looked closer

On the verge of no return  why'd you keep fucking it up?
Don't wanna have to bury you  but nothing seems to get through your skull
One day  the only butterflies left will be in your chest
As you march towards your death  breathing your last breath
I hate to say I told you so  but look how the bruises show
Tell me  how's it gonna feel
Without my arms wrapped around  wrapped around you?
Bet it feels pretty real when your skin starts to peel from the bone
You were dead to the world  now I'm dead to you
Haunting your own house  nothing to lose
How did I let you sink your fangs so deep? Ah-ah
You know you can't breathe on your own
Past the point of rescuing  why'd I keep pushing my luck?
The hole I wore into your soul has got too big to overlook
One day  the only butterflies left will be in our chests

The sun is setting on our love  I fear
Letting our loneliness out into the atmosphere
The tide is turning on our chance to turn it 'round (Love isn't in the air  love isn't in the air)
I never thought I'd see my fingernails fall out (Love isn't in the air  love isn't in the air)
Love isn't in the air  love isn't in the air
