Beyond life
You will find your song
Before sound
To be found
Close your eyes and rise
Higher still
Endless thrill
To the land of love
Beyond love
Come alive
Angel eye
Forever watching you and I
You are the light behind a cloud
You are the end and the beginning
A world where time is not allowed
There's no such thing as competition
This is a journey of the soul
The perfect song is framed with silence
It speaks of places never seen
Your home's a promise long forgotten
It is the birthplace of your dreams

She says I'm cold
Only time I'm comfortable kissing is sending X and Os
Whatever happened to our phone sex?
I broke her heart on the email
I can't even tell y'all whats real

She got jealous I was tappin' on my Blackberry

Am I that unaffectionate?

She said it got better and worser
And it's supposed to be vice-versa
We used to see tears when we hurt stuff
I guess it got faster but colder
That's better than not seeing her
And I'm so glad I'm serving her like Serena
She can YouTube in the arena

What's going on? Could this be my understanding?
It's not your fault I was being too demanding
All because I hoped that you'd be someone different
There's not much I know about you
Fear will always make you blind

It's amazing what you'll find face to face

I turned away because I thought you were the problem
But when I faced you in my blank confusion
It really didn't make sense

It really didn't make sense
Just to leave this unresolved
It's not hard to go the distance
Letting the sunlight into my eyes
Our only plan is to improvise
And it's crystal clear that I don't ever want it to end
Keep building these random memories
Turning our days into melodies
But since I can't stay
I'll just keep playing back these fragments of time
Everywhere I go these moments will shine
I'll just keep playing back these fragments of time
Everywhere I go these moments will shine
Familiar faces I've never seen
Living the gold and the silver dream
Making me feel like I'm seventeen
And it's crystal clear that I don't ever want it to end
Keep building these random memories
Turning our days into melodies
But since I can't stay

I definitely wanted to become a musician
It was almost impossible because—it was—the dream was so big
That I didn't see any chance because
I was living in a little town  was studying
And when I finally broke away from school and became a musician
I thought  Well  now I may have a little bit of a chance
Because all I really wanted to do is music
And not only play music  but compose music
So  I would take my car  would go to a discotheque
Sing maybe thirty minutes
I think I had about seven  eight songs
I would partially sleep in the car
Because I didn't want to drive home and that helped me for about
Almost two years to survive in the beginning
I wanted to do an album with the sounds of the '50s
The sounds of the '60s  of the '70s
And then have a sound of the future
And I said  Wait a second  I know the synthesizer
Why don't I use the synthesizer which is the sound of the future?
And I didn't have any idea what to do
But I knew I needed a click  so we put a click on the 24-track
Which then was synced to the Moog Modular
I knew that could be a sound of the future
But I didn't realize how much the impact would be
My name is Giovanni Giorgio
But everybody calls me Giorgio

I don't want any other  two old friend coincidences
I don't wanna play any other game
Born a simpler day
It's not how we used to do
It's not true  it's not right
It's not how we used to do
It's not true  it's not right
It's not how we used to do
What he does  he does well
He does well and he knows  he knows it
Lay down  just lay down
I was crossed in the border  we were waiting in a line
I don't want any other  two old friend coincidencеs
Voice inside my head  dinnеr's at mine or yours?

I don't wanna say  what he wants to know
Born a simpler day

I thought of everything I'd never regret
A little time with you is all that I get
That's all we need because it's all we can take
One thing I never see the same when you're 'round
I wanna take you to that place in the Roche
But no one gives us any time anymore
He asks me once if I'd look in on his dog
I got this picture of us kids in my head
And all I hear is the last thing that you said
And we will never be alone again
'Cause it doesn't happen every day
Kinda counted on you being a friend
Can I give it up or give it away?
Now I thought about what I wanna say
But I never really know where to go
So I chained myself to a friend
'Cause I know it unlocks like a door
And we will never be alone again
'Cause it doesn't happen every day
Kinda counted on you being a friend
Can I give it up or give it away?
Now I thought about what I wanna say
But I never really know where to go
So I chained myself to a friend
Some more again

It didn't matter what they wanted to see
He thought he saw someone that looked just like me
The summer memory that just never dies
We worked too long and hard to give it no time
Cracks in the road that I would try and disguise
He runs his scissors at the seam in the wall
He cannot break it down or else he would fall
One thousand lonely stars hiding in the cold
And we will never be alone again
'Cause it doesn't happen every day
Kinda counted on you being a friend
Can I give it up or give it away?

I might not be the right one
But there's something about us I want to say
'Cause there's something between us anyway
I might not be the right one
It might not be the right time
But there's something about us I've got to do
Some kind of secret I will share with you
I need you more than anything in my life
I want you more than anything in my life
I'll miss you more than anyone in my life

Touch  touch

Where do I belong?
Touch  I need something more
I remember touch
I need something more in my mind
Touch  I remember touch
Pictures came with touch
A painter in my mind
Tell me what you see
A tourist in a dream
A visitor  it seems
A half-forgotten song
Where do I belong?
Tell me what you see
I need something more
Kiss  suddenly alive
Happiness arrive
Hunger like a storm
How do I begin?
A room within a room
A door behind a door
Touch  where do you lead?
I need something more
Tell me what you see
I need something more

There's a world within me that I cannot explain
Looking for someone
I need to know now
Please tell me who I am
Looking for someone
I need to know now
Please tell me who I am
There are so many things that I don't understand
There's a world within me that I cannot explain
(Where are the locks to try the key?)
(And I wonder why)
Looking for someone
I need to know now
Please tell me who I am
Looking for someone
I need to know now
Please tell me who I am
Looking for someone
I need to know now
Please tell me who I am
Looking for someone
