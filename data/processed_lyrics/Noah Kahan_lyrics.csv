"You'd understand my fear of everything in sight
I know I'd quickly sell my heart for some advice
On how to ease a troubled mind
My brain's a dog asleep that I cannot let lie
Cloudy head  though I can't find a single silver lining
Guess there is no hope for me in sight
To ease this troubled mind
I worry for the sun  yes  I worry for the snow
I worry I'll die young while I worry I'll grow old
Oh  I worry for the time I spent worrying alone
It makes me sad
It takes me back
I break in half
Ah-ooh  I break in half
I took a bus out to the city where you live
Eavesdropped on strangers' conversations with their kids
In hopes that maybe they'd say something relevant
To ease my worried head
Well  every mile that passed just amplified my fear
I started counting all the times I saw you last year
And suddenly it all became so clear
It was sadly making sense

I worry for the sun  yes  I worry for the snow
I worry I'll die young while I worry I'll grow old
Oh  I worry for the time I spent worrying alone

Ah-ooh  I break in half

I worry I'll die young while I worry I'll grow old

It makes me sad
It takes me back
I break in half
Ah-ooh  I break in half
I told you  love  if you could see it through my eyes
You'd understand my fear of everything in sight
I know I'd quickly sell my heart for some advice
 now that you mention it
 I'm the same as I was
 of how it has to be
 I'm the same as I was
 I swear I was scared to death
The doors are always closed
And I spend my weeks
And they say that nothing's given
So I guess I'll get nothing at all
And I'll accept defeat
'Cause you can't swing
When the fight's lost
You know
Can't see the grass getting greener 'cause
Out here ain't nothing but blue
But everyone you meet's just passing through
White lies take all of the color from you
Most nights you don't sleep at all
And you black out blind you hide
Is there any wonder no one ever really tries to call?
And you say

You say
Ooh
Down by the carpark  high off your head
Honey don't worry  nobody's angry at any of this
It's like when you're tired  you're someone else
Don't speak for some time to find those words inside yourself
Darling be patient  it's easy to break beneath the weight of the earth
And I said
Always  I'll wait
For sharp glass when you break
I'll be the light that you can't make
I'll be your eyes  you be my face
'Cause darling  I get scared for you
And I'm not busy anyway
Today you looked older than me
Hair in your face  it fills the space between your teeth
And all of your falling  has it got exhausting? Have you gotten sleep?
You said you were sorry  that you hadn't called me in over a week
And I said

Darling I get scared for you
You speak when you’re nervous
And all the wrong words seem right in your head
You can't stand the space in your bed
So you shake in the darkness
You break like an artist
And all your big plans are small the next day
You can't wait to throw them away
You perseverate
And the truth might be a million miles away
And lose yourself inside your busyhead
Burn your bridges and leave no witnesses
All alone inside your busyhead
Your busyhead
You spend your days in wait for bad news

Burn your bridges and leave no witnesses
All alone inside your busyhead
Going nowhere
Fast enough to tell a lie
Give yourself an alibi
You’ve been gone lately
Stand upon your peace of mind
You're bound to fall if you take your time
'Cause we're all waiting
And you can stare below into the abyss
Find a home on the edge of it
And be defined by its presence
By its size and its message
You can move along through the dark
And when you wonder where you are
You'll be proud of your weakness
And lose yourself inside your busyhead
Burn your bridges and leave no witnesses
All alone inside your busyhead
You're all alone inside your busyhead
You're all alone inside your busyhead
The moment right before it ends you're most afraid of
But don't you cancel any plans
'Cause I won't let you get the chance to never make them
Stayed on the line with you the entire night
'Til you let it out and let it in
Don't let this darkness fool you
All lights turned off can be turned on
I'll drive  I'll drive all night
I'll call your mom
I've been exactly where you are
I'll drive  I'll drive all night
I'll call your mom

We listen to Only The Good Die Young
And we laughed about its statement
In your angst and my impatience
Did you find what you were looking for?
Some escape from your skin
You know that place you were dreaming of
Where all light comes in
I hope you know I grew my hair out long
And your sister's just fine
I keep burning my bridges down
Just to keep you alive

If it keeps you alive
Woo-oo-oo

Woo
Keep my fingers crossed  keep my knees weak
Are we all such fragile things?
And may we remember the past but not hang on to our old ways
Let's pity laugh at the jokes we tell in bad taste
All my friends think I'm funny in a sad way
But they know not how they speak
Oh my god
While we sit and wait for time
To change our luck
And open up our blinds
Oh don't you know
Don't you know that you're the last thing on my mind
Oh I  Catastrophize
Oh I   Catastrophize
Let me see the world through the kindness of my dad's eyes
Let every photograph be taken from my bad side
So when the world sees my face they'll never ask why
I look the way I do
So let my soul be the only thing to guide me
I'll tour the world and hope my anger dies behind me
So if I fail I can blame it on bad timing
I'll love nothing that I can lose

And I should change this way of thinking
That all my fears are facts of life
But I could die tomorrow
You'd be close behind
Close behind

Come over

I'm in the process of clearin' out cobwebs

But it feels like a fortress when the weather gets bad
And my mouth was designed for my foot to fit in it

It's been a long year
Would we survive in a horror movie?
I doubt it we're too slow moving
We trust everyone we meet
Two bodies riddled with scars from our pre-teens
Intertwine in a car's dirty backseat
And stare at a drive-in screen
We didn't know that the sun was collapsing
'Til the seas rose and the buildings came crashing
Everywhere  everything  I wanna love you
'Til we're food for the worms to eat
'Til our fingers decompose  keep my hands in yours

I'm just a fish out in the sea
I'm just a preacher in the graveyard
Telling everyone but God to follow me
I'm just a liar who got lucky
I ain't no different from the rest
I might be jaded and delusional
But at least I found a home inside my head
This is for all those dreams I believed in
This is for all those doubts in my mind
This is the wild wild world that we live in
I won't let anyone tell me I won't survive

I miss the honesty of pain

Where I'd go with my friends to get drunk
Used to wish I meant anything to anywhere  to anyone
When forever was a sentence  sentence to death
And thе edges of your soul  I haven't seen yet

And I'll meet a girl in the heat of July

Your sense of the world lay
In your little home by the harbor

To think that last fall you were with me
And all of your old clothes
Are still in the hall of my building
You never asked once
If I was putting things off
If I was drinking too much of that red wine
And accept every sin
And if I glued myself shut
You would find your way in
We gambled our souls to the summer
And rattled our bones to the thunder
We watched every sunset
Until we got sick of each other

It's likely one of us will have to spend some days alone
Maybe we'll get forty years together
One day  I'll be gone
It's knowing that this can't go on forever
It's likely one of us will have to spend some days alone
Maybe we'll get forty years together
Now that you made your change
Was your soul rediscovered?
Was your heart rearranged?
Are you still taking pills in the morning?
And did you lose that longing now?
For a walk through an ocean town
'Cause this town's just an ocean now
You don't hate the summers
You're just afraid of the space
Asking strangers for answers
To forget what they say
A boat beside a dock in the sunlight
Nothing but the water and the sunrise now
Just the lack of an open mouth
'Cause this town's just an ocean now
Bad
I'll miss this place  your head and your heart
And my dad still tells me when they're playing your songs
Laughing at the way that you would say
They'd make me a star
They'd make me a star

Once you've had your change of heart
'Cause we're no more than the fossils
On Crescent Beach State Park
And we used to sing along to church bells on Sundays
And can you even hear em from the subway now?
And I hope that we make you proud
I would be home in the morning
I'd wake up in a cold sweat
Take a flight back to the city I was born in
And I would wipe myself clean
Of what I knew was unimportant
I'd want typical things
I'd try to fit back into all my old clothing
And I would prove myself wrong
With all my bitterness gone
And I'll put all my pieces back together
And I'll help her set up her new apartment

Two sizes big your shirt in my apartment
If I could fly I doubt I'd even do it
I'd probably get high and crash or something stupid
You made Ohio feel just like Central Park
Liberal rednecks get drunk on a dirt road
Attention deficit kids in their gym clothes
Paper bags drift wherever the wind blows
And mine's full of receipts
Ooh  this town's for the record now
The intersection got a Target
And they're calling it downtown
You and all of your new perspective now
Wish I could shut it in a closet
And drag you back down
Gave me your word and now I can't pronounce it
No thing so sure that I can't learn to doubt it
Now the state bird  it sings our song so out of key

Mailboxes until my house
This place had a heartbeat in its day
Vail bought the mountains  and nothing was the same
Their license plates Live Free or Die
But it just ain't that simple  it never was
We'll drink 'til New Year's  then they'll leave me to clean up
One day  I'm gonna cut it clear
Ride like Paul Revere
And  when they ask me who I am
I'll say  I'm not from around here
I'll leave before the road crew's out
Before those joggers  looking way too proud

Strawberry wine  and all the time we used to have

To spiral out  to try and float
To see a friend  to see a ghost
Bitter-brained  always drunk
Rail-thin  Zoloft
Subtle changе  shorter days
Dead-eyеd  dead weight
Your life  your dreams
Your mind  your needs
My needs
Your needs  my needs

Spiral out  try and float
See a friend  see a ghost
To see a ghost  see a ghost
Was when I saw your destination as a deadline
Making quiet calculations where the fault lies
It takes a strong hand and a sound mind
They're correcting all the grammar on our spray paint
And I even gave up driving after nightfall
I got tired of the frat boys with their brights on
It takes a strong hand and a sound mind
It makes me smile to know when things get hard
You're the greatest thing we've lost
The birds will still sing
Your folks will still fight
The boards will still creak
The leaves will still die

And we'll all be here forever
And we'll all be here forever
We sure will
We're overdue for a revival
We spent so long just getting by
That's the thing about survival
You told me you would make a difference
It won't be by your own volition
If you step foot outside this town
But it's all we've had
For always
You're the greatest thing we've lost
The birds will still sing
Your folks will still fight
The boards will still creak
The leaves will still die
And we'll all be here forever
And we'll all be here forever
You're gonna go far
You're gonna go far
You're gonna go far
You're gonna go far
(Ooh-ooh)
If you wanna go far
Then you gotta go far"
