lyrics
"My liquid silver arms extended
These waves aren't far apart
Black gold in claw foot tubs unchanging
Whisper crimson I intrude
There's light beneath your eyes
If what they say is true
You are a shadow in the fourth dimension
To float away with you
We see the corners where nothing happens
Ceilings lifted walls were gone
You speak the language of the breeze
All your leaves were meant for me
The love that every person wants to be
I'll live inside your lips if you won't laugh
My heaving hands on rotten fruit at last
She'd fit inside my heart and take it over
'Til her cape got blown into my red lungs
Either there's a purpose
Or I'm heading out at breakfast
Feeding time
Streets realigned
Ooh ooh ooh
Stored in my mind
All I could do not to steal
All the fun in the world
From your little heart
And now I owe it back to you
But it's hard to catch it and let it go
Find excuses to burn right through the grief
Oh my poor memories
Down to a trace
And you feel it's all right
Ooh I'm sure you'll be fine
Tune it out
And I'm sure you'll be fine

Shutting down soon (over my eyes)

Over my eyes...
Over my eyes...
Over my eyes...
That twitches on a peak at the place where the spirit was slain
Who love those alien days
The nonstop alien days
Must've skipped the ship and joined the team for a ride
A couple hours to learn the controls and commandeer both my eyes
Decide what's working and what's moved on to the last phase
The floodgate alien days
I love those alien days
When the peels are down it feels like traveling in style
You don't need wings to hover forty-ton stones for a mile
Numbers can't decide if the day's supposed to smile
You might also like
It's a blessing but it's also a curse
Those days taught me everything I know
How to catch a feeling and when to let it go
Can't find dreamer's honey in the hive
If it's right beneath the nose
You don't need smoke to cover most of the world in a gloom
But here comes racer number 7
Watch my fingers ripping out the lines
If it looks like we could lose
If it looks like we could lose
If it looks like we could lose
The signs keep changing on me
Like a shimmering bell
Long waves enveloping me
And my plastic mind
So chewed and shrinking all the time
Feels it whirling by
And I can't get down
*Break*
If I don't feel right
Polishing off the sand
Lay by me
And we'll erode
As gently as we can
Into the twilight
Into the twilight
Into the twilight
Into the twilight
I could almost touch the free walls
When we were evicted from the heavens
Fast clouded-over bumbling eyes
Now peering out through a sinking
Flaming currents forced us to surface
Wet purple gowns and blaring alarms
All for some milky perversion
Nothing the spooks wouldn't be used to
Spoiled by an empty fear of violence
The only time I've ever been dropped
The minute the mirror turned its back to me
My distinct conviction of keeping
Eternal sources piled somewhere familiar
Was compromised and tangled in knots
For all I know we were sleeping
Arranged like Fate's vain infantry
Stacked in unconscious opposition
Blind and happy for tomorrow
For tomorrow...
I followed sounds to a cathedral
Imagine my surprise to find
That they were produced by Brian Eno
Past the gates  quite stark
The roses trimmed and the windows dark
I see the walls through a limestone crack
Not red not blue not yellow but black
And all the spaces left for you
If the sky was synthesized  you'd probably know
He taught me many things
The wisdom of oblique stratagems
The prophet of a sapphire soul
Presented through creative freedoms
And everything I say is true
Because if I was telling lies  it'd probably show
I can tell when he's kind of smiling
But what does he know? (What does he know?)
We're always one step behind him  he's Brian Eno (Brian Eno)
Brian Eno (Brian Eno)

When I was stuck he'd make me memorize elaborate curses
Tinctures and formulas to ditch the chori and flip the verses
My whole foundation came unglued
When I tried to humanize by ambient light
(What does he know?)
We're always one step behind him  he's Brian Eno (Brian Eno)
Brian Eno (Brian Eno)
He promised pretty worlds and all the silence I could dream of
Brian Peter George St. John Le Baptiste de la Salle Eno
Well  all alone by the oldest stone where the shade trees grow
(What does he know?)
The creature by the water feature with the ghostly glow
(Brian Eno)
Making sure that time's preserved well  we reap what we sow
(What does he know?)
We're always one step behind him  he's Brian Eno (Brian Eno)
(What does he know?)
I'm always one step behind him  he's Brian Eno

(What does he know?)
I'd like to see him plant a forest  because I don't know
Brian Eno
I can tell that he's trying to smile  but what does he know?
(What does he know?)
I'll always be a step behind him  Brian Eno
(Brian Eno) Yeah
He's making sure that time's preserved well  we reap what we sow
(What does he know?)
I'm always one step behind him  because I don't know
What Brian Enos
Tell me what the truth is
Isn't this bed a log?
Doesn't that confuse things?
Shouldn't I run?
Isn't that the white man?
None of this seems like fun
For years I've strung you along
Afraid of the bubblegum dog
And it's finally catching up with me
I hope it's a false alarm
But the pain of the bubblegum dog
It's finally catching up with me
Who would have believe? I saw
Tenement homes
Built upon a fault line
Juvenile quetzal birds
Living in the coal mine
Manicured lawns
Tibetan straw men
Igneous basketballs
Drifting through the heavens
You might also like
I felt hate toward the earthly world
But hate is a very strong word
And it's finally catching up with me
The years of plodding on
In fear of the bubblegum dog
It's finally catching up with me
So I'll pray it won't be long
I'll wake up and it's all gone
You and me
We'll keep it calm
My bubblegum dog
The shame of vitriol
Aimed at the bubblegum dog
It's finally catching up with me
And I hate this bubblegum world
But hate is a very strong word
And it's finally catching up with me
So we'll hide until it's gone
Boil the ones that don't belong
Pay the man to keep it on
Days are short and nights are long
Bang our heads against the gong
Maybe tinkle on the lawn
One for all and all for one
The sons and daughters of city officials attend demonstrations
It's hardly a sink or swim when all is well if the ticket sells
Out with a whimper  it's not a blaze of glory
You look down from your temple as people endeavor to make it a story
And chisel a marble word  but all is lost if it's never heard
But I've got someone to make reports that tell me how my money's spent
To book my stays and draw my blinds so I can't tell what's really there
And all I need's a great big congratulations
I'll keep your dreams  you pay attention for me
As strange as it seems  I'd rather dissolve than have you ignore me
The ground may be moving fast but I tied my boots to a broken mast
The difference is clear  you throw it in your cauldron
You start with a simple stock of all the waste and salt to taste
But damn my﻿ luck and damn these friends that keep on combing back their smiles
I save my grace with half-assed guilt and lay down the quilt upon the lawn
Feign like I notice a fundamental tone
The fine petals open and close offended
Poor explanation and nothing shown
Kind of like if a friend exits without a sign
Glimmering like a precious stone
Maybe we shared a dream for 20 nights in a row
I might feel better knowing that I was alone
Wherever scientists turn lead to birds
Something else to soften a sadistic urge
When they tell you the extent of the vice
Then the prime time mission is to choke the statistician
And like the senses that you're lurking behind
While it gnaws right through to your core
Oh I'd twist it more
If you think that you're free (Free like a kite)
Watching as it flies by (Spy the unknown)
Focus on the quiet oars
Tell me how far you'd go (Go where you like)
Knowing your air won't last (Last one to know)
Would you feel better holding the stars up
You might also like
What if the beast escapes (apes have it good)
And separates like a cloud (loud like a fault)
Seeps into the hollow bones
Wouldn't its eyes expand and zero in like a scope
Trying to keep it low
Saw you move to the beat and I was blown away
That's all you need to know
Maybe I mistook pure distraction
For a flash of love
I wanna clear the air by Monday
If all the tanks are gone
And when it settles down  I wonder
If I'll like what we've done
You know we just started
We’re proud-hearted like fish in the lobby
Dead and gone  dancing in Babylon
Two ships in the night
Quietly signaling from the bow
Don't you miss feeling like you could run away
And nobody had to know?
When your time is up  call the captain
Tell him to let mе off
Don't rush me (Don't rush me)
I don't wanna be thinking about this stuff
You hurt mе and I run to you
Is that the big idea?
You know we just started
We're proud-hearted like fish in the lobby
Dead and gone  dancing in Babylon

I love you
I wanna tell everyone I know

Standing there with nothing on

Shock me like an electric eel
Baby girl
Turn me on with your electric feel

Blank dreams of the coming fun
Distort the odds of a turnaround
Gut screams out next to none
The back way to escape the gun
Climbing a tree with a missing limb
And not saving anyone
And now it hurts to stay at home and see flash
The mirror ball's throwing mold
And you can't get a grip if there's nothing to hold
You see the flash catch a white lily laugh and wilt
And if you must smash a glass first fill it to the hilt
Still bending towards the light
And if we dance until the heart explodes
It will make this place ignite
And even if this hall collapses
I can stand by my pillar of hope
It's just a case of flash delirium

Here's a growing culture deep inside a corpse
Comfort keeps us nice
So quick to donate everything (nothing arrives)
Die wolken drifting blinding smiles circling (einkreisen)
And time's tingling spines
Attaching hands to floor
The rosy-tinted flash
The hot dog's getting cold
And you'll never be as good as the Rolling Stones
Watch the birds in the airport gathering dirt
Crowd the clean magazine chick lifting up her skirt
Lines when I close my eyes and just (Why close one eye and try to)
Aim blindly at the sun (Pledge allegiance to the sun)
And hear love when the ghosts start singing
(When plastic ghosts start terrorizing everyone)
Terrorizing everyone
And geometric troops aligning
Carried up to the burial mounds with gold
It's a heavy time but your (My earthbound heart is heavy)
Your rhythm makes it light (Your heartbeat keeps things light)
And explode like a violent star keeps (With the violence forever)
Threatening the night
And even if this hall collapses
I can stand by my pillar of hope and trust
That our heads won't bust
66 55 red battleships
Forty earthlike planets
One fork in its side
Zero tears in their eyes
On the face and the hands
On a green-colored island
On a primitive man
It was the future reflecting
It felt familiar but new
A street was missing a building
The kids had something to do
There was a feeling the spirit was leaving
Red like a marker
Cut the heart from a lonely life
I saw patterns on floorboards
Deep in the dust was a leader
Someone was walking on floorboards
Turning from oak into cedar
He can assess the situation
I wrapped a string around my finger
Into the forest with the young ones
I don't expect to be a winner

My heart is phosphor
Sea rolls and death tolls
Off of the trail and off of your hands and
Onto a new plan
Is the cost to stay lost
And one day I'll appreciate the rush of blood and the washed-out beat of the shore
And remember what it felt like
To be alone
Sitting in the sunlight
And the rights that they abused
Might just fuck us over
But the doors won't shut until they're sure
There's nothing left to use
Someone's taking over
It's time to hand it over
Now we'll see who is who
Look who's bending over
We both knew it was true
The smart ones exit early
And the rest hope for a shoulder
Oooh
If everyone's confused
Which door do we open?
Now there's one thing left to do

It's time (Hand it over)

And give me what's mine (Hand it over)
It's yours and mine (Hand it over)
Just give me what's mine (Hand it over)
It's yours and it's mine (Hand it over)
And when my noose is tied I could blow it
And fall down into your arms
Fifteen centuries of dissolution and grief
To return a yellow trickster and a thief
Hey  I found a whistle that works every time
That's when the trail escapes to nowhere
And the flood erases the crime
Such conviction  to paint all the walls with the blood
Of the young and the faithful and the good
Yeah  I found a whistle as thin as a sheet
To split the dumbness of a vision
Between a sleep and asleep
Tiny axes repeatedly raising the flag
All ignored  real emotion's such a drag
Hey  I've got a pistol that's aimed at your heart
And on dark nights when the moon is right  I could show you
The head attached with a scarf
Aerophane sorceress  at home obeying the fates
When it's gone  has it gone all the way?

All beginnings are an end
In the blackness there’s a light
Maybe you will only read
One or two letters at the most
Shipping crates might line the streets
Every stranger is a ghost
Cashiers won’t deduct the pain
Loneliness sleeps on the couch
Only noticing the stain
Once the color’s faded out
Let’s go camping in the cold
Envision leather getting old
Re-send pigeons that were sent
Try to memorize your smell
It reminds me of a field
Crickets clearer than a bell
Have all their guts recast in steel
Birds don’t cry when echoes quit
They trail off into the fog
Autumn hurts far less than sticks
Knowing winter’s five feet tall

Generations of defeat
All assuming you're the worst
They never tied the cans
To the back end of a hearse
Take your hand against my own
If there’s a finger I can grip
Reassure me at the ace
Mine’s a black heart you could flip
I’ve come to terms with what I have
Turn my back against the sea
And beg the serpent for a dance
But in the red dirt muddy towns
Celebration of the dark
Children walking hand in hand
With the pygmies in zee park
I can’t touch you only once
You always leave me wanting more
So keep my feet within the house
And stick my toes just past the door
Let me know when I’m in love
You beg the dawn to ease you in
Pass the time a thousand ways
And any kind of love will do
In a style that’s insincere
For a six-dollar coffee
And municipal parking
And Disney on Ice

Yellow curtains drawn
Designed with comfort in mind
Glowering into the night
Feel like letting go
The final resting place
The house cat knows when it's time
To enter another phase
But you looked sad
In a reassuring way
And I don't want to leave
So we can both be the same
In the afternoon
Modern sovereignty
The sunlight stopped coming through
And we lost the game
Brains like nesting dolls
Plotting their escape

He can't seem to find your name

Feeling no emotions

There's a season when I will find out where I am

And hiding when it comes
Seeing its reflection
And the fire it becomes
Turning of the seasons

Burning with the reasons
Burning for revenge

So I can see your faces
The eyes are wrong
How will I know if it's working right?
Light confuses
The tiny isles of bruises
The mangled lines
I see the signs of aging
But if I try to feel at all
I am deceived  my mind's affected
It's empty now  as I lay down
I feel alright  my heart is racing
Turn the noise on (The noise on)
I'd like to feed my poison (My poison)

The ruins of the day painted with a scar
And the more I straighten out  the less it wants to try
The feelings start to rot one wink at a time
Oh-oh
Forgiving who you are for what you stand to gain
Just know that if you hide  it doesn't go away
When you get out of bed  don't end up stranded
Horrified with each stone
On the stage  my little dark age
Picking through the cards  knowing what's nearby
The carvings on the fetish say they find it hard
And the engine's failed again  all limits of disguise
The humor's not the same  coming from denial
Oh-oh

I know that if you hide  it doesn't go away
If you get out of bed and find me standing
All alone  open-eyed

Giddy with delight  seeing what's to come
The image of the dead  dead ends in my mind
Policemen swear to God  love's seeping from the guns
I know my friends and I would probably turn and run
If you get out of bed  come find us heading
For the bridge  bring a stone
All the rage  my little dark age
I grieve in stereo  the stereo sounds strange
I know that if you hide  it doesn't go away
If you get out of bed and find me standing
All alone  open-eyed
Burn the page  my little dark age
All alone  open-eyed
Greet the workers of the universe
Still nothing prepares you for loss of life
(Mm)
What remains of disconnected dots
Who knows how the painting will look in the morning
When the day is born and life is ending (Ah)
But it's neither created nor destroyed
There's a way to quiet all the noise
'Cause it's only a different kind of gain
Even if your color fades away
When thе world is born and life is ending
Then you lеarn to love your loss of life (Ah)
When the morning comes and life is over (Ah)
Anyone can love (Oh)
Anyone can love (Ah)

It can teach you and reprogram you
It can show you the flood that's trapped inside
This one's alive
Tale is breathing and she's listening
Into an oak
Silver lining on a black scale
But where is the fourth?
You can climb there to your lofty perch
It can teach you the fairy tale of hurt
Ooooh  aaaah!

Just before the show  this wild-eyed kid came up to the fence
He took one look at us  and he said...

We didn't play his favorite song
Now he'll never come to another show
Now he'll never come to another show
Now he'll never come to another show
Now he'll never come to another show
Now he'll never come to another show
Now he'll never come to another show
Hospitals and woods confirm (Now he'll never come to another show  now he'll never come to another show)
Red in the eyes of everyone (Now he'll never come to another show  now he'll never come to another show)
Parasites and lovers scrape the meat from bones (Now he'll never come to another show)
Turned into jade and tiger's eye
Save me some dark hair over a face like hers
She'll help the rain come to a pour
Bathroom floor of stone and tiles broke in two
Warm where they touch her porcelain  timid skin
I'm careful to untie this rope
Wrapped in a knot  indifferent
Lion's foot unearthing all the things I've seen
But never truly understood
Rotten wood  from oceans that were never green
Crumbles beneath the canopy  secretly
(Let's pretend he never touched the sugar)
Tonight  under rose
You won't find another wheel to roll
When autumn winds appear
We wear these fears on our right
We just wants to be surreal  cause
All dressed in diamond image jeans
Mercury's found in old field
We miserable in love
And chance we walked right on in
Into the streets of the city  but
Watching people disappear
Without reaching out
Years and years
You're left by yourself
On the wheel
And think maybe the children just want recognition
I wrote the fairytale on a midnight drive
Wanting to know if I'm more than alive
I torched the fields again
And killed an honest man
Now I understand Mother Nature
Watch me running head-first into the thorns
It's like the lights are off but somebody's home
Unwrap that tourniquet 'round the sun
Turn those subtle reds into neon
You'll see the difference when it's done
But I undеrstand your hesitation
Come take a walk with mе down billionaire's row
Trying to keep our balance over zero
We'll write the fairytale for the rest of our lives
Throwing the trash away one more time
Holding on to love like a stone
Melting down today for tomorrow's
Covenant of the heart
You know it's turbulent from the start
And I understand it's not your nature
You might also like
But you need a friend
To take you home
You've got to begin again
To open castle gates and let me go inside
And taste the bitter tea that won't let you hide
Then we can take away as much as we can steal
Break all the precious bones before the guards appear
Before the fantasy is cast into the fire
And strike the temple bell to resonate the—
Covenant of the heart
You know what comes right after the dark
What slips into the system
Don't sympathize with the mystery disease
All it is is a feeling
Pain in a dress too revealing
A lost bond
An old friend who likes what it sees
You can't shake off the mystery disease
Lovers in a past life
Meet in the street close to midnight
A last look
Sweet like the end of a dream
Then fall back into the mystery disease
It's not in any of the books you can read
It's no fun to face what you don't get to be
But what's one more to the mystery disease?
Floating impatience
Snuffs my limited sapience
Black smoke as soon as the pressure's released
Consumed by a weakness
Cut with perpetual unrest
Trap what you want
Waste what you need

And when the west wind sweeps through the leaves
Emperors of history fall to their knees
Small fronds can't see the wood for the trees
 Nothing changes
 like I shouldn't be here
 then I wouldn't be here
 when did all the gods deceive me?
 I shouldn't be here
 believe me
 valiant flailing
 with endless straining
 but nothing's storming
Not in the bags under my eyes
I can see you standing there
The world's my Fine de Claire
My Spanish castle in the sky
I can see it floating now
If I'm worlds away
I'm holding mountains in my hands
Starlight ain't never gonna let me down
Until I stumble like a drunkard back to town
Then I end up where you are
Keeping the sanctuary warm
Don't ask me who I am
Don't ask me where I was
Nothing to declare
Not in the valise of my mind
All the documents are there
The world's my Fine de Claire
The waters beckon me to dive
I can tell the pearl's in there

If you let me go
I'll fall as far as I can fall
Starlight ain't never gonna bring me home
Until I wake up like a baby in the womb
Then I'll wonder who you are
Keeping the conversation light

Don't ask me how I know
Don't ask me how I know
Don't ask me how I know
Don't ask me how I know
Don't ask me how I know
Don't you know about the temperature change in the cold black shadow?
Are you mad at your walls or hoping that an
Unknown force can repair things for you?
Pardon all the time that you've thrown into your pale gray garden?
Even a bird would want a taste of dirt from abyssal dark
The prick of a feather could make a kingdom burn and the bloodshed start
The falling apart
Made me a shadow in the shape of wonder the waves of black
He's a rat
Set the tempo and cut and cut its brains out
It will inspire on the burning pyre
Communication is easy as the ocean
Before you choose the night and the silence overtakes you
If you looked into the fire and you had that conversation
Then there's one thing left to try if you want to save your life
Fear is his name  but his friends still call him God
Again and again  the thought remains
(The only way to get rid of the feeling)
I don't wanna die  wishing I'd done something
More than what's required to last until the sunset
There's one thing left to try if you want to change your life
Today I left those thoughts behind  behind
Over and over  you die just to feel alive
The only way to get rid of the feeling  you have to draw the line
And remember there's more than you're seeing  decide
Do you want to keep us alive?
Do you want to feel alive?
Do you want to keep us alive?
Do you want to feel alive?
(Fun is over tonight) Do you want to keep us alive?
(Fun is over tonight) Do you want to feel alive?
(Fun is over tonight) Do you want to keep us alive?
(Fun is over tonight) Do you want to feel alive?

Showing you things that you can't unsee
In the sense of unknowing why
Anything happens to be
And just as the sun comes out again
Something is blocking the light
But it's alright
The inside's still glowing
Telling the heart what it wants to hear
But what if it's only lies
Twisted apart by fear?
From the front of the train where the coal is burned
And you know the refrain without hearing a sound
So you sing it again 'cause you won't
Learn from the people in the streets
Wheels left the ground
Hoping to fly past the road ahеad
Components start breaking down
And just when the wool goes over the eyes
Somebody moves you along
But it's all wrong

And someone complained that the fire was out
So they shut off the rain and let the flames return
Now they had to rename all the tricks in the book
And I'm starting to doubt where I once stood
And there's people in the streets
There's people in the streets
People in the streets
There's people in the streets
End of the line
In real time
I stopped clinging to what's mine
They're marching to the beat of a different drum
Going over receipts with a magnifier
The people in the streets aren't singing along
'Cause they're probably sick and they're probably tired
I listen for the sound of the starting gun
But when you're living the dream and your ears are bad
The people in the streets aren't part of the fun
Scared of the people in the streets
The people in the streets
People in the streets
Cold-blooded claws never offered anything at all
Past the point of love  shattered and untied
Waiting to pick up the pieces that make it all alright
But pieces of what?
Pieces of what?
Pieces of what
Doesn't matter anymore
Moonlight on my floor  shinin' through the roof
They got the city surrounded  as if I needed proof
I forgot my fear  feelings on the rise
Buried by all of the pieces fallin' from the sky
But pieces of what?
Pieces of what?
Pieces of what
We used to call home
Pieces of what
We used to call home

And plenty of those are not women
As soon as you get yourself free
Then somebody stops you from swimming
No it's whatever you want it to be
There's plenty of girls in the sea

It's best to accept it and not make a fuss

 it never works out
 it never works out
 it never works out
The bridge that watches the light speed through
And cries while the spirit stumbles
The inside missile for the protection of you
Maybe it's silent
The voice can't bear any more strain
But speaks without even knowing
And streams outside in the direction of truth
There's no reason there's no secrets to decode
Wide open arms can feel so cold
The disappointed look on the faces that squint at the moon
Let's see it with shadows enhanced
And then vote to decide who'll advance
Silver jet plane making a turn
Exciting the brain that expects it to crash and then burn
It's not the life lesson I'd've guessed
If you're conscious you must be depressed
Or at least cynical
You might also like
But someone might still eat the steaks
Even if they're tough
Floating away isn't rough but it's not enough
And London's a scratch on the lens
It's over before it begins
Silk 'round her neck falls down to her shoulders
But really there's no trip at all
That doesn't result in a fall
Or a faltering
But something could spit out the bait
Even if it's real
It's not right
The low tide is telling me when it's over
To breathe in everything exposed
And comes back to cover me with a blanket
Being here's always changing tunes
The empty sky surrounds me but I can't see at all
Wide-open arms can feel so cold
And you can sit beside me and tell me what it's worth
But I hope I die before I get sold
I hope I die before I get sold
I'd rather die before I get sold
If you find the soul that you lost
Frozen in a starry void
Take it within and hope the sight of blood
Can will signs of life to return
Back to the way that it was
Long before it made a noise
To keep on quietly reminding you
What's never created or destroyed
Wake as the swell peaks
The close-outs drowning the birds with roars
And howls scare the new unkindness
That picks and laughs at the carrion scene
Forces you see breathe can always go into hiding
And wait 'til it passes over
Or stay far gone for all eternity
I'm cut and weeping like a rubber tree
But I don't care who's left behind
Lost revelations that I'll never find
Blues prepared for anti-christening
Somewhere there's an honest soul
To mirror teeth where neon lures troll
And what's extinct might come alive
A purple smoke in some internal shrine
With a long sigh let the hissing in
Stones deformed by gentle kissing and
All the closed eyes start to glisten
But it feels like someone's missing
It feels like someone's missing
It feels like someone's missing
Feels like someone's missing
It feels like someone's missing
It feels like someone's missing
Feels like someone's missing
It feels like someone's missing
Or maybe half of his time
Or part of the time wandering
Around the creeks and cobble stones of Hackney lanes
With a tear in his eye
And then stops to paint a picture of a frown
Walking around
Dan Treacy's smile
Leaves you trying to decide
No rest for the mind that's seen it all before
And I don't know where he lives
But he's a myth of a man and Texas Bob the cameraman
Is off to fix his suit before the show
To know when your time's up
You flip the glass and watch the hours quickening
In the back of the station
Fluorescent lights about to quit their flickering
Dan Treacy's eyes

In the middle of the park
When the underground is dark
He starts thinking about a place that no one knows
And when the creeks run dry
He stays frozen in time
Strange lights in the sky start blinking
And he's making up his mind
(He made his mind up) To get things done and overcome
(He made his mind up) In the park and at the station
(He made his mind up)
I'll try not to let them take everything they can steal
I know I can feel them underneath my leather boots
You toss all the mornings lost to the clouds
And you watch it go
Your fair weather friends on a parachute binge
Get lost when the wind blows
The handshake's stuck on the tip of my tongue
It tastes like death but it looks like fun
I was a loner  I was just waiting by myself
You can call all the people you want  but it's you who's being used
A curse on all creation  every single thing you know
It would only take a few seconds of darkness to figure out what's in store
Little girl
You convince yourself that you want it
But you don't know
You keep on tryin' to wash the blood from your hands
But it won't go
We're gonna keep you on the run

 tides have turned from boos to cheers

I'm in the prime of my life
Let's make some music  make some money
Find some models for wives
I'll move to Paris  shoot some heroin
And fuck with the stars
You man the island and the cocaine
And the elegant cars
This is our decision  to live fast and die young
We've got the vision  now let's have some fun
Get jobs in offices and wake up for the morning commute?
Forget about our mothers and our friends
We're fated to pretend
To pretend
We're fated to pretend
To pretend
I'll miss the playgrounds
And the animals and diggin' up worms
I'll miss the comfort of my mother
And the weight of the world
I'll miss my sister  miss my father
Miss my dog and my home
Yeah  I'll miss the boredom and the freedom
And the time spent alone

 time spent looking at my phone
 time spent looking at my phone
 turn you off but can't detach
 signing in and signing out
 time spent looking at my phone
 devoured by perverted creatures
 spending every moment looking at their phones
 time spent looking at my phone
 time spent looking at my phone
 time spent looking at my phone
 so you close all the windows
 even if our love is ornamental
 we can lose ourselves in nothing
 you can go ahead and stop pretending
A beast that doesn't quiver anymore
And we could crush some plants to paint my walls
And I won't try to fight in the weekend wars
Was I? I was too lazy to bathe
Or paint or write or try to make a change
Now I can shoot a gun to kill my lunch
And I don't have to love or think too much
Instant battle plans written on the sidewalk
Mental mystics in a twisted metal car
Tried to amplify the sound of light and love
Christ is cursed of fathers and martyrs
Might even take a knife to split a hair
Or even scare the children off my lawn
Givin' us time to make the makeshift bombs
Every mess invested was a score
We couldn't use computers anymore
But it's difficult to win unless you're bored
And you might have to plan for the weekend wars
Try to break my heart  I'll drive to Arizona
It might take a hundred years to grow an arm
I'll sit and listen to the sound of sand and cold
Twisted diamond heart  I'm the weekend warrior (huh)
My predictions are the only things I have
I can amplify the sound of light and love
