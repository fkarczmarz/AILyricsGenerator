lyrics
"Doctor said I had to stay a little bit longer and I'll be fine
When I thought it'd all been done
When I thought it'd all been said
A little bit longer and I'll be fine
But you don't know what you got 'til it's gone
And you don't know what it's like to feel so low
You don't even know
A little bit longer and I'll be fine
A little bit longer and I'll be fine
But you don't know what you got 'til it's gone
And you don't know what it's like to feel so low

Yeah
But you don't know what you got 'til it's gone
So I'll wait 'til kingdom come
All the highs and lows are gone
A little bit longer and I'll be fine
Whoa
I never thought it'd come this far
Was thinking back to where we started
And how we lost all that we are
We were young and times were easy
But I could see it's not the same
Give it all for that to change
And I don't want to lose her
Don't wanna let her go
Standing out in the rain
Need to know if it's over
'Cause I will leave you alone
I'm flooded with all this pain
Knowing that I'll never hold her
Like I did before the storm
Yeah-ah-ah
Before the storm

With every strike of lightning
Comes a memory that lasts
And not a word is left unspoken
As the thunder starts to crash
Maybe I should give up
Standing out in the rain
Need to know if it's over
'Cause I will leave you alone
I'm flooded with all this pain
Knowing that I'll never hold her
Like I did before the storm
I'm tryna keep the lights from going out
And the clouds from ripping out my broken heart
They always say a heart is not a home
Without the one who gets you through the storm
Standing out in the rain
Knowing that it's really over
Please don't leave me alone
I'm flooded with all this pain
Knowing that I'll never hold you
Like I did before the storm
Yeah
You go around like you know
Who I am  but you don't
You've got me on my toes
I'm slipping into the lava
And I'm trying to keep from going under
Baby  who turned the temperature hotter?
Come on  girl
I fell (I fell) so fast (So fast)
Can't hold myself back
High heels (High heels)  red dress (Red dress)
All by yourself  gotta catch my breath
I'm slipping into the lava
And I'm trying to keep from going under
Baby  who turned the temperature hotter?

Family with nowhere to go
Angels on treetops and angels in the snow
Oh  the cold
Seasons change  come and go
But there's one thing I know
You'll just stay the same
You don't ever change
I miss the feeling
Waiting for Santa to show
Caroling late night
And all the children's eyes aglow
I need you  Christmas
Oh  how I miss you the most
Greetings from loved ones
And lovers under mistletoe
If you're young  if you're old
We all wait to be told
Just a simple phrase
Have a Merry Christmas

Two stops past the parkway
And that old cemetery
We weren’t born to grow in a hurry
But it rained hard in the garden state
And we shot up like weeds
Walking out of that red brick house
Yeah I could hear it screaming
Please don't leave
Don’t you want to talk about it
Before you walk away?
When there's still
So much left to say
Hollywood's a lot like the Bible
Both take faith and if you want grace
Then you gotta believe
Holding on was always a battle
Don't always agree
There was always room for one of us
But not enough for three
So who its gonna be?
