lyrics
"You're getting to be my one desire
You're getting to be all that matters to me
I hope and pray each day I live
A little more love I'll have to give
A little more love that's devoted and true
'Cause all I do is think about you
All I do is think about you
Think of how exciting it would be
If you should discover you feel like me
If you should discover this dream is for two
I'd light a candle every day
And pray that you'll always feel this way
And pray that our love will forever be new
'Cause all I do is think about you
You might also like
All I do is think about you (I think about you)
All I do is think about you
I'd light a candle every day
And pray that you'll always feel this way
And pray that our love will forever be new
If I cannot have you for my own
I'd rather be lonely and all alone
I'd rather keep thinking the way that I do
'Cause all I do is think about you
All I do is think about you
All I do is think about you
All I do is think about you
All I do is think about you
All I do is think about you
All I do is think about you
All I do is think about you
All I do is think about you
All I do is think about you
Can't you feel the fire burning?
Can't you feel the birds humming? (All I do is think about you)
Can't you feel my love flowing? (All I do is think about you)
Can't you see my love growing?
Love's a crazy game
Two people vow to stay
In love as one they say
But all is changed with time
The future none can see
The road you leave behind
Ahead lies mystery
But all is fair in love
I had to go away
A writer takes his pen
To write the words again
That all in love is fair
All of fate's a chance
It's either good or bad
I tossed my coin to say
In love with me you'd stay
But all in war is so cold
You either win or lose
When all is put away
The losing side I'll play
But all is fair in love
I should never have left your side
A writer takes his pen
To write the words again
That all in love is fair
A writer takes his pen
To write the words again
La-la-la-la-la  la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la  la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la  la-la-la-la
For you  there might be a brighter star
But through my eyes  the light of you is all I see
For you  there might be another song
But all my heart can hear is your melody
Informed me that no other love could do
But listen did I not  though understanding
Fell in love with one who would break my heart in two
For you  love might bring a toast of wine
But I will celebrate our love of yesterday
Informed me that no other love could do
But listen did I not  though understanding
You might also like
But through my eyes  the light of you is all I see

And the rosebuds know to bloom in early May
Just as hate knows love's the cure
You can rest your mind assure
That I'll be loving you always
As now can't reveal the mystery of tomorrow
But in passing  will grow older every day
Just as all is born is new
Do know what I say is true
That I'll be loving you always
Until the rainbow burns the stars out in the sky (Always)
Until the ocean covers every mountain high (Always)
Until the dolphin flies and parrots live at sea (Always)
Until we dream of life and life becomes a dream
Did you know that true love asks for nothing?
Her acceptance is the way we pay
Did you know that life has given love a guarantee
To last through forever and another day?
Just as time knew to move on since the beginning
And the seasons know exactly when to change
Just as kindness knows no shame
Know through all your joy and pain
That I'll be loving you always
For I'll know deep in my mind
The love of me I've left behind
'Cause I'll be loving you always

Until the day is night and night becomes the day (Always)
Until the trees and seas just up and fly away (Always)
Until the day that eight times eight times eight is four (Always)
Until the day that is the day that are no more (Did you know you're loved by somebody?)
Until the day the earth starts turning right to left (Always)
Until the earth just for the sun denies itself (I'll be loving you forever)
Until dear Mother Nature says her work is through (Always)
Until the day that you are me and I am you (Always)
Until the rainbow burns the stars out in the sky (Always)
Until the ocean covers every mountain high (Always)
We all know sometimes life's hates and troubles
Can make you wish you were born in another time and space
But you can bet your life times that and twice its double
That God knew exactly where he wanted you to be placed
So make sure when you say you're in it  but not of it
You're not helping to make this earth a place sometimes called Hell
Change your words into truth and then change that truth into love
And maybe our children's grandchildren
And their great-grandchildren will tell
I'll be loving you
Until the rainbow burns the stars out in the sky (Loving you)
Until the ocean covers every mountain high (Loving you)
Until the dolphin flies and parrots live at sea (Loving you)
Until we dream of life and life becomes a dream (Be loving you)
Until the day is night and night becomes the day (Loving you)
Until the trees and seas just up and fly away (Loving you)
Until the day that eight times eight times eight is four (Loving you)
Until the day that is the day that are no more (Loving you)
Until the day the earth starts turning right to left (Be loving you)
Until the earth just for the sun denies itself (Loving you)
Until dear Mother Nature says her work is through (Loving you)
Until the day that you are me and I am you (Now ain't that loving you?)
Until the rainbow burns the stars out in the sky (Ain't that loving you?)
Until the ocean covers every mountain high (And I've got to say always)
Until the dolphin flies and parrots live at sea (Always)
Until we dream of life and life becomes a dream (Always)
Until the day is night and night becomes the day (Always)
Until the trees and seas just up and fly away (Always)
Until the day that eight times eight times eight is four
Until the day that is the day that are no more (Always)
Until the day the earth starts turning right to left
Until the earth just for the sun denies itself (Always)
Until dear Mother Nature says her work is through
Until the day that you are me and I am you
Until the rainbow burns the stars out in the sky
Until the ocean covers every mountain high
Until the dolphin flies and parrots live at sea
Until we dream of life and life becomes a dream
Until the day is night and night becomes the day
Until the trees and seas just up and fly away
Until the day that eight times eight times eight is four
Until the day that is the day that are no more
Until the day the earth starts turning right to left
Until the earth just for the sun denies itself
Until dear Mother Nature says her work is through
For the flag we now hold high
Was a Black man
The ground where we stand
With a flag held in our hand
Was first the red man's
Guide of a ship
On the first Columbus trip
Was a brown man
The railroads for trains
Came on tracking that was laid
By the yellow man
We pledge allegiance
All our lives
To the magic colors
But we all must be given
The liberty that we defend
For with justice not for all men
History will repeat again
It's time we learned
This world was made for all men

But as your hand touches your heart
Remember we all played a part

Scout who used no chart
Helped lead Lewis and Clark
Was a red woman
Use of martial arts
In our country got its start
By a yellow man
And the leader with a pen
Signed his name to free all men

My whole body gets weak
When you're standing in a crowd
Your love talks to me so loud

When I do my love to you?
When I hear you on the phone
Just the mention of your name
Seems to drive my head insane

Not like it's hurt me before (Not like it's hurt before)
For once  I have something I know won't desert me

Kind of heaven eyes
Closing both my eyes
Waiting for surprise
To see the heaven in your eyes is not so far
'Cause I'm not afraid to try and go it
To know the love and the beauty never known before
I'll leave it up to you to show it
I'd like to go there
I'd like to go there
Take me right away
Looking at your hands
Hands can understand
Waiting for the chance
Just to hold your hand

Into a lovely smile that's blooming
And it's so clear to me that here's a dream come true

There ought to be a law against
Anyone who takes offense
At a day in your celebration
'Cause we all know in our minds
That there ought to be a time
That we can set aside
To show just how much we love you
And I'm sure you would agree
It couldn't fit more perfectly
Than to have a world party on the day you came to be
Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday
Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday
I just never understood
How a man who died for good
Could not have a day that would
Be set aside for his recognition
Because it should never be
Just because some cannot see
The dream as clear as he
That they should make it become an illusion
And we all know everything
That he stood for time will bring
For in peace our hearts will sing

Why has there never been a holiday
Where peace is celebrated
All throughout the world

Who know the way to truth
Is love and unity to all God's children
It should be a great event
And the whole day should be spent
In full remembrance
Of those who lived and died for the oneness of all people
So let us all begin
We know that love can win
Sing it loud as you can
Happy birthday to you

Ooh yeah
We know the key to unity of all people
Is in the dream that you had so long ago
That lives in all of the hearts of people
That believe in unity
We'll make the dream become a reality
I know we will
Because our hearts tell us so

Worthless years
Here am I encased inside a hollow shell
Life began
Then was done
Now I stare into a cold and empty well
The many sounds that meet our ears
The sights our eyes behold
Will open up our merging hearts
And feed our empty souls
I believe when I fall in love with you
It will be forever

It will be forever
Without despair
We will share
And the joys of caring will not be replaced
What has been
Must never end

You're the woman I've been waiting for
You're the girl that I really adore
You're the baby I've been thinking for
No chocolate-covered candy hearts to give away
No wedding Saturday within the month of June
Made up of these three words that I must say to you
I just called to say I love you
I just called to say how much I care
I just called to say I love you
And I mean it from the bottom of my heart
No harvest moon to light one tender August night
Not even time for birds to fly to southern skies
No giving thanks to all the Christmas joy you bring
To fill your heart like no three words could ever do

Had a childhood sweetheart
We were always hand in hand
I wore hightop shoes and shirt tails
Suzy was in pigtails
I knew I loved her even then
You know my papa disapproved it
My mama boo-hooed it
But I told them time and time again
Don't you know I was made to love her
Build my world all around her
She's been my inspiration
Showed appreciation
For the love I gave her through the years
Like a sweet magnolia tree
My love blossomed tenderly
My life grew sweeter through the years
I know that my baby loves me
My baby needs me
That's why we made it through the years
I was made to love her
Worship and adore her

All through thick and thin
Our love just won't end
My baby loves me
My baby needs me
And I know I ain't going nowhere
I was knee-high to a chicken
When that love bug bit me
I had the fever with each passing year
If this whole world crumbles
By her side I'll still be standing there
'Cause I was made to love her
Build my world all around her
 what would be my toy
 it sure felt outta sight
Then why can't it be everlasting?
Like the sun that always shines
Like the poet's endless rhyme
Like the galaxies in time
If it's pleasing
Then why can't it be never leaving?
Like the day that never fails
Like on seashores there are shells
Like the time that always tells
It holds the key to every heart
Throughout the universe
It fills you up without a bite
And quenches every thirst
So if it's special
As making sure we dress in style?
Posing pictures with a smile
Keeping danger from a child

It holds the key to every heart
Throughout the universe
It fills you up without a bite
And quenches every thirst
So if it's magic
Why can't we make it everlasting?
Like the lifetime of the sun
It will leave no heart undone
For there's enough for everyone
Oh
Isn't she wonderful?
Isn't she precious?
Less than one minute old
Making one as lovely as she
But isn't she lovely? Made from love
Isn't she pretty?
Truly the angel's best
We have been heaven blessed
I can't believe what God has done
But isn't she lovely? Made from love
Isn't she lovely?
Life and love are the same
Life is Aisha
The meaning of her name
Without you who conceived the one
Of asking for permission to lay something heavy on one's head
So I have tried to not be the one who'll fall into that line
Made life's history
'Cause you've brought some joy inside my tears
And you have done what no one thought could be
You've brought some joy inside my tears
I've always felt that tomorrow is for those who are too much afraid
To go past yesterday and start living for today
I feel that lasting moments are coming far and few between
So I should tell you of the happiness that you bring
You've brought some joy inside my tears
You brought some joy inside my tears (Yeah)
You brought some joy inside my tears
You brought some joy inside my tears
You've brought some joy inside my tears
Got to tell you
You brought some joy inside my tears (You brought some joy inside my tears)
You have done what no one thought could be (Nobody ever thought it would be)
You brought some joy inside my tears
You brought some joy inside my tears
You have done what no one thought could be
You brought some joy inside my tears
You brought some joy inside my tears (Baby)
You brought some joy inside my
Strolling the summer days of imaginings in my head
And words from our hearts
I don't want to bore you with my trouble
But there's somethin' 'bout your love
That makes me weak and
Knocks me off my feet
There's somethin' 'bout your love
That makes me weak and
Knocks me off my feet
Knocks me off my feet
I don't want to bore you with it
I don't want to bore you with it
More and more
We lay beneath the stars
Under a lovers' tree that's seen through the eyes of my mind
And I reach out for the part
Of me that lives in you that only our two hearts can find

With no vivid reason here to find
Yet the thought of losing you's been hanging
'Round my mind
Far more frequently you're wearing perfume
But when I ask  Will you be coming back soon?
You don't know  never know
Well  I'm a man of many wishes
I hope my premonition misses
But what I really feel my eyes won't let me hide
‘Cause they always start to cry
‘Cause this time could mean goodbye
Lately I've been staring in the mirror
Very slowly picking me apart
Trying to tell myself I have no reason
With your heart
Just the other night while you were sleeping
I vaguely heard you whisper someone's name
But when I ask you of the thoughts you're keeping
You just say nothing's changed

Could change your joy and laughter to tears and pain
It's that love's in need of love today

Hate's goin' 'round breaking many hearts
Stop it please before it's gone too far
The force of evil plans to make you its possession
And it will if we let it destroy everybody
We all must take precautionary measures
If love and peace you treasure
Then you'll hear me when I say  woah-oh

Don't delay  send yours in right away
Hate's goin' 'round breaking many hearts
Stop it please before it's gone too far

I thought you would go then come back home
I thought the cold would leave by summer
But my quiet nights will be spent alone
You said there would be warm love in springtime
That is when you started to be cold
I never dreamed you'd leave in summer
But now I find myself all alone
You said then you'd be the life in autumn
Said you'd be the one to see the way
But now I find my love has gone away

Oh

Just like me they long to be
Close to you

The angels got together
And decided to create a dream come true
So they sprinkled moon dust in your hair
And golden starlight in your eyes
So true
And that is why
Never can say goodbye
Never can say goodbye
Even though the pain and heartache
Seems to follow me wherever I go
There's a very strange vibration
Piercin' me right to the core
Tell me why is it so
I don't wanna let you go
I never can say goodbye
That soon she'll have my mind
That girl thinks that she's so smart
That soon she'll have my heart
She thinks in no time flat
That she'll be free and clear to start
With her emotional rescue of love that you'll leave torn apart
That girl thinks that she's so bad
She'll change my tears to joy from sad
She says she keeps the upper hand
Cause she can please her man
She doesn't use her love to make him weak
She uses love to keep him strong
And inside me there's no room for doubt
That it won't be too long
Before I tell her that I love her
That I want her
That my mind and soul and body needs her
That I need to do all that I have to
To be in her love
I've been hurting for a long time
And you've been playing for a long time
You know it's true
I've been holding for a long time
And you've been running for a long time
It's time to do what we have to do
That girl knows every single man
Would ask her for her hand
But she says her love is much too deep
For them to understand
She says her love has been crying out
But her lover hasn't heard
But what she doesn't realize is that I've listened to every word

But I ain't left the ground

See the people lock their doors

Killing plagues the citizens
Unless they own police

Starvation roams the street

Infected by the grief

Glad for what we have

Or do we have to find our wings and fly away
To the vision in our mind?

I'm not one who make believes
I know that leaves are green
They only change to brown when autumn comes around
I know just what I say
Today's not yesterday
And all things have an ending
But what I'd like to know
Is could a place like this exist so beautiful
Or do we have to take our wings and fly away
God has made us fall in love  it's true
I've really found someone like you
Will it stay  the love you feel for me?
Will it say that you will be by my side to see me through
Until my life is through?
That may not be here forever to see me through
But I found strength in you
I only pray that I have shown you a brighter day
Because that's all that I am living for  you see
Don't worry what happens to me
'Cause in my mind  you will stay here always
In my mind we can conquer the world
That's why I'll always be around
You are the apple of my eye
I feel like this is the beginning
Though I've loved you for a million years
And if I thought our love was ending
You are the apple of my eye
You must have known that I was lonely
And I know that this must be heaven
You are the apple of my eye
By all the things you say that you'll do
Though much concerned but not involved
With decisions that are made by you
But we are sick and tired of hearing your song
Telling how you are gonna change right from wrong
'Cause if you really want to hear our views
You haven't done nothin'!'
It's not too cool to be ridiculed
But you brought this upon yourself
The world is tired of pacifiers
And we are sick and tired of hearing your song
Telling how you are gonna change right from wrong
'Cause if you really want to hear our views
You haven't done nothin'!

Doo doo wop—dum dum dum
Doo doo wop

We would not care to wake up to the nightmare
But when misled who knows a person's mind
Why do you keep on making us hear your song
Telling us how you are changing right from wrong?
'Cause if you really want to hear our views
You haven't done nothin'!!!!
Doo doo wop—na na na
Doo doo wop—oh
Doo doo wop—mmm co co
Doo doo wop—bum bum bum
Doo doo wop—mmm bum bum
Doo doo wop—mmm bum bum
Doo doo wop—mmm dum dum
Doo doo wop—go go go
Doo doo wop—oh
Doo doo wop—mmm bum bum
Doo doo wop—mmm
Doo doo wop—brr eh deh deh"
