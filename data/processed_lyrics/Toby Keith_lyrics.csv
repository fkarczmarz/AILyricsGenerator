lyrics
"For the first time in all of her years
I said Mama you gotta be kiddin' me
She said things ain't like they used to be 'round here
You just wouldn't believe it
Kids growin' up without Jesus
A good thing your Daddy ain't here to see this now
They stay higher than the water tower
In this thirty-five mile an hour town
I've had a back road buzz or two myself
It seems like heaven's slippin' further away
The devil ain't got far to go when they raise hell
We used to burn a hole through midnight
Smoking a stolen Marlboro Light and
On a good night might kill a fifth of Crown
But now there's a lower higher power
In this thirty-five mile an hour town
Oh we can't blame the babies for growin' up lazy
Why work when we'll give it to 'em
It's right there in the Bible we don't put out
Spare the rod and you'll sour a
Thirty-five mile an hour town

The yes ma'am's gone and the please's too
It's out the door with the thank you
In the evening you don't see a front yard football game
The neighbor kids have done away
With the shirts and skins
No one hits the front porch lights
To get their kids to come inside
Cause the streets ain't safe
For a bike to ride down
Since they printed a prowler
In this thirty-five mile an hour town
No they're going nowhere fast tonight
No matter how fast they drive in this
Nothing I could say ever seemed to matter
So I took a little drive just to clear my head
I saw a flashing neon up ahead
It looked like a place to find some satisfaction
With a little less talk and a lot more action
I paid the man at the door and pushed my way to the bar
Shouted for a drink over a screaming guitar
A drunk on a stool tried to mess with my head
But I didn't even listen to a word he said
I knew somewhere amid all this distraction
Was a little less talk and a lot more action
A lot more lovin' is what I need
Let's get on down to the main attraction
With a little less talk and a lot more action
The look she shot me through the glass refraction
Said a little less talk and a lot more action

I'm a little too gone
A little too tired of this hanging on
So I'm letting go while I'm still strong enough to
It's got a little too sad
I'm a little too blue
It's a little too bad
You were too good to be true
It's a little too late
Only time you and me wasting is the time it takes to walk right out that door
It's a little too late
I'm a little too gone
A little too tired of just hanging on

I'm a little too gone
I'm a little too tired of just hanging on
So I'm letting go while I'm still strong enough to
It's got a little too sad
I'm a little too blue
It's a little too bad
You were too good to be true
It's a little too late
Tidal wave come across the Mexican border
Why buy a gallon  it's cheaper by the barrel
Just don't get busted singin' Christmas carols
That's us  that's right
Gotta love this American ride
Both ends of the ozone burnin'
Funny how the world keeps turnin'
Look ma  no hands
I love this American ride
Gotta love this American ride
Momma gets her rocks off watchin' Desperate Housewives
Daddy works his ass off payin' for the good life
Kids on the YouTube learning how to be cool
Livin' in a cruel world  pays to be a mean girl
That's us  that's right
Gotta love this American ride
Both ends of the ozone burnin'
Funny how the world keeps turnin'

Poor little infamous  America's town

Got herself a record deal  can't even sing a note

Customs caught a thug with an aerosol can
If the shoe don't fit  the fits gonna hit the shan
That's us  that's right
Gotta love this American ride
Both ends of the ozone burning
Funny how the world keeps turning
Hot dog  hot damn
I love this American ride
Gotta love this American ride
Oh  yeah
Raise a daughter and a son
Be a lover to their mother
Everything to everyone
Up and at them bright and early
I'm all business in my suit
From my head down to my boots
I don't do it for money there's still bills that I can't pay
Providing for our future's my responsibility
And I can't call in sick on Mondays
When the weekends been to strong
I just work straight through the holidays
And sometimes all night long
You can bet that I stand ready when the wolf growls at the door
But if dying's asked of me
I'll bear that cross with honor
Cause freedom don't come free

Meet my twin sister Betty Lou
And we're both feeling kinda wild tonight
You're the only cowboy in this place
And if you're up for a rodeo
I'll put a big Texas smile on your face
I ain't as good as I once was
I got a few years on me now
But there was a time back in my prime
When I could really lay it down
And if you need some love tonight
Then I might have just enough
I ain't as good as I once was
But I'm as good once as I ever was
I still hang out with my best friend Dave
I've known him since we were kids at school
Last night he had a few shots
Got in a tight spot hustling a game of pool
With a couple of redneck boys
One great big bad biker man
I heard David yell across the room
Hey buddy  how 'bout a helping hand?

But I'm as good once as I ever was
I used to be hell on wheels
Back when I was a younger man
Now my body says  You can't do this boy
I ain't as good as I once was
That's just the cold hard truth
I still throw a few back  talk a little smack
When I'm feeling bullet proof
So don't double dog dare me now
Cause I'd have to call your bluff
I ain't as good as I once was
But I'm as good once as I ever was
May not be good as I once was
But nothin's somethin' special when we had it all together
It wasn't about no money  it wasn't about the kiss
A little somethin' 'bout somethin' that she thought she might of missed
I rolled around in a gutter  sang a lot of blues
With a hole in my soul and a hole in my shoes
I was lonely  lonely in the 4-0-5
Then I heard it on the street she grew tired of the cold
Somebody said they saw it on a Facebook post
Said she was coming back but they didn't say when
And then her sister called and told me she was movin' back in
Yeah  seeing is believing  but I had my doubts
Till my baby called me up and said she's 20 miles out
Said she was lonely  my baby's back in the 4-0-5
Yeah  she left Oklahoma in the middle of the night
Tried some other lovers  but couldn't get it right
Now she's driving in from Dallas  up I-35
Man  I never felt so alive
She's back in the 4-0-5
Yeah  she's back  back in the 4-0-5

And we finally found forever  I can see it in her eyes
It's all about love  sweet love in the 4-0-5 (Sweet love in the 4-0-5)

Talkin' 'bout love
I got me a job doing lawnmower repair
I met an army recruiter down at the Winn-Dixie
The first place we landed was a base called Ballad
They convoyed our asses to a 10 acre F.O.B
With my boots and my cover and an old M16
Two bottles of water and a cold M.R.E
Oh you'll meet lots of new friends and you're sure to get paid
We'll show you the world and we'll teach you a trade
Ah but you never told me I'd get my ass shot at
You never told me I'd get my ass shot at
The first night in combat we went out on patrol
They ambushed our convey and we chased the asshole
We found them all hiding in low water ditches
And we took aim and killed all them son of a bitches
Oh you'll meet lots of new friends and you're sure to get paid
We'll show you the world and we'll teach you a trade
Ah but you never told me I'd get my ass shot at

Ah but you never told me I'd get my ass shot at
Said somebody’s been shot  somebody’s been abused
Somebody blew up a building
Somebody stole a car
Somebody got away
Somebody didn’t get too far  yeah
They didn’t get too far
A man had to answer for the wicked that he done
Take all the rope in Texas  find a tall oak tree
Round up all of them bad boys hang them high in the street
For all the people to see
That justice is the one thing you should always find
You gotta saddle up your boys
You gotta draw a hard line
When the gun smoke settles we'll sing a victory tune
And we'll all meet back at the local saloon
We'll raise up our glasses against evil forces
Singin' whiskey for my men  beer for my horses
We got too many gangsters doing dirty deeds
We've got too much corruption  too much crime in the streets
It’s time the long arm of the law put a few more in the ground
Send them all to their maker and he'll settle them down
You can bet he'll set them down 'cause

Second hand tires with poor boy tread
Made a lot of almost love in the bed of that
Truck that got stuck a lot
Just letter jacket boys singing Jerry Jeff songs
Drinking everything we could get our hands on
Learnin' ‘bout right by doin’ it wrong
Hopin’ we didn’t get caught
And we spent what little bit of money we had
On Wintergreen Skoal and main street gas
If you’re lucky you can take her cross the railroad tracks
Where the man in the moon works his magic
On the second runner up of the 4H pageant
That was fourteen hundred and fifty two beers ago
Oh
Skipped that town on my birthday
For eighteen years I was headed that way
Where old red stopped I just stayed
In a room without a view
I met a one look girl in a two bit bar
I had a place and she had a car
I won her heart with my guitar
I sang her the homesick blues

That was fifteen hundred and sixty two beers ago
Oh
We spent what little bit of money we had
On Wintergreen Skoal and main street gas
Go get your girl and go make the drag
If you’re lucky you can take her cross the railroad tracks
Where the man in the moon works his magic
On the second runner up of the 4H pageant
That was sixteen hundred and fifty two beers
Sixteen hundred and fifty three beers ago
I was always quick to strike
Had everything I own
In the saddles on my bike
I had a reputation
For never staying very long
Just like a wild and restless drifter
Like a cowboy in a song
I met a dark haired beauty
Where they lay the whiskey down
In southern Arizona
In a little border town
She had to dance for money
In that dusty old saloon
I dropped a dollar in the jukebox
Never see it coming
It just hits you by surprise
It's that cold place in your soul
That fire in her eyes
Makes you come together
Like wild horses when they run
Now the cards are on the table and
The bullets in the gun

She was sitting on my lap
We still had shots to kill
When a man pulled up
Who owned the bar
In a Cadillac DeVille
He grabbed her by her raven hair
And threw her on the floor
Said no free rides for the cowboys
She jumped up and grabbed my pistol
Stuck it in the fat man's back
Said open up the safe
And put your money in the sack
Then tied his hands behind him
And put a blindfold on his eyes
You're dumb enough to die
Never see it coming
It just hits you by surprise
It's that cold place in your soul
That fire in her eyes
Makes you come together
Like wild horses when they run
Now the cards are on the table and
We rode across the border
Down into Mexico
When you're running from the law
Ain't that where everybody goes
We came to a town
With a name I could not spell
She gave me what I came for
In that Mexican motel
I woke up to sirens
And the sound of running feet
There were fifty Federales
Locked and loaded in the street
She grabbed my .44
I grabbed the money in the sack
She kissed me for the last time
And we headed out the back
Every gun was on us
And every heartbeat pounded
There's only one thing left to do
When they got you all surrounded
She fired that old pistol
But we didn't stand a prayer
Money hit the gravel
Bullets filled the air
Never see it coming
It just hits you by surprise
It's that cold place in your soul
That fire in her eyes
Makes you come together
Like wild horses when they run
Now the cards are on the table and
The bullets in the gun
Bullets in the gun
Bullets in the gun
And some jackoff walks up cruisin' for a bruisin'
Poppin' off and makin' my whole redneck red
He asked my girl if she'd like to dance
He had three buddies so I had no chance
I looked around the room for a friend and I saw Fred
A quick evaluation of the situation
And we entered into a conversation
It seemed to last the better part of the next two songs
Now I didn't say and they didn't ask
But Fred did two tours over in Iraq
Call a Marine
Instead of 911
They're built to improvise  adapt and overcome
When you're in knee deep and you're up shit's creek
And you've tried everything
Tell you what you do
Call a Marine!
Now my sister's husband didn't love her no more
And he runned off with a skinny little whore
And left her sittin' around the house with a couple of kids
She just lays around in that muumuu gown
Old girl put on about 35 pounds
If you wanna fix what troubles you
Just ease down to the VFW
And you'll walk through the door and turns those boys' heads
For most of those boys it's been awhile
Just show a little leg and that Marlboro smile

Some douche bag rises up and overthrows his government
Diplomacy ain't workin' and the ammos all been spent
The world is in a crisis and the media's a curse
I'll tell you what to do
When it goes from bad to worse
Call a Marine
Instead of 911

 we'll always recognize
 we lit up your world like the Fourth of July
 Uncle Sam put your name at the top of his list

 Uncle Sam put your name at the top of his list
 oh

Got the news on Friday mornin'
But a tear I couldn't find
You showed me how I am supposed to live
And now you showed me how to die
I was lost 'til Sunday morning
I woke up to face my fear
While writing you this good-bye song I found a tear
I'm gonna miss that smile
I'm gonna miss you my friend
Even though it hurts the way it ended up
I'd do it all again
So play it sweet in Heaven
'Cause that's right where you wanna be
I'm not cryin' 'cause I feel so sorry for ya
I'm cryin' for me
I got up and dialed your number
And your voice came on the line
With that old familiar message
I've heard a thousand times
It just said  Sorry that I missed you
Leave a message and God bless
I know that you think I'm crazy
But I had to hear your voice I guess

I'm gonna miss that smile
I'm gonna miss you my friend
Even though it hurts the way it ended up
I'd do it all again
So play it sweet in Heaven
'Cause that's right where you wanna be
I'm not cryin' 'cause I feel so sorry for ya
I'm cryin' for me
I'm still cryin'
I'm cryin' for me
Oh
And I will be the first to say  I was glad to see it go
And day by day  ever since you went away
I find that I am still missing you  and I have just got to know
Does that blue moon ever shine on you
I want to hold you close to me  feel just like it used to be
And baby  if you feel like I do
You can come to me
Does that blue moon ever shine on you
On my mind  you were right there all the time
I could search and never find someone that does me like you do
Here is the part where I am giving you my heart
Does that blue moon ever shine on you
I want to hold you close to me  feel just like it used to be
And baby  if you feel like I do

And baby  if you feel like I do
You can come to me
Can't leave it up to him  he's knocking on my door
And I knew all of my life  that someday it would end
Get up and go outside  don't let the old man in
Many moons I have lived
My body's weathered and worn
Ask yourself how old would you be
If you didn't know the day you were born
Try to love on your wife
And stay close to your friends
Toast each sundown with wine
Don't let the old man in
Many moons I have lived
My body's weathered and worn
Ask yourself how old would you be
If you didn't know the day you were born
When he rides up on his horse
And you feel that cold bitter wind
Look out your window and smile
Don't let the old man in

Look out your window and smile

With a short little note that said I had a good time
It was written in lipstick red
She didn't sign her name I wonder
If that's a little secret that she keeps
She's calling my name again
She took my new sunglasses and my old jean jacket
And she never even bothered to ask
You could say I haven't seen her since late last summer
But every night she comes back
Just like smoke through the keyhole
She slips in so silently
She's calling my name again

I'll be losing my mind till she comes back to me

Thinking about what I'll say to prove
That we should go out for a laugh or two
Instead of going home tonight
'Been a long day  no break
We made it to the middle of the week
And I'm thinking that I'm probably gonna need
To get to know you casually
Just having fun  two for one
Watch a good time get a little better
Ain't no ball and chain for the suits and skirts
Just drinks after work
Drinks after work
Tell me what's it gonna hurt
To have a little drink after work?
Happy hour's like a holiday
Hanging with you's like getting away

For a little while
It's a whole lot better than being stuck
In a drive-time 9 to 5

Washed in the blood
And raised on the banks
Of the Mississippi mud
She always had a thing
About falling in love with a bad boy
But her daddy never dreamed
She'd grow up that fast
You know what I mean
The way a girl gets
When she turns 17
Kind of crazy
She's a rebel child
And a preacher's daughter
She was baptized in dirty water
Her mama cried the first time
They caught her with me
They knew they couldn't stop her
She holds tight to me and the Bible
On the back seat of my motorcycle
Left her daddy standing there
Preaching' to the choir
You see God love her
Oh me and God love her

She kissed her mama goodbye
Said I'll be sure 'n phone you
She called from a truck stop
In Tucson Arizona
With Amazing grace
We made California line
And then my gypsy life
Started taking its toll
And the fast lane got empty
And out of control
And just like an angel
She saved my soul from the devil
She's a rebel child
And a preacher's daughter
She was baptized in dirty water
Her mama cried the first time
They caught her with me
They knew they couldn't stop her
She holds tight to me and the Bible
On the back seat of my motorcycle
Left her daddy standing there
Preaching' to the choir
You see God love her
Oh me and God love her
Now she holds tight to me and the Bible
On the back seat of my motorcycle
Left her daddy standing there
Preaching to the choir
You see God love her
Oh me and God love her

It's the Fourth of July
I get to wake up in your freedom
But sometimes I wonder why
Seems like everybody's pissin'
Happy birthday America
Whatever's left of you
You were the darlin' when you saved the world
WW I and II
France would just be part of Germany now
If it hadn't been for you
Now your children wanna turn you in
To something other than yourself
They burn your flag in their city streets
More than anybody else
Happy birthday America
It's the Fourth of July
I get to wake up in your freedom
But sometimes I wonder why

All the broken-down cities
By the left's design
And the right can't seem to get it right
Most of the time
Every time I go to town and vote
I just come home with the blues
The lesser of two evils
All we ever get to choose
Happy birthday America
It's the Fourth of July
I'll get to wake up in your freedom
But sometimes I wonder why
Seems like everybody's pissin'
Happy birthday America
Whatever's left of you
Here you come a-running  you're looking for some cover
I know you're sad and lonely  I know you're feeling blue
You miss him so much  won't let me get too close to you
Stop all this foolish wishing  he ain't worth missing
I know your head is turning  I know your heart is burning
You know I'm here to save you  but you ain't through crying yet
Look at your pretty face  all red and soaking wet
I'm gonna try and make him just a memory
Stop all this foolish wishing  he ain't worth missing
I know your head is turning  I know your heart is burning
If you need someone to hold you
Someone to ease your pain
Well  I'll be holding steady

And I wrote your number on the fifty-yard line
You were always the perfect one and a valedictorian so
Under your number  I wrote call for a good time
I only wanted to get your attention
But you overlooked me somehow
Besides  you had too many boyfriends to mention
And I played my guitar too loud
How do you like me now?
How do you like me now  now that I'm on my way?
Do you still think I'm crazy standing here today?
I couldn't make you love me  but I always dreamed about
Livin' in your radio  how do you like me now?
When I took off to Tennessee  I heard that you made fun of me
Never imagined I'd make it this far
Then you married into money  girl  ain't it a cruel and funny world?
He took your dreams and he tore them apart
He never comes home and you're always alone
And your kids hear you cry down the hall
Alarm clock starts ringing  who could that be singin'?

And we got yuppies  we got bikers
We got thirsty hitchhikers
And the girls next door dress up like movie stars
We got cowboys  we got truckers
Broken-hearted fools and suckers
And we got hustlers  we got fighters
Early birds and all-nighters

Puts a big smile on my face
No cover charge  come as you are
We got divorcees and a big bouncer man
An old jukebox and a real bad band

Is my list of things to do today
Go to the bank and the hardware store
Put a new lock on the cellar door
I cross 'em off as I get 'em done but when the sun is set
There's still more than a few things left I haven't got to yet
Take a deep breath of mountain air
Put on my glove and play some catch
It's time that I make time for that
Wade the shore and cast a line
Look up a long lost friend of mine
Sit on the porch and give my girl a kiss
Wouldn't change the course of fate
But cutting the grass just had to wait
Cause I've got more important things
Like pushing' my kid on the backyard swing
I won't break my back for a million bucks
I can't take to my grave
So why put off for tomorrow what I could get done today...

Good whiskey at the Alamo
When he walked the streets of old Mexico
While Blackbeard was fleecing around the hurricane season
He didn’t quit because of a girl
While Russia was brawling
I bet that Old Stalin was calling for a vodka martini
While the world waited in fear
They couldn’t drink their diamonds and pearls
I ain’t getting much done but I’m having fun
Sailing on the deep blue sea
My whole body goes numb from a bottle of dark rum
And the sun sinking down on me
My catch of the day is a tall Cuba Libra
Chased down with a 12 ounce Curl

Slice 'em in the bushes  crank 'em in a creek

The day the paved the parking lot
Somebody hung a ribbon up
And then they cut it down
And that big white rose upon that sign
Put innocence in all our lives
We could see its neon light
From half a mile out
Gas was .50 cents a gallon
They'd put it in for you
They'd bump your tires and check your oil
And wash your windows too
And We'd shine those cars bright as bright
We'd go park underneath that light
Stare out at the prairie sky
There was nothing else to do
And now there's plywood for glass
Where the windows all got smashed
And there's just a chunk a'concrete
Where those old pumps used to stand

And we'd pull up and fall in love
And they've all moved away
Strangers used to stop and ask
How far they've driven off the map
And then they built that overpass
And now they stay out on the highway
'Cause there's plywood for glass
Where the windows all got smashed
And there's just a chunk a'concrete
Where those old pumps used to stand
And that neon sign was the heart and soul
Of this ol' one horse town
And it's like it lost its will to live
The day they shut it down
I know this boulevard much too well
It hasn't changed since I've been gone
They paved the road through the neighborhood
I guess the county finally fixed it good
It was gettin' rough
Someone finally complained enough
Fight the tears back with a smile
Stop and look for a little while
The only thing missing is me
That's my house and that's my car
That's my dog in my back yard

Where she lays her pretty head
I planted that tree out by the fence
Not long after we moved in

Alright boys
Tell me what you got on your mind
I guess those college boys all went home for the summertime
So why is it so hard to find
A place to lay your pretty little head down once in a while?
Don’t you sweat it
Everything is waiting inside for you
You know I got it
Come and get it
And who’s the one guy that you come running to
When your love life starts tumbling?
I got the money if you got the honey
Let’s cut a deal let’s make a plan

Don’t you sweat it
Everything is waiting inside for you
You know I got it
So come and get it
And who’s the one guy that you come running to
When your love life starts tumbling?
I got the money if you got the honey
Let’s cut a deal let’s make a plan
I've never asked you where you've been
I've never called and checked your story
You stayed out with all your friends
I've never tried to catch you lyin'
I didn't want to know the truth
Than go on lovin' without you
I wish I didn't know now what I didn't know then
I wish I could start this whole thing over again
I just don't want to know how it ends
You'd still have my heart in the palm of your hand
I'd still look like a fool in front of your friends
What I didn't know then
I've always said what I don't know
Couldn't hurt as bad as leavin' you
Turns out I knew what I was thinkin'
It ain't an easy thing to do
I sure found out too much to stay
Please don't say you're sorry
I might wait another day

What I didn't know then
You'd still have my heart in the palm of your hand
I'd still look like a fool in front of your friends
What I didn't know then
 howling at the moon
 up all night wonderin' where I'd been
 I guess you thought it was funny
 you ain't much fun since I quit drinkin'
 now I'm killing myself
 sackin' the trash
 honey do that
 you ain't much fun since I quit drinkin'
 well
 tailspin draggin'
 sackin' the trash
 honey do that
 and I got to thinkin'
 you ain't much fun since I quit drinkin'
The moment that your lips touched mine
Somethin' shot right through me
My heart skipped a beat in time
There's a different feel about you tonight
It's got me thinkin' lots of crazy things
I even think I saw a flash of light
It felt like electricity
'Cause I'll just close my eyes and I won't know where I'm at
And around and around and around
They'd never believe we're just friends
If you do baby kiss me again
Everybody swears we make the perfect pair
But dancin' is as far as it goes
Girl you've never moved me quite
Quite the way you moved me tonight
I just wanted you to know
I just wanted you to know

'Cause I'll just close my eyes and I won't know where I'm at
And around and around and around
They'd never believe we're just friends"
