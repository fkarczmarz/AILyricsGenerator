"Didn't I know the things I had
Oh all the things
Adios amigos so long
Didn't I know my hands were both cut off
So catch me catch me catch me if you can
Yeah call the operator
Catch me catch me catch me if you can
Catch me catch me catch me if you can
Adios amigos so gone
Call me up when you're in Tarascon
Didn't I know the things I had
Oh all the things
(Yeah that's what I said)
So catch me catch me catch me if you can
Yeah call the operator
Catch me catch me catch me if you can

All in the moment
Can it tell a story that can be told throughout time?
And it's like in every song
I've been as hard on you guys as I have been on the labels about this stuff
Songs have to have a lift
They have to have dynamics
They have to have space
It's not like I disagree with everything that you guys said
I'm like whatever the artist said
And that's not because I don't trust you guys
It's because I'm thinking about
I'm just trying to get home
In my heart I feel alone
I want it all right now
I'm goin' to hell right now
I want it all right now
I want it all right now

I was in a very famous TV show (Ooh)
I'm BoJack the Horseman (BoJack)
And I'm trying to hold onto my past
That I'm more horse than a man
Or I'm more man than a horse
I'm BoJack the Horseman (Goddamn!)
What the hell was I thinkin'  bro?
When you're an artist
Yeah  it's hard to play it safe
That show stumbled hard
Right out the starting gate
Wonder if I'm ever
Gonna get another chance
Maybe a listicle at best
 gimme gimme that dip
 gimme gimme that dip
 gimme gimme that dip
 gimme gimme that dip
 gimme gimme that dip
 yeah
 you were there
 woo-ooh
 we were there
 woo-ooh

 oh weeyahah. nunununu hu nuhuhuh
 he's from upstate
 all the suffering obliterates our speed
 hiding in the kitchen
 all the suffering obliterates our speed
 all the suffering obliterates our speed
Borderlines got every man ready to jump off
One by one  they fall
One by one  they fall
Quarter-  dime- and penniless in a parking lot
I got a black cat baby and it's following us
I got a black cat baby and it's packed away
I got a black cat baby and it's wrapped around my leg
One by one  they fall

Borderlines and aliens  glowing in the dark
Borderlines got every man ready to jump off

You're kicking on back when the zig-zag put you on the floor
But the Beach Boys bring that endless summer to your room
From the dive bar you can make it to that sold-out show
But if things stop and lock down
Got to bend that ear near to the ground
Like hand-written mail we're just tales that are soon forgotten
Sink your teeth in the flesh of this new horizon
Being cannonball
Cannonball
If you're caught between a rock and me and watch you wait
You might also likeI'll follow ya
As if you were my lover
Yeah even if the dance is lost
And we're all going under
Like hand-written mail we're just tales that are soon forgotten
Sink your teeth in the flesh of this new horizon
Be cannonball
Cannonball
Cannonball
Oh coming down
You know you got me
Bringing all hell to the board
Cannonball
Bringing all hell to the board
Cannonball
Bringing all hell to the board
Bringing all hell to the board
You can light the fire  open up the window
You can make a choice by seeing where the wind blows
You can watch me sleeping and I can watch you dreaming
You can change the channel and I can change the feeling
You can find the key and I can find the way out
I can sit awake from midnight to daylight
You can watch me sleeping and I can watch you dreaming
You can change the channel and I can change the feeling
Chloe  I don't need a reason
Well  I'm bound by the sweet condition

All the way from New York City
And the sunlight in your eyes
Pins and needles
No surprise
And the moon shines in your hair
And it's all handled
You close your eyes and count to ten
Don't swallow any seaweed
Or if you do you're starting again
You either didn't or you did
Talking 'bout talking from within
Talking 'bout how you wanna live
We call it metamorphosis
Yeah this is metamorphosis

I'll stand outside in the rain
A little bird just told me so
It's time to start over again
So I'll man up and take this boat
Far away from these shores
And I'll reach behind an enemy line
And find my curable cure
'Cause it's a cruel and beautiful world
And I got my girl
And if it seems like we're falling behind
Or just slipping on top from the mouths of our mind
I buried a treasure far off near the desert
I'm trying to find my way there
It's been too long since I've been myself
And my eyes can't see anymore
But there's a song inside this heart of mine
And I'd like to sing it to you
'Cause there's an earthquake shaking inside my country
Now what am I gonna do?

And how I got all burned out
You got me always thinking about
Everybody's got a place they like to go
I get the feeling that you wanna lose control
And you know that I'll go there with you

You're looking for your holy ghost
And what you gonna find?
Is it somewhere you like to hide?
So you'll run around your ego
You'll run around your gold coast
You know you got the time
Because this prison is our own design
So you're thinking of your future
Your thinking of some old past
And it's your time to shine
So what you gonna go and leave behind?
And there's no one to be in with
There's nothing left downstairs
And when you feel despair
What's your method to get out of there?

Was coming up when all the rain was pouring down
You'd never know that I was always spinning
I turn the corner and I pass right through the crowd
Me  I would never know
See  I can never wait
Me  I can never stop my world from spinning
See  I can never grow
Me  I can never be
Say here I stand
I was broken now I'm brave
Say here I am
Found my colours in the grey
My legs are tired  but I keep on pushing
I drop my hands and let my head fall heavy down
It's like I found my only child gone missing
I raise my arms up to the sky and show my crown
