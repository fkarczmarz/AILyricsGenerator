"Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Can you hear me now?
This is not the girl you used to know
Talking to you now
I don't think you want me to explode
It's a countdown
It took you too long to find out
What you want right now
I'm too gone to stay around
Switching up my style
You might also like
(In space)
They always seem to want you when you go
It took you too long to find out
What you want right now
I'm too gone to stay around
Switching up my style
You was fuckin' with a sucker but you dealin' with a real now shawty (For real)
Pretty face and your ass off the hook (Skrrt!)
Would you bend if you don't know me? (What?)
Bitch don't like life ‘cause you don't want me
Think you could do better? Well we sure gon' see (Okay)
Listen one thing still in the pen right now (What?)
I'm too gone to stay around (Uh-huh)
I'm the only one that's been right here
Why you acting like you don't care?
I been down since day one
Don't let the tables turn
Don't let the bridges burn
Been down for you  don't get it confused
Boy  you could lose your turn
Don't let the tables turn
Don't let the bridges burn
'Cause everything could change in a matter of days
Depending if you've learned
Why you acting like that? (Ooh  ooh)
You gon' miss me when I'm gone
Why you acting like that?
(Why you acting like that?)
(Ooh  ooh)
Why you acting like that? (Ooh  ooh)
You gon' miss me when I'm gone
Why you acting like that?
When I leave I'm taking off
You might also like
Baddest bitch in the world right here
You ain't even gotta go nowhere
Boy  you better watch the way you walk
'Cause if you trip you're gonna fall  oh
Don't let the tables turn
Don't let the bridges burn
Been down for you  don't get it confused
Boy  you could lose your turn
Don't let the tables turn
Don't let the bridges burn
'Cause everything could change in a matter of days
Depending if you've learned
Why you acting like that? (Ooh  ooh)
You gon' miss me when I'm gone
Why you acting like that?
(Why you acting like that?)
(Ooh  ooh)
Why you acting like that? (Ooh  ooh)
You gon' miss me when I'm gone
When I leave I'm taking off
But you gon' turn your beauty right into a beast (Uh)
I ain't tryna be second  just for the record (Record)
I see you slippin' you trippin'  thought I should let you know
I admire your effort but I need better love
See many men try to play me 'til they get scared away (Right)
I told 'em that's a fall  try out another day (Right)
This is different  now I'm seeing that it isn't (Mmm)
Promise I'm not gon' cry here like Mary J
Now ain't that funny  that you was something special 'til
I noticed that you just like these losers who come in severals
But I  know that if you leave you comin' right back
So my question boy is  why you acting like that?
Don't let the tables turn
Don't let the bridges burn
Been down for you  don't get it confused
Boy  you could lose your turn
Don't let the tables turn
Don't let the bridges burn
'Cause everything could change in a matter of days
Depending if you've learned
Why you acting like that? (Ooh  ooh)
You gon' miss me when I'm gone
Why you acting like that?
(Why you acting like that?)
(Ooh  ooh)
Why you acting like that? (Ooh  ooh)
You gon' miss me when I'm gone
Why you acting like that?
Haha
It. Must. Be the ass that got me like damn
And our situation won't matter
I come to make you smile in the freakiest manners
Off the Wall like MJ in his early days
It's the Inc. and Lopez now
Ain't that funny?
It's been a while since you came around
Now you wanna see what's goin' down
Tryna tell me how you want my time
Tryna tell me how I'm on your mind (On your mind)
You should've never played the games you played
Now I'm seein' that you're kind of lame
Knowin' how the situation change
Ain't that funny? (Ain't it funny?)
Now I can smile and say
Ain't that funny? (Ain't it funny?)
I'm glad I can smile and say
Ain't that funny?

I remember how you walked away
Even when I tried to call your name
See at first I didn't understand
Now you're lookin' like a lonely man (Lonely man)
I remember how you did me wrong
And now you're hurtin' 'cause my love is gone
Everybody gets a chance to burn
You can take it as a lesson learned
Ain't that funny? (Ain't it funny?)
Now I can smile and say
Ain't that funny? (Ain't it funny?)
I'm glad I can smile and say
Ain't that funny?
Never been a sucker for chocha
And ain't that funny?
How they want me see me workin' with money but Caddy ain't a dummy
What these brodies want from me?
And Murda I.N.C
I really wish you wouldn't send me gifts
Tryna make me sit and reminisce
Tryna blind me with your blinging bling
Thought I told you love don't cost a thing (Love don't cost a thing)
Hope you realize that now I'm through
And I don't ever wanna hear from you
I had enough of bein' there for you
Now I'm laughin' while you play the fool
Ain't that funny? (Ain't it funny?)
Now I can smile and say
Ain't that funny? (Ain't it funny?)
I'm glad I can smile and say
Ain't that funny?
I got my boyfriend
(Ain't it funny?)
Is that your girlfriend?
Loca
Enamorada

It seemed to be like the perfect thing for you and me
It's so ironic you're what I had pictured you to be
But there are facts in our lives we can never change
Just tell me that you understand and feel the same
This perfect romance that I've created in my mind (In my mind)
But yet we find ourselves in a less-than-perfect circumstance (Ooh)
And so it seems like we'll never have the chance
Ain't it funny how some feelings you just can't deny (Oh)
And you can't move on even though you try? (Oh)
Ain't it strange when you're feeling things you shouldn't feel?
Ain't it funny how a moment could just change your life (Oh)
And you don't want to face what's wrong or right? (No)
Ain't it strange how fate can play a part
In the story of your heart?
You might also like
Sometimes I think that a true love can never be (Never be)
I just believe that somehow it wasn't meant for me (Ooh)
Life can be cruel in a way that I can't explain
And I don't think that I could face it all again
I barely know you but somehow I know what you're about (You're about)
And now I feel that I don't have to be afraid
Ain't it funny how some feelings you just can't deny (Oh)
And you can't move on even though you try? (Oh)
Ain't it strange when you're feeling things you shouldn't feel?
Ain't it funny how a moment could just change your life (Oh)
And you don't want to face what's wrong or right? (No)
Ain't it strange how fate can play a part
In the story of your heart?
I locked away my heart
But you just set it free
Emotions I felt
Held me back from what my life should be (Ooh)
I pushed you far away
And yet you stayed with me
I guess this means
That you and me were meant to be
Ain't it funny how some feelings you just can't deny (Oh)
And you can't move on even though you try?
Ain't it strange when you're feeling things you shouldn't feel?
Ain't it strange how fate can play a part
Ain't it funny how some feelings you just can't deny (Funny)
And you can't move on even though you try? (Even if you try)
Ain't it strange when you're feeling things you shouldn't feel?
Ain't it funny how a moment could just change your life (Change your life)
And you don't want to face what's wrong or right? (Wrong or right)
Ain't it strange how fate can play a part
Ain't it funny how some feelings you just can't deny (Can't deny)
And you can't move on even though you try? (Even though you try)
Ain't it strange when you’re feeling things you shouldn't feel?
Baby
Ain't it funny how a moment could just change your life?
And you don't want to face what's wrong or right?
Ain't it strange how fate can play a part
Ain't it funny how some feelings you just can't deny
And you can't move on even though you try?

I do believe we'll laugh and reminisce

I gotta leave you alone (Come on now)
All my pride is all I have
The path you chose to run alone
Promises you made about coming through
So much time you wasted
I thought my tender touch could lock you down (Yeah)
That's the way you used to giggle right before I put it down
I gotta leave you alone (What you want now?)
'Cause I'm good holding down my spot
Stop acting like that
And I'm good reppin' the girls on the block
Now you know you need to stop
Here we go
All my pride is all I have
The path you chose to run alone
Ain't nothing you can say to me that
The path you chose to run alone
The path you chose to run alone
I promise you

¡JLo!
Sudor desenfrenado cuando tú y yo nos juntamos
Sin piedad (Aquí no aguantamos)
Nos damos
Cuando hacemos el amor

Vuelvo a la vida cuando toco tu cuerpo

Tenemos la fortuna de perder el control (¡JLo!)
Se oculta la luna (¡Ey!) cuando sale el sol  (Duro)

Yo quiero hacértelo lento (Bien lento)
Tu cuerpo (Muy lento)
Cuando hacemos el amor

Vuelvo a la vida cuando toco tu cuerpo (¡Hey!)
Hay emociones que no puedes controlar
Y gente que te vuelve loca

¡Oh!
You know I need you
Gotta have you (What?)
Can't be without you (J.Lo)
It's like downtown New York in the middle of traffic jams
All I really want you to know is who I am
You can find me low-key in the back of the club
Or with some fine females  rollin' on dubs
You and me big pimpin' on a shopping spree in L.A
Paparazzi's and critics  who give a damn what they say?
Boy  I never knew I could feel the way I felt when I met you
I could never forget you
I realize more and more I adore your pretty eyes
But what I wanna know from you is do you wanna share my love's bliss?
I long for the day when I'm feeling your kiss (I need you)
Can you love me for a lifetime for just in one night?

Can't be without you
Papi  I got something to say to you (Woo)
Blessed and cursed on the day that I felt the power of you  (Woo  woo)
And there comes a time in our lives when things change (It's a brand new day)
And baby  I'll spend it with you
What I wanna know from you is do you wanna share my love's bliss?
I long for the day when I'm feeling your kiss (I love ya)
Can you love me for a lifetime but just in one night
I gotta have you (Can't be without you)
Can't be without you (Baby  I love you)
Baby  I need you (I gotta have you)
Can't be without you
Baby I love you (I love you too)
You know I need you (Woo  J.Lo)
Gotta have you (Pied piper  what? What?)
Can't be without you (Uh  J.Lo)
It's like downtown New York in the middle of traffic jams
All I really want you to know is who I am
You can find me low-key in the back of the club
Or with some fine females  rollin' on dubs
You and me big pimpin' on a shopping spree in L.A
Paparazzi's and critics  who give a damn what they say?
In the rear  drop-top Bentley on somebody's highway
Who let it jumpin' in some club on this valet?
Got a little smoke  got a little drinks sittin' in V.I.P
Got a little buzz with my hands up  honeys feeling me
Got that Cris' sittin' on ice like a gansta lean
Hands surrounding them like dice like security
After party in the Ritz Carlton  penthouse suite
All my thugs and me  breath smelling like Hennessey
Got a few friends flying in from San Diego
It's a surprise party for my homie J.Lo
I need you (Baby  I love you)
Baby  I love you (I gotta have you)
Ooh (Baby  I need you)
Ladies (I gotta have you)
Do you know what I'm talking about? (Can't be without you)
(I gotta have you)
Hey  hey

Why I love at your command
From the words you speak

A mix of passionate fidelities

Lo mejor que suena ahora
JLo
Nace de la nada y se convierte en todo
Nunca imaginé enamorarme así
No tenías previsto sentir amor
El amor es así
Y a veces tentación
El amor es así
Depredador
Ellos no saben lo que se siente
Cuando estamos juntos tú y yo
Nos dimos cuenta de lo que hicimos
Y tu corazón es testigo
Dime qué fue lo que pasó
Tenemos el control

Tenemos el control
Que sea lo que Dios quiera
Yo quiero vivir contigo
Lo hacemos a tu manera
Porque a mi me da lo mismo
Que sea lo que Dios quiera
Yo quiero vivir contigo
Lo hacemos a tu manera
Ellos no saben lo que se siente
Cuando estamos juntos tú y yo
Nos dimos cuenta de lo que hicimos
Y tu corazón es testigo
Dime qué fue lo que pasó
Tenemos el control
Tenemos el control
Que sea lo que Dios quiera (¡Motif! Yo te lo dije)
Que sea lo que Dios quiera (lo mejor que suena ahora)
¿Y por qué te ahogas? (Por la soledad)
Di por qué me tomas fuerte así mis manos
Y tus pensamientos te van llevando
Yo te quiero tanto (¿Y por qué sera?)
Aunque en el futuro haya un muro enorme
No me ames porque pienses que parezco diferente
Tú no piensas que es lo justo ver pasar el tiempo juntos
Y tú así serías lo que yo de mi reflejo
No me ames para estar muriendo
Dentro de una guerra llena de arrepentimientos
Con tu gran amor por el azul del cielo

Ayer a nuestros labios les sobraban las palabras
Porque en los ojos nos espiábamos el alma
Y la verdad no vacilaba en tu mirada
Ayer nos prometimos conquistar el mundo entero
Ayer tú me juraste que este amor sería eterno
Porque una vez equivocarse es suficiente
Para aprender lo que es amar sinceramente
¿Qué hiciste?
Hoy destruiste con tu orgullo la esperanza
Hoy empañaste con tu furia mi mirada
Borraste toda nuestra historia con tu rabia
Y confundiste tanto amor que te entregaba
Con un permiso para así romperme el alma
¿Qué hiciste?
Nos obligaste a destruir las madrugadas
Y nuestras noches las borraron tus palabras
Mis ilusiones acabaron con tus farsas
Se te olvidó que era el amor lo que importaba
Y con tus manos derrumbaste nuestra casa

Yo borraré todos tus sueños de mis sueños
Que el viento arrastre para siempre tus recuerdos

Oh  oh-oh
When I sleep  I have dreams about the way we used to kiss
'Bout the way you used to hold me
And say nothing would ever harm me
Made me smile when I was down
Big pimping around the town  you and me
Whenever they'd see you  they'd see me
A lover and a friend to me you were  how did it end?
How it hurts to not have you in my life
When I wanted to be your wife
You never know what you have 'til it's gone
Treated you wrong for so long
Now you're gone away
But the love still lives here
Still  I still got love for you
Still  after all we've been through
Still  I gave my heart to you
And baby  you're the only one (The only one)
There's other men than you
Still  they can come close to you
I knew you'd be the only one

A good man you were to me  always there to care
Would do anything in this world for me (Oh  oh)
I never thought we'd part from the arguments we'd start
When I just wanted to get some attention (Sorry)
And I'm sorry  baby for bitching
If I could take back the words
That I said to make you leave
I'd be down on bended knees
Asking you to please forgive me
You never know what you have 'til it's gone
Treated you wrong for so long
Now you're gone away
But the love still lives here
Still  I still got love for you
Still  after all we've been through
Still  I gave my heart to you
And baby  you're the only one (The only one)
There's other men than you
Still  they can come close to you
I knew you'd be the only one
All of the good times we had together (Together)
Do they mean something to you?
Do you ever wish we never split?
'Cause I still got love for you
Still  I still got love for you
Still  after all we've been through
Still  I gave my heart to you (Gave my heart to you)
And baby  you're the only one
There's other men than you (There's other men than you)
Still  they can come close to you
I knew you'd be the only one
Still  I still got love for you (Still got love)
Still  after all we've been through
Still  I gave my heart to you
And baby  you're the only one
There's other men than you
Still  they can come close to you (I love you)
All those could-have-beens became her sacrifice
You met me halfway
Now we know what it takes for our ever after
And I sing
This is me now
This is me now
This is me now

A woman in love is what I grew up wantin' to be (In love's what I wanted to be)

I found my shootin' star
This is me now
Seduciendome despacio
Tuya me sentí  todo te lo dí
Y hasta el alma me has robado
Yo nunca pensé que pudiera querer
Con esta pasión que me quema la piel
Volar por tu cuerpo es el cielo tocar
Quiero contigo llegar
Una noche más  oh
Quisiera inventar nuestro amor
Una noche más  oh-oh
Sentir junto a ti la pasión
Una noche más
Oh-oh  oh-oh-oh
Necesito más de lo que me das
Todo ya no es suficiente
Me deje llevar por un beso más
Yo estoy presa para siempre
Mi vida no tuvo sentido sin ti
Vivir de ilusiones fue igual que morir
En otras caricias no pude encontrar
Todo el amor que me das

Like a movie scene
In the sweetest dreams
I have pictured us together
Now to feel your lips
On my fingertips
I have to say is even better
Than I ever thought it could possibly be
From all of my sadness  the tears that I've cried
I have spent all of my life
Waiting for tonight  oh
When you would be here in my arms
Waiting for tonight  oh-oh
I've dreamed of this love for so long
Waiting for tonight
Oh-oh  oh-oh-oh
Tender words you say
Take my breath away
Love me now and leave me never
Found a sacred place
Lost in your embrace
I want to stay in this forever
I think of the days when the sun used to set
On my empty heart  all alone in my bed
Tossing and turning  emotions were strong
I knew I had to hold on
