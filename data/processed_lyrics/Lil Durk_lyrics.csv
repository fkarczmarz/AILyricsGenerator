"I would  but I know they lyin'
(I been through this shit before  you know?)
Foenem told me keep my iron
My mama had a dream about me dyin'
I told her that I hope she lyin' (For real)
It's gon' be a homicide
It's gon' be a homicide
Fuck with Durk and they dyin' today (Facts)
They told me that they sick and tired
They don't wanna die today
I be off them drugs  addicted to narcotics (Narcotics)
2012  niggas wasn't with me in the 'partments
Why you steady playin'  ho? Let me be they father (Father)
Kill his ass in the streets  we hope they don't charge us (They don't charge us)
We can't find your ass  we gon' kill your artist (On God)
And you know it's guaranteed when I say promise (Yeah  yeah)
And I got some shorties that gon' shoot (Shoot)
They gon' do the shit you ain't gon' do (You ain't gon' do)
They gon' slide through your block  they make calls on you (Let's get it)
You hang with them and don't supposed to  it's gon' fall on you
Spit on me bad when I was down  I'ma ball on you
And you ain't thinkin' 'bout getting no money 'til it dawned on you (Yeah  yeah)
I ain't still signed to French  but I'd kill for him (Let's get it)
Who say I ain't got no money? I'm like a mill' on (A mill' on)
You turned a ho into a housewife  she still goin' (Still goin')
Voice of the trenches  talkin' for the streets (for the streets)
Teachers say I might be dead 'cause I love the streets (Bitch)
And she still told me that my grades above a B
The streets don't love anyone  but they in love with me
Fuck with me and it's a homicide
Try to clean my image with a turkey drive (Turkey drive)
Went in eighteen  he gettin' out when he like thirty-five
Lie to you none  but in jail I say a hundred lies
How the fuck you mad and I gave your ass a hundred tries? (Oh)
Don't feed your gang when they snake you  you gon' wonder why
Tryna tuck my pride away  oh (Tryna tuck my pride)
I ain't really tryna die today (I ain't really tryna die)
Certain shit I can't tolerate (No)

Why the opposition callin' my line  tellin' me to come outside?
I would  but I know they lyin'

My mama had a dream about me dyin'
I told her that I hope she lyin' (For real)
It's gon' be a homicide
It's gon' be a homicide
Fuck with Durk and they dyin' today (Facts)
They told me that they sick and tired
I don't even drink for real  but I damn near fucked a bottle girl
When I'm in the club with niggas I don't like  we havin' bottle wars
Said to my man like we on that nigga ass  ain't no talkin' to us
Champagne back to back in the Gucci store when I walk through it
Get high  then I treat the mic like therapy 'cause I talk to it
I sit back and ask myself  Why? so many times
They treatin' sports just like the streets  they tryna give 'em fines
He in the trenches without a gun  I called and gave him mine
Bumped heads with my day ones yesterday  I say I'ma give 'em time
Hope BA get right back off that time  they gave him fifty-five
I hate Tayski gone forever  we locked in on 59th
Me and my auntie had some words  that shit ate me alive
See  my lil' daughter bad as hell and she ain't even five
He got the same time as the shooter and he ain't even drive
An O-P-P got hit in his T-O-P and he ain't even die
I've seen so many young niggas lose they lives
That's why when I go to a funeral today  I don't even cry
And that real shit run in my veins
Some niggas I don't fuck with for real  they just wanted my stain
I put ninety on your head  that's one of my chains
And I can't cap  that nigga Von made me go to Johnny Dang
I'm swingin' first whenever a nigga ask me what I bang
When you lose five niggas in one summer  that's when you'll feel my pain
I'm the highest in the room  I feel just like La Flame
They'll give you life  but change to a dub if you give 'em names
If a nigga I know support my song  they'll call 'em groupies
And they ain't even meet Lil Baby  but they'll go post his music
And I be stressed out with my kids  sometimes I don't call at all
And you be actin' like you off Percs  but you off Tylenol
I done popped some X and I told my mama I was off Adderall
These ain't no Guess jeans
I cannot mention my homies inside of my song 'cause I know they be trappin' a lot
Yeah

Love Songs for the Streets 2
I got niggas who locked up who niggas lied on
These niggas shootin' at these kids  they shootin' in blindfolds
And I got niggas in the trenches who I'd die for
They got a murder that's unsolved  it got my mind gone
And foenem still'd be right here if he ain't take his mask off
Kenneka Jenkins' murder still unsolved  oh
They said I still can't do no shows in Chicago
That's why I'ma charge a hundred fifty for a concert
I'd rather do hundred years than see my mom hurt
I wonder what was in his mind in that Tahoe
Off this ecstasy  I cannot sleep-ay-ay-ay
Wash this gun powder off with some bleach-ay-ay-ay
I'm Lil Durk and I be representing the trenches
Steady ready running from the Jakes  we hoppin' fences
I regret I caught that case  I had a witness
And when I'm talking to the streets I bet they listen
When I was down bad on my dick  they ain't pay attention
Man  I fell down to my knees when the law came
And I can't go like Mitch in the hallway

Thats why I gotta ride through all the opp shit
I don't do relations so don't waste it
Bitch ain't send me money  I had to face it
And since my car white they'll swear I'm racist
She say she freak nasty so I'm on that shit
Niggas snitching here  he'll get his face lift
Bitch I'm from Chicago where we go ape shit
If we catch a hommie we don't say shit
Even rappers know we ain't who to play with
I can't wife a eater  I just freak her
Pass her to my niggas like a blunt of reefer
30 don’t jam it's like aquafina
Free my nigga Jam that lil boy a demon
And since I got my deal  I feel important
I live what I rap and just record it
They tried to give me 10 if I didn't have a lawyer
Niggas out here snitching  they're straight informers
Try Me! Try Me!
Bullets got his name on it like a ID
Sipping on the lean is like my IV
My crazy life  I feel like YG

We all change  you say I change alone
Sleepless nights  barely changin' clothes
You know damn right you was wrong

Certain vibes  it don't feel right
Plenty nights got me traumatized
Why they lie? I do love my guys
You lookin' crazy  know the trenches raised me
I'm Durkio  but I'm Chicago JAY-Z
And I was scared how that money made me
I caught a vibe  but they was lookin' crazy
I can't even vote for who I believe in  shit ain't goin' right
I didn't drop a tear inside the funeral  I ain't mourn right
And I nut in all the hoes I fuck  I blame the porn site
Please don't turn away from me
I got enough on my plate tryna turn away  tryna turn away
Became the voice of the streets and my people ain't believe in me
I'm supportive of the streets and them people ain't believe in me
