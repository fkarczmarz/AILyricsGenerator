lyrics
"I've been gettin' up with some boys I used to know
We're tryin' to get our pockets up
This year has just been movin' fuckin' slow
You were comin' out to Pineville  it was freezin' cold
I'm gettin' old by the day
You said it gave your heart somethin' to believe in
'Cause boys like us fade away
But you stuck around when I was down
And I'll owe you all my days
Them boys of faith
Them boys of faith
High tide  it's been risin' up
I've been gettin' up with some boys I used to know
We're tryin' to get our pockets up
This year has just been movin' fuckin' slow
You were takin' photos of me in Kentucky
Sayin' we were lucky for the light
Who'da thought those things would find a billboard
Way out in New York at night

Thinkin' of the times that you didn't bat an eye
All those times of shade
Them boys of faith
Them boys of faith
High tide  it's been risin' up
I've been gettin' up with some boys I used to know
We're tryin' to get our pockets up
This year has just been movin' fuckin' slow
High tide  it's been risin' up
I've been gettin' up with some boys I used to know
We're tryin' to get our pockets up
Tik-Tok talkin'  late-night TV
There's still so much that I have yet to know
We get dressed up just to go downtown
In some ego-filled late-night crowd
Seems to be where I feel the most alone
I'd like to get lost on some old back road
Find a shade tree and a honey hole
And talk to my grandpa again
And I see God in everything
The trees and pain and nights in the spring
So why do I still long for a home?
I'd like to lay in a field on a cozy blanket
And feel the fear of never wakin'
To know thе true warmth of the sun
I'd like to lovе my lady long and hard
And lay down lines of laymen guitar
Never leave her lovin' arms again
My exes hate me and my friends all miss me
I wanna drown in rotgut whiskey
Leave this small town for a while
Head to Paris on a late-night flight
Find a bar and get in a fight
Write a few poems on a sunny balcony

I wanna be a child climbin' trees somewhere
Breathin' in the fresh  outside air
And before I knew this life was unkind
I want a well-trained dog on a couple of acres
A kind  kind lady and a place to take her
Few good friends I can count on one of my hands
I know I'm bound to die one day
So when I reach those golden gates
I pray to say I did the best I can
Sit with my mother and the dearly departed
Send a prayer down to the broken-hearted
Let 'em know it all turns out just fine
To know me is to love me and to hate me is to wrong me
I prefer my nights so lonely
I'm a simple man  I don't need much
Just my simple songs and some human touch
I'm tired now so I'm bringin' my ass home
So let me go down the line
So let me go down the line
So let me go down the line
So let me go down the line
So let me go down the line
So let me go down the line
Tryna build an empire of the things that they can take
Damn you and damn all your ties to this machine
Ties to this machine
But them vampires are groping you every night on East and 12th
To keep them bloodsuckers at least a four-inch blade away
A four-inch blade away
Them damn cold vampires been keeping me awake
Tryna build an empirе of the things that they can take
So damn you and damn all your ties to this machine
Ties to this machine
'Cause them vampires will take every ounce of the blood that you can give
Let 'em know that you're walking alone to a warm home tonight

Oh my heart is on the mend
Nobody gives a damn about me
You can tell me that you love me 'til your little lungs turn blue
But I'm always alone when I fall asleep
And the girls that walk downtown
Are like some stars that fell to earth
They like the veins in my arms
And the story in my hurt
The boys they always tell me that my words get 'em by
They can tell how much I mean it by the bloodshot in my eye
So don't try to make this my fault
If you plan on leaving don't come at all
Lord knows  no glory in the fall
If no one's around at the end of it all
I'm condemned  I'm condemned
Oh my heart is on a mend
Looking for somebody just to save me
I'm condemned  I'm condemned

You can tell me that you love me 'til your little lungs turn blue
Down past the Texas line to make sure he's not alive
They dumped him off of a river bridge in the fall of '84
Word got around that he climbed out of that muddy red river floor
Lost my bride to the finest man she claims to have ever known
When she got to the parkin' lot his knees were already blown
Bet he misses her floatin' past the barge
With one eye and crooked teeth
One eye and crooked teeth
One eye and crooked teeth
One eye and crooked teeth
Your crooked teeth are floatin' and my lady's restin' fine
Seven miles out of Bismarck next to Bakken oil lines
I laid her down so softly and so kindly reassured
And I'll drive through Colorado on a rocky stretch of road
With no one who loves me as far as telephone poles go
The only thing worth trusting is some brass through crooked teeth
Some brass through crooked teeth
Some brass through crooked teeth

All is fair in love and war
So what the hell are we even fightin' for?
I'm on your front porch beggin' for my dawns back
Give my goddamn records and my clothes back
'Cause I'm through
And by the time she wakes
I'll be halfway to my mama's home
It just dawned on me
Life is as fleeting as the passin' dawn

 deep Manhattan
 your dress and how it falls
 starts as ends
 I've been comin' down on a Greyhound
 when you hear the rain
 then that's just what I'll be
 there's laughter this evenin'
 please pay my tab
 I've been comin' down on a Greyhound
 when you hear the rain
 then that's just what I'll be
 when you hear the rain
They shipped me off in a motorcade
You don't even know what you're fighting for
I lost friends in the August heat
At night it was God I'd always meet
I've got women in the West I wanna hold
And I lost you in a waitin' room
After sleepin' there for a week or two
Doctor said he did all he could
You were the last thing I had that was good
So I walked miles on the Tulsa streets
Light started beamin' in from the east
6 AM and fucked up again
Askin' God where the hell He'd been
He said the sun's gonna rise tomorrow
Somewhere on the east side of sorrow
You better pack your bags west
Stick out your chest
And then hit the road
The sun's gonna rise tomorrow
Somewhere on the east side of sorrow
Don't give it a reason to follow
Let it be  then let it go

Heard your brother lost his mind in the city last fall

If you ever get the time come on home
I heard Turnpike's back together and they're writin' songs
He said the sun's gonna rise tomorrow

Did you ever make it back to El Dorado?
I'd call and ask  but hell if I know
If I still got your number or if you care
You moved away when you was younger
Was it escape or was it hunger?
Kansas ain't no place to be a man
You used to say you'd settle down
With that kind girl from school in town
She was gone before you got back home
To El Dorado  hell if I know if you're still alive
There's a note in the glove box of your drive
El Dorado  hell if they know the difference in a hero
And a man I wish was still by my side
Seventeen years old
How our grins look scary bravе

You're in every last memory alive
And I called last week to talk to my favorite old devil dog
I don't need a music machine telling me what a good story is  and matter of fact I've never asked nothing from nobody
I've taken my motorbike down the Pacific 101 and I have stood atop the Empire State Building with my father
I've ridden in fear  although  I was afraid every single time
I've learned that every waking moment is enough and еxcess never lеads to better things  it only piles and piles atop the things that are already abundantly in front of you like breathing and chasing and slow dancing and love making  fighting and laughing
I am unhinged  unworthy  and distasteful to mostly everyone I meet  however I am loyal to a fault to anyone I find kindness in I do not and will not fear tomorrow because I feel as though today has been enough
And I got no hate in my heart for anything  anywhere  or anyone
And I think fear and Fridays got an awful lot in common  they're overdone and glorified and always leave you wantin'
And my blood's at a boil  there ain't no fire
I just love the way the light beams in
But I got bad news  I'm fearin' Friday again
Chokin' on some bourbon when you roll up
There's a house hoppin' on the edge of town
Won't you get angry at me  say you love me again?
I got a fear dear  that it's a Friday spark
You only love me like you mean it when it's after dark
We can hide out tonight out where thе trees get clear
Those plеase-you-eyes are a man's worst fear
There's a name saved on your heart's gravestone
Saturday's coming  I fear I'm wakin' alone

In a photo Daddy took on a humid day
In a town that's anyone's guess
Way out in western Kentucky
She's broken-hearted as he's ridin' away
On a motorbike out to East LA
Between broken and lucky
It's the gettin' by that'll get a soul down
Somewhere alone in some coastal town

And I can feel when your body ain't in this bed
I can still hear you laughin' last spring in my head
Now it's April and I hate you and I'm headin' home

In coat pockets and cabinеtry
Are in a shoe box from when we once talked

I'm finally leaving Austin and I wish it was with you
I am just a sickness and you seem to be the cure
How much can a southern girl honestly endure?
You were napping on my arms on a Sunday afternoon
Repression is my heaven but I'd rather go through hell
It's 'bout time that I left Austin
'Bout time you settled down
With a man who doesn't move as quick
As the train rolling through town
'Bout time that I face
The hard times I've let go
If love was just an ocean
I would drown before I float

Never make a home on the road

And I'm so damn glad you're here
How many sad songs it take to get your stubborn ass awake?
What finally got you risin' from your bed?
Was it the sunset on her cheeks leadin' down to a delicate collar bone
Or the judgement of your mind when you're alone?
I've been strugglin' to get back to you
And if you fight all night I'm sure you'll gain the guts to try
To get past the things that you've been through
'Cause no one plays it cool quite the way you do
Are those tires you got still turnin'?
Is that spirit you had still burnin'?
Do you still talk that shit the way you did before?
All the women and the wages and the wars that I've been wagin'
I just don't feel like fightin' anymore

That I bet his ass could never cash
He’s bettin' on the eight ball landin' in the side wall
Cold-blooded killer if you ask
But every night  he needs me to land himself a red three
Corner pocket at 12 AM
Only twelve-years-old  but I got ahold
Of a pool stick I was gifted from him
My father is a bettin’ man
But I got myself a steady hand
He's sittin' in the corner with a six-pack of Corona
Bettin' that his son'll win again
Go bet another six-pack  bet I make a comeback
I know that this table's got a lean
Won't you takе me fishing? And I wanna try out
For the sevеnth grade football team
You'll probably be nothin’ but this town’s old drunkard
And die on a smoke-stained stool
But right now  he's got a bargain that he’s taken too far
On his boy's game of nine-ball pool

One rainy night in a well-used chair
Tellin' me how well you used to dance
The western wind will come again
And make you feel like you did
When all those cowboys didn't stand a chance
You said it all turned out awfully fair
So tell me tales of all the times and all the seasons you got by
Breathin' in that cold November air
When no one was there
No one was there
When no one was there
Two kids 'bout twenty-three
And the sunsets you'll never see
You were yellin' supper from the yard
And they grew old and sailed away
Called you on phones from far away
Wrote you novels on postcards

Memory gives warmth to right here

And you talk so strong but you can't stand straight
How'd you fall for a man I've grown to hate?
And I can drive you by where I learned to curse
He's got his creased dress whites in an all black hearse
Why's the green more green in the east of Eden?
Swing on by 'cause I know you ain't eaten
Did the city beat your ass like the trash you are?
There's still smoke smell in your old fast car
You can't hide where you're from
With nightcrawlеr blood on your castin' thumb
You can fight and fiend and sell your guns

You'll always be the Oklahoman son

Ten more hours to a twelve long shift
'Til these woods turn to her eyes

Monday morning when the blades are sharp

And cut sequoia 'til it's dark
If every hour's fourteen dollars or a chance closer to her
And I don't know who she is or if she might exist
But if she does I swear to love I'm destined for that kiss
How's a man get so homesick
For a face he's never seen?

And think of boys I could've been

Through these trees and melodies

There ain't been no sun in L.A.​
Since you moved out of Sarah's place
I love your mother's stories 'bout you as a kid

Out at Sarah's place
And you called to talk just last week
I'm still fallin' apart like I'll always be

Drank a cup of coffee couple hours south

How the city makes a country boy dream
Played pool in Colorado after snow all night
It rained in Carolina but we played just fine
Charles is always better than last week

A roof over my head and a band that don't miss
Healthy dog that hugs me when I'm home

It can't get better but what have I ever known?

For an eternity it seems
And everything is desolate and empty and nothing and hopeless
I'm lost  but I know where I'm going
And I see this small light
A dim one growing bigger and brighter and closer and stronger
And the closer I get  the more I see
Some frosted windshields that hadn't been touched for hours
I hear a song  and it's faint
And I can't make out the name  but I know every word
I feel my feet first
And the wind takes my breath with it
And then I walk up to this door  and I knock even though I feel I don't have to
And I don't know where I am  but I know exactly where I am
And this crack of light widens on this porch underneath me as this door opens
And this brown-haired girl with the brightest smile
I don't know who she is  but I know her so well
And behind her  the warmest home I'd ever seen
She says
Where have you been? We've been waiting on you all night
We've missed you
She says to the kindest smirk I'd seen in so long
Then she tapers off the sentence with the
With the peaceful sound that a lady makes
She grabs me on the forearms  pulls softly into the dining room

And we're all standing  and I'm laughing at a joke I'll never hear again
I don't know where I am  but I know exactly where I am
And then she tucks her head between my collar as a friend
Between my collar and my jaw  and there's no weight at all

Know that I'll be by your side
You bled your whole soul into things you can't control
In a world you'll never satisfy
I bandage up your body and your bones and your bad days too
Take care of the blood that your love runs through
I know all the damage that some days in this dark world does
You were laughin' last week at somethin' I dreamed of
Come say hello to Stanley first
When you finally feel the blood you spill into everybody else
I'll tourniquet your toes to the ground
Spring your kind ass into town
You’ve been playin’ your guitar from arenas to the bars
Since you were old enough to rhyme a word
But your face is gettin' thinner and you’re prayin' for the winter
And I heard you fucked it up with her

I bandage up your body and your bones and your bad days too
Take care of the blood that your love runs through
I know all the damage that some days in this dark world does
You were laughin' last evenin' at somethin’ I dreamed of
I bandage up your body and your bones and your bad days too
Take care of the blood that your love runs through
I know all the damage that some days in this dark world does
She were laughin' last evenin' at somethin' I dreamed of
There's delays on the planes out of Eastern Montana
Where you told me you were leavin' from
You've been stabbed in the back and the rest of your body
Knows a good place for a boy to drown
They look at me so strange when I talk
I wish I was a tradesman
Learnin' from some beat down old layman
On some hillside they ain't named yet
Sleepin' next to mountain fire smoke
And everyone lately's scarin' me
It's all backdoor deals and therapy
The only callous I've grown is in my mind
I wish I was a tradesman
Playin' with some tuned up tired string band
Somewhere out by the badlands
Way past closin' time
And know the old feelin' of a fivе o'clock smile
And know I didn't take no easy way out
There's somethin' more that I need
Than accolades and sympathy
Fatiguin' in the summer heat
While they smoke big cigars
So give me somethin' I can't fake
That rich boys can't manipulate
Somethin' real that they can't take

And know the old feelin' of a five o'clock smile
And know I didn't take no easy way out
Everyone lately's scarin' me
It's all backdoor deals and therapy"
