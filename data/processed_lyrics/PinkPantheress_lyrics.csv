lyrics
" she thinks we're still going strong
 but I don't answer my door
 I try to make myself believe
Johnny  my baby's hands  they grip my fingers when they're cold
He could be the one to make me never freeze again because
No one is as romantic as him  I want you to know
Everyone told me life was hard  but it's a piece of cake
Even if Johnny hasn't answered in a couple days (Let's go)
You won't check your phone so you can't tell me you're okay because
Johnny  my baby  did it always have to end this way?
'Cause one day (One day)
One day  my baby just went away (Went away)
My angel (My angel)
You're what haunts me now that you're away (You're away)
Everyone told me life was hard  but it's a piece of cake
Even if Johnny hasn't answered in a couple days
You won't check your phone so you can't tell me you're okay because
Johnny  my baby  did it always have to end this way?
'Cause one day (One day)
One day  my baby just went away (Went away)
My angel (My angel)
You're what haunts me now that you're away (You're away)

 babe?
 I think someone spiked my shit
 that's okay
Eternal happiness tonight (Hey)
But it was just another blip in my heart
Sometimes I think of calling you up
To make myself look bad again
But now I'm bringing flowers to your front door
I know it's not l-l-love (Yeah)
It's not something I want
Back at the start (Back at the start)
Back at the start
 will you pray on your knees
 but we mean a lot to me
 who would alter everything
Your heart was for the taking
Cause' sometimes it hurts to think
When it aches and it pains for you
Guess sometime you shout
Now I'm here right in front of you
And words bleed out my mouth
Have you thought of getting out?
You think tonight?
You think tonight?
Love you with all I've got
You think tonight?

Love you with all I've got

You think tonight?
You think tonight?
Love you with all I've got
You think tonight?
You think tonight?
On looks that I saw you give (On looks that I saw you give)
I'll buy the same everything (I'll buy the same everything)
How many times (How many times) do I dream of reachin' out?
Except you're everythin' I can't be
Except I get wonderin' еyes
It looks much better on thе side of your street
I'll always change because you want me to
Except you're everythin' I can't be

I won't have to hold my breath till you get down on one knee because
You only want to hold me when I'm looking good enough
Did you ever feel me? Would you ever picture us?
That you'll find me ugly and one day you'll disappear because
What's the point of crying? It was never even love
Did you ever want me? Was I ever good enough?
The boy's a liar  the boy's a liar
Good eno-o-ough  good eno-o-ough
Good eno-o-ough  good eno-o-ough
Good eno-o-ough  good eno-o-ough
Good eno-o-ough  good eno-o-ough
Come stay with me
I thought you liked the look about a girl just like me
Can you take a look inside your heart  is there any room for me?
I won't have to hold my breath till you get down on one knee because
What's the point of crying? It was never even love
Did you ever want me? Was I ever good enough?

Until I left the party the other night
Do you remember all the things that you said to me?
That came out of his mouth automatically
But I'm so used to saying
I’m fine
Despite (Those times)
One day I just wanna hear you say
I like you
What's stopping you? (Hey)
What’s stopping you?
Wish I could go back to lying beside you on the bed
I lie here thinking 'bout every bad mistake I've madе

I'm afraid of doing the things that you want me to
I wanna tell you everything that I do
I always hate the kinda love that we do
I played again and got hurt like I used to

But I was wondering if you'd like to have a chat
Shouldn't have asked 'cause you don't work like that
And you call yourself grown
But you still won't pick up the phone
But they phone me
And I'll figure out that you still can't make your way
Out of the ride that you hated yesterday
I know that you're tired but you don't say
How you're feeling alright
But next time I hope someone warns you of danger
'Cause how could you even guess you were in danger?
Maybe it's 'cause you're trying to find
Thе next stop out of town
So you'll stay out of danger
But who's to blame whеn you still claim that you're in danger?
I know it's late
But I was wondering if you'd try me on a date
And I know that no one's talked to you this way
And you're taking that everyday that it might come
But if you had a choice to leave then—
I know it's hard
To allow someone's entry to your opened door
To get to know the boy you don't know anymore
But I know that you're tired so you don't say
How you're feeling alright

Danger (Ah ah ah)
Maybe it's 'cause you're trying to find

So you'll stay out of danger (Danger oh oh oh)
I can't let go of your hand
I can't even breathe without you
I don't think you understand
Ha  ah  yeah
I love to watch you as you speak

In the morning how you like
Ha  ah  yeah
All I wantеd was to scream
When I saw one of hеr messages that popped up on your screen
Do you miss me? Miss me  ah
Does she miss you  too?
I can be discreet if you don't want her seeing you
With me on your arm (Yeah)
'Cause I know you can't tell her yet
Practice my I dos when I'm home 'cause I know I still want you

Wires on the floor  it plays twenty-four

This feelin' I pay you  while you're on the stage
Now I'm wonderin' what made me feel this way

I realize that I'm peakin' too early

So I gave her my number so she'll tell me when you're through
I've been busy floating for hours
And I haven't left my room
Every sound I make it's so loud
That's why I keep my mouth closed
 you never came  I travelled by car
 you won't make it very far
 she's me but prettier
 ah-ah-ah  ah-ah-ah-ah
 you never arrived
 we set last night  I guess you stood me up
 you never arrived

I never knew I could learn
'Cause I could start to doubt it if I'm into you
I'm not acting the way I think you'd like
We went for dinner and now you're acting paranoid
If only you knew the way I felt inside on that night
And that's 'cause lying's a big problem of mine (Just a problem for me)
I signed my name in marker pen (Yeah)
I must apologise

Swear you're never gonna see me fall
Take it how I get it then I ask for more
A different town is all I'm asking for

And I'm dreaming of you leaving roses at my feet (At my feet)
I'm obsessed with you in a way I can't believe

You're finally confident
Your thoughts fade away (Oh oh oh)
This doesn't happen easily and now you're feelin' like a winner
How many times have you cried while you're thinking it through?
Looks like you tried to face your demons last week but I know tonight
You finally met you tonight
You can say you finally met you tonight
You can do it all your own way
Can I check my numbers? 'Cause I want to
I know it's annoyin' how much I do
Spendin' you the day that I want  the day that I want
Another day then  maybe Tuesday?
Can I spend a fortune? 'Cause I want to
I know it's appallin' how I lose you
Spendin' every day that I want  the day that I want
What happened to me?
'Cause I just had a dream I was dead
And I only cared 'cause I was taken from you
You're the only thing that I own
I hear my bell ring  I'd only answer for you

I was too young startin' out  now I'm too scared that you might leave me

It's not a problem if it hurts because I can't feel ache anymore
I only came back home because I wanted to see what's changed
And when I realise everyone's gone  but I still feel the same
I wasn't meant to be
This bored at nineteen
My friend lived next to me
Now she won't wanna see
Me look differently
Now that I'm nineteen
And I wish that I could tell all my ex-jobs in retail
That I should've stayed at work 'cause of the A-Levels I failed
My cousin just told me that my favourite shop shut down
And the other one just told me that I've always got a frown
My  my mind's alone because I'm alone
My mind's alone because I'm alone
(Enough the lot  I've had enough)
My mind's alone because I'm alone (The gore  the pain)
(I've had so much  I love to hate)
My mind's alone because I'm alone (The way I shaped because I'm hurt)

But what did you really gain from it? (From it)
We split in two  now you don't want me
Now it's the start of July
You thought that you broke my heart and now every time that you see me you vanish (Vanish)
'Cause you assumed you really mattered (Really mattered)
But I was sound  I had it patterned
Now you're a burden of mine
D-D-D-Did you notice I cried  but only just a little bit? (Yeah)
Tell you I lied  then split down in the middle
'Cause you're taking one side  not the side that I like
Because you know I can't lie when you're in my mind
Y-Y-You're too cruel to be kind and I know that from experience
I can hear your replies  but it's maybe that I'm hearin' things
And I heard all your lies  there's no lies that I like
So I'll take that as a sign  you're a burden of mine (Hey)
Mine
Burden of mine  mine
Mine  of mine
I can't lose my life like this  I'll still fight and
If I die  please  let them find me
Because my lungs aren't workin'
Liquid fills the inside of them  stops me talkin'
You can see me underwater
As I descend  I see my life flash again (I see my life flash again)
Got a message tellin' me that I should come round to yours now
(Come round to yours now  come round to yours now)
I can't believe the fear in me when I had knocked on your door now
(Knocked on your door now  your door now  your door now)
And when I went inside and realized I'm the only one that arrived
(The only one that arrived  that arrived  that arrived)
I wish I stayed at home in bed 'cause then I might have survived (Might have survived  might have survived  might have survived)
You're not sorry
And no one else had this effect on me
Now I'm here  but  your neighbors will hear me screamin' until they find me here
So tell me  what did I do to deserve you killin' me this way?
I can't lose my life like this  I'll still fight and

I'm dead  I can't see
I'm dead  I can't see
Had a few dreams about you  I can't tell you what we did
I expected to see you on your morning run again
I know I shouldn’t be watching  'cause every time I feel the pain
I still see you live at home  when I run by your house
Feels like it was yesterday  that I lived on your couch
Never had a girl like you  you know how to make me cry
Should've talked about our problems
But we pushed them to the side
Saw your FaceTime at 1:05  I wouldn't answer
'Cause if I see your face again  I'll wanna see you after
I don't wanna be with you if you’re not happy
You told me it wasn’t over
Didn't wanna let you go
But was this before or after
I was slowly losing hope
I used to think we’d make it far
I thought we made it too
It's such a shame that we weren't the same at all

I know we both got a past  but it's past me

Wish that we could still be friends  'cause I ain't doing well
 now I'm entering my bed
 I can't tell you what we did
 it turned out that we are
 I think I lost the plot instead
 I know they listen to me
 but they’re thе outside lookin' in
 they can’t understand when they all cope with everything
 'cause they're not there anymore
 he told me there's no room for me
 almost as far as I can see
 but they're not there anymore (Hey)
 nah-nah-nah-nah)
 nah-nah-nah-nah)
 they always say
 hey)
 but they’re the outside lookin' in
 they can't understand when they all cope with everything

 he told me there's no room for me
 he told me there's no room for me
 he told me there's no room for me
I got to reason number five
To find words that described all the times
I caught myself and realised there are good things just ahead of me
But I know that I'm safe when I leave
And you can't speak to me
And when I can't receive
The words I know you mean
Nothing can sеt me free
I can go through things that make me sad
It's the only time off that I've had
Reason that I had at number one (Was I liked to)
Know the feeling well of being loved (Then number two)
I like the feeling of becoming numb (I can't choose)
Which one I prefer because you can't
Speak to me
And when I cannot receive
The words I know you mean
Nothing can set me free (It's better you leave me be)

I'm making the most of my life
Till the day that I hit twenty-five
I know that they'll make an adult of me
I know that I'm not quite ready to be
When I said some things that I knew that I shouldn't say
I opened up a letter of bills that I didn't pay
It's sad that I
Prepare to be so young till the end of time
I realised
When I struggled to get out of my room last night
Got on my phonе
And I begged for my brother to takе me home
When he asked why
I said I'd rather be here alone
I went to the doctor again
Said I was behind on my rent

 I turn off the light
 and stay a while

 you'd hold my hand

I'm built for another (Another)
A flower I'm growing wilted today  I chose it

Several feelings that you didn't once let me choose
(You turned on me)
I now look back when we yelled  it's reminiscent
I held the hope to find someone else

Are you too high? why can't you pick up the phone?
This tactic doesn't work 'cause I see you dancing on your own
I've missed the fact that you're throwing panties on the bed
I'm steady dreaming of times I'd rather be instead
I tried to give you space so I wasn't controlling you
Gave you all the reasons why I don't smile like I used to
Tell me all your lies and I'll act surprised
Even try and make myself look in your eyes but
Bitch about me to all your friends 'bout what they think of me
So then you can call me and talk all sweet to mе
I don't think you realize the way I'll dеspise you
And my resilience to not come different there before
How we shared everything and more
We were fighting all night
Cruisin' city take but our right
Mental warfare with you can't compare
