Yeah  ease it out for 'em
I like that
Now grab your cigar  grab your lady
Hug her tight and tell her that you love her
It's been a pleasure y'all
To all the women across the world  we can't diss y'all
To all my ladies in lingerie
Never underage  who stay gettin paid
Who like to take trips where the sun is shade
To my women who love to ball out
And spend all that money 'til ya fall out
I feel like a pimp with a different pimp game
With a different pimp name  with a little pimp fame
Even got a gat loaded for that ass
I don't drink or smoke that's why I love my body
You might catch me chillin with a little short hottie
With a little piercin on her body
Japenese girls even love my beats
They say  Timbaland we love you
We love the dope things that you do
They even call me things like wicked  and the f'n gov'na
That's why I can't forget y'all
That's why I had to make this roll call  uh

This here's for one and all
It's so good to feel all a y'all  oooh
Make that move and just ball out  oooh

This here's for one and all
It's so good to feel all a y'all  oooh
Make that move and just ball out  oooh
Life's too short for some time out  oooh
Back when shorty cherished the thing
Yo' time was frequently saved
For us stoppin and whiskey popping to the Marvin and Gaye
Sonny  don't plan tomorrow but live for today
Sonny  here's a quarter for that groovy arcade
From Cool J to Kane dawg  we changin the game
So graphic with things
Pac-Man ain't looking the same
Haters  get more familiar who you robbing for change
Sebast'  a.k.a. Tyler Durden's the name
Guess what people
It's the first of the month
Guess what people  I can do what I want
I can take  all my peoples on first class flights
I can buy all my homegirls lightning new bikes
I'm a don when it comes to just servin girls
I'm a don so that's why nobody's in my world
Cause Timabaland's that cool cat
I'm just tryna find what I need
But I'd rather be smokin weed
Live in a mansion next to Hanson
I ain't forgot that I'm from yo' hood
I'm just tryna' be who you would
Cause I hate the game  I hate the glory
I could be with y'all
It would be another story
You don't know all the things I seen
More than fame and his naked greed
They took my cash  take my name
Put it up in bright lights
I ain't got a damn right
Think I'm chilling and living large
Girl he's Mag not El DeBarge
But I'm a be the man in charge in due time
All my P-Town folk getting paid  bottom line
Aye  aye  aye
I'm holdin' on your rope
Got me ten feet off the ground
And I'm hearin' what you say
But I just can't make a sound (Aye  aye  aye)
You tell me that you need me
Then you go and cut me down  but wait
You tell me that you're sorry
Didn't think I'd turn around  and say
That it's too late to apologize
It's too late (Aye  aye  aye)
I said it's too late to apologize
It's too late (Aye  aye  aye)
Yeah (Aye  aye  aye)
I'd take another chance
Take a fall  take a shot for you  oh
I need you like a heart needs a beat
But it's nothin' new  yeah  yeah
I loved you with a fire red
Now it's turnin' blue  and you say
Sorry  like the angel

But we really wanna know how many coins you got
If you talking 'bout your rap  how many songs you got?
This for my bitches  all my bad bitches
Only if you independent and after your riches

Young nigga hit it right and smoked that good marijuana
She'll have you in the club mad  everybody want her

Runnin' out of energy
I come hot in the coldest way
Watch me turn it on
Watch me turn it on
No matter what you tell me  I will never give up
There's no excuse for failing  so don't hold your breath for love
I will never let you come and steal my joy
Just give up stop tryin'  I'm no concern of yours

I did it all for you  still you were lonely
It's funny how someone else's success brings pain
When you're no longer involved  that person has it all

I traded in my señorita for a microphone
If I was unsuccessful  would you be satisfied?
I need a paramedic girl  I’m feeling paralyzed
If I could choose  you will always be a friend to me
The more money I made you acting like my enemy  it's crazy
I can’t help it if you feel ashamed
Thought the pressure would turn you into my diamond babe
How can something so familiar be so strange
Closest friends get estranged when the status change  huh?
Is it my mistake  thinking that where I am and where you at?
And my homeboy Larry Live is the only one that had my back
You were the perfect pair and now it seems that we don’t match
Is it the money  want me to give it back?

To me and Dwayne Carter putting out the hardest shit
I should wanna go back to the one I started with
But I'm addicted to this life  it's gon' be hard to quit
Yeah  just ask me how things are coming along
You could tell me that you've never heard none of my songs

She always makin' plans today  come and find me tomorrow
Goodbye  girl
She's too invested in the hours that pass her by
I'd pay attention if I thought it was worth the time
Confusing passion for the love he never gave
Fall back on reasons that we know won't stand a chance
Watching her shoulders like a memory from the past
Confusing passion for the love he never gave
I couldn't get rid of shorty if I wanted 'cause she was down
But I was tired of playin' the role like I ain't know that she get around
Somethin' 'bout this girl fascinates me
She's the type that like to hang with the stars
The way she makes me feel and sedates me
Who knew we would take it this far?
Everywhere that I try to go  she got a Wanted poster with my face on it
Can't blame myself when it's not  my fault cause nothin' is promised
At least I can say I was honest -- goodbye  girl

But tonight I'mma leave
Find me someone in these streets
Frequent them slowly and not feel emotion
Cause he would do the same to me no doubt
So I'mma get even  I never believed in you telling me a lie
I'mma get busy and find me a nigga to lay with tonight
Pimpin' ain't nothing but game  treat all these niggas the same
Niggas and women  we all lie about how we living
We all lie about where we staying
We all lie about who we laying  we all do
We all lie about who we cuffing
We all lie about who we fucking  we all do
Baby don't worry about me  I be on the run like B
You ain't gotta hide your face cause I'm probably in the room right next to your suite
I think my girl might be cheating on the low
She say she need her space and she say she need to go
Oh man  I think my girl might be cheating on the low
I really hate to say it  but tonight I need to know
Need to know  are you fucking other niggas? UFO  UFO
Are you fucking other niggas? UFO  UFO
Are you fucking other niggas? UFO  UFO
Are you fucking other niggas? UFO  UFO
She say she need her space and she say she need to go
She say she want somebody she can talk to
I always say I will but I never do
She says she need somebody she can count on
She say she'll find somebody if it ain't me
And I'm getting the feeling that she finna creep
I think my girl might be cheating on the low
She say she need her space and she say she need to go

He could be alone with a dancer
Hear it in his tone when he answer
Four or five hoes in a week
But if I go out to cheat then I have no standards
Find me someone in these streets
Freak on him slowly and not feel emotion
I'mma get busy and find me a nigga to lay with tonight
Pimpin' ain't nothing but game (Game)
Treat all these hoes the same (Same)
We all lie about where we staying
We all lie about who we cuffing
You ain't gotta hide your face
'Cause I'm probably in the room right next to your suite
You might be fucking him and him and every brother 'round this bitch
I never knew until I thought I knew
I think my girl might be cheating on the low
She say she need her space and she say she need to go
Won't somebody save me? Everything I do feel like it's wrong
All we do is fall down even though we try to stay afloat
I swear it's gon' kill me even though you think it won't
So why rock the boat and make waves?
When everything's calm and okay
So why am I confused if you love me?
I thought this would be smooth sailing
'Cause I don't wanna let you go
But we're caught in the undertow
'Cause I am losing my control
But we're caught in the undertow
Our only prayer is all our own
But we need air  we go alone
'Cause I don't wanna let you go
But we're caught in the undertow
We change the illusion  whenever you go and set the sail
My heart's in your hand  don't you go hurt me again
All we got is one chance and it's sink or swim
So why rock a boat and make waves? (Make waves!)
When everything's calm and okay? (I'm okay!)
Why am I confused if you love me? (Love me!)
