Girl  you're my friend when I'm in need  lady
Life is one big party when you're still young
But who's gonna have your back when it's all done (yeah)
It's all good when you're little you're pure fun
Can't be a fool son  what about the long run (yeah)

I bet you wish you never burn that bridge
Oh no cause now you'd like to cross it
I bet you wish you never burn that bridge
Oh no cause now you'd like to cross it
I bet you wish you never burn that bridge
Oh no cause now you'd like to cross it
Climbing up the ladder you better watch your steps
Watch how you a flex and watch the moves you meck
Careful of the people you disrespect
Dem di repercussions man nuh take nuh checks
Cause when you coming down they might not wanna treat you right
And when you coming down that's when you gonna get the fight
And now your wishing that you were a little more polite
And now the table turn and everything a come to light
(Repeat)
It's no coincident the people you meet
You haffi careful how you move in the street
The same man you pass when you going up
That's when you have to face your real sorrows for real
I know you wish you never burn your bridges
But who cyaa hear haffi feel
When you haffi cross the river in a dark
Now your future lead you to the same path
But this pretty little senorita said it and I liked how it flowed
What is venga mi casa I really don't know
From the way that she smiled I could tell how the story would go
Chica bonita you pretty like a rose
Mi senorita mi love how you a pose
Dame un beso you hot and it shows
Toca mi vida and everybody knows
Baby baby baby
Tell me what you wanna do and where you wanna go
Ain't no need to rush it baby we can take it slow
I swear it must be cupid shooting arrows with his bow
I notice in your eyes a certain glow
Have me wondering now
Is it really me or tell me do you feel the same
I feel like I'm in love and I don't even know your name
I know what I am saying to you may sound pretty lame
Your love is like an everlasting flame
What is cinco cervezas I really don't know

Just 25 and I'm not ready yet
Hey love  let's make a deal
Give me some time I got a few hearts to steal
Hey love  got more grounds to gain
Can't get stuck with a ball and a chain
Hey love  I need to be sure
Come back and see me in two years or more
I remember as a kid I used to dream
I had a big crush on Sandra's kid sister Jean
But she was in love with Dwayne
It's been so many years but I still feel the pain
What about the girl across the street?
Took the same bus  I used to reserve her seat
But she would just sit with her friends
And the all talk about guys in Beemers and Benz
Seem like my luck took a slide
Then shorty came along and stood by my side
I couldn't give her much but she stayed
Now I'm hitting all the charts it's so easy getting laid
Living in style  I'm getting paid
Hooking up my peeps with the millions I've made
Now I'm having girls who I knew in first grade
Now I'm kinda feeling like my shorty getting played
So I'm begging you

We had a one room shack and the livin' was low
And my mama by herself raised me and my bro
Wasn't easy  but we did it with the little that go
Worked hard  got us up for school every day
And kept her eyes on the stars when the skies were gray
Gave us pride to survive  really showed us the way
Now I really understood what she was tryin' to say
She said  Son there'll be times when the tides are high
And the boat may be rocky  you can cry
Just never give up
You can never give up  uh-uh
In this life you could lead if you only believe
And in order to achieve what you need
You can never give up
You can never give up
And this hope
That keep me holding on
On and on
And this hope
That makes me carry on
On and on

Boom-boom  couldn't have made it alone
I got a wonderful life  two kids on my own
With a strong foundation that was carved in stone
And my mama for the love that made my house a home
Made me wonder some time if this was meant to be
All this for a humble little guy like me
And all I ever really wanted was a family
To teach my kids the same value that she gave to me
She said  'Son there'll be times when the tides are high
And the boat may be rocky  you can cry

You can never give up ' uh-uh

Reality check
You know what I mean
Street life's eh
When I was young
I use to dream of being rich
Have a lot of houses and cars
Couldn't know which one was which
And finding me a chick and getting hitched
Living the fairy tale life perfect without a ditch
You think that this would bring me happiness
If at the end of every rainbow
There was a treasure chest
Sometimes having more is really less
So take a look inside yourself
You'll realize you're really blessed
No matter how you're sad and blue
There's always someone who has it worse than you
Sometimes you gotta pay your dues
So don't worry just push on through
Keep'n it real
Gotta GIG up all my peoples who be working on the future
Though they know they gotta struggle
Keep'n it real
To all my homies working on the 9 to 5
And doing right to keep themselves up out of trouble
Keep'n it real
Although sometimes I know it seems impossible
There ain't no need in drowning in your sorrows
Keep'n it real

You can be sure there'll be a brighter tomorrow

Chorus
Are you looking for a man to make you lose control?
A man who when you need a friend will fill that roll
Be a life blanket when you're feeling cool
Girlfriend this is your lucky day
They don't call me Mr. Lover coz I like ice cream
I am Mr. Lover coz I fulfill dreams
When last your man made you moan & scream?
Girlfriend this is your lucky day
Verse 1
A lot of fellows ___________ show indeed
But have you ever wondered why a woman will cheat
It takes a real man to make a woman complete
Fellahs out dere acting like their on speed
But slower can be better if you wanna succeed
Listen to your woman & ask what she need
Sometimes it can be better if u follow her lead

Verse 2
You have a man
___________ that he's known
So if he's all of that
Then why are you on my phone?
Could it be that deep down you're feeling all alone
Something's telling me things aren't really great at home
You say you got a man
Well let's see what that means
What does he tell you stuff to make you feel like a queen?
It takes more than money girl to feel like a queen
Chorus
Verse 3
Love making should be fun
The lady should be satisfied before you're up & done
Ladies if your man is one who love to jump the gun
Let him go & call me later
Let a real lover show you how it's done girl

Don't you let one day go by without praising the most High
'Cause it's the only way we ever will survive
It's a mad mad world that we're living in

Gotta keep your heads up high  can't be giving in
Don't you let one day go by without praising the most High
'Cause it's the only way we ever will survive
False prophet make profit  focused on them pocket

Death toll rising  sex commercializing
Barely surviving  future jeopardizing
No compromising  hope paralyzing
Rules need revising  why is it surprising?

Filled full of pleasure from the rude boy's skill
Passion and ecstasy  you know the drill
Full up your cup 'til your juice's spill

Covered in sweat but feeling the chill

If I stay  would you put a end to all the games you play
Can you promise me that you will never stray
Has to be a new beginning from today  only way I will stay

I'm a typical Jamaican why you layin your frustration on me
When we met it was a perfect combination
But you know my reputation don't know what you were expecting from me
Fight back  you canfight get things a go if yuh nuh like that
Cause I know that when you leavin you come right back
Your new founded termination sounds to me like desperation
There's no ground for termination

My honey marches in and ask if I think I'm slick

I thought I could explain but then my story wouldn't stick
Incriminating pictures show me with some other chick
It happened once before and she was tired of the tricks
She ask me if I can spell the word evict

Made a little flex around by Flatbush Avenue
I'm calling to some honeys and sipping on my brew
That's when I saw the boys in blue
They pulled me to the side why I don't even have a clue
Looking for a reason and they finally found a few
A case of ammunition and a loaded .32
I can't believe what I'm going through
Why me Lord? Here I am I gotta face the time

Never let yourself be over come by greed
Walk the straight and narrow and you shall succeed
Get you act up to speed
And try no matter what it takes to give a next man a blye
Everybody else deserve a piece a the pie
Honesty the best policy no sell no samfie
And if ya need me ask why

Your like a jewel  baby
This ain't no pick up line
Epitome of a lady  truly one of a kind
Wear a precious diamond  wid all dem polish shine?
Can't wait to hold you closer  can you read my mind?
Later images for which I won't apologize
I hope that you can see the passion in my eyes
Won't over step our boundaries
These words are hard to find
Stated my intentions
Hope you my way inclined

We'll only have ourselves to blame
Showing you a world of pleasure

We nah fi force it our love continue growing
Keep it spontaneous cause our thing is never boring
