lyrics
"Is take a look at you  then I'm not so blue
When you're close to me  I can feel your heartbeat
I can hear you breathing in my ear
Wouldn't you agree?
Baby  you and me got a groovy kind of love
Anytime you want to  you can turn me onto
Anything you want to  anytime at all
Can't control the quivering inside
Wouldn't you agree?
Baby  you and me got a groovy kind of love
When I'm feelin' blue  all I have to do
Is take a look at you  then I'm not so blue
When I'm in your arms  nothin' seems to matter
My whole world could shatter  I don't care

Wouldn't you agree?
Baby  you and me got a groovy kind of love
We got a groovy kind of love
We got a groovy kind of love
Oh-oh  oh-oh-oh-oh
Just let you leave without a trace
When I stand here taking every breath
You're the only one who really knew me at all
How can you just walk away from me
When all I can do is watch you leave?
'Cause we've shared the laughter and the pain
And even shared the tears
You're the only one who really knew me at all
And there's nothin' left here to remind me
Just the memory of your face
And you comin' back to me is against the odds
And that's what I've got to face
You might also like
I wish I could just make you turn around
Turn around and see me cry
There's so much I need to say to you
So many reasons why
You're the only one who really knew me at all
And there's nothin' left here to remind me
Just the memory of your face
'Cause there's just an empty space
But to wait for you is all I can do
And that's what I've got to face
Take a good look at me now
'Cause I'll still be standin' here
And you comin' back to me is against all odds
It's the chance I've gotta take
Just let you leave without a trace
When I stand here taking every breath
You're the only one who really knew me at all
How can you just walk away from me?
When all I can do is watch you leave
'Cause we've shared the laughter and the pain
And even shared the tears
You're the only one who really knew me at all
And there's nothin' left here to remind me
Just the memory of your face
And you comin' back to me is against the odds
And that's what I've got to face
I wish I could just make you turn around
Turn around and see me cry

But to wait for you is all I can do
And that's what I've got to face
Take a good look at me now
'Cause I'll still be standing here
And you comin' back to me is against all odds
It's the chance I've got to take
For the words to say how I feel
I'd spend my time thinking too much
And leave too little to say what I mean
But I try to understand the best I can
All of my life
All of my life  I've been saying sorry
For the things I know I should have done
All the things I could have said come back to me
Sometimes I wish that it had just begun
Seems I'm always that little too late
All of my life
Set 'em up  I'll take a drink with you
Pull up a chair  I think I'll stay
Set 'em up  'cause I'm going nowhere
There's too much I need to remember
And there's too much I need to say
All of my life  I've been looking (Looking)
But it's hard to find the way
Just reaching past the goal in front of me
While what's important just slips away
And it doesn't come back  but I'll be looking
All of my life

All of my life  there have been regrets
That I didn't do all I could

And that's a memory I will live with
All of my life  ah-ah

 they don't frighten me
 I wonder why
 your heart's empty
 you can't change it

 I don't understand
 hold my hand
 I don't want to go
 heard you call my name
Where death waits in the darkness with a weapon to cut some stranger down

I could say everything's alright
And I could pretend and say goodbye
Got your ticket
Got your suitcase
Got your leaving smile
I could say that's the way it goes
And I could pretend and you won't know
That I was lying
'Cause I can't stop loving you
Why should I?
And I saw you walk across the road
Feeling humble
I heard a rumble
On the railway track
And when I hear that whistle blow
I'll walk away and you won't know
That I'll be crying

But that would be lying
'Cause I can't stop loving you
But I cannot turn back the years
The perfect love was all you wanted from me
But I cannot turn back the years
Too bad I love you
That I cannot turn back the years
But I cannot turn back the years
Can't live in a dream and I won't serenade the truth

But I hear the blame was mine
I would call you up to say I'm sorry
But I wouldn't want to waste your time
There's a look I can't describe in your eyes
Would you keep on telling me those lies? (Telling me lies)
Do you remember?
(Do you remember?)
(Do you remember?)
There seemed no way to make up
'Cause it seemed your mind was set
And the way you looked it told me
It's a look I know I'll never forget
You could've come over to my side
You could've let me know
You could've tried to see the distance between us

There are things we won't recall
And feelings we'll never find

And he was there at the right time with the right smile
Just a shoulder to lean on
Someone to tell you it'll all work out all right
Don't let him steal your heart away
Don't let him steal your heart away
You can look at him the way you did me
And hold him close say you're never letting go
But any fool can see you're fooling yourself
But you ain't fooling me
So don't let him steal your heart away
Don't let him change a thing 'cause I'll be back
Just tell him to pack his things and get out of your life
And just give me one more chance

Make you think your whole life's been leading to this
But whatever you do
And don't let him steal your heart away
Don't let him change a thing 'cause I'll be back
Just tell him to pack his things and get out of your life
And just give me one more chance
'Cause you were lonely and you needed a friend
And he was there at the right time with the right smile
Just a shoulder to lean on
Someone to say don't you worry it'll all be alright
But he's no good for you
He'll make you think your whole life's been leading to this
And whatever you do
Don't let him steal your heart away
Shadows were on the ground
Nobody knew where to find him
No evidence was found
I'm never coming back! they heard him cry
And I believe him
Well  he never meant to do anything wrong
It's gonna get worse if he waits too long
'Cause you're not anywhere that I can find you
'Cause you're not anywhere that I can find you  oh no
Searching through the day and into the night
They wouldn't stop till they found him
They didn't know him and they didn't understand
They never asked him why
Get out of my way! they heard him shout
Then a blinding light
Oh  all I could see was him running down the street
Out of the shadows and into the night

Shadows were on the ground

And I guess there's nothing more to say
Love can make you blind  make you act so strange
But I'm here and here I'll stay
So everyday I cry
Yes everyday I fall
Do you ever wonder why  why I love everything about you
But everyday I say I'll try to make my heart be still
Until then every way there is to cry  ourselves to sleep we will
It picked me up  knocked me off my feet
I've got no way to explain
Will never see the light of day
So everyday goes by
And everyday I fall
It makes me wonder why
My life's worth nothing without you
But everyday I say I'll try to make my heart be still
Until then every way there is to cry  ourselves to sleep we will

The book closes and we try to forget
But I know that things won't change
How we feel  how life goes on
And that seems so strange
And so the light fades away
I can't stop thinking about you
It seems my life's worth nothing without you
But everyday I say I'll try to make my heart be still
Until then every way there is to cry  ourselves to sleep we will
Everyday  everyday you know I try so hard
Everyday  everyday it gets a little harder
Everyday  everyday you know I try so hard
Everyday  everyday it gets a little harder
You're gonna find a place
It seems so far
But it never is
You won't need to stay
But you might lose your strength on the way
Sometimes you may feel
You're the only one
'Cause all the things you thought were safe
But you won't be alone
'Cause I'll be here to carry you along
Watching you till all your work is done
And when you find your heart
You'd better run with it
'Cause when she comes along
She could be breaking it

I could not believe in my eyes
'Cause I've already given all I have to give
And I think it must have slipped your mind
But I remember not too long ago
And I gave it all to you
Now I'm living on borrowed time
But it's mine
I cannot believe it's true
Are you really doing the things you do?
They don't seem to realize
They're listening but they're not hearing me
They're being too cruel to be kind

It's all the same to you
It seems all so well laid out
But I cannot get through
Never meant it to show
Now I'm living on borrowed time
But it's mine
I cannot believe it's true
Are you really doing the things you do
But there's nothing that I can say
Because nothing can change
All the things that you've done to me
Nothing can make me stay
Are you really doing the things you do

You won't catch me crying cause I just can't win
I don't care anymore
I don't care anymore  d'you hear?
I don't care what you say
I don't play the same games you play
'Cause  I've been talking to the people that you call your friends
And it seems to me there's a means to an end
They don't care anymore
And as for me  I can sit here and bide my time
I got nothing to lose if I speak my mind
I don't care anymore

What took you so long

That look's been there for far too long
I'm waiting in line
Would you say if I was wasting my time
Did I miss again?

I think about it from time to time
When I'm lonely and on my own
I try to forget

I read each word that you've sent to me
And though it's past now

All the memories I have still remain
I've kept all the pictures
But I hide my feelings so no one knows
But I'm in a crowd on my own

And it'll be here if you come again
I knew before you let me know
Seems I was wrong
And that's the one thing that you can't take away

But I don't know if you know who I am

También dime cómo es y aprenderé
Es razonable  más no para mí

Parece claro más no es verdad
Y puedo ver mi propia imagen
Descubriré cuan grande es mi futuro
Quiero saber  que me enseñes
Quiero saber lo extraño que soy
Dime más que entienda
Lo que es normal en lo extraño que soy
Cada gesto  como mueve su ser
Siento un algo como nunca sentí
Esta atracción me invita
A estar muy junto a ella
Las emociones que hoy conocí
De un mundo son que jamás viví

Trying to think of things to say
Someone lies bleeding
In a field somewhere
So it would seem
I've seen all I wanna see today
While I'm sittin' here
Trying to move you anyway I can

In a gutter somewhere
And it would seem
I can't take it anymore

I'd do anything within my power

But the path I seek is hidden from me now
Brother bear
I let you down
You trusted me
Believed in me
And I let you down
Of all the things I hid from you
I cannot hide the shame
And I pray someone
Something will come
To take away the pain
There's no way out of this dark place
I know I can't be free
But I can't see another way
With blue skies ahead
And there's nowhere else that I'd rather be
Tell everybody I'm on my way
And I'm lovin' every step I take
With the sun beating down
And I can't keep this smile off my face
'Cause there's nothing like seeing each other again
No matter what the distance between
And the stories that we tell will make you smile
Oh it really lifts my heart
So tell 'em all I'm on my way
New friends and new places to see
And to sleep under the stars
Who could ask for more?
With the moon keeping watch over me
The sun will come out wait and see
And the feeling of the wind in your face can lift your heart

 Take a look at me now
I'm an ordinary man
They don't tell me nothing
So I find out all I can
There's a fire that's been burning
Right outside my door
And it helps to keep me warm
Seems so long I've been waiting
Still don't know what for
There's no point in escaping
I don't worry anymore
I can't come out to find you
I don't like to go outside
They can turn off my feelings
Like they're turning off the light

I've got no far horizons (Oh-oh)
I don't wish upon a star (Oh-oh)
They don't think that I listen (Oh-oh)

Young men come and young men go
But life goes on just the same
And I don't know why  why do we keep holding on
That's the way it is
That's the way it is

They've been waiting for you night and day
They won't wait any longer for you
It may already be too late

If we agree that we can disagree
We could stop all of this today

But you cannot fight no more
You must want to look your son in the eyes
When he asks you what you did it for
'Cause all day long  he was fighting for you
And he didn't even know your name
Young men come and young men go
But life goes on just the same
And I don't know why  why do we keep holding on

Kids are crying 'cause the sheets are so cold
I wonder if she ever made the coast
'Cause this winter looks like it's gonna be another bad one
They tried their hardest to make it a home

Hope my children will try to make it their own
But my roof is leaking and the wind is howling
The kids are crying 'cause the sheets are so cold
Woke this morning and my hands were frozen

Happiness is something

Don't be discouraged
It's hard to take courage
In a world full of people
You can lose sight of it all
Can make you feel so small
But I see your true colors shining through
I see your true colors and that's why I love you
So don't be afraid to let them show your true colors
Show me a smile then
When I last saw you laughing
If this world makes you crazy
And you've taken all you can bear
Just call me up
Because you know I'll be there
But I see your true colors Shining through
I see your true colors And that's why I love you

But if you don't put faith in what you believe in
It's getting you nowhere
Cause it hurts  you never let go

Cause she's always there behind you  just to remind you
Two hearts  believing in just one mind
You know we're two hearts believing in just one mind
Cause there's no easy way to  to understand it
There's so much of my life in her  and it's like I'm blinded
And it teaches you to never let go
There's so much love you'll never know
She can reach you no matter how far
Wherever you are

My mama said
You can't hurry love
No  you'll just have to wait
She said  Love don't come easy
But it's a game of give and take
You can't hurry love (Hoo)
No  you'll just have to wait
Just trust in the good time
No matter how long it takes
How many heartaches must I stand
Before I find the love to let me live again?
Right now  the only thing that keeps me hanging on
When I feel my strength  ooh  it's almost gone
I remember Mama said
(You can't hurry love)
No  you'll just have to wait
She said  Love don't come easy
It's a game of give and take
How long must I wait? (Hoo)
And how much more must I take
Before loneliness
Will cause my heart  heart to break?
