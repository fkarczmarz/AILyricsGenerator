lyrics
"I swear you got the real thing
Not the type to conversate
The baddest if I do say so myself
You sexy on your own
Don't need no help
I had to say excuse me
I had to say excuse me
Can I take you home?
Forget about whoever did you wrong
Wear your heart on your sleeve
We been gettin' to it ever since the movie started
And now we finally made it to you favorite part where
You move just like a tire swing
I swear you got the real thing
Not the type to conversate
The baddest if I do say so myself
You sexy on your own
Don't need no help
I had to say excuse me
I had to say excuse me
You's a bad lil' vibe
You might also like
And we so high
Don't you ever kill the vibe
But you wearin' your disguise
You should take your own advice
I don't really play no games
You move just like a tire swing
I swear you got the real thing
Not the type to conversate
The baddest if I do say so myself
You sexy on your own
Don't need no help
I had to say excuse me
I had to say excuse me
You's a bad lil' vibe
And we so high
And we so high
And we so
Yeah
You move just like a
That super psycho
I see your friends
Your crew just like you
I'll get you high like
Top of the Eiffel
Give me a chance
Ain't no tellin' what I might do
When we alone
When you perform
Just do your dance
Just do your dance
And let me know when I give you my hands
Throwin' this money like it's no running out
And drop it down the pole like it's a fire
Now let me see just what you're doing with your bad ass
I can't help but watch you move it with your bad ass
Let me see just what you're doing with your bad ass
I can't help but watch you move it with your bad ass
I'm feeling like the man of the hour  host of the evening
I got pockets of hundreds  they say that change is irrelevant
Looking up in the sky I say I love watching you elevate
Get high as you ever been (go)  we getting hella bent (go)
Ball so hard  I deserve me a letterman
Ass up  gon' take it down like a sedative
That's a negative  ain't nobody wetter than
Better get familiar like a motherfuckin' relative
Know you see the fireworks  you looking where my section is
All this money falling in the air like it's confetti  bitch

I'm feeling like a man of the hour  tear down the house
Throwin' this money like it's no running out
And drop it down the pole like it's a fire
Now let me see just what you're doing with your bad ass
I can't help but watch you move it with your bad ass
Let me see just what you're doing with your bad ass
I can't help but watch you move it with your bad ass
I'm the man of the hour  money and power
And the humble ain't feed me so I got that Geechi shit out me
And the city is ours where the killers devour
Where the niggas lift Smith-Ands
And the victims lift a few flowers
Okay what I see dog you and me not cool
Bet they be loud when I leave out room
Knowing how you move how you got good shoes
When the heat on niggas be like pyoom
Young nigga with some old riches
And the coldest women I be with weave on Necole Bitchie's
The broad let me I sweat it out like P90 get me doe
And I'm sure she's got them cakes but I'm trying to see that throat
35-0-0 my coat  we high chokin' on that dope
Turn around girl let a nigga know  Double M Young Olu ghost
I'm feeling like a man of the hour  tear down the house
Throwin' this money like it's no running out
And drop it down the pole like it's a fire
Now let me see just what you're doing with your bad ass
I can't help but watch you move it with your bad ass
Let me see just what you're doing with your bad ass
I can't help but watch you move it with your bad ass
Meek Milly! Ink  what up?
I'm feelin' like the man of the hour  host of the evening
These niggas is haters they know that we eatin'
I got a bitch she Jamaican  fuck her slow when we speakin'
I get your chick and I take her  talkin' Cabo for the weekend
I'm just a young nigga outchea ballin'  all these bad bitches callin'
Rollie all flooded to New Orleans and a big Rolls Royces  can't park it
Got gold rims on my Ash Martin and I'm rollin' up in that foreign
I flex hard on Instagram  post your bitch goin insta-ham
Pyrex pot that's insta-grams  drop that work that's insta-bands
And I'm sittin' man  on a couple mill
Swear my life's so fuckin' real
Back to the wall like fuck the world
A nigga say fuck me  I'ma fuck his girl like woah!
I'm feeling like a man of the hour  tear down the house
Throwin' this money like it's no running out
And drop it down the pole like it's a fire
Now let me see just what you're doing with your bad ass
I can't help but watch you move it with your bad ass
Let me see just what you're doing with your bad ass
I can't help but watch you move it with your bad ass
Now go ahead with that bad ass and fast cash my dash pass
Just move it 'til the bass slap the bass slap like the Mac S
No question we turnt up  workin' on my fourth cup
Then throwin' all this money like the ass is for purchase
Very important persons  don't take it too personal
I'm feeling like a man of the hour  tear down the house
Throwin' this money like it's no running out
And drop it down the pole like it's a fire
Now let me see just what you're doing with your bad ass
I can't help but watch you move it with your bad ass
Let me see just what you're doing with your bad ass
I can't help but watch you move it with your bad ass

Fat Joe pockets  lean back like a recliner

Lotta people try to tell me I'm the next guy
Bat Gang  got it tatted by my left eye
Chain gang over here  no neck tie
Bitch you know I'm all about the business

Sitting in the room full of disco lights
But you ain't got a Swisher then we ain't gon' session

Breaking this down get ya fingers so messy

Got a gram of the wax if you need a dab hit
Must keep it in a jar cause these niggas cabbage

Straight top shelf in the store

Made it out the hood to the good side
B-bossin' up with no tie
You heard it through the grape vine
Been tryna get so high  feel like I'm in freefall
5'10  feelin' 8 feet tall
Coldplay  bands in my G star
And yours ain't the same ones that these are
Sunset  she just wanna see the stars
BunnyRanch  ran through and seen Lamar
Rosé  take one to the brain
Cobain  rollin' up romaine
Mix jeans  pocket full of mixed greens
Big team  yeah them bitches cheerlead
Came through in the clutch  hit the last shot
And you was on the sideline like a mascot
West side
Twist it up  knew I wasn't rich enough
Back then when I was gettin' kitchen cuts
But right now it's Dita frames when you picture us
Everywhere that I go  I think I seen 'em all
BunnyRanch  ran through and seen Lamar
Key the car  sound just like a dinosaur
Martin Luther  I got everything that you was fightin' for
Underrated but I'm overpaid  puttin' in overtime
This shit ain't happen overnight  my nigga Nijah know the grind
All my chains is shoulder length and all these bitches show me love
And most these niggas broke as shit  I got broke-nigga-phobia

I'm tryna ball like I'm fresh up out the locker room
I came through in the clutch  hit the last shot
And you was on the sideline like a mascot
I got a bitch in the back who only listen to me
She only post up selfies  she don't post up memes
Might twist me a Swisher  but don't like Backwoods
I light it up  it got me feelin' like a lamp in the plug
Just put the ash in the cup  you couldn't ask me enough
To get my act together  I'm just still as real as I was
I might not pick up my phone and let that hotline bling on you
Catchin' feelings like Prime Time  Neon Deion
Speed on the track  and this year's never the pre on
Feet on the dash but never on the table I eat on
We on a career high  man it's lookin' Korean
Shout out to the ones who did it way before me
They love and they hate and then they love you more
Yeah  uh
Different day  same old story
Got money on my mind  nothing more important
Mindset of a kid raised in apartments
Fuck forty and a mule  I need a bigger portion
Parked in front of a crib  looking for some dry
Dealing with the bullshit on the other side
Of the grass in the past  I would run and hide
But I can't kill any time  it's career homicide
Uh  gotta show 'em all who the best
In the motherfucking building like an architect
Doing the most  I could never give em' less
Now take a look around  I'll be here when no one left
Bitch  I promise
You could try hard  but you can't ignore me
Shout out to the ones who did it way before me
They love and they hate and then they love you more
That's the way it goes  that's the way it goes

Thank God I'm alive and I made sum'
Out of nothing  niggas thought I was frontin'
Now they see me getting to it  doing what they said I wasn't
I gotta play my cards  even when they think I'm bluffing
Heading to the top  can't see nobody above me
Can you feel the pressure  can you hear the message?
I'm trying to stay clean but the shit been getting messy
If you're looking for me I will be right where you left me
Put that on my city  that I'm bout' to bring it back
Bitch I promise
You could try hard  but you can't ignore me
Shout out to the ones who did it way before me
They love and they hate and then they love you more
That's the way it goes  that's the way it goes
Yeah

Paranoid 'bout my friends cause these favors done got me jack
Consequence of all the misdemeanors
That I was willing to do to get some rougher ends
Until the cops (Woop  woop)

Those are friends that you grew with
Telling me they knew that I'd make it

Looking for a detour nowhere to be found

Yeah it took a little time
But can't really be upset
Long way to the top
I can barely see the steps
But I barely need to rest
Show you what I'm made of
Tell 'em I paid my dues
You can check the pay stubs
Never had a chance so

Sacrificed it all and everything that I owned

There ain't no miracles round here
There ain't no miracles…
I'm not afraid of the impossible
There ain't impossible round here
One day it'll never be the same
Just look into my heart you can see the grind
Look into my eyes you can see the pain
Painted a perfect picture where I came from
Some nights when I thought I wouldn't see the sun
Hard tryna hold it down like a short skirt
Skurr off from these niggas tryna hold me back
Dreaming 'bout a moment that'll change my life
I said nothing's impossible

I was a loser just tryna fit in a letterman
I never thought that a song I wrote in a minivan
Would ever have the impact I'm reading inside these letters man
Or realize everything you need's inside you?

Switching lane no sign of slipping
Killing the strip no sign of a siren

Yeah  but don't you ever take that shit for granted
Take a second look away and they gon' take advantage
This life ain't never gonna go the way you planned it
Sometimes you gotta take a seat  just so you can stand it
And everybody ain't gon' understand it
It's been a minute since you talked to all your friends and family
Them winters never colder  this work is never over
Two hands together in my head I hold them
Lord forgive me  'cause I would kill for this
Ever since a nuisance I knew then that I was build for this
Told me I was trippin' and then they start actin' different
That's the day that I woke up and I had to make a decision

It's all on you
Nigga  that's all on you
Know the check  nigga all on me
Shawty she in love with the bass
I give it to her all on beat
Let me see you dance in my honor
While I roll up one for insomnia
We gon' be up 'til mañana
Wake up in my club clothes  no pyjamas
Swear that they biting my style like pirhanas
I can't even shop in the mall for designer's
You still tryna figure out who designed them
I'm tryna make LA the home of the Niners  I'm home
Somebody need to get this niggas paid
I swear they be hatin' like a job
Back up  they ain't far enough
Tryna act like it's all of us  but..

I'm all out of champagne
Poppin' like a Uzi

Just left out of Hooray's
Nigga just made a blu-ray
Runnin' from the lady outside selling bouquets
OG only flower that I want
You can keep that sour in your blunt sheet
Lookin' for the nose candy  Willy Wonka
Money don't grow  I feel like I found one tree
Tryna roll like I once see
Three point five doing a hundred from zero
My year just flashed forward
You still tryna find exposure

And this moment feel like 50  nothing but G's all in my unit
We built this from the roots  smell like trees all in my room
Fire cook the kush in the blunt  get out of the kitchen if it’s too humid
The story that I could sell made way more money without the deal
But I'm doing this cause I dream big
And y'all already know who the team is
Never thought that we'd make it out
Grew up over where the fiends at
That's that thing that made me a man  swear y'all just act like females
If we talking bout numbers  really me and you don't speak well
Just go ahead wit yo mixtape
I'm killing it with my pre-sell
Hope you getting prepared  everybody here with me gon prevail
Stay suited  it's deeper than music

But let's celebrate  pour me a drink
Everything earned never concerned long as we grind
How do you skate?

But in my mind nobody competing
Leaving behind the rearview chasing
Riding in my own lane just flexing
More ketchup  it ain't no pressure under pressure

These haters in the building keep booing
But ain't nobody gon do shit

Hit em in the head with a brand new style
Closet full but there ain't no ties
Mouth full of gold  got a brand new smile

Let it burn  and watch just how the tables turned
Don't know what you've got until it's gone is what you're gon' to learn today
You the baddest on the planet but I could show you a better world
Free as you want and I don't ever get too jealous
I know we got a connection that is tighter than your leggings  girl
