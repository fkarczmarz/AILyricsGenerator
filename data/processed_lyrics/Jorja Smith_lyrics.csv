"1  2  3
Why am I gonna apologize?
What have I even done?
Why you acting like you lost the crown
If you were never wearing one?
Falling ever deeper  dealing cards now
Now you can't recognize yourself on the deck
I thought I was your queen of hearts
But all the aces stole the check
A prince  a prince
A glorious game
A prince  a prince
Checkmate 'til you stole me away
Cursing words  am I a pauper now?
Even though all my shoes do fit
Won't even let me leave the house past 12
I ain't no fairytale chick
Happy endings cloud your head now
You have put your expectations too high
Sit on the bed  tears running down our eyes
Once upon a time  I wonder why

A prince  a prince
A glorious game
A prince  a prince
Checkmate 'til you stole me away
Darling hold on a second
You know that your eyes and your smile are a weapon
Now come here  why won't you just listen?
You tell me I'm hurting your arm with my grip
See now trust me  but never trust women
Yeah they're perfect  I'm at home stressed
With this skunk spliff
When I know that you're out on the road being faithless
Does it make sense?
And my insecurities don't pay rent
But they're living with me
And this is a disease
We live in a man's world so what you expect me to be?
Now  now  now
Whether it's the shit sex or this limp dick
My reflection keeps telling me sick things
You know that I'm ugly
I hope that you want me  I'll make sure you love me
A prince  a prince
A glorious game
A prince  a prince
Checkmate 'til you stole me away
No I've never been a prince  no  no
And I tried to be a king  oh Lord
Said I've never been a prince  no  no
And I tried to be a king  but I let you down  my queen
She knows what's in it  she knows what's wrong
She just can't quit it  her heart's so numb
Hurts to live it  but worse to run
Waits for the nighttime  day's no fun
Got a call from her brother  said he's concerned
You lied about your work  and I haven't seen you in months
There's no light in your eyes  and she won't open them
The hardest thing
You are not addicted to me
I'm the only thing you should need
You should be addicted to me
The hardest thing
I am too selfless to leave
You're the only thing that I need
You should be addicted to me
What life are you living? It can't really be real
Pushing over limits you can't even feel
Can we drink just not to care  not care just to drink?
Can't that be enough and not take too much?

Was I just to fall on my own?
If this room was full of lies
Is that how you fooled me with love?
Why does it hurt so much?
You face the pain while your days are numbered
And I'vе heard this many times in my head but it still rеmains
That you had all of this
You fought all of this
You don't even know how bad it got
So much for you're my one and only

You'd say that you were all mine

Glad you have it all but there's things that you can't buy
Why you want to offer me love that you don't have?
It's played out many times in my head but it still remains

So much for you're my one and only
Only I quit
I'm all for that
Only I quit
I'd hop in for a ride  movin' fast  never lookin' backwards
Play our favorite songs  do the words still make you feel the same? Oh
Once upon a time  drivin' fast  never lookin' back
I know that I know how to find words
Say 'em out loud
I'm done lettin' myself down
My heart came from the right place
I don't want to cause heartache
But my mind just couldn't translate
How to deal with these emotions
Can start fire and still get burn
And I'll fuel it like I ain't learnt
'Cause it hurts me if I hurt you
So I hurt you  so you hatе me
But you won't leave  I can't gеt out
How you held me  oh
I hope that you see
There's no way you'd know
How  how you helped me

I'd jump into your bed  live your days  they were never mine
Tell me why the light stayed on red  that must have been a sign
All these little things that we missed  we'll get over in time
You taught me about patience
Raised all my expectations
You showed me what's my ground
I stand here and I look down
On myself and I'm so proud
Thank you 'cause I've figured out
What's best for me is on my own now
It's been a while and I'm grown now
But I'd never have grown if you weren't 'round
You've shown me what's meant to be
What's meant for you is not meant for me
And we'll find out in this next life
How you held me  oh
I hope that you see
There's no way you'd know
 yeah
 and
 tell me do you want me on top?
 scold ya
 honour you
 looking like I'm winning
 I'm sorry
 what you wanna do?
 you know
 not only when you're lonely‚ yeah
 tell me do you want me on top?
 you no say I run whenever I see bad mind
 make sure you think twice
 you'll be feelin' brand new
 get high
 then you can lie
 I’m under your love
 one try
 this time
 same time

That's what us girls are destined for

Where are these so-called independent women?
Who pick up their flaws
And let the world in

Little girl doin' all she can
You had your eye on only a few things
And maybe it wouldn't go anywhere
Had to be real with your dream
No silent movie and no puppet strings
Can't hold you up  you got to hold yourself now
Don't mean it's showtime for everything
You never listen  no
There she goes  there she goes
You burn like you never burn out
You try so hard  you can still fall down
You keep it all in  but you don't let it out
You try so hard  don't you know you've burnt out?
Let it go in  over my lungs
The firе's always there  no one needs to gеt hurt
