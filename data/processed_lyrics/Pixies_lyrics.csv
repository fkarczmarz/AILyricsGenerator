"They thought he was real smart Alec (Little Eiffel  little Eiffel)
He thought big they called it a phallic (Little Eiffel  little Eiffel)
They didn't know he was panoramic
Little Eiffel stands in the archway (Little Eiffel  little Eiffel)
Keepin' low doesn't make no sense
Sometimes people can be oh so dense
They didn't want it but he built it anyway (Little Eiffel  little Eiffel)
Little Eiffel stands in the archway (Little Eiffel  little Eiffel)
Keepin' low don't make sense  keepin' low doesn't make no-sense
(Little Eiffel  little Eiffel)
Little Eiffel stands in the archway
See you beneath the archway of aerodynamics
See you beneath the archway of aerodynamics
See you beneath the archway of aerodynamics
See you beneath the archway of aerodynamics
See you beneath the archway of aerodynamics
See you beneath the archway of aerodynamics
See you beneath the archway of aerodynamics
But I always think about the past
About the things that didn’t last
If I could go to the beginning
Then for sure I would be another way
Make it better for today
If I could go to the beginning
I would be another way
Make it better for today
Remember when we were happy?
I'm gonna try anyhow
I remember we were happy
That’s all I think about now
That’s all I think about now
I remember we were happy
That’s all I think about now
If you have any doubt
How ya doin'?
Can I be your boy?
I can't ride
All over the world
(Everybody rock out!)
You can't live easily
All over the world

Undressing in the sun
Return to sea
Bye
Forgetting everyone
Eleven high
Ride a wave
She's my fave
Undressing in the sun
Return to sea
Bye
Forgetting everyone
Eleven high
I think it used to sit right here
Encrusted in blue and hard and true
For now I will kiss her finger
Have you ever seen Andro Queen
Wandering all for her ruby?
One day she'll come in through my window
Only kissing you is so hard in this wild thresh
That's how it's been with Andro Queen
Loving on our bed of flowers
Breathing in the smell of her musk
Yet she shows me under her silk
Only kissing you is so hard in this wild thresh
I wave goodbye to Andro Queen

You were workin' Japanese fast food
And I dropped you off with your Japanese lover
And you're goin' to the beach all day
You're so pretty when you're unfaithful to me
You're so pretty when you're unfaithful to me
You're looking like you've got some sun
Your blistered lips have got a kiss
That tastes a bit like everyone
Your bone's got a little machine

Make your dress all wet and send it to me

Hi
Hi
Hi
I was driving doing nothing on the shores of Great Salt Lake
I soon forgot myself and I forgot about the brake
I forgot about all laws and I forgot about the rain
They were talking on the 9 and all across the Amy band
Everybody was remembering to forget they had the chills
And I heard the voices on a broadcast from up on the bird
They were getting interviewed by some good man whose name was Bill
I'm almost there to Vegas where they're putting on a show
About the boy who fell from glory and how he was a wicked son
This ain't no holiday
But it always turns out this way
Here I am with my hand
He took his sister from his head
And then painted her on the sheets
And then he rolled her up in grass and trees
And they kissed 'til they were dead
This ain't no holiday
But it always turns out this way
Here I am with my hand
Well  sit right down  my wicked son and let me tell you a story
About the boy who fell from glory and how he was a wicked son
This ain't no holiday  no  no
But it always turns out this way
Here I am with my hand
This ain't no holiday
But it always turns out this way
When they put it on the air
I put it in the hammer lane
I soon forgot myself
And I forgot about the brake
I forgot about all laws
And I forgot about the rain
They were talking on the 9
And all across the amy band
Across the road they were turning around
And headed south with me
It got so crowded on the road
I started driving in the sand
My head was feeling scared
But my heart was feeling free
The desert turned to mud
It seems that everybody heard
Everybody was remembering
To forget they had the chills
And I heard the voices on a broadcast
From up on the bird
They were getting interviewed
By some good man whose name was Bill

(¡Puñeta!)
Vamos a jugar por la playa
Oh! Ah!
¡Ay! ¡Muñeca cabrona! ¡Maricona! ¡Cabrona!
Ah!
Ah!
Ah!

I keep gettin' friends lookin' like lesbians
We'll trampoline
Finally through the roof (Finally through the roof)
On to somewhere near
And far in time
Velouria
Her covering
Traveling career (Traveling career)
She can really move
Oh velveteen
Say to me
Where have you been?
Finally through the roof (Finally through the roof)
And how does lemur skin
Reflect the sea?

We will wade in the shine of the ever
We will wade in the shine of the ever
We will wade in the tides of the summer
Forever green
I know she's here
In California (California)
I can see the tears
Of Shasta sheen

(V-E-L-O-U-R-I-A)
(V-E-L-O-U-R-I-A)
Drive my car into the ocean
You think I'm dead  but I sail away
On a wave of mutilation
Wave of mutilation
Wave of mutilation
Wave  wave
I've kissed mermaids  rode the El Niño
Walked the sand with the crustaceans
Could find my way to Mariana
On a wave of mutilation
Wave of mutilation
Wave of mutilation
Wave  wave
Wave of mutilation
Wave of mutilation
Wave of mutilation
With your feet on the air and your head on the ground
And you'll ask yourself
Where is my mind?
Where is my mind?
Where is my mind?
(Where is my mind? Where is my mind?)
(Where is my mind?)
I was swimmin' in the Caribbean
Animals were hidin' behind the rock
Except the little fish
Where is my mind?
Where is my mind?
Where is my mind?
(Where is my mind? Where is…)
