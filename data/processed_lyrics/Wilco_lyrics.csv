lyrics
"When you went to bed with your darkest mind
Your pillow wept and covered your eyes
And you finally slept while the sun caught fire
You've changed
We fell in love in the key of C
We walked along down by the sea
You followed me down the neck to D
And fell again into the sea
You've changed
Maybe all I need is a shot in the arm
Maybe all I need is a shot in the arm
Maybe all I need is a shot in the arm
Maybe all I need is a shot in the arm
Maybe all I need is a shot in the arm
Maybe all I need is a shot in the arm
Maybe all I need is a shot in the arm
Something in my veins bloodier than blood
Something in my veins bloodier than blood
Something in my veins bloodier than blood
Something in my veins bloodier than blood

The ashtray says you were up all night
When you went to bed with your darkest mind
You've changed
What you once were isn't what you want to be anymore
What you once were isn't what you want to be anymore
What you once were isn't what you want to be anymore
What you once were isn't what you want to be anymore
For a hundred in twenties and a small service fee
I could spend three dollars and sixty-three cents
On Diet Coca-Cola and unlit cigarettes
I wonder why we listen to poets when nobody gives a fuck
All my lies are always wishes
I know I would die if I could come back new
I want a good life with a nose for things
Fresh wind and bright sky to enjoy my suffering
A hole without a key if I break my tongue
All my lies are always wishes
I know I would die if I could come back new
I'm down on my hands and knees every time the doorbell rings
I shake like a toothache when I hear myself sing

All my lies are only wishes
I know I would die if I could come back new
I would like to salute
The ashes of American flags
And all the fallen leaves
You started to cry
To come back home
Or maybe all you mean is leave me alone
At least that's what you said
You're irresistible when you get mad
Isn't it sad? I'm immune
I thought it was cute
For you to kiss
My purple black eye
Even though I caught it from you
I still think we're serious
You get so low
Struggle to find your skin
Hey ho
Look out below
Your prayers will never be answered again
Phones still ring
And singers sing
Speakers are speaking in code
What now
Well anyhow
Our prayers will never be answered again
You know it's all beginning
To feel like it's ending
No love's as random
As God's love
I can't stand it
I can't stand it
The way things get
You get so high
Funny how we make new friends
Oh hey ho
I gotta go
My prayers will never be answered again

 pure bug beauty
 steady crushing hand

 your sorrow is sunshine

 old radiant beauty

 I will always die
 so you can remember me
 steady crushing hand

I'm gonna walk away slowly
Instead I bid you good night
Another goodbye
I'm gonna cry
Cry all day
Whatever you're withholding
I never said it was good
If I could sell it by the dozen
I know that you would
I'm aware that you could
Cry all day
Cry all night
I had a hole in my heart
It kept me holy from rolling
Someone into something like me
Something like me
You don't wanna be
Cry all day
I cry all night
I cry all day
Cry all day
Cry all night
At the open mic
I sing and I stall
I fall on the knife
Another future to fight
I never took it so seriously
Watch 'em all fight
But you can't fight it
And I cry
Cry all day
Cry all night
Cry all day
Cry all night
And all day
And now the hounds are calling
I see the world I find
I'm sick of your affliction
But you're just a smartass and blind
Out of the light
Now be kind
Cry all day
All night
Into the light
Into the light
 heart of gold - so I'm told
 I been found
The clouds will blow away
Maybe I won't feel so afraid
I will try to understand
Either way
Maybe you still love me
Maybe you don't
Either you will or you won't
Maybe you just need some time alone
I will try to understand
Everything has its plan
Either way
I'm gonna stay
Right for you
Maybe the sun will shine today
The clouds will roll away
Maybe I won't be so afraid
I will understand
Everything has its plan
 far away from you
 I know it's right
 my friend
 I know you will
 I know you will
 I hope I do
The blinds were being pulled down on the dew
I was looking for you
Saxophones started blowing me down
I was buried in sound
Taxicabs were driving me around
To the handshake drugs I bought downtown

I looked like someone I used to know
I felt alright
I believe that's the only way for me to be
Exactly what do you want me to be?

I used to go see on the landing in the summer
She fell in love with the drummer
She fell in love with the drummer
She fell in love
Shiny  shiny pants and bleached blond hair
A double kick drum by the river in the summer
She fell in love with the drummer
Another then another
She fell in love
I miss the innocence I've known
Playing Kiss covers  beautiful and stoned
Unlock my body and move myself to dance
Moving warm liquid  flowing blowing glass
Classical music blasting masks the ringing in my ears
Oh  I sincerely miss those heavy metal bands

She fell in love with the drummer
She fell in love with another

And the first thing that you want
Will be the last thing you ever need

 toll after toll
I assassin down the avenue
I'm hiding out in the big city blinking
What was I thinking when I let go of you?
Let's forget about the tongue-tied lightning
Let's undress just like cross-eyed strangers
What was I thinking when I said it didn't hurt?
I want to glide through those brown eyes dreaming
You were so right when you said I've been drinking
What was I thinking when we said good night?
I want to hold you in the Bible-black predawn
Take off your Band-Aid because I don't believe in touchdowns
What was I thinking when we said hello?
I'd always thought that if I held you tightly
You'd always love me like you did back then
Then I fell asleep and the city kept blinking
What was I thinking when I let you back in?

Cry like a window pane
Can my cold heart change
Even out of spite?
I slump behind my brain
A haunted stain never fades
I hunt for the kind of pain I can take
And I cry like a window pane

It's good to be alone
I'll be in my bed
You can be the stone
That raises from the dead
And carries us all home
There's no blood on my hands
 the shadow grows
 a suicide
 a traveler's guide
 in your chair
With the light from a TV
Running parallel to you
But there is no sunken treasure
Rumored to be
Wrapped inside my ribs
I am so
Out of tune
With you
I am so out of tune
With you
If I had a mountain
I'd try to fold it over
If I had a boat (probably roll over)
You know I'd probably roll over (leave it on the shore)
And I leave it on the shore (leave it for somebody)
I'd leave it for somebody
Surely there's somebody
Who needs it more than me

For all the leaves we'll burn
In autumn fires and then return
For all the fires we burn
All will return
Music is my savior
I was maimed by rock and roll
I was maimed by rock and roll
I was tamed by rock and roll
About my soul
I'm an ocean
And this emotion
Illiterati lumen fidei
God is with us everyday
That illiterate light
Is with us every night
Theologians they don't know nothing
About my soul
Oh they don't know
They thin my heart with little things
And my life with change
Oh in so many ways
I find more missing every day
Theologians
I'm going away
Where you will look for me
Where I'm going you cannot come
No one's ever gonna take my life from me
I lay it down
A ghost is born
A ghost is born
A ghost is born

I am a cherry ghost
Cherry ghost
Hey I'm a cherry ghost
And it felt alright to me
Dying on the banks of Embarcadero skies
I sat and watched you bleed
Buried you alive in a fireworks display
Raining down on me
To the sea
I printed my name on the back of a leaf
And I watched it float away
Was all I tried to save
But the wind blew me back via Chicago
In the middle of the night
And all without fight at the crush of veils and starlight
I know I'll make it back
One of these days and turn on your TV
To watch a man with a face like mine
Being chased down a busy street
And I won't go to sleep

Via Chicago
Where the cups are cracked and hooked
They shine down your shoulders
And crawling is screw faster lash
And I blow it with kisses
I rest my head on a pillowy star
And a cracked door moon
That says I haven't gone too far
Searching for a home
Searching for a home
Searching for a home
Via Chicago
I'm coming home
It's a war on war
It's a war on war
It's a war on war
It's a war on war

You're gonna lose
You have to lose
You have to learn how to die
Let's watch the miles flying by
Let's watch the miles flying by
You are not my typewriter
But you could be my demon
Moving forward through flaming doors
You have to lose
You have to learn how to die
If you want to want to be alive
Okay

Forget the implications
Infatuations end
I can't imagine ever being apart
I'll come back to you
It'll be brand new
But I promise
We're just friends
Over and over and over again
I try to make amends
For everything that I've done wrong
My whole world just spins
Try to talk me out of giving up
I'll come back to you
It'll be brand new
But I promise
We might be strangers
However close we get sometimes
It's like we never met
But you and I
I think we can take it
All the good with the bad
Make something that no one else has but
You and I
You and I
Me and you
What can we do
When the words we use sometimes
Are misconstrued
What's coming next
I can't ever tell you
The deepest well I've ever fallen into
Everything about you
And you don't need to know
That much about me

Sister's husband's brother
Working in the gold mine full-time
Filling in for sunshine
Filing into tight lines
Of ordinary beehives
The door screams I hate you
Hate you hanging around my blue jeans
Why is there no breeze
No currency of leaves
No current through the water wire
No feelings I can see
I trust no emotion
I believe in locomotion
But I've turned to rust as we've discussed
Though I must have let you down
Too many times
In the dirt and the dust
I have no idea how this happens
All of my maps have been overthrown
Happenstance has changed my plans
So many times my heart has been outgrown
Now everybody's feeling all alone
Can't tell you who I am
When everybody's feeling all alone
Can't tell you who I am

I am looking forward
Towards the shadows tracing bones
Our faces stitched and sewing
Our houses hemmed into homes
Trying to be thankful
Our stories fit into phones
And our voices lift so easily
A gift given accidentally
When we're not sure"
