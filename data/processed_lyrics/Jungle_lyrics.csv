" it don't come ea—
 it ain't easy
 it ain't easy
 it ain't easy
 it ain't easy
 time to be livin'
 it ain't easy
 it ain't easy
 it ain't easy
 it ain't easy
I'm coming home to the warmth
And it's madness
Who do you think you are?
'Cause everything just happened at once
Yeah everything just happened at once
And it's magic
Are you strong?
Are you strong? Any more?
Yeah and imagine
If you knew who you are
And I don't remember a thing you see

Yeah everything just happened at once to me
All of the time (You needed me)
All of the time (You gotta be)
All of the time
You never know when I’m feeling low
Heaven ain’t big enough
You never did what you had to do
All of the time (Keep telling me)
All of the time (You needed me)
All of the time (Keep telling me)
Why don’t we talk in the morning?
Could it be easy for us?
(It’s all alright)

When we get high on my break time
And we're just watching from the same town
But that don't change when it break down
Then we were talking 'bout the same crime
Learnt my lesson at the same time
Go? Back on 74 (When I noticed you)
Never gonna cry anymore
Where did it all—
You keep me walking on the same line
When we get high on my break time
And we're just watching from the same town
But that don't change when it break down
Then we were talking 'bout the same crime
I learnt my lesson at the same time

Time out to be there  she said she won't care
Now you have something  before  you had nothing
I don't want to care  but your love's real
And it's an odd thing  how can I be your whole world?
We sit on the fake grass  and I won't believe that
And I never had enough for you  but you said someone
Would come and replace me  how can you replace me?
While it's true
It's all good now
When it's nothing  loving  nothing
That's all that you admire
And these tears
Fall in the sunlight
When it's nothing  loving  nothing
That's all that you admire

Every single night I pray
Giving you a reason to trust me
Every day
But no one said this would be easy
And it hurts me
That I ever lied to you in the bad times
It was in my head
But I won't let them take control of me

I injected hope into my lungs
And spoke up things I once
Thought were silly dreams
I'll walk you through the scene
Jump on a jet and it's chartered a star
Batting the cycle  I don't even like her
She deaded  I cannot be bothered to call
Running like four legs  thеm people fall
They don't want no run-ins likе bow legs  no
Jumped out the circus like Soleil  curving
Steel resolve  look at you
You like a cube of sugar in a pool of water
Bet you will dissolve
Had so much to prove
But no wherewithal  so you got
Nowhere at all  no way out
Either way  it's all gon' play out
