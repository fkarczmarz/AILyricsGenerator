As the first black nigga that's a rap trillionaire
I control heat  I'm about to buy the ozone layer!
I'm into copping minerals now: diamonds and granite

Now  there ain't no way that you could kill the beast dead

I got oil well money in the desert playing golf
Dolce shorts  dashiki with a Louis scarf
Chest cold  diamonds make a nigga wanna cough
In Dubai  20 million on the villa loft
And then I step up in the club and then these other niggas mad as shit
The way I make the people wanna sing the hook in Arabic

Turn my mic up
Do I make 'em say Wow!? Strip! (Ow!)
Let me come and mop up the knockoffs​
And if you ain’t had enough—
What in the fat fishes of a phenomenal fahrvergnügen fuck is going on?
I'ma have these niggas nervous
And clipping they nails and dribbling
Your bitch remind me of replacement butt
Like she was a basement fuck
It’s kinda like me having a case in the truck
And drinking ‘til I’m blasted
Harassing and erase a nigga (What!?)
Keeping 'em open and blacking until I’m leaving ‘em stuck
While I’m chasing a buck
These funny niggas be chasing they luck
When I’m pushing they face in the mud— (Ahh!)
‘Til this shit circling back around
With more fire for me to melt a brick surfacing back a sound
While I light up shit that'll cause a quick worship
Painful and make ‘em scatter (Blink!)
Your head up off your shoulders (With)
Bullets bigger than a boulder
And they break ‘em and they know it's (Classic!)
(We that sick!) Like I come from Haiti
(Al-la-la!) Like I’m a crazy Israeli (Bastards!)
I’m chopping your foot off
Back to the hood and off to the wild
And I’m hoping you protect your child
And I been blacking out so long
But the beat is fried!

With this my brain is just like a fucking fried egg
Is my mind scrambled? 'Cause I'm lit—narrow minded
But go through such a wide range of this emotion
That my rage has gotta squeeze through it sideways
I just pulled up in Clive Davis's driveway
And drive straight through the gay pride parade
And should I take it as a sign
Maybe to take 'em back into time? (Shady!)
To take the attention away
From my stinking face it was bringing
Changed the whole complexion of the game
But just in case you was thinking an inkling of replacing
So if this is any indication of what you may be facing
You better make a distinction 'cause you fake imitations
Who raps nasally? Eyes hazely?
Need some Flonase when he's speaking?
What kind of stupid question is that?
Other than your husband's fucking brains that were leaking
How'd you think that play was this weekend?
To come fuck up the whole party
Me and Flipmode starting a campaign
Act my goddamn age? I am—eight!
So let's get smashed and wake up the next day
Glass ashtray smashed
Champagne splashed on the lampshades
When I was taking so much NoDoz and LSD
I almost fell asleep on the Wake Up Show
When Penelope Cruz was still developing boobs
I sit in front of my computer all day
Son of God  I'm the S.O.G
'Cause I'm so full of self-esteem that I sweat fog
Soft? 'Bout as commercial as my fucking Learjet
Jealousy’ll get you green as a Chia Pet
So (Jump around! Jump! Jump!)
Get that ass shaking (Jump around! Jump!)
Came to hit you with a fan favorite
And freaking hands flailing and (Jump!)
Like Van Halen and pray for a damn tailwind
More afraid of success than I am of failure
So what does that tell ya?
That on a grand scale I don’t give a fuck about nothing
Like Stan mailing his last piece of fan mail
Before he ran straight into the damn railing
I'm in the vicinity of a nigga that can spit it with me
Feel the fire whenever we act up
Everybody else is incompatible with the artillery
So forget about it when you hear about it
Cause it's too fast when I pass the baton to Busta
Hit a victim in the middle of the body with a bullet and a rhythm
Every murder is a structure
Every time I hit you niggas with another jam be blacking
I be sounding like a nigga full of anger
Now I'm back to beat you in the head  I'll bring another banger
With my nigga Twist  everything we do be up to wanger
You don't really  really wanna see the way that I come
And I'll give it to you  get up on the ceiling see a nigga numb
Do it how I wanna do it 'till I make another nigga drop
Do whatever you wanna do
Show the competition how we gunning too when we coming through
Better never let a nigga never get in front of you
The race  I'm so fast they call me Flash
Don't nobody really wanna
We can hit 'em like a couple of millimeters
Woopin' a niggas' ass
I'm skipping all over on another Just Blaze hit
Now I know a lot of y'all been sitting  waiting and wondering
Was we ever gonna do this shit
And then we came to hit 'em with another flow
Pop champagne  celebrate and kill another show
Now I gotta ask y'all

Kill everybody cause I'm gunning outta stress
If I'm running outta breath  he gonna pick up where I left off
Keep him with me when he spitting cause the flow be the bidness
I'm a menace when I bust a lyrical tec off
Go faster than Ricky Bobby  kill him in Talladega Nights
Niggas try to get up  when a nigga hit up
When it I come I promise you gotta pay the price
Look  why don't everybody wanna come and try get a little taste
Of the shit I got  let me put it all up in your face
When I spit it I got a nigga wilding all over the place
Everybody better listen here
Cause you know when I bring him I will never  never stop
Make a nigga rewind and bring it back to the top
Throw the shit up in the streets and I be running every block
Everybody better stand clear
Like a millimeter when I be booking the track up
Motivated for murder whenever I act up
A couple of phenomenal niggas can stack up
Gets anybody that wanna live in the back up
Killing everybody when I bust a clip off
Cause I'ma be attacking them with the insane flow
Then I be having them calling me Twista Phelps
And my nigga Buss like Usain Bolt
Shocked a nigga like I was a thousand volts
Now I'm sailing on the beat the way I'm sailing on the boat
The way I gotta kill 'em and the way I gotta flow
When I'm in the spot you know you can't leave
I spit every word 'till  damn I can't breathe
You never heard 'till you nosebleed

You can talk about it with a bunch of people
They all say that I'm a lyrical manifestation of rhythm
Then I come and do the shit I gotta do and then I bang ‘em
And get 'em and do it every single time I hit 'em
When I do it it just gotta be accurate
I am attacking the rhythm with such a vocal tenacity
See the way a brother blacking in back and in front
Cause every time we in the place we fill it to capacity
I be coming with it  he be coming with it
And nobody really do it how we do it
And the flow is so fluid it gotta be an anomaly
Gotta be an Odyssey  the prodigy  and I'ma be the one to prove it
Don’t you ever forget it the way we coming
And they sending somebody  gonna probably be needing a medic
So give us the credit in alphabetical order
We coming to slaughter so call out the order see the way we do it
Now I gotta ask y'all

Despite all the things that we go through
I'm going to take more time with you
And be a friend indeed
I made a decision
That everything's gon' be alright
Going to stay strong and keep it tight
I'll be there indeed
See when it feels like the sun ain't shining bright enough
It's like the devil's trying to work to give an idol up
Someone you know that knows you and gives you motivation
Someone that you can go to and vent your frustrations
When you need them the most are they really ever there?
The difference is really needing a friend than having one
It's good when your peoples are there to help your problems
And help you smile about it while finding a way to solve them
How you hold me down is something I genuinely value
I got a clearer view
And being that you're always here for me I'll be here for you

Even though we probably link up every now and then
Something I realize is I don't even have to mention
Sometimes I feel that the people that I love don't appreciate me
And some hate to see the shit I've been going through lately
On everything that I believe and I appreciate you
But I thank you just for being there and for hearing me out
I got a clearer view
I made a decision
Despite all the things that we go through
I'm gon' to take my time with you
And be a friend indeed
I made a decision
Everything's gon' be alright
Going to stay strong and keep it tight
I'll be there indeed
I made a decision
I look in your eye and I see the pain in it
Decisions to split us in the place that life seemed to hit us
I had my own issues that I was trying to get through
I made a decision
Despite all the things that we go through
I'm going to take my time with you
And be a friend indeed
I made a decision
That everything will be alright
Going to stay strong and keep it tight
I'll be there indeed
I think we got some shit for 'em (FLIP-MODE!)
Yeah I'mma rub these sticks together
Check it  and start a bonfire
And if you don't see it y'all niggas can't fuck with our
Flipmode Movement - bounce in your truck to us
Y'all get stupid - don't try to fuck with us
Because you will get carried away  yeah you'll get carried away
Now I'm subtle  once I pick up my metal
Put my foot on the pedal  ridin' through every ghetto
Analyze the shit I'm seein' when I sip Amaretto
A lot of bitches on the strip  struttin' in they stilettos
Then they wave and say hello  when my Lambo' is yellow
Everything they got a jingle when they walk like ah-Jello
See the niggas on the corner and I never forget it
And I never regret it because I see how you get it
Now because of you niggas  I'm a hustler nigga
'Gnac guzzler nigga  rip your jugular nigga
In the night I become the type to love when it's dark
Cause when I pull up and park  is when I'm makin my mark
See the fact's that I'm tryin' to strive and capitalize in
Start to max-a-mimize and b-build a ent-ter-prise
And wh-while I'm stockin' this bread  keep ah-stockin' the lead
And leave a permanent dot  on the top of your head

Pardon Dre this beat is a monster  catchy
Like sleepin under open windows that's drafty
Then wakin' up my throat scratchy  that's how I spit it nasty
They short  a few inches North of a dwarf
My flow's Murciélago  ghostin' them narcos
Toastin' the ways of the original Pablos
Still a pyramid architect  mix liquors like a chemist
Killer lyricist  poetical tyrant
Sneaker store terrorist  Mt. Everest I climbed it
Heat is drawn  no creepin on me whenever I'm bent

And freak styles like 3000 Andre
To keep pilin  keep pushin them drops
And if you don't see it y'all niggas can't fuck with our
Flipmode Movement - bounce in your truck to us
Y'all get stupid - don't try to fuck with us
Because you will get carried away  yeah you'll get carried away

Add a little cut to the coke when I'm cookin the pot
DRUGS  BITCH! I got what you want come and get what I got

Niggas know they pussy and struggle to pretend that they not
Lose your life in the drop  while I harvest the crop
My hot shit  bust a cannon have you run in your socks
See we live on the edge  bang shit with a sledgehammer
Split up your head  kill a snitch for the feds
Let's go  for the streets I'm always spittin a gospel
Get Nas holdin a barrel size of elephant nostril
And if you don't see it y'all niggas can't fuck with our
Flipmode Movement - bounce in your truck to us
Y'all get stupid - don't try to fuck with us
 your time has come
 Vengeance is mine
 the battle is the Lord's and God has come

 I'm back to punish
 I'ma stand and stick around for the judgment
 line up the subjects
 politicians and judges
 sometimes it's seductive
 why create a creature that is so destructive?
 but no man is free of consequences
 I study lessons
 the Earth will rumble like a stampede of cattle
 faster than sound travel
 a merit down to a felony
 justices will reward a penalty
 never stop 'til the death of me

Wave the torch  cut the head off the Leviathan
The terminology I'm rhymin' in cause a frenzy up in Ireland
Hit ya  I'm gon' get ya

Street niggas hang on the sidewalk
Moderatin' how we establish the whole Conglomerate

Young and restless down to the old and feeble
Peep them  Czechoslovakian to Yugoslavian niggas

Fuckin' with diplomats who love Bailey's
Monopolize and quickly get other money fuckin' with Israelis
So solid how we be symbolic
To a handful of niggas that be all schemin' on the same wallet

If you ain't from the ghetto  don't come to the fucking ghetto
But I'ma let one of our most immaculate tour guides
Take us all through the ghetto  my nigga Rick James!
When I was a young boy  growin' up in the ghetto
Hangin' out on corners  singin' with the fellas
Lookin' for the cute chicks  tryin' to find me big fun
Lookin' for some trouble or anyone who'll give me some
I was young and crazy! (In the ghetto)
Didn't know what my life would be (In the ghetto)
Something had a spell on me (In the ghetto)  you all know what I'm talkin' 'bout
Talkin' 'bout ghetto life
Talkin' 'bout ghetto life  you all know what I'm singin' 'bout
Talkin' 'bout ghetto life  ghetto life!
Talkin' 'bout ghetto life (In the ghetto)
Sure  we be takin' them chances
While we search for the answers  we be smokin' them cancer sticks
Police provokin' motherfuckers  we dancin'
And we be dodgin' them bullets they be poppin' off at us  shit
But yet we always romance the street
And fall in love with the hood 'til somebody come blast the heat
Always up to no good  so all of my fam could eat
My soldiers on the block get on it
It be good if you flaunt it  we will take if we want it
See  niggas from the ghetto got a different state of mind
With a different kind of hustle and we iller with the grind
And develop our muscle 'til we sicker with the shine
In the struggle  thus our money come quicker doin' crime
I see the way we rep the hood  gotta love me

And get to hustling as hard as you could (In the ghetto)
Until your cake stacking shit'll get good
Throw a block party for the whole hood (In the ghetto)
With them burnout cellys
Talk crazy  sell drugs in front of Pancho Deli
Crackhead chicks still smuggle babies in they belly
And then piss in elevators 'til the lobby all smelly (In the ghetto)
That's where I keep my ratchets
Get my instincts and survival tactics

Scott Storch  why you have to do it like this to 'em?
Feels like a new day!
Listen
Now every time I come
And I hit you niggas with shit regardless
You get retarded and then niggas ain't got a clue
On how the fuck I do what I do  and say what I say
And spit what I spit  you ain't never even gotta question who
‘Cause you know that I'm the only nigga that can ever come
And spitefully turn the place in to a motherfuckin' zoo
Then I come and I spit c-crazy sh-sh-sh-shit
And m-m-m-make n-n-niggas do exactly what I want 'em to
From my point of view  instead of trying to step up
You still trying to play catch up
And keep up with the way a nigga grew
These niggas panic and freakin' get schizophrenic
And let they emotions out
And I doubt they can ever test my crew
Whatever record you recorded  that's why your shit is through (Whoo!)
You fuckin idiot  I don't think you get it

Now if you ain't blind
And you ain't handicapped in your vision
I think it's simple enough  think that it's really plain to see
No matter how much you try
No matter how much you make an effort
You niggas can never ever really fuck with me
‘Cause I'll hurt you  and I will learn you a thing or two
Shit on a mic and doodoo
Right through the yoo-hoo  you do not have a fightin' chance to move
You were covered in my poo-poo
Smothered in my manure while I spit saliva fluid do-do-do-do-do-do g-g-g-goobers are glued to you
You don't have a clue as to what we're about to do  do you?
So just sit back and watch somethin'  you just gon' have a touch-chew
You just made me sneeze  I'm allergic to beats like these
You're probably wonderin' why there's thunder
And everyone is runnin' and duckin' up
Under everything up on the block
‘Cause Busta Bus and Flipmode just tip toed into the building
Then with Shady quietly try not to start  a riot with Doc
But since we all been spotted  we might as well have a party
And you ain't got to do nothin' special for this occasion
Now if you ain't blind
And you ain't handicapped in your vision
I think it's simple enough  think that it's really plain to see
No matter how much you try
No matter how much you make an effort
You niggas can never ever really fuck with me
‘Cause I'll hurt you  and I will learn you a thing or two
Catch you niggas and snatch you niggas
You bunch of bumblin' fools
Who got me rumblin' dudes all the way down the block
Keep on stumblin' and jumblin' over their words and vowels
Throw in the towel  see you niggas is on the clock
Every single time you put my shit in your CD player
And turn up the volume
You bang your head  because your shit is not
I continue with crumblin' niggas and tumblin' niggas
You struggle while I humble a nigga with the Glock
Then I watch you while I'll keep on fumblin'
While I got you tr-tr-tremblin'
Before one of my niggas bust your head with a rock
Before I start to do another thing
Then to make you crown me the king
Now watch my brother bring all my diamonds to summer bling
While I'm climbing and fuck her
Then tell you bitch to get off my yacht
Now if you ain't blind
And you ain't handicapped in your vision
I think it's simple enough  think that it's really plain to see
No matter how much you try
No matter how much you make an effort
You niggas can never ever really fuck with me
‘Cause I'll hurt you  and I will learn you a thing or two
See me when I pull up to the curb  little nigga

My Fulton Street niggas (Hardcore for '96)
Dangerous MC's
Ugh (Check it out)  ugh
Diamonds on my neck  chrome drop-top
Chillin' on the scene  smokin' pounds of green
Ooh-wee  you see  the ugliest (Ugh)
Money-hungriest  Brooklyn Loch-Ness
Nine millimeter cock test  wan fi' test? (Ugh)
And the winner is  not that thinner kid
Bandanas  tattoos  my fist never bruise (What)
Land still cruise  Frank White paid his dues
Ask who's the raw  bet they say Poppa  very
Look forward to me like commissary (Ugh)
All of a sudden  now everybody Big Willie
Done did it  come with it  get your head splitted
Or get your neck slitted  admit it  you overdid it
Your shit it just ain't got that loud
Gold tooth shine like ta-dow
Biggie Smalls the illest—and how  phrase raise your eyebrow
By now you figure  he talkin 'bout that nigga
But your weak-ass assumptions  lead lead to dumpin'
IV to pumpin'  you're feeling something
Catch my drift or catch my four-fifth lift
At least six inches  above project fences
Turn meat to minces  jumps turn to flinches
When I rain I drenches  cleared your park benches
Missed you by pinches  your talk is senseless
Actor needs chiropractor for cracked jaw
Yes I rocked your chatterbox
Dangerous  you're not  I gets down
Twist your body ‘round and ‘round  upside down

The say no to drugs slogan growing greatly irrelevant
Niggas gettin caught with bricks but still reaching the settlement
Niggas a get a one to three and come home in twelve months
Run up and take a niggas shit and eave 'em with twelve lumps
I've never been so willin' to put the thoughts of mo killin'
Into manufacturing a flow so bone chillin'

Shit glitter like ballroom chandelier  crystal  nigga

Head back north  cross 8 line to become the boss

You want some motherfuckin' wholesale  keep it steppin'
No discount  player  no fuckin' credit
No shorts  I came to govern the laws (damn)
And you paying the price so you dying by the sword
You had a devil smokin with them rebels

Extortionin' my own hood and that shit's power

I had the greatest experience shooting that video  'What’s it Gonna Be?'
I had to say it wowing  my heartbeat started pounding
Walked on the set while she got dressed
In cock rings on her outfit
Janet  why you doing this to me?
At the time I couldn’t believe we both were starring in this movie
You're in my video  you know a nigga loved it
I spent 2.4 million on the fucking budget
All my jewelry flooded  see how the kid was on?
First rap nigga album you’ve ever featured on
And I was weak in the Lord  despite the things we said
My first words to Hype Williams is “I can’t believe this dream”
Shot a solo scene  I tried to make mines better
But I love when we shot together  and we rubbed up on each other
In that Poetic Justice movie  from what I can account
You know what we be ‘bout…
Any time  huh?
Any place  baby?
Yeah  I was in love with shorty since she was
Penny and all that on Good Times and shit  you know what I mean?
You broke my heart with that  man

We grew up with her through the lens of a camera
Didn’t have much  but dare said I’m having her
Shorty was the joint  here’s my case and point
Me and ‘Pac rollin’ L’s in the trailer
Both of us get to scheming how to nail her
First movie about to come out in the theater
In my mind it would prolong
Me and Justice kissing keep it going  two pros with credit
A memorable summer in ’92 out in Cali
When I got back up top my niggas asked about the fatty
And did I smash her madly  to that I had to answer
Negative  but I’d give anything to be her dancer
A captivating lady  I used to be her baby
Good Times  they never fading
Look back and celebrate Poetic Justice

Where birds fall from the sky and fish die in the ocean
Now who you think you foolin'? We seein' the way you're movin'

You're playin' with a match that can grow into an inferno
I hope you document this and write it down in your journal
And read it back to yourself while overcomin' your hurdles
Now trust me and be careful of who you let in your circle
'Cause the Devil fucks a life and will breed the pussy that's fertile
I know it's gettin' cold and you're fightin' the war internal
You portray a lotta shit with no rehearsal
Look at what you've become and what the Devil gave birth to

So we put the chips on the table and told 'em to let it ride

Shawty love the way I beat it up
Beat the pretty pussy with a battle scar
Let a nigga eat it up like it caviar

Wednesday night at the Apollo
But it's okay 'cause she got a long neck
And I got a dick size only a giraffe could swallow
Sent her back 'cause they gonna ask tomorrow
