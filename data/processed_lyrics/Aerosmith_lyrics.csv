lyrics
"Way before the stable
Lightning shot right down from the sky
A mothership with fate said let's give it a try
Conscience was related
Lady luck took him by surprise
Her sweet and bitter fruit
It surely opened his eyes
Even Eve in Eden
Voices tried deceivin'
With lies to show the lady the way
At first she stopped and turned
And tried to walk away
Lady was deceiver
The snake was he and she just climbed right up his tree

Conscience was related
When lady luck took him by surprise
Her sweet and bitter fruits
Surely opened his eyes
Evil came like rain
And who knows who's to blame
And something tried to lay her to waste
And all she want to need was just a little taste
Belirginleşiyor
Öyle değil mi? herkesin hayatında ödemesi gereken aidatları var
Nerden geliyor ve nereye gidiyor?
Kazanmasını bilmek için kaybetmek zorundasın
2.Kısım
Hayatımın yarısı kitapların içinde ki yazılmış sayfalarda
Aptallar ve bilgeler ile yaşadım ve öğrendim
Bu'nun doğru olduğunu biliyorsun
Her şey sana geri döner
(Nakarat)
Belki de yarın İyi Tanrı yarın seni yanına alacak
Hayalin gerçekleşene kadar hayal et
Hayalin gerçekleşene kadar hayal et
(Nakarat)
Belki de yarın İyi Tanrı yarın seni yanına alacak
(Nakarat)
And let the wrong ones in
Had an angel of mercy to see me through all my sins
There were times in my life
When I was goin' insane
Tryin' to walk through the pain
I was so sick and tired of livin' a lie
I was wishin that I would die
It's amazing
With the blink of an eye you finally see the light
It's amazing
When the moment arrives that you know you'll be alright
It's amazing
And I'm sayin' a prayer for the desperate hearts tonight
That one last shot's a permanent vacation
And how high can you fly with broken wings?
And I just can't tell just what tomorrow brings

You have to learn to crawl
Before you learn to walk
I was out on the street
Just tryin' to survive
Scratchin' to stay alive
It's amazing
With the blink of an eye you finally see the light
It's amazing
When the moment arrives that you know you'll be alright
It's amazing
And I'm sayin' a prayer for the desperate hearts tonight
 I don't know if I can face the night
 let's break the walls between us
 I'll put away my pride
 I've suffered and I've seen the light
 you're my angel
 a dog without a bone
 you're my angel
 baby
 you're my angel
 alright
I'm back in the saddle again
I'm back
I'm back in the saddle again
Riding into town alone
By the light of the moon
I'm looking for old Sukie Jones
She crazy horse saloon
Barkeep give me a drink
That's when she caught my eye
She turned to give me a wink
That'd make a grown man cry
I'm back in the saddle again
I'm back
I'm back in the saddle again
I'm back
All right until the rising sun
I'm calling all the shots tonight
I'm like a loaded gun
Peeling off my boots and chaps
I'm saddle sore
Four bits gets you time in the racks
I scream for more
Fool's gold out of their mines
The girls are soaking wet
No tongue's drier than mine
I'll come when I get back

Believe me this trick's no cinch
But I really get her going
When I whip out my big 10 inch
Record of a band that plays the blues
Well a band that plays the blues
She just love my big 10 inch
Record of her favorite blues
Last night I tried to tease her
I gave my love a little pinch
She said now stop that jivin'
Now whip out your big 10 inch
Record of a band that plays the blues

She gets all excited

My heart says no but my head says stay
My work is finished  or so I've been told
You can't part the three of us  once we got a hold
I forgot my name
I took a shot on the chin
I'm rearranging my game
Tell by the shape I'm in
In the line of fire  you know what to say
They gave us no choices  just one shade of gray
My legs keep moving  don't seem to stray
But I know each step we take  they're one step away
I found the secret  the key to the vault
We walked in darkness  kept hitting the walls
I took the time  to feel for the door
I found the secret  the key to it all
I got the Nouveauree
And dragged it home to bed
I traded you for me
I took it all and said
I find my own fun  sometimes for free
I got to pay it to come looking for me
Walking on Gucci  wearing Yves Saint Laurent
Barely stay on  cause I'm so God damn gaunt

They talk to me and seem to hypnotize

My lover with no jet lag
We're staying up all night in my sleeping bag
You got a heart-beatin' rhythm from the subterranean
I really love you little girl
I don't need to explain
Like a double shot of lovin' so fine
'Cause you and me is two of a kind
Or somewhere else but you've been always near
It's you that's in my dreams I'm beggin' for
But I woke up when someone slammed the door
So hard I fell out of bed
Screamin' mama's little baby loves shortnin' bread

A Indian summer  Carrie was all over the floor
She was a wet nap winner  and rarely ever left the store
She'd sing and dance all night  and wrong all the right outa me
Nowhere to draw the line
Hi ho silver  we were singin' all your cowboy songs
Checkmate honey  you're the only one who's got ta choose
Where to draw the line
Checkmate  don't be late
Take another pull
That's right impossible
When you got to be yourself
You're the boss of the toss
The dice  the price
Grab yourself a slice
All these lines on my face getting clearer
The past is gone
It went by like dusk to dawn
Isn't that the way?
I know nobody knows
Where it comes and where it goes
I know it's everybody's sin
You got to lose to know how to win
Half my life's in books' written pages
Lived and learned from fools and from sages
You know it's true

Just push play  we're comin' at you anyway
Tell me what I say  walk this way
Were ruled by Lords of greed
Maidens fared with gold
They dared to bare their wombs that bleed
Kings and queens and guillotines
Taking lives denied
Starch and parchment laid the laws
When bishops took the ride
Only to deceive
Oh I know I lived this life afore
Somehow know now truths I must be sure
Tossing turning nightmares burning dreams of swords in hand
Sailing ships the Viking spits the blood of father's land
Only to deceive
Living times of knights and mares
Raising swords for maidens fair
Sneer at death fear only loss of pride
Living other centuries
Deja vu or what you please
Follows true to all who do or die

Bound to a wife in marriage
Found my horse and carriage
Ladies hold the aces
And their lovers call it passion
The men call it pleasure
But to me it's old fashioned
Times they're a changing
Nothing ever stands still
If I stop changing
I'll be writing out my will

Tell me how the pain's supposed to go (Oh yeah)
Tell me how it is that you can sleep in the night
Without thinking you lost everything that was
Good in your life to the toss of the dice
Tell me who's to blame for thinking twice
Ooo
I don't want to burn  I don't want to burn
Don't let it get'cha down
You see me crying
I'm back to the lost and found
You see me crying
Say you're a ladies man
You see me crying
So hard to understand
See Aerosmith LiveGet tickets as low as $35You might also like
You see me crying
Please say you'll stick around
And I got to be your lover
And I'll show you everything I know
And I'm never ever let you down
'Cause my love is like a merry-go-round"
