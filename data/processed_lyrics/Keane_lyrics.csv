lyrics
"Over every town up and down the line?
I'll die in the clouds above
And you that I defend I do not love
No one on my side
I was fighting
But I just feel too tired to be fighting
Guess I'm not the fighting kind
Where will I meet my fate?
And when will I meet my end?
In a better time you could be my friend
No one on my side
I was fighting
But I just feel too tired to be fighting
Guess I'm not the fighting kind
Wouldn't mind it
If you were by my side
But you're long gone

Yeah
Where do we go?
I don't even know
My strange old face
I've been thinking about those days
I've been thinking about those days
Ooh
No one on my side
I was fighting
But I just feel too tired to be fighting
Guess I'm not the fighting kind
Wouldn't mind it if you were by my side
But you're long gone
Yeah
Or was it just in my mind?
Was I just a ghost passing through you?
Clinging to the wreckage
Till I got the message
Hanging at the edge of the room
Give me something that's real
Give me half of your bitterest pill
Something from under the surface
You actually feel
We say these words again and again
But they still sound the same
They were just easy lies
The lightest words are heavy
And promises are easy
And no one's ever happy or sad for very long
But just because I said it
It doesn't mean I meant it
I guess that was the way all along

I'm just shaping the sound
I'm just turning the syllables round
Dipping my toe in the water
And watching you drown
We say these words again and again
But they still sound the same
They were just easy lies
And we've been a long time waiting
And it's been a lifetime in the making
We said when you are alone and afraid
I will come to your aid
Cause it was real to me
We say these words again and again
But they still sound the same
We say these words again and again
Will be lit by your face
I hope all the years
Will hold tight our promises
I don't wanna be old and sleep alone
An empty house is not a home
I don't wanna be old and feel afraid
I don't wanna be old and sleep alone
An empty house is not a home
I don't wanna be old and feel afraid
And if I need anything at all
(Ooh! Ah! Ooh!)
I need a place that's hidden in the deep
Where lonely angels sing you to your sleep
Though all the world is broken
I need a place where I can make my bed
A lover's lap where I can lay my head
Cause now the room is spinning
The rainy roads of our old town
Many the lives we lived in each day
And buried altogether
Don't laugh at me
Don't look away
You'll follow me back with the sun in your eyes and on your own
Bedshaped and legs of stone
But what do I know? What do I know? I know
I know you think I'm holding you down
And I've fallen by the wayside now
And I don't understand the same things as you
But I do
Don't laugh at me
Don't look away

Though I know I said I'd wait around till you need me
But I can't stop now
I've got troubles of my own
'Cause I'm short on time
I'm lonely and I'm
Too tired to talk
I noticed tonight that the world has been turning
While I've been stuck here withering away
Though I know I said I wouldn't leave you behind
But I can't stop now
I've got troubles of my own
'Cause I'm short on time
I'm lonely and I'm
Too tired to talk
To no one back home
I've got troubles of my own
And I can't slow down
For no one in town
And I can't stop now
And I can't slow down
For no one in town
And I can't stop now
For no one

Got some good friends around me
But I'm still scared of losing my head
I guess there's just something selfish about me
A dozen months go by as you wait for a sign
For the sky to boil above a sea of wine
For some road to grow before your eyes
For some act of God to set you right
I've had a little bad luck
I thought I had it all sewn up
But I was so badly mistaken
For the sky to boil above a sea of wine
For some road to grow before your eyes
For some guiding star to shine her light

It's been a difficult year
They bring the flood
Faster than our feet can run
Swarm of angels from above
Children sleep under the sun
And we go down to the river to pray
Pray for magic and another day
Into the dirt of memory

Where the seats of learning stood
And handsome couples would take a turn
Through the wealthy neighbourhood

Time to show your face
Time to take your place

You will not be alone
And you will see my shadow on every wall

It only takes a spark
To tear the world apart

Erases the ink before it dries on pages

Cos it hurts me just to see what I finally lost
So I guess I'm just a fiend
Consumed by the scene
The stage and the screens
Where it's just me and Keane
And if I stop for a minute
I think about things I really don't wanna know
So I guess I'm just a fiend
Consumed by the scene
And I'm the first to admit it
Without you I'm a liner stranded in an ice floe
The stage and the screens
By the open window
Your arm around my shoulder
One song after another
A church to praise the good times
And shelter from the bad times
And when our run came to an end
Felt like I'd lost my best friend
For a moment I was dreaming
We were just beginning
Finally I've come home
I lost something I love today
A rich kid with a good life
Now I know you're too young to
Have done things you can't undo
To rake over your dreams
And know this is what they've come to

I woke up in a strange room
Time to start again now
No one to help you find a way through
You're just meant to guess it somehow
We were just beginning
Throwing our possessions in the van
Your tapes piled on the back seat
And a camera in your hand
Dressed for our arrival in the strangeland
Strangeland blind
You got no reason  you got no rhyme
You get no time to put things right  to put things right
We drove across the border as the winter rains ran dry
And only fateful birdsong filled the sky
You threw your head back screaming
As we raced across wet sand
And leapt into the waters of the strangeland
Strangeland blind
You got no reason  you got no rhyme
You get no time to put things right  to put things right
You wound the rope around me
And you pulled the knots in tight
And shook me like a bad dream from your sight
And now the things I've done to forget you
Well  it's not what I had planned
The sweetest thoughts get twisted in the strangeland

You tore my baby away from me

I've done something stupid again
It's just I'm in this black hole so blue
I've done something stupid again
And now it's little lies and alibis
To miss the kids' bedtime again
And I know that you know and we both just play along
Just one more stupid thing that I have done
It starts
Got money in your pocket at last
It makes you think you're more than you are
You're just another sucker for the dream
No more or less than you have ever been

And the second phone (I drank too much)
I've done something stupid (Don't wait up)

And you feel like a fool
And we both just play along
And you feel like a fool

And only some dumb idiot would let you go
But if I'm one thing
Then  that's the one thing
I should know
Can anybody find their home?
Out of everyone

Where only some dumb idiot would let you go

Nobody tells you anything you need to know
I need a friend but a friend is so hard to find
I need an answer but I'm always one step behind
Cause it takes time
Learning to fly
Do you ever feel like all you want is to go home
Some days I rage like a fire in the wilderness
Some days I only need the darkness and a place to rest
Oh it takes time
(It takes time)
Learning to fly
Tear up this town
Blinking in the sunlight as the walls come down
This fire will burn
Digging for a truth that just can't be found
Don't want your lessons in love
I want to tear it all up

A toad will be our king
And ugly ogres our heroes
Then you'll shake your fist at the sky
On fashions and small fry?
All promises broken
And forfeit your whole kingdom
I'd sooner lose it than still live in it alone
You were our golden child
But the gentle and the mild
Inherit the earth while
Your prince's crown
Cracks and falls down
Your castle hollow and cold
You've wandered so far
From the person you are
'Cause now we all know

I dreamed I was drowning
In the river Thames
I dreamed I had nothing at all
Nothing but my own skin
I dreamed I was drifting
On the howling wind
I dreamed I had nothing at all
Nothing but my own skin
Slipped away from your open hands
Into the river
Saw your face looking back at me
You take the pieces of the dreams that you have
Cause you don't like the way they seem to be going
You cut them up and spread them out on the floor
You're full of hope as you begin rearranging
Put it all back together
But any way you look at things
Looks like the lovers are losing

The young lovers dance
I reached out to touch your hair
But I was watching from a distance

But in the final reckoning
Looks like the lovers are losing
But now you can't recognise
The streetlights that are daggers to your eyes
You can't find your bearings
You're slipping into the ground
The scene has no colour and no sound
Do you still believe in me
After the things I've done?
Do you fear for what we have become?
The ground is uneven
We stumble from day to day
But shelter where it's easy
I know your feet are like lead
But you've got to get underway
Drag your heart up to the starting line
Forget the ghosts that make you old before your time
It's too easy to get left behind
I know you've been kicked around
But tie up your thoughts and lay them down on me
Each heart is a paper kite
Blown around by the breeze
Love won't rest 'til it brings you to your knees
Some find it easy
Some will never even know
You think you've done your journey
Then you stumble and find
That there's such a long way to go

And drink to the bad times

You're too good to fall so low
Things will be clearer
And soon as we make a start
We'll be that much nearer
We're too old to just stand here
Waiting to break apart
Drag your heart up to the starting line
Forget the ghosts that make you old before your time
It's too easy to get left behind
I know you've been kicked around
But tie up your thoughts and lay them down on me
Never anything but joy behind your eyes
No sign of all the dark clouds
Spreading like volcanic dust over your blue skies
Now they're looking for an answer
Where the rot set in and set up the landslide
But it only makes it worse now
You're like a puzzle to be worked out
And it's the voices in your head now
Saying there's something wrong about the way I feel
And it's not what you expected
The way the world you built loves to cut you down
The way your head gets twisted
And you sit up all night trying to figure it out
And they say you've made your bed now
Don't you see you've brought it on yourself
And they say that you should move on
But you can't even get your shoes on

I remember the first time
The first of many lies
Sweep it into the corner
Or hide it under the bed

Your one last line
You fall on me for anything you like

Tread it into the carpet
Or hide it under the stairs

 left spinning in the wind

 maybe it was just our time

 I was just in love and hanging by a thread
I missed my stop and I went round again
Why would I wanna see you now?
What I was isn't what I am
But I was made the way I am
I'm not a stone  I'm just a man
Lay down your arms and I will lay down mine
Rip back the time that we've been wasting

Your fingers slip from my hand
White skies and silence
A lifeless wind burns through the Downland

I see that fearless love in your blue eyes
Think I can picture some new shape of life
