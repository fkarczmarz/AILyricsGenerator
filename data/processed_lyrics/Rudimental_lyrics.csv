"You got me up to my old ways again
You know I be saving first place for him
So safe with him
Baby got me feeling so safe again
Baby I can never feel the same again
When you do the thing that I want
I have got to be honest
See you there and I want it
One by one
You have taken me higher
We got no Bic or no lighter
My walls come falling down
Was lost and now I'm found
You came without a sound
My walls come falling down
So let 'em fall
My walls come falling down
So let 'em fall
My walls come falling down
So let 'em fall down

You're feelin' some type of way again
And I don't know what to say again
I feel like my love can draw you in
Now you're falling down
You want to know if I'm all in now
If I'm out in the night time crawlin' now
You're the only one I'm lovin' now
Pickin' up when I call you
You're bailing off the line right now
Talk to me when I'm feelin' low
Tell me now if you're all in
'Cause if you think then I need to know
My walls come falling down
Was lost and now I'm found
You came without a sound
My walls come falling down
So let 'em fall
My walls come falling down
So let 'em fall
My walls come falling down
So let 'em fall down
I have got to be honest
See you there and I want it
You have taken me higher (Higher)
We got no weed or no lighter for ya
My walls come falling down
Was lost and now I'm found
You came without a sound
My walls come falling down
So let 'em fall
My walls come falling down
So let 'em fall
My walls come falling down
So let 'em fall down
My walls come falling down
So let 'em fall
My walls come falling down
I'm falling back to your arms like waves on a pebbled shore
I'm 'bout to give in  my brain shuts down
And then it hit me like a thunderstorm
I can't see what I fell hard for
I gotta go  feel it running through my veins
And I can't stop it right now
Just stay up late to hear my voice through your phone
Caught in the night roaming through the streets now
Feeling so damn good  yeah
Open my mind  everything is possible now
I feel strong on my own
'Cause I'm high on this adrenaline
I feel strong on my own
'Cause I'm high on this adrenaline

Gasoline to my burning fire
Getting better every minute
Let the rhythm take  take control
And in this dance I see it clear
Overflow of the waves pulling out from the pebbled shore
I gotta go  feel it running through my veins
And I can't stop it right now
Just stay up late to hear my voice through your phone
Caught in the night roaming through the streets now
Feeling so damn good  yeah
Open my mind  everything is possible now
I feel strong on my own
'Cause I'm high on this adrenaline
I feel strong on my own
'Cause I'm high on this adrenaline
I've been staring down your way
Don't know exactly what to say
I'm wondering if you feel the same
Because every time I'm looking down
The questions what you're dancing around
I'm sick of playing silly games
Am I just wasting my time?
Should I carry on? Or should I say no more?
All of the things running through my mind
Baby baby

Every single night and day
I wonder if it's just a phase
Or is it really something here?
Cause whenever that you're near to me
I feel it in our energy
Just pull me out my misery
Am I just wasting my time?
Should I carry on? Or should I say no more?
All of the things running through my mind
Baby baby
Tell me
Tell me

Baby baby
Baby
Oh-oh  oh-oh  oh-oh
Every time you show up  yeah
Always on glow up  yeah
I really shouldn't go back there
Always say no  but yeah
You could never love me how I love me
I will never trust you  trust me
It was just you  never just me
You're lucky I don't do you how you done me
You know mine's never-ending
You're with me  you're protected
One more time  no pretending
You've got me moving restless
You say you love me  but you know that's just words (Just words)
Say it's real  but I still just curve (Just curve)
You want another chance  you know you got nerve (Got nerve)
I'm priceless  now I know my worth

If there's no end to our start  I'd keep hold of it with both hands
Just say what's on your mind  cause I can't cope with false hope and pain

Let's find a common emotion  something we both can feel
Cause I want to feel a common emotion  common emotion

I tried to find something sacred and mutual
But I'm losing my mind cause I don't know if you care at all  at all

Cause I want to feel a common emotion  common emotion

Embrace the love from my creator and be in his favour
And that'll be later
Cause right now I couldn't be greater
And I do not hate or you think I'm a baker?

And I love this music industry

The ones that roll behind your back regurgitating data
Bunch of vagrants
Gotta be patient
And other persuasions and denominations
I know that love ain't just a word
If you would bother to use your imagination

Teach me how to love like my mother baby
She loved him every day  thick and thin
She loved daddy like crazy
I would kill  I would steal
Have a feel  have a heart like my brother
He’d run from life  won’t think twice
Give his life to fight for his baby mama
See if I could love
Don’t you think that I’d love somebody?
If I could trust
Don’t you think that I’d let you touch me?
Teach me to love
I hope there’s still hope for me

So wash them tears away
Mama bawl out when the bullet hit her first son
Too many bombs and military incursions
This is our prayer for the ones that been muted
Everybody choosin' desires over beauty
Evil is bloomin' and money's where it's rooted
So spread your wings and get ready to fly
Said it's no biggie and I'm ready to die
The grave digger have them space in the cemetery
So just listen to me properly when me a tell you this
Them no business 'bout the blood when we're sheddin' it
We don't need no pain

All that I see's money
The money don't hear you callin' out
Bullets keep you awake
Pray your wings take you away

Change for who? Change for why?
I need none of this here when I touch down
They can never penetrate the passion
Or the pedigree
Through the jealousy
