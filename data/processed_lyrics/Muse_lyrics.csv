lyrics
"I've been drained and I can't hide it
But I have strength for you  you're all that's real anymore
I am coming home now  I need your comfort
From this moment  from this moment
You will never be alone
We're bound together  now and forever
The loneliness has gone
States are crumbling  and walls are rising high again
It's no place for the faint-hearted
But my heart is strong 'cause now I know where I belong
It's you and I against the world  and we are free
From this moment  from this moment
You will never be alone
We're bound together  now and forever
The loneliness has gone
We've gone against the tide
All we have is each other now
And I am coming home now
I need your comfort

We're bound together  now and forever
The loneliness has gone
We're bound together
Now and forever
Churn like a cog
We are caged in simulations
Algorithms evolve
Push us aside and render us obsolete
This means war
With your creator

Your freedom comes naturally
Everything about you resonates happiness
Now I won't settle for less
Give me all the peace and joy in your mind
Ooh
Everything about you pains my envying
Your soul can't hate anything
Everything about you is so easy to love
They're watching you from above
Give me all the peace and joy in your mind
I want the peace and joy in your mind
Everything about you resonates happiness
Now I won't settle for less
Give me all the peace and joy in your mind
I want the peace and joy in your mind
Give me the peace and joy in your mind
And everything you were
Your number has been called
Fights and battles have begun
Revenge will surely come
Your hard times are ahead
You've got to change the world
And use this chance to be heard
Your time is now (Your time is now)
Change everything you are
And everything you were
Your number has been called
Fights and battles have begun
Revenge will surely come
Your hard times are ahead

Teach us to cheat
What shouldn't be shared

Erase all the memories
They'll only bring us pain

We just need your compliance
Just give us your compliance
We won't let you feel lost anymore

(Dead inside)
Revere a million prayers
And draw me into your holiness
But there's nothing there
Light only shines from those who share
Unleash a million drones
Do you have no soul?
Your lips feel warm to the touch
You can bring me back to life
But you're dead inside
You're free to touch the sky
Whilst I am crushed and pulverised
Because you need control
Now I'm the one who's letting go
You like to give an inch
Whilst I am giving infinity
But now I've got nothing left
You have no cares and I'm bereft

My lips feel warm to the touch
My words seem so alive
My skin is warm to caress
I'll control and hypnotize
You've taught me to lie without a trace
And to kill with no remorse
Now I'm dead inside
From your ins-ins-inciting
You can't brainwash me
You've got a problem
Free  yeah I'm free
From society
You can't control me
I'm a defector
You think you're strong and you can't be broken
But your empire is dissolving
You thought  you thought I was weak
But you got it wrong  look into my eyes  I'm a defector
Free  yeah  I'm free

You've got a problem
Free  yeah I'm free
From society
You can't control me
I'm a defector
We look for strength and assistance
Confident that with your help
Man will be what he was born to be:
You must find a way
When the darkness descends and you're told it's the end
You must find a way
When God decides to look the other way and a clown takes the throne
We must find a way
You will find a way
Dig down
Dig down
Dig down and find faith
When you're close to the edge
With a gun to your head
You must find a way
When friends are thin on the ground and they try to divide us
We must find a way
We have entered the fray and we will not obey
Dig down
Dig down
Dig down and find faith
When they've left you for dead and you can only see red
You must find a way
Dig down
Dig down
We will find a way

The only thing I'll never show
Hopelessly
I'll love you endlessly
Hopelessly
I'll give you everything
But I won't give you up
I won't let you down
And I won't leave you falling
If the moment ever comes
It's plain to see it's trying to speak
Cherished dreams forever asleep
Hopelessly

Moments of happiness elude
Maybe I just misunderstood
All of the love we left behind
Watching the flashbacks intertwine
Memories I will never find
So I'll love whatever you become
And forget the reckless things we've done
I think our lives have just begun
I think our lives have just begun
And I'll feel my world crumbling
I'll feel my life crumbling
I'll feel my soul crumbling away
And falling away
Falling away with you
Staying awake to chase a dream
Tasting the air you're breathing in
I know I won't forget a thing
Promise to hold you close and pray
Watching the fantasies decay
Nothing will ever stay the same
And all of the love we threw away
And all of the hopes we've cherished fade
Making the same mistakes again
Making the same mistakes again

You have only been betrayed
You were never truly nurtured
By churches or the state
You were left unprotected
To these wild and fragile lands
But you can rise up like a god
You can build a nuclear power
Transform the earth to your desire
Free your mind from false beliefs
You can be the commander in chief
You can hide your true motives
To dismantle and destroy
Now you finally have the code
I have given you the code

To love and cherish
To hunt and gather memories
Of the great nation we were
There's no countries left
To fight and conquer

Survive alone with no one left to love
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
There's no culture left
To love and cherish
A trillion memories lost in space and time
Forevermore

They'll try to push drugs that keep us all dumbed down
And hope that we will never see the truth around

Another promise  another seed
Another packaged lie to keep us trapped in greed
And all the green belts wrapped around our minds
And endless red tape to keep the truth confined
(So come on)
They will not force us
They will stop degrading us
They will not control us
And we will be victorious

Interchanging mind control
Come let the revolution take its toll
If you could flick a switch and open your third eye
You'd see that we should never be afraid to die

And get myself blown asunder
But now you have pushed me under
I've opened my eyes and counted the lies
And now it is clearer to me
You are just a user and an abuser
And I refuse to take it
Now die alone
I'm playin' you at your own game

I will never see you the same
I know how to win before you begin
I'll shoot you before you take aim
A psychological war
Now I'm gonna settle the score
