lyrics
" it's five  once again
 so am I
 justified
 keeping count
 breakin' all the dishes
 what would Mama say? She'd say
 you never know when to stop
 well  now I'm high as the ceiling
 oh  I think I just hit my stride
 now I'm high as thе ceiling  oh
 quite a lot
 breaking all the dishes
 what would Mama say? She'd say
 you never know when to stop
 well  now I'm high as the ceiling
 oh  I think I just hit my stride
 well  now I'm high as the ceiling
 guess I'm keepin' it goin'
 but that was yesterday
 you never know when to stop
 well  now I'm high as the ceiling
 oh  I think I just hit my stride
 are you alone?
 you don't even know
 it's better that you don't
 but I do
 every time I have a drink or two
 yeah
 aye
 we both remember what we said
 you should go to bed
 it's crazy
 oh yeah
 yeah
 oh-oh  oh)

 crash down)
Start a fire when you turn the lights off
Oh my  my God
When he made you  he did a fine job
I know you been hoping I'd give in
But I ain't feelin' that feelin'  no
The one thing I love more than being with you and that's
Late nights  doing what I wanna do
I got sleep eyes  I woke up like this
One thing I love more than being with you
And that's no ties  no drama in my life
Yeah I  I woke up like this
One thing I love more than being with you
Ayy  you
Ayy  you
Sizzlin'  white hot
Give me that sugar with the sweet talk
You're perfect  but I'm not
So how do we end up in the worst spot?

Ayy  you (Yeah!)
Ayy (Dolla $ign  Dolla $ign)
You on top  got me feelin' on your booty
Know you hate it when you know there's other girls around
Won't admit it  but you're actin' so different now
And it's hard to just take off like that
When you been with a broad and you go way back
And you love what keeps you coming back
And I love when a bad bitch down my back
The one thing I love more than being with you
And that's late nights  doing what I wanna do
I got sleep eyes  I woke up like this
One thing I love more than being with you
And that's no ties  no drama in my life
Yeah I  I woke up like this
One thing I love more than being with you
Cold to the touch  but she’s warm as a devil
Gave her my heart  but she wanted my soul
She tasted the break and I can’t get more
You got me in chains
You got me in chains for your love
But  I wouldn’t change
No  I wouldn’t change this love
You got me in chains
You got me in chains for your love
But  I wouldn’t change
No  I wouldn’t change this love
Try to break the chains  but the chains only break me
Try to break the chains  but the chains only break me
I ain't no criminal  just a simple individual
I want it all  need it now  no subliminal
It is not that difficult  here's a visual
Chains and whips  make 'em strip  I am in control
You play the submissive role  then maybe we switch the role
I'll be your slave  you can have me anyway that you want

Cold to the touch  but she's warm as a devil

You got me in chains
You got me in chains for your love
But I wouldn't change
No  I wouldn't change this love
You got me in chains
You got me in chains for your love
But I wouldn't change
No  I wouldn't change this love
Tryna break the chains  but the chains only break me

Alone in the night 'til she knocks on my door  oh  no
Wasted again  but I can't say no  whoa

 TV on

How many pieces have to break? (Break)
So many reasons not to celebrate (Celebrate)
I got a bottle I've been saving up (Saving up)
Thought that we’d drink it on that day
We were the opposite of breaking up (Breaking up)
Can't believe I'm losing you
We just opened up too soon
We got champagne problems
Only one way to solve 'em
Raising our glass 'cause it's our last
With these champagne problems
How did our clothes end up all on the floor? (Woo)
Didn't we just break each other's hearts?
Didn't you have one foot out of the door?

With just one breath  I'm locked in

When I met you in April
You were looking like May
The liquor never tastes good
But I don't need to chase
Take another hit
Just fake it 'til you feel it
Open up and let me in
I just wanna feel you
Close enough to feel this moment
Close enough to feel this moment
Like the sun in December
Or a lemonade in June
Have you ever noticed
That I can't see straight

Got me glued to your waist

I took a pill but it didn't help me numb
I see your face even when my eyes are shut

You  you're like taking off on Monday
I was just a face you never notice
Now I'm just trying to be honest
You might think that I'm a fool
For falling over you
So tell me what can I do to prove to you
That it's not so hard to do?
Give love a try  one more time
'Cause you know that I'm on your side
Give love a try  one more time
How did it play out like a movie
Now every time you speak it moves me
And I can't get your smile off my mind
And your eyes  when I saw 'em for the first time
Knew that I was gonna love you for a long time
With a love so real  so right
Well  you might think that I'm a fool
For falling over you
So tell me what I can do to prove to you
That it's not so hard to do?
Give love a try  one more time
'Cause you know that I'm on your side
Give love a try  one more time
Post it for the world to see
People that you don't know
Who the hell you tryna please?
Living like a credit card
Pray you never see the charge
Those Hype Williams videos
Taught you how to wear your clothes
When did all these good girls decide to be bad?
Who's the asshole that told you that's what you had to do?

Chilled me to the bone 'cause I realized
Everything before was a waste of time
And this could be forever
This could be forever
If it's this life or the next one
Promise that I'm always gonna find ya
If I fall again
It'd be the last time
The last time that I'm falling
The last time that I'm falling
But it's the last time
The last time that I'm falling
The last time that I'm falling
Fall again for you

The last time that I'm falling
It's just the beginning
But it's the last time
The last time that I'm falling
The last time that I'm falling
I think lyrics need to rhyme and you're not askin'
But I'm tryin' to grow a mustache
And sometimes on a homemade quesadilla
Otherwise  it smells like feet to me
And I  I really like it when the moon looks like a toenail
And I love it when you say my name
If you wanna know  here it goes
Gonna tell you there's a part of me that shows if we're close
Gonna let you see everything
But remember that you asked for it
I'll try to do my best to impress
But it's easier to let you take a guess at the rest
But you wanna hear what lives in my brain and my heart
Well  you asked for it
For your perusin'  at times confusin'
Slightly amusin'  introducing me
Do-do  do-do-do-do-do
Do-do  do-do-do-do-do
La-da-da-da
La-da-da-da-da-da-da-da  da

Am I crazy? Have I lost ya?
I turn my chin music up
And I'm puffing my chest
I'm getting red in the face
You can call me obsessed

Than the love you're giving me
I just gotta have you  wish you didn't have to
When you gonna set me free?
Like it or not  we were doomed from the start
I know that you'll agree
Than you and me (And me  and me)
Than you and me (And me  and me)
You and me
I take the worst of what you got
It hurts more than sticks and rocks
You know I'll be there  you know I'll be there
And I would be your punching bag
Throw it all and don't hold back
'Cause I used to live in fear  it was my home
But there are harder things to be than all alone

We're so unsure

And I know that you'll agree
Gotta be numb to push you like that
Liftin' me up  lettin' me fall
Fuck with my head like it's nothin' at all
You were my sun  you were my earth
I was your best and you were my worst
Breakin' my heart one piece at a time
You don't know what it is you do to me

And all I have is a hole where it used to be
And the hardest part is
Now you've got some substitute for me
But he's not the one
You don't know what it is you do to me
Yeah  you leave me numb
Losin' my mind  losin' control
Swallow my pride  you swallow me whole
Smile on my face to cover my hurt
Spent so much time  but what was that worth?

Cross in my hand  mistaken for love

I got trapped off in a black box lit from the matchbox in your rage
You said  We are merely players who still act off of the stage
Know you don't like trouble  but what's one more season?
And I dream on  you gettin' your plot and your scheme on
And I just be here with my theme song
'Cause you make me feel like the night before Christmas
Love is a crime and I'm stuck in your prison
If you numb and I'm numb  then what is we feelin'?
You don't know what it is you do to me
Yeah  you stole my heart
And all I have is a hole where it used to be
And the hardest part is
Now you've got some substitute for me
But he's not the one
You don't know what it is you do to me (You do to me  yeah)
You know well that I can't swim
I'm not tryna be a martyr
Know that I won't let you in
Safe and warm inside myself
But you need more than someone else
You take yours and I'll take mine
So I can be the one to push you
The one to push
Hold me tight enough to kill me
Bite my tongue so I can't speak
Clip my wings so I can't fly
You take yours and I'll take mine

'Cause you're all that
And I just had to let you know
That I'm screaming out in the crowd for you
I can be too loud 'cause I don't care
I let them all stare
I just want everyone to know the truth
It's only you
You might also like
I never really noticed
Took a while for me see (A while for me to see)
Playing back the moments
Now I’m starting to believe (Starting to believe)
That you could be at the show and know every word
But it's you who makes me sing
I may not know where we are  but I know who I am
Baby  I'm your biggest fan
You showed up and you looked so classy
Made me think twice 'bout the way I was acting
You were real from the start of it all
Like a dream came to life  now I'm left in awe
Stars shine  but your light is the brightest
And Love flies  but your love is the highest
You're so sweet that it drives me crazy
A summer like no other  you're my L.A. baby
No  I never really noticed
Took a while for me to see (Took a while for me to see)
Playing back the moments
Now I'm starting to believe (I'm starting to believe)
That you could be at the show and know every word
But it's you who makes me sing
I may not know where we are  but I know who I am
That you could be at the show and know every word
But it's you who makes me sing
I may not know where we are  but I know who I am"
