lyrics
"People just don't see
How much work is really involved in this rap shit
I didn't know it  I didn't see it
I never saw it until I was actually in it
You really gotta be in it
To understand what it's like
But you always gotta
People always gotta see you smile
You always gotta put on that fake...
You know what I'm sayin'?
No matter what you just been through
Shit has gotta be right
So you wanna be a rap superstar
And live large
Comin' up in the world
Don't trust nobody
Gotta look over your shoulder constantly
I remember the days when I was a young kid growin' up
Lookin' in the mirror dreamin' about blowin' up
To rock crowds  make money
Chill with the honeys
Sign autographs and whatever the people want from me
Shit's funny
How impossible dreams manifest
And the games that be comin' with it
Never the less you got to go for the gusto
But you don't know about the blood sweat and tears
And losin' some of your peers
And losin' some of your self
Through the years past  gone by
Hopefully it don't manifest for the wrong guy
Egomaniac and the brainiac
Don't know how to act
Shit's deep
48 tracks
Studio gangsta mack
Signed a deal  thinks he's gonna make a mil'
But never will
'Til he crosses over  still
Fillin' your head with fantasies
Come with me
Show the sacrifice it takes to make the cheese
You wanna be a rap superstar in the biz
And take shit from people who don't know what it is
I wish it was all fun and games
But the price of fame is high
And some can't pay to play
Feelin' trapped in
What you rappin' about
Tell me what happened when you lost clout
The route you took started collapsin'
No fans  no fame
No respect  no change
No women
And everybody shits on your name

So you wanna be a rap superstar
And live large
Comin' up in the world
Don't trust nobody
Gotta look over your shoulder constantly
To be a rap superstar
And live large
Comin' up in the world
Don't trust nobody
Gotta look over your shoulder constantly
When you sign to a record label
You don't know you sign your life over
And these white boys don't care about you
'Cause the minute you fall off
They'll find another Noreaga
And they'll find another Capone-N-Noreaga
And they'll find another B-Real
So you need to just keep
Stack your chips up
Do what you gotta do while you hot
And motherfuckin' get out the game
Just stick to the drug game
It's even worse because in the drug game
If somebody jerk you
You can shoot 'em and kill 'em and
If you  in this game if somebody jerk you
You gotta be humble
No matter what you just been through
Shit has gotta be right
You gotta approach people
You gotta be on the up and up
And everything's gotta be all good
When you see someone  slap hands with 'em
You know what I'm sayin'
Give 'em a pound or whatever it is  you know
But you always gotta act like it ain't shit
So you wanna be a rap superstar
And live large
Comin' up in the world
Don't trust nobody
Gotta look over your shoulder constantly
To be a rap superstar
And live large
Comin' up in the world
Don't trust nobody
Gotta look over your shoulder constantly
My own son don't know me
Sittin up in the hotel room lonely
But I thank God I'm wit my homies
But sometimes I wish I was back home
But only no radio or videos
Cuz they show me no love
The phony gotta hit the road slowly
So the record gets pushed by Sony
I'm in the middle like Monie
And the press say that
My own people disown me
And the best way back
Is to keep your head straight
Never inflate the cranium
Your crew worried about them honies at The Palladium
Who just wanna cling on and swing on
And so on and go on and fall off
The hoes fall off
To the next rap superstar
Wit no shame give him a year
And they'll be right out the game
The same as the last one
Who came before him
Gained fame
Started gettin ignored
I warned him
Assured him
This ain't easy take it from Weezy
Sleezy people wanna be cheesey
They talkin evil
So you wanna be a rap superstar
And live large
Comin' up in the world
Don't trust nobody
Gotta look over your shoulder constantly
To be a rap superstar
And live large
Comin' up in the world
Don't trust nobody
So you wanna be a rock superstar?
Comin' up in the world don't trust nobody
Gotta look over your shoulder constantly
I remember the days when I was a young kid growin' up
Looking in the mirror dreamin' about blowin' up
Sign autographs or whatever the people want from me
Shit's funny how impossible dreams manifest
You got to go for the gusto but you don't know
And losing some of yourself to the years past gone by
Hopefully it don't manifest for the wrong guy
Egomaniac and the brainiac don't know how to act
But never will till he crosses over
Still filling your head with fantasies
You wanna be a rock superstar in the biz?
And take shit from people who don't know what it is
I wish it was all fun and games but the price of fame is high

What happens to these stars and their big brains

Long as you sell everything will be okay
Then you get dissed by the media and fans
Things never stay the same way they began
I heard that some never give full to the fullest
That's why fools end up dining on a bullet
Think everything's fine in the big time

Ever heard of me?
Wicked as you ever seen
Heavy on the throttle
Under the cover of night
And my clan goes way back to the Cro-Mags
Too much to fuck with when all the brothers combine
Everything you ever heard of is not a myth
Crazy dogs you don't ever wanna deal with
Which smell? It's the hash that we left around
Smoke a whole pound when I feel myself comin' down
Live how I wanna live and answer to no one
Similar to the ways of the shogun
Think again before you try and come and get me
Or you'll be shot up by a gang of gypsies (shot)

Jack me and I'll jack you back (Jack you back)
Then jump back to my big Buddah like
I'm not a bad guy but don't take advantage
All I was doing was searching for the boom
Then some punk tried to hit me with the broom
Lucky I ducked quick or else I'd be assed out
Last thing I wanted was have to pull the gat out
Here comes a nigga and he's got a .38
Took a little trip to the funky weed spot

Heading down to the Mexican border

Kid Frost got my back (BOO-YAA!)  en la casa
'Cause everyday  things get a little crazier
As I step to the microphone area
First  I claim my city — puro Los Angeles
Vatos waitin' on me  along with their heinas
Catchin' all the sweat for what I said to one-timer
So when you see me at the party or the baile
Before I got here  I was gaffled in the calle
Who's that gabacho who said I was borracho?
Had an attitude  why you tried to play me macho?!
Just relax — calmado  mijo

Yeah  I'd like to send peace to my homeboy B-Real (Hehehe!)

That’s a good boy
Would you rather put the cameras out  or we playin' coy?
Don't even think about the strap up in your backpack
Cooperate and when I leave you're still alive  in fact
I only want your cash crop  not your life jack
(You can get another crop)  but not your life back
So settle down  I don't wanna let the metal spray
Lead the way  give it up and live another day
Trees and sacks  backpack full of cash  out the door
Hit the ride  hear my tires screechin' in the back

Nowhere to run from the assassination

Whoops there goes another body on the ground
Watch out for G hound

Not like these fools who don't comprehend
You end up doing a twenty-five bit in the pen
You got that? Getting your cup  I took a swig
The bitter taste of the 'mezcal'  free worm shit
Just do what I say  and you'll be rich
And keep this in your mind: rats lay in a ditch with no spine
Don't ever forget that golden rule in the game
Watch those conniving women and keep your eye out
Always be aware of what's around you
They wanna down you  and fuckin clown you
Keep your shit in order the money won't stop
Pretty soon you'll be on top
Tequila Sunrise  bloodshot eyes
Realize we're all born to die
So get the money nigga!
Tequila Sunrise  bloodshot eyes
Realize we're all born to die
So get the money nigga!
Tequila Sunrise  with the bloodshot eyes
My mentor passed on and passed a warn to me  emergency
For my enemies who wanna murder me
I recall the words from Jesus  you are the Juice
Let these words stick  you better be ready to die
Tequila Sunrise  bloodshot eyes
Realize we're all born to die

Pa'la Salud
Primero Yo!!
ARRGH!!!! (Mexican Yell)
Cometelo!!!!!!!
Aqui estoy con mi barrio listo a hacer feria
Cartel Cypress Hill esta en tu area
Colectando queso allá en Mexico
Donde el sol quema duro y baja despacio
Tengo mis camaradas y todo esta bien
Tengo una mansion en tierra que mide cien
Y todos se den cuenta vengo a hacer transas
Como Chalino aqui estoy pa'la raza
Me veen en mi ranfla con todos los hierros
Cuidando mi negocio con todo mi perro
No trates nada tengo mis soldados
Espiritu asesino vienen preparados
Raperos desperados es nuestro tema
El dicho de nosotros Agarra La Crema

Con los ojos rojos un dia vamos a morir
Escandalosos!!
Pero como guerrillero me enseno la foto grande
No pases anos torcidos con placas en tu frente
No me cruces o te pico
Que no se te olviden las reglas del juego
Te van a conocer hasta que quemes en el fuego
Mujeres falsas y dinero no va
Como tomando manejando mi hermano te matara
Quedate alerta a lo que esta alrededor
Esas cosas que dije van a ser tu matador
Recuerdate de mi y siempre vas a ganar
Tiempo vuela rapido y by surprise
Mi pana se murio y a mi me dejo
Que te peguen mis palabras
— ¿Pos sabes que compa? Yo aquí  en el norte yo soy el que controla yo te lo puedo mover todo...
— ¿80  100 palos a la semana…?
Te traemos toda la feria y limpio ese…
— Pues bueno  aquí tenemos un negocio... vamos hacer hombres ricos… ¿Tomamos no? Del gusano…
— Pa' la salud!
— Pa' la salud! Primero yo…
— Primero usted…
— Grrrrrah!
*Mexican yells*
— Word up  Tequila style
— Cometelo!
Eat the worm motherfucker
Tequila spice  hot nice
Feeling right  sipping on Jose Cuervo
Down in Tiajuana  Mexico
Thinking of the big score the night before
Met the connect  who was impressively dressed
In high fabrics
With troops like Beirut  up on the mezzanine
Brandishing sub-machine guns  aye-yo
It's all about the money  son
Now that's the only reason
We came south of the border  to complete this work order
Ready to attack  die in a minute flat for it
As God is my witness  we got ditches
For all you motherfuckin fake bitches
It all boils down to the business
Nothing personal  when niggas acting like they helping you
I fuckin blast you like Frank Castle  motherfucker!

'Til I met the man with mad hook-up  and big plan
Every where you look'a  he got everybody shook up

Niggas wanna get busy with the ultimate
With chips and clips and tons of blue steel
So who wants to be the first nigga to die?
Punks don't make it back very often
I got Erick to take care of the sermon
Bustin' open the doors to the temple
Takin' you to the dark side of your mental (Dark side of your mind)
Throw your hands in the air (Come on)
Throw your hands in the air (Everybody now)
Throw your hands in the air (All my brothers do)
Throw your hands in the air (Redman)
So I kill 'em softly and use 'em as walkie talkies *bzzzzt*
Is what I leave your crew with
Boom bip or some two and two shit
With my nigga Keith in the place takin charge
You're deaf 'cause I freak shit you never heard of
Throw your hands in the air (Come on)
Throw your hands in the air (MC Eiht)
The original baby gangsta on this Compton thang
Boo-yaa is the sound from a lonely clip
Throw your hands in the air (Throw 'em up now)
Throw your hands in the air (In the air yo)
Throw your hands in the air (Come on)
Throw your hands in the air (Throw 'em in the air)

 man
 man?
 you know what I'm sayin'?
Tremendos cocos y también es linda
A veces me la cojo en la cocina
Esta muchacha me chupa la pinga
Yo le dije dame tu bollo
Me dice negro loco tu no eres mi novio
A mi me importa un carajo
A mi cuarto meterte un palo
Por tu culo o por tu chocha
Y ya tu sabes que no me importa
Y ella me dice Suavecito
Yo pienso que tu eres bien rico
Cuando me toca por mi frente
Ya tu me tienes bien caliente
Y cuando me tocas por detrás
Ya tu sabes sin parar
Acabe de singar y me levante
Fui al baño y me bañe
Salí del cuarto y me esperaba
Con los ojos negros y bonita cara
Me pongo mi camisa y mi pantalón
Se ríe y me dice Negro sedentón…
Estaba fina
Esta muchacha estaba tan pinga
Uy! Cuando se lo metí...
Nunca he singa'o yo como yo singué esa vez
She noticed a lot of girls giving up their phone digits
She didn't wanna be one of those hoes
In clothes exploiting her body from head to toes
She had glossy lips she was swaying her hips
On the dance floor and every nigga's flashing her grip
Trying to impress her in vain she gave no play
Niggas hit her up for numbers and she said no way
I thought to myself let it go and roll on  B
But like Smokey said she really had a hold on me
I couldn't stop staring I started to fantasize with her
Voices in my head said she's tantalizing ya
Even if I moved to the other side of the party
I had pictures in my head of her moving that body
I was beside myself with hunger pain
So I slowly walked over and I asked her name
What's your name  what's your number?
I would like to get to know you
Can we have a conversation?
The night is young  girl give me a chance!

She gave a smile but I got no answer though
I took a while before she gave a chance she's acting cold
I offered her a drink she turned me down flat
She said if you want my name you gotta do better than that
I said OK  now your shit don't stink
I'ma walk away only tried to buy you a drink
As I began to walk away she said I'm sorry for real
But every guy in the club tried slipping me pills
I don't trust guys each and every one will lie to you
I said I understand but it's not what I try to do
I wasn't even gonna come to your table
But if I didn't I knew that I'd regret it later
I go after what I want but I got class
For me no need to slip a pill if I want ass
She gave me a funny look I couldn't tell what it meant
She let her guard down and on our conversation went
She said I want a man with a plan and ambition
Not an immature nigga on a pussy-hit mission
I'm too good for that I have so much to offer
Got a good job working at my mom and dad's law firm
You got goals  that's what she asked
Yeah I wanna fill my home with platinum plaques
It takes hard work but you know it's coming after
She said 'oh my God you must be a famous rapper!'
I do all right but I'm never satisfied
I'm told when you still love what you do it never gets old
I strive for more but that's enough about me
Why don't we skip out the club and take a walk on the streets
We slipped out of the club with no worries
Seems she wanted to get out in a hurry
We hung all night till we lost our friends
Till they caught us bangin in the back of a Benz
Rolling around the nine deuce Cadillac
Still got my homies to watch my back
And they'll smoke your ass if you wanna come and chat
A hollow point shell's hard to swallow (Hey)
Why wallow when you come to roll on?
Left kicking dust as you hear the gat bust
I brushed with death
How many shells stuffed in my closet
Where my big chrome things kept
When the shit goes down you better be ready
(When the shit goes down)
When the shit goes down you better be ready
(When the shit goes down)
When the shit goes down you better be ready
(When the shit goes down)
When the shit goes down you better be ready
(You better be ready)
I told the boys get the sawed off Glock and the rest of the gats
As I strapped on the bullet-proof vest
Niggas 'bout to fall
I'm coming out blasting like Yosemite Sam
Got the cheese and the bread for the ham

Yo quiero fumar... mota
Yo quiero fumar... mota
Yo quiero fumar... mota
Fumar marijuana por la policia
Me vale madre el humo que hay por todo el aire
Si tu quieres que me toque pues caele
Soy el grifo mas escandaloso
De Los Angeles Cypress peligroso
Enciende el leño o la pipa
Pasalo por mi clica la que rifa
Es algo que yo hago diario
Al despertar y tambien todo el dia en mi barrio
Cuando me encuentres en cualquier lugar
Saca papeles porque quiero fumar mota...
Yo quiero fumar... mota
Yo quiero fumar... mota
Yo quiero fumar... mota"
