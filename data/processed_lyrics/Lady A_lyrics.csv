lyrics
"It’s the best time of the year
I don’t know if there’ll be snow
But have a cup of cheer
Have a holly jolly Christmas
And when you walk down the street
Say hello to friends you know
And everyone you meet
Oh ho the mistletoe
Hung where you can see
Somebody waits for you
Kiss him once for me
Have a holly jolly Christmas
And in case you didn’t hear
Oh by golly have a holly jolly
Christmas this year
Oh ho the mistletoe
Hung where you can see
Somebody waits for you
Kiss him once for me

And in case you didn’t hear
Oh by golly have a holly jolly
Christmas this year
And it's messin' with the way I see myself
My tank is pushin' empty  I'm runnin' low on caffeine
I guess my good day went to someone else
Just when I'm on the edge of cryin'  babe
You're callin' to remind me  remind me
Breathe in and let it go
This life ain't always perfect
Sometimes it's dominoes
When one bad thing leads to another
Baby  there's a shine at the end of the tunnel
Roll my windows down  turn that song up loud
Laugh it off and give myself a break
Gray skies try their best to cover up

Breathe in and let it go
This life ain't always perfect
Sometimes it's dominoes
When one bad thing leads to another
Baby  there's a shine at the end of the tunnel
(Gonna be  gonna be alright)
(Everything's gonna be alright)
(Gonna be  gonna be alright)
(Everything's gonna be alright)
Ain't nothin' that a new day can't face
Ain't nothin' that a good love can't shake
Ain't nothin' that the good Lord can't change  oh
Breathe in and let it go
This life ain't always perfect
But I know it's beautiful
When one bad thing leads to another
Baby  there's a shine at the end of the tunnel
I know it's all gonna be alright  yeah
(Gonna be  gonna be alright)
(Everything's gonna be alright) Ooh  alright
(Gonna be  gonna be alright)
(Everything's gonna be alright) I know it's all gonna be alright  yeah
(Gonna be  gonna be alright)
(Everything's gonna be alright) Know it's gonna be  know it's gonna be alright
(Gonna be  gonna be alright)
Where the church bells ring and strong love grows
Like American honey
American honey
Callin' out my name like a long lost friend
And American honey
Get caught in the race of this crazy life
Tryin' to be everything can make you lose your mind
I just wanna go back in time
Callin' out my name like a long lost friend
And American honey

Gone for so long now
I gotta get back to her somehow
To American honey
Callin' out my name like a long lost friend
And American honey
And American honey
And shoot down fear with the other hand
And she's the softest place to land
The strength I need to get through every day
So if anybody thinks I'm a hero
When they watch me walk right into the flames
I'm just marching to the sound of her heartbeat
And she knows that better than anyone
I know she's my loaded gun
So if anybody thinks I'm a hero
When they watch me walk right into the flames
I'm just marching to the sound of her heartbeat

All my girls just keep on blowin' up my phone
Do what you gotta do to forget his name
Now there’s only one thing left for me to do
Slip on my favorite dress and sky-high leather boots
Check the mirror one last time
And kiss the past goodbye
What I’m really needin' now
Is a double shot of Crown
Chase that disco ball around
‘Til I don’t remember
Go until they cut me off
Wanna get a little lost
‘Til the party and the music and the truth collide
Bring it ‘til his memory fades away
Hey bartender
Tonight I’ll let a stranger pull me on the floor
Spin me 'round and let him buy a couple more
But before it goes too far
I’ll let him down easy
'Cause tonight it’s all about dancin' with my girls to the DJ
Put that song on replay

I’m comin' in hot
Hey bartender

Hey bartender
Mighta drank too much wine
Mighta said somethin' that
I just can't take back
Always push till you cry
And I just don't know why
Tell me there's some way to turn around
On this way to goodbye
'Cause I'm comin' back
Back to my senses
I'm comin' back
Like holy redemption
I'm comin' back to the man that I was
Be patient with my love

Don't give up
Just be patient with my love
'Cause I'm comin' back to love
I'm comin' back to love
Oh-oh-oh
Be patient with my love
Blowin' stop signs and cigarette smoke
Just some bad boys and some good girls
Yeah  we had big love in a small town
What I'd give just to get a little bit back now
Yeah  we fell in just as fast as we fell out
We were too young to settle down and a big love in a small town
In a small town  yeah
We were Thunderbirds and Pontiac wild
Flyin' in your front seat  at least for a little while
Our love was drowned out by real life?
Yeah  we had big love in a small town
What I'd give just to get a little bit back now
Yeah  we fell in just as fast as we fell out

Yeah  we fell in just as fast as we fell out
We were too young to settle down  always dead set on getting out
Ain't that the thing about big love in a small town?
Along the way
Have left me with these walls and these scars
That won't go away
And opening up has always been the hardest thing
Until you came
This feelin' I'm feelin' is something I've never known
And I just can't take my eyes off you
And I just can't take my eyes off you
I love when you tell me that I'm pretty
When I just wake up
And I love how you tease me when I'm moody
But it's never too much
You climbed my walls
This feelin' I'm feelin' is something I've never known

 we don't need a high-rise skyline view from a window
 we ain't drippin' in diamonds
 it's been a bumpy road
 pedal hard
 you can walk instead of run
 you'll never be alone
 don't be afraid
 you can walk instead of run
 you'll never be alone
 you can walk instead of run
 you'll never be alone
 you can walk instead of run
Like a broken whisky bottle in an alley
You should've  but you wouldn't leave without me
You took me home
We were wild ones
Burning like that backseat back in '08
And everybody said they wouldn't do it
But they were wrong
You
You were reckless on that day you took my hand
But you  you could see right through the boy and see a man
And here I stand
Thank God for you
Thank God for us
Thank God for crazy love
Ain't it funny
How a couple silly kids could see forever?
And looking back  we shouldn't be together
But here we are

Thank God above
We never gave up
Beneath that moon that was really a disco ball
I can still feel my head on your shoulder
And hoping that song would never be over
I haven't seen you in ages
Sometimes I find myself
Wondering where you are
And beautiful
And dancing away with my heart
I brushed your curls back so I could see your eyes
And the way you moved me was like you were reading my mind
I can still feel you lean in to kiss me
I can't help but wonder if you ever miss me
I haven't seen you in ages
Sometimes I find myself
Wondering where you are

Store front mannequins sleeping in the lights
We used to smoke while we were jay-walking
Like it was your birthday every other Saturday night
Knew the bands so we never payed our cover
Wrote our names on the bathroom tiles
We never dressed to impress all the others
They would let us in on our laid back kinda style
But boy  you know it's been a while
And I don't know why you don't take me downtown
Like you got anywhere better to be
You talk it up and give me the go 'round  'round
Like a good time tease
I'm only counting on your cancellation
When I should be counting on you at my door
Did you forget about how we went around?
I don't know why you don't take me downtown anymore
Oh  anymore
I got some platforms sitting in the corner
They wanna stroll on a city sidewalk
I got a dress that'll show a little uh-uh
But you ain't getting uh-uh
If you don't come pick me up (Damn)
Show me off (Wow)

Never hears a no
Everything you want is never what you need
Mirrors and the smoke
Put another spin on the rehab  rehab
Whole world's waiting on a comeback
Welcome to the show
Watch it all fade to black
Damn  she's famous
Everybody knows what her name is
Kinda breaks your heart when you think about
Everything she gave and the life they stole away
But you can't blame her
Everybody's drawn to the danger
Looking through the lens of make believe

Lord knows you're in my heart
Even when I close my eyes
You are golden
Precious as a prayer flying up through the air
While the rain is falling
Golden  timeless as a kiss
Baby  I don't wanna miss another perfect moment
To tell you  how you make me feel
The day you strolled in  my heart was stolen
'Cause you are golden
Smallest parts of who you are
Are everything to me

To the way you love on me

You'll be the hand I'm holding
When the heavens open
(Oh  oh  oh)
Gonna find us a couple of glasses
Gonna pour us a bottle of wine
There ain't no better way to get this
Long week behind us
I put my dancing dress on
Just let the record spin
We're gonna hit this night like we might live
Forever and ever  amen
This world could throw me anything with you by my side
It's a good  good  good time to be alive
Come on now (Oh  oh  oh)
(Oh  oh  oh)
No doubt you look so pretty
Like that when your hair falls down

Is made of nights like these

Ooh-ooh (Oh  oh  oh)
Don't need nobody's help  zipping up my own dress
Sometimes the word alone  sounds like a sad song
But why's it gotta be  'cause what I really need is a reset
And a deep breath  yeah
I think it's time to take a heart break  out late
Solo on a Saturday night
Going out without a plus one  I'm done
Falling over pickup lines
I'm single for the summer  I won't rebound
One lover to another  or be tied down
'Til I'm sleeping like a queen in a California king I made (I made  I made)
I think it's time to take a heart break
I think it's time to take a heart break
It's just a little phase  give me a little space
You might see through it  but I'm putting on a poker face
I think it's time to take a heart break  out late
Solo on a Saturday night
Going out without a plus one  I'm done
Falling over pickup lines
I'm single for the summer  I won't rebound

Cell phone calls
Talk radio screams at me
Through my tinted window I see
A little girl
A rust red minivan
She's got chocolate on her face
Got little hands
And she waves at me
Good to see you my old friend
Broken like I'm never gonna heal
Every day I drive by
A little white church
It's got these little white crosses
Like angels in the yard
Maybe I should stop on in
Say a prayer
Maybe talk to God
Like he is there
Good to see you my old friend
And broken like I'm never gonna heal
Sometimes I forget what living's for
And I hear my life through my front door
Hello world
Hello world
All the empty disappears
I remember why I'm here
Just surrender and believe
I fall down on my knees
Hello world
And I guess I'm the guy who you were waiting on me all along
You feel like home
You're the steady through whatever
The shelter from the storm
You feel like home
You're the promise of forever
The place where I belong
You feel like home
Day by day and brick by brick we're building
Something real and something strong
You feel like home
You're the steady through whatever
The shelter from the storm

Like a lighthouse when I'm lost at sea
Then I'll always find an excuse
Ignite a spark I can't undo
It always starts out simple like a conversation
If you catch my eye across a crowded room
I'll fall into the atmosphere surrounding you
If you pull me close just to disappear
The chances are I'd wait for you a thousand years
If you're reckless with your love just to take it back
You could hurt somebody like that
You're a carnival on a summer night
Gone too soon every time
Than the wasteland you leave behind
If you catch my eye across a crowded room
I'll fall into the atmosphere surrounding you
If you pull me close just to disappear
The chances are I'd wait for you a thousand years

You could hurt somebody like that

Sittin' there with you by the river
We danced in the headlights
And fell for the first time
I remember telling you I loved you
The northern star rising above you
Love comes in circles
And love takes its own time
I never knew another love timeless and true
Through the years I just kept on believing
There had to be a plan or a reason
But Heaven was silent and life just kept moving on
'Till my heart knew the moment was gone

I never knew another love timeless and true
I run from prejudice
I run from pessimists
But I run too late
I run my life
Or is it running me?
Run from my past
I run too fast
When lies become the truth
That's when I run to you
This world keeps spinning faster
And when it all starts comin' undone
I run to you
We run on fumes
Your life and mine
Like the sands of time
Slipping right on through

Run to you
 we were restless  just two clueless kids
 what I know now
 three rows to the left
 but we never even met
 what I know now
 once in a while
 and throws you a smile
 leaves every scar
 and sings to your heart
 what I know now
 back seat of my car
 I took it way too far
 what I know now
 'cause love only comes  once in a while
 and throws you a smile
 leaves every scar
 and sings to your heart
 what I know now
 I used up a lot of chances
 I'm gonna make it last
 once in a while
 and throws you a smile
 leaves every scar
 and sings to your heart
 what I know now
 if I knew then  what I know now
It's hard to fight these feelings when it feels so hard to breathe
I'm caught up in this moment
I'm caught up in your smile
I've never opened up to anyone
So hard to hold back when I'm holding you in my arms
But we don't need to rush this
Let's just take it slow
Just a kiss on your lips in the moonlight
Just a touch of the fire burning so bright
Just a shot in the dark that you just might
Be the one I've been waiting for my whole life
I know that if we give this a little time
It'll only bring us closer to the love we wanna find
It's never felt so real

But you'll be in my dreams
Tonight

Tonight
Just a kiss on your lips in the moonlight
Just a touch of the fire burning so bright
I don't wanna push too far
Just a shot in the dark that you just might
Be the one I've been waiting for my whole life
Let's do this right with just a kiss goodnight
With a kiss goodnight
Fears will fly if you let them
Patterned-leather dress  shoes on a baby's feet
Is he too young to tell him
People come and gather round
Only love can lift us now
We find our common thread
Over tear-stained ground
Raise our voices up  lay our flowers down
White knuckles  cotton beads on a rosary
Hoping one has an answer
You hung it on the mirror only as a novelty
But now you squeeze it 'til your hands hurt
People come and gather round
Only love can lift us now
We find our common thread
Over tear-stained ground
Raise our voices up  lay our flowers down
Oh  lay 'em down

Comes out of nowhere  hits so hard I can hardly breathe
In the middle of the night when I need sleep
You see  that's the thing about envy
Yeah  the thing about angry and me
I'm strong  then I'm down on my knees
I scream when the silence should speak
You see  that's the thing about angry
But love lifts you up
I know it's hard sometimes to see it  but it does
The one and only feeling you can trust
Let it be love
Let it be love
You see  the thing about humility and me
I put myself a little higher than I should be
Forget I'm just one drop in a big ol' sea

And all the second chances you keep taking

Let it be first (Let it be first)  let it be us

It might take some time to get back what is gone
But I'm moving on and you don't haunt my dreams
Well  I heard the news that you were back in town
Just passing through to claim your lost and found
But I'm over you and there ain't nothing there
That you could say or do to take what you did back
Well  you got nerve to waltz right in
And think what's mine is yours again
'Cause I've been doing fine without you
Forgetting all the love we once knew
But now you say you've changed your thinking
But I ain't got a heart for breaking
So go and pick your bags up off my floor
Oh  'cause love don't live here anymore
Oh  no

And try to justify everything you did
Oh  and I've been down this road
Too many times with you
I think it's best you go
Well  I got one thing left to say
Is you can lay in the bed you've made
'Cause I've been doing fine without you
Forgetting all the love we once knew
Oh  should've known
Now you say you've changed your thinking
But I ain't got a heart for breaking
So go and pick your bags up off my floor
Oh  'cause love don't live here anymore
Oh  no
That love don't live here anymore
You don't live here anymore
Love don't live here anymore
Since you walked out of my door
Love don't live here
Love don't live here  girl
My pair of boots and your Converse shoes kicked off by the front door
Sippin' cheap tequila on the front porch
Somethin' from the '90s on the dashboard dial
A memory can't get you outside of your mama's house
Midnight rain on a Chevy hood
A memory can't hold you in a Sarasota sunrise
Even though you wish it would
All it's gonna do is make you lose sleep at night
Wake up and leave you in the past
Can't love you back
It kills my vice and it kills the mood
And I should be movin' on

Can't love you back (Woah)
A memory can't tell you how you'll make her feel
In the moonlight glow of a shotgun seat
A memory can't pick out a diamond ring
And say I do under an old oak tree
All it's gonna do is make you lose sleep at night
Wake up and leave you in the past
Can't love you back (Woah)
Can't love you back (Oh)
I like diamond rings
I like Malibu beach sights
Dressed up out there in the city
Sitting high up on a hill
Shows his love with dollar bills
Don't need a fancy fast car to come and pick up my heart
And ride off into the blue
I just need you
I just need you
I want your love

Don't need a fancy fast car to come and pick up my heart
And ride off into the blue
I just need you
 yeah  it's me  just been thinking about everything tonight
 I just miss you so much
 it happens all the time
 I'm all alone and I need you now
 but I've lost all control and I need you now
 it happens all the time
 I'm a little drunk and I need you now
 but I've lost all control and I need you now
 oh
 I'm all alone and I need you now
 but I'm a little drunk and I need you now
Trouble neglect you
And heaven accept you
When it's time to go home
May you always have plenty
Your glass never empty
And know in your belly
You're never alone
May your tears come from laughing
You find friends worth having
With every year passing
They mean more than gold
May you win and stay humble
Smile more than grumble
And know when you stumble
You're never alone
I'll be in every beat of your heart
When you face the unknown
Wherever you fly this isn't goodbye
My love will follow you
Stay with you
As much as I want it
I'm not gonna promise
That cold winds won't blow
So when hard times have found you
And your fears surround you
Wrap my love around you
You're never alone
May the angels protect you
Trouble neglect you
And heaven accept you
When it's time to go home
And when hard times have found you
And your fears surround you
Wrap my love around you
You're never alone
And feel like they're worlds away?
I can see your sad story eyes
So how do you have no words to say?
All I want is to fall in deeper
Than I've ever been
Why won't you let me?
So much beauty at my feet
All I wanna do is swim
But the waves keep crashin' in
I'm so tired of the shore
You're an ocean beautiful and blue
I wanna swim in you
Like a lighthouse I've been shinin' bright
Through the dark for the both of us
And I've done it outta love is not enough
And I don't wanna find out
How much lonely I can take before you lose me

I can't let it go
From moments in your arms
But they come back again
So much beauty at my feet
All I wanna do is swim
But the waves keep crashin' in
I'm so tired of the shore
You're an ocean beautiful and blue
I could fall in love
I could fall in love with you
In this dark so dense
We talk so soft
The way young lovers do
The days last sight turns to cool nights breeze
And this love hangs thick like these willow leaves
I've hid myself away from this
But your silhouette is the Judas kiss
On a night like this
The moon sits still
And the stars are watching too
The way you move is a lullaby
And I could fall (I could fall) in love with you
The days last sight turns to cool nights breeze
And this love hangs thick like these willow leaves

Hmm
On a night like this
I could fall in love
You wear your smile like a summer sky
Just shining down on me and you
I swear your heart is a free bird
On a lazy Sunday afternoon
I love the way that you were up for anything
Never worried 'bout what people say
What we got is
Just like driving on an open highway
Never knowing what we're gonna find
Skipping rocks and leaving footprints
Down along the riverbank
You get me laughing with those funny faces
You somehow always know just what to say
What we got is

And one of you laughin' at me catching my first fish
One on Valentine's Day
With the mariachi band at our favorite place
The camera doesn't show the way it hurt
There's one on my phone that I can't erase (One on my phone)
But you'd never know by the smile on my face
The last one before Goodbye
The camera doesn't show the way it hurt

Of all the hell that we went through

To put myself in this position
Down a road that leads nowhere
Somewhere between lovers and just friends
Saw you parked outside the party
I knew you'd be by the bar
I wish there was a heart I could borrow just 'til tomorrow
'Cause this is always how it starts
Gonna hold you in my arms
Throw shadows in the dark
I'll let you in against my better judgement
With somebody else's heart
Oh
I wish I could feel the falling
But someone else could hit the ground
Wanna feel the buzz of getting closer without the hangover
But I could use another round

 it's true
 it can cut you deep
 take a deep breath
Heading straight through the red lights where the midnight and heartbreak meet
You're a bird in flight to a house in flames
Where even angels might not go
Some stars have a long glow
Let it pull you like a song you know
It might look like a dream come true
But it only leads you straight into
The thing that wrecks you
You're a deer in the headlights and I'm driving as fast as I can (As fast as I can)
Where even angels might not go
And your star's got a lonely glow
And I pull you like a song you know
We might look like a dream come true
But it only leads you straight into
The thing that wrecks you (Wrecks you)

You're a passing car on a one way street
We drove past the Texaco
With an empty tank and no loose change
You swore we'd make it home
It's a little fuzzy 'cause
I was caught up in your eyes
Your touch
The rush
When you showed up late on New Year's Eve
And you tried to hold my hand
You told me that you'd met someone
And I said  I understand
It's hard not to fall apart
With a midnight broken heart
So I cried
But that was the last time
'Cause I don't think about you and me
What we used to be
Every memory anymore
Forgot about what we went through
'Cause I'm bulletproof
Oh  I bet you think I do

The place where I first saw your face
And you bought me a drink
And when we talked 'til 2AM
About every single dream
Well  now it's just a bar
In a beat up parking lot
I see
Yeah  that's all it is to me
'Cause I don't think about you and me
What we used to be
Every memory anymore
Forgot about what we went through
'Cause I'm bulletproof
Oh  I bet you think I do
No  I don't think about you
Well  maybe only when I'm lonely or when I'm drinking
But when I see you I'm always gonna play it cool
'Cause I don't think about you and me
What we used to be
Every memory anymore
'Cause I don't think about you and me
What we used to be
Every memory anymore
Forgot about what we went through
My heart is bulletproof
Oh  I bet you think I do
This city never looked so good
This city never looked so
This city never looked so good
White noise ringing on the boulevard
Same cover band in the same old bar
Midnight smoke floatin' in the air
A million faces everywhere
But tonight (Tonight)
It feels like just you and me
Street lights on fire
Couldn't get much higher
This city never looked so good the way it's lookin' so good on you
Your hands in my jacket
Caught up in this magic

And a call that never came
Something in you must have changed
I cried for so long
Now I know just what went wrong
I guess I wanted you more

Of the things we wanted out of life (Out of life)

Your lips keep trying to speak
But you just can't find the words
Well  I had this dream once
I held it in my head
She was the purest beauty
But not the common kind
She had a way about her
That made you feel alive
And for a moment
We made the world stand still
Yeah  we owned the night
You had me dim the lights
You danced just like a child
The wine spilled on your dress
And all you did was smile
Yeah  it was perfect
And I hold it in my mind

Oh  yeah
When the summer rolls around
And the sun starts sinking down
I still remember you
Oh  I remember you
And I wonder where you are
Are you looking at those same stars again?
Do you remember when?
We woke under a blanket
All tangled up in skin
Not knowing in that moment
We'd never speak again
But it was perfect
I never will forget
When we owned the night
Yeah  we owned the night
Yeah
Oh-woah-oh
Oh-woah-oh
Oh-woah-oh
Throws you right back to a different time
Puts your lighter up
Singin' loud and out of tune
It puts a little sound in an empty space
It can make you dance and make you cry
Make you wanna give it one more try
And break some rules
It'll make you give your heart and get it back
Change your mind just like that
When it's like every single line was written just for you
Ain't it crazy what a song can do?
Makes you make a call at 4 AM
Makеs you say you want him all over again
It's like you knew it all along
Ain't it crazy that a song

Ain't it crazy what a song can do? (Whoa)
Crazy what a song can do
Feel that pounding in your chest
Bring you to your knees right there in that old church pew
Change your mind just like that
And most of all it's what brought me here to you
Crazy what a song can do
But to movin' on is the hardest part
It comes in waves  the letting go
But the memory fades  everybody knows
Everybody knows
What if I'm tryin'  but then I close my eyes
And then I'm right back  lost in that last goodbye?
And what if time doesn't do what it's supposed to do?
What if I never get over you?
Maybe months go by  maybe years from now
And I meet someone and it's workin' out
Every now and then  he can see right through
'Cause when I look at him
Yeah  all I see is you
What if I'm tryin'  but then I close my eyes
And then I'm right back  lost in that last goodbye?
And what if time doesn't do what it's supposed to do?

What if I gave you (What if I gave you) everything I got?
What if your love was my one and only shot?
What if I end up with nothing to compare it to
What if I never get over? Oh  if I never get over

Oh  what if I never get over?
Toys on the front lawn
Disney World trip next summer
Used kit for our little air-drummer
Food on the table
Brand new cradle
For the angel that's coming in a minute
This house and everybody in it
Got a heartache to go with it
Take a look at our little paradise
Ain't nothing out there like this
And it kills me that I gotta go
Couldn't do it if I didn't know
That every time I'm walking out that door
You know what I'm leaving for

When I'm out there

And getting that small town to sing
On that last turn home
I can hardly wait

Ain't nothing out there like this
And it kills me that I gotta go
Couldn't do it if I didn't know
That every time I'm walking out that door
Got a heartache to go with it
While we still got time
Take a look at our little paradise
And it kills me that I gotta go
Couldn't do it if I didn't know
You know that this heart of mine is yours
(You know that this heart is yours)
You know what I'm leaving for
 I know I am
 I swear
 after all this time
 there's gonna be some ups and downs
 I'm fine
 I know
 don't let go
 baby
 whoa
 oh
 oh
If I hadn't spent that summer
Waiting tables in my hometown?
If I hadn't spilled your drink
And you never asked me out
Would I even know the magic
Of something meant to be
Where would I be without your love
And what would I do if I woke up
One day and found out this was all a dream?
Where would I be without your soul?
Reminding me I'm always home
As long as I can hear your melody
God only knows
If you never found me
Wherе would I be?
Where would I bе
If I never been to Georgia
Played that bar on Athens street?
One day on my own

Where would I be?
Hopin' it will change
And I keep wishing for a brand-new body
That I didn't have to blame
Like tryna build a church out of all my hurt
When it really needs grace
I gave all my time to nothin'
I focused on who I was not who I'm becomin'
My eyes couldn't look away
I didn't even realize I worshiped what I hate
Half a bottle of red just before bed
Is the only way I dream
Before I rеally wake up
The first thing I touch is a button on a screen
I'm guilty of stayin' and just chеckin' out
On what's in front of me

Go ahead and dance if you want to
Order up another round

 in the sand  in the back of a bar
 breaking necks
 heads turning all day when they see you with me
 Hey  who that there with the shades?

 so fresh  so fine
 got everybody watching you like cameras in Hollywood
