lyrics
"And then the devil took your memory
And if you fell to your death today
I hope that Heaven is your restin' place
I heard the doctors put your chest in pain
But then that could've been the medicine
And now you're lyin' in the bed again
It's not his fault he doesn't know your face
And you're not the only one
Although my grandma used to say
That he used to sing
I could look into your eyes until the sun comes up
Put your open lips on mine and slowly let them shut

And things were all good yesterday
But then the devil took your breath away
Stapled together with the strangers and a friend
It's not his fault he doesn't know your face
And you're not the only one
Although my grandma used to say
That he used to sing
I could look into your eyes until the sun comes up
Put your open lips on mine and slowly let them shut
And my father and all of my family
Rise from their seats to sing Hallelujah
And my brother and all of my family
Rise from their seats to sing Hallelujah
And my brother and all of my family
Rise from their seats to sing Hallelujah
And my father and all of my family (Ah)
Rise from their seats to sing Hallelujah
(Ah-ooh)
Stop the clocks  it's amazing
You should see the way the light dances off your hair
Saturday morning is fading
The sun's reflected by the coffee in your hand
My eyes are caught in your gaze all over again
We were love-drunk  waiting on a miracle
Tryna find ourselves in the winter snow
So alone in love like the world had disappeared
Oh  I won't be silent and I won't let go
I will hold on tighter 'til the afterglow
And we'll burn so bright 'til the darkness softly clears
Oh  I will hold on to the afterglow
Oh  I will hold on to the afterglow
The weather outside's changing
The leaves are buried under six inches of white
The radio is playing Iron & Wine
This is a new dimension
This is a level where we're losing track of time
I'm holding nothing against it  except you and I

Ooh  ooh
Every time you come around  you know I can't say no
Every time the sun goes down  I let you take control
I can feel the paradise before my world implodes
And tonight had something wonderful
My bad habits lead to late nights endin' alone
Conversations with a stranger I barely know
Swearin' this'll be the last  but it probably won't
I got nothin' left to lose  or use  or do
My bad habits lead to wide eyes starin' at space
And I know I lose control of the things that I say
Yeah  I was lookin' for a way out  now I can't escape
Nothin' happens after two  it's truе  it's true

I've got two left feet and a bottle of red wine
Making me feel like the beat and the bassline
Are in my blood  both hands up on her waistline
Get on up  baby  dance to the rhythm of the music
Don't care what the DJ chooses
Get lost in the rhythm of me
Place don't close until we wanna leave it
And you and I  we're flying on an aeroplane tonight
We're going somewhere where the sun is shining bright
Just close your eyes
And let's pretend we're dancing in the street
In Barcelona
Barcelona
Barcelona
Barcelona
I fell in love with the sparkle in the moonlight
Reflected in your beautiful eyes
I guess that is destiny doing it right
And dance like they do in the Mediterranean
Spin you around me again and again  and
You're like something that God has sent me
I want you  baby  solamente

L.A. on a Saturday night in the summer
Sundown and they all come out
Lamborghinis and their rented Hummers
The party's on  so they're headin' downtown ('Round here)
Everybody's lookin' for a come up
And they wanna know what you're about
Me in the middle with the one I love and
We're just tryna figure everything out
We don't fit in well 'cause we are just ourselves
I could use some help gettin' out of this conversation  yeah
You look stunning  dear  so don't ask that question here
This is my only fear: that we become
Beautiful people
Drop top  designer clothes
Front row at fashion shows

Prenups and broken homes
Surrounded  but still alone

My hands are scarred from nights before
And my hair is thin and falling out of all the wrong places
I am a little insecure
My eyes are crossed  but they're still blue
I bite my nails and tell the truth
My skin is inked  but faded too
But she loves me  she loves me
Why the hell does she love me
When she could have anyone else?
Why the hell do you love me?
'Cause I don't even love myself
Baby  the best part of me is you
And lately  everything's making sense too
I overthink and still forget
I lose my phone and place my bets
And I never catch the train on time
Always thirty minutes behind
Your worries ain't seen nothin' yet

I've been spinnin' now for time
Couple women by my side
I got sinnin' on my mind
Sippin' on red wine
I've been sittin' here for ages
Rippin' out the pages
How'd I get so faded?

One or two could free my mind

I was runnin' from my brother and his friends
And tasted the sweet perfume of the mountain grass I rolled down
I was younger then  take me back to when I
Found my heart and broke it here
Made friends and lost them through the years
And I've not seen the roaring fields in so long  I know I've grown
But I can't wait to go home
I'm on my way
Drivin' at ninety down those country lanes
Singin' to Tiny Dancer
And I miss the way you make me feel and it's real
We watched the sunset over the castle on the hill
Fifteen years old and smoking hand-rolled cigarettes
Runnin' from the law through the backfields and gettin' drunk with my friends
Had my first kiss on a Friday night  I don't reckon that I did it right
But I was younger then  take me back to when
We found weekend jobs  when we got paid
We'd buy cheap spirits and drink them straight
But I can't wait to go home

One friend left to sell clothes
One works down by the coast
One had two kids but lives alone
One's brother overdosed
One's already on his second wife
One's just barely gettin' by
But these people raised me
And I can't wait to go home
And I'm on my way  I still remember
These old country lanes
When we did not know the answers
And I miss the way you make me feel and it's real

I could fall or I could fly

And I could live  I could die
Hangin' on the words you say
And I've been known to give my all
And jumpin' in harder than
Ten thousand rocks on the lake
So don't call me baby
Unless you mean it
And don't tell me you need me
If you don't believe it
So let me know the truth
Before I dive right into you
You're a mystery
I have travelled the world
And there's no other girl like you  no one

Do you have a tendency to lead some people on?

 I was never looking for a friend

 babe

 babe
 I only wanna see her
 a text message was the only way to reach her

 the way that things played out
 how I was confused about

 babe
 I already told ya
 that's all
 of course
 God knows I'm singin'
 babe

 babe
 babe
 she knows
Learned to sing inside the Lord's house  but stopped the age of nine
I forget when I get awards now the wave I had to ride
The paving stones I played upon that kept me on the grind
So blame it on the pain that blessed me with the life
Friends and family filled with envy when they should be filled with pride
And when the world's against me is when I really come alive
And every day that Satan tempts me  I try to take it in my stride
You know that I've got whisky with white lies and smoke in my lungs
I think life has got to the point I know without it's no fun
I need to get in the right mind and clear myself up
Instead  I look in the mirror questionin' what I've become
Guess it's a stereotypical day for someone like me
Without a nine-to-five job or a uni degree
To be caught up in the trappings of the industry
Show me the locked doors  I'll find another use for the key
And you'll see
I'm well aware of certain things that can destroy a man like me
Another one to take the sting away
Save your lovin' arms for a rainy day
And I'll find comfort in my pain eraser

I chased the pictured perfect life  I think they painted it wrong
I think that money is the root of all evil and fame is hell
Relationships and hearts you fixed  they break as well
And ain't nobody wanna see you down in the dumps
Please  know that I'm not tryna preach like I'm Reverend Run
I beg you  don't be disappointed with the man I've become
Have conversations with my father on the A14
Age twelve  tellin' me I've gotta chase those dreams
With my beaten small guitar  wearing the same old jeans
Wembley Stadium crowd's two hundred and forty thou'
I may have grown up  but I hope that Damian's proud
And to the next generation  inspiration's allowed
The world may be filled with hate  but keep erasin' it now
Somehow
I'm well aware of certain things that will befall a man like me
Another one to take the sting away
Save your lovin' arms for a rainy day

I guess you know I've been away
But where I'm heading  who knows?

And I'll find comfort in my pain eraser

But how can I help myself?
Been inside for most this year
Dealin' with the cards life dealt
I'm still holdin' back these tears
While my friends are somewhere else
I pictured this year a little bit different when it hit February
Every song reminds me you're gone and I feel thе lump form in my throat
'Cause I'm here alonе
Just dancin' with my eyes closed
And time is movin' so slow
And I don't know what else that I can do

But she fell in love with an English man
Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand
I met her on Grafton Street right outside of the bar
She shared a cigarette with me while her brother played the guitar
She got Arthur on the table with Johnny riding a shotgun
But she fell in love with an English man
Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand
With my pretty little Galway Girl
You're my pretty little Galway Girl
You know she beat me at darts and then she beat me at pool
And then she kissed me like there was nobody else in the room
As last orders were called was when she stood on the stool
After dancing the céili singing to trad tunes
I never heard Carrickfergus ever sung so sweet
A cappella in the bar using her feet for a beat

To finish some Doritos and another bottle of wine

About a Galway Girl and a perfect night
She played the fiddle in an Irish band
But she fell in love with an English man
Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand

I saw you in another's arm
Only a month we've been apart
You look happier
Saw you walk inside a bar
He said somethin' to make you laugh
I saw that both your smiles were twice as wide as ours
Ain't nobody hurt you like I hurt you
But ain't nobody love you like I do
If you're movin' on with someone new
My friends told me one day I'll feel it too
But I know I was happier with you
Sat in the corner of the room
Everything's reminding me of you

But if he breaks your heart like lovers do
Should see the way she holds me when the lights go low
Shakes my soul like a pothole every time
Took my heart upon a one-way trip
Guess she went wanderin' off with it
And unlike most women I know
This one will bring it back whole
I feel safe when you're holdin' me near
Love the way that you conquer your fear
You know hearts don't break around here
She is the river flow in Orwell
Fields and trees and her smell fill my lungs
Spend my summertime beside her
She is the flint that sparks the lighter

Keep careful watch of my brothers' souls
And should the sky be filled with fire and smoke
Keep watching over Durin's sons
If this is to end in fire  then we should all burn together
Watch the flames climb high into the night
Watch the flames burn auburn on the mountainside high
And if we should die tonight  we should all die together
Raise a glass of wine for the last time
Watch the flames burn auburn on the mountainside
Desolation comes upon the sky
Now  I see fire inside the mountain
I see fire burnin' the trees
And I see fire hollowin' souls
I see fire  blood in the breeze
And I hope that you'll remember me

And with that shadow upon the ground  I hear my people screamin' out
Now  I see fire inside the mountains
I see fire burnin' the trees
I see fire hollowin' souls
I see fire  blood in the breeze
I see fire (Oh  you know I saw a city burnin' out)
And I see fire (Feel the heat upon my skin)

Searching for a sweet surrender  but this is not the end
I can't work it out  how?
Going through the motions  going through us
And  oh  I've known it for the longest time
And all of my hopes  all of my words
Are all over written on the signs
When you're on my road walkin' me home
See the flames inside my eyes
It burns so bright  I wanna feel your love  no
Easy  baby  maybe I'm a liar
But for tonight  I wanna fall in love
And put your faith in my stomach

Drinking to suppress devotion with fingers intertwined

Your lips pressed to my neck
I'm falling for your eyes
But they don't know me yet
And with a feeling I'll forget  I'm in love now
Kiss me like you wanna be loved
You wanna be loved
You wanna be loved
This feels like falling in love
We're falling in love
We're falling in love
Settle down with me
And I'll be your safety
You'll be my lady
I was made to keep your body warm
But I'm cold as the wind blows
So hold me in your arms
Oh  no

My three words have two meanings
But there's one thing on my mind
And it's dark in a cold December
But I've got you to keep me warm
And I'll keep you sheltered from the storm that's raging on now
I'll pick you up when you're gettin' down
And out of all these things I've done
I think I love you better now
I'll do it all for you in time
And out of all these things I've done

I'm gonna paint you by numbers
And colour you in
And put you on a wall

When I met the woman I would call my own
Twenty-two grand kids now growing old
In that house that your brother bought ya
On the summer day when I proposed
I made that wedding ring from dentist gold
You can't marry my daughter
She and I went on the run
Don't care about religion
I'm gonna marry the woman I love
Down by the Wexford border
She was Nancy Mulligan
And I was William Sheeran
She took my name and then we were one
Down by the Wexford border
And she was working on a soldier's ward
Never had I seen such beauty before
The moment that I saw her
Nancy was my yellow rose
And we got married wearing borrowed clothes
We got eight children now growing old
Five sons and three daughters

She took my name and then we were one
Down by the Wexford border
From her snow white streak in her jet black hair
Over sixty years I've been loving her
Now we're sat by the fire in our old armchairs
From a farm boy born near Belfast town
I never worried 'bout the king and crown
'Cause I found my heart upon the southern ground
She and I went on the run
Don't care about religion
I'm gonna marry the woman I love
Down by the Wexford border
She was Nancy Mulligan
And I was William Sheeran
She took my name and then we were one
I heard he spent five hundred pounds on jeans
Goes to the gym at least six times a week
Wears boat shoes with no socks on his feet
And I hear he's on a new diet and watches what he eats
He's got his eyebrows plucked and his arsehole bleached
Owns every single Ministry CD
Tribal tattoos and he don't know what it means
Still lookin' at your Instagram and I'll be creepin' a lil'
I'll be tryin' not to double tap from way back
'Cause I know that's where the trouble's at
Let me remind you of the days when
You used to hold my hand
And when we sipped champagne out of cider cans
Just a young boy tryin' to be loved
So let me give it to ya
I don't wanna know about your new man
'Cause if it was meant to be
You wouldn't be callin' me up tryin' to
'Cause I'm positive that he don't wanna know about me
I don't wanna know about your new man

And I could play a guitar just like ringin' a bell
Could you have been my part-time lover to me listenin' to Stevie Wonder?
Under the covers where we used to lay
And Re: Stacks is what the speakers played
I'd be on tour almost every day
Gettin' high as two kites when we needed to breathe
We used each other's air just for the people to see
And stay up all night like when we needed to sleep
We go anywhere our minds would take us
And I'll say you are beautiful without your make-up
And you don’t even need to worry 'bout your weight 'cause
We can all be loved the way that God made us
And time's the only reason that we could break up
'Cause you would always tell me I'm away too much
Distance is relative to the time that it takes

With drawstrings pulled tight to keep your face from the cold
Taking day trips to the local where we'd eat on our own
Back to the burrow with all the Celtics
I understand but I can’t help it
I put my job over everything 'cept my family and friends
But you'll be in between forever so I guess we'll have to take a step back
Overlook the situation
'Cause mixing business and feelings will only lead to complications
And I'm not saying we should be takin' a break
Just re-evaluate quick before we make a mistake and it’s too late
So we can either deal with the pain or wait to get on a plane
Love will come and love will go
But you can make it on your own
People grow and fall apart
But you can mend your broken heart

Who asks for your hand
'Cause you're waitin' for me
And I know you're gonna be away a while
But I've got no plans at all to leave
And would you take away my hopes and dreams?
All my senses come to life
While I'm stumblin' home as drunk as I
Have ever been and I'll never leave again
'Cause you are the only one
And all my friends have gone to find
Another place to let their hearts collide
Just promise me you'll always be a friend

Lovin' can hurt sometimes
But it's the only thing that I know
And when it gets hard
You know it can get hard sometimes
It is the only thing that makes us feel alive
We keep this love in a photograph
We made these memories for ourselves
Where our eyes are never closin'
Hearts are never broken
And time's forever frozen still
So you can keep me
Inside the pocket of your ripped jeans
Holdin' me closer till our eyes meet
You won't ever be alone
Wait for me to come home
Lovin' can heal
Lovin' can mend your soul
I swear it will get easier
Remember that with every piece of ya

Under the lamppost back on Sixth Street
Hearin' you whisper through the phone
Grew up 10 miles from the town of Ipswich
Wanted to make it big  I wished it to existence
I never was a sick kid  always dismissed quick
Stick to singing  stop rappin' like it's Christmas
And if you're talkin' money  then my conversation's shiftin'
My dreams are bigger than just bein' on the rich list
Might be insanity  but people call it gifted
My face is goin' numb from the shit this stuff is mixed with
Watch how the lyrics in the songs might get twisted
My wife wears red  but looks better without the lipstick
I'm a private guy and you know nothin' 'bout my business
And if I had my 15 minutes  I must have missed 'em
20 years old is when I came in the game
And now it's eight years on and you remember the name
But it's ironic how you people thought I'd never be great
I like my shows open-air  Tokyo to Delaware
Put your phones in the air if you wanna be rocked
You know I want way more than I already got
Give me a song with Eminem and 50 Cent in the club
You know it ain't my time to call it a day
I wanna crack on and I wanna be paid
But it's 'bout time you remember the name

Offered off my shoulder just for you to cry upon
Gave you constant shelter and a bed to keep you warm
It goes on and on
Life can get you down so I just numb the way it feels
I drown it with a drink and out-of-date prescription pills
No farewell

And only scars remain

Packed up the photo album Matthew had made
Memories of a life that's been loved
Took the get well soon cards and stuffed animals
Poured the old ginger beer down the sink
A heart that's broke is a heart that's been loved
So I'll sing Hallelujah
You were an angel in the shape of my mum
Spread your wings as you go
When God takes you back
Folded your nightgowns neatly in a case
John says he'd drive then put his hand on my cheek
And wiped a tear from the side of my face

You were an angel in the shape of my mum
You got to see the person I have become
Spread your wings and I know
That when God took you back
I've got a habit for spittin' quicker lyrics  you know
You'll find me rippin' the writtens out of the pages they sit in
I never want to get bitten 'cause plagiarism is hidden
Watch how I sit on the rhythm  prisoner with the vision
Signed to a label  but didn't listen to any criticism
Studio is a system and you could say that I'm driven
I'll never try to win you over like your stepfather
I'll do my own thing now and get respect after
And I'm avoidin' the 'caine like it was Get Carter
For four years  I never had a place to stay
But it's safe to say that it kept me grounded like a paperweight
I was Macy Gray  I tried to say goodbye and I choked
And went from sleepin' at a subway station
To sleepin' with a movie star and addin' to the population
Not my imagination  I don't wanna relax
Would it hurt your reputation if I put it on wax?

Come on and take it back for us

Tryna act like Jack Black when I bring it to school
I'll make a beat with my feet by just hittin' the loop
Bringing the lyrics to prove that I can fit in these shoes
I'll give you the truth through the vocal booth
And stars burst out on the scene like an Opal Fruit
They try to take aim like Beckham when he goes to shoot
But then again  that's what they're supposed to do
And I'm supposed to be calm  I tattooed the lyrics onto my arm
Whisperin'  Everything that happens is from now on
I'll be ready to start again by the end of the song
And still  they're claiming that I handle it wrong
But then  I've never had an enemy except the NME
But I'll be selling twice as many copies as their magazines will ever be
With only spectacles ahead of me and festival fees
Are healthier than a dalmatian on Pedigree
Singing for the masses  rubber dinghy rapids
I keep this rappin' a habit and keep on fashionin' magic
I'm battlin' for respect and I don't know if I'll have it
This song's from the heart  covered the planet
I'll take it back now
Come on and take it back for us
I'll take it back now
Now  I don't ever wanna be perfect
'Cause I'm a singer that you never wanna see shirtless
And I accept the fact that someone's gotta win worst-dressed
Taking my first steps into the scene  giving me focus
Puttin' on a brave face like Timothy Dalton
Considerin' a name change  thinkin' it was hopeless
Rhymin' over recordings  avoidin' tradition
'Cause every day  some lyrics and a melody could be written
Now  absence can make your heart ache
But drinking Absinthe can change your mind state
Vividly  need to let my liver be
And I'll say it again  livin' life on the edge with a closed handful of friends
It's good advice from the man who took his life on the road with me
And I hope to see him blowin' up globally
'Cause that's how it's supposed to be  I'm screamin' out vocally
It might seem totally impossible achievin' life's dreams  but
But I just write schemes
I'm never havin' a stylist giving me tight jeans
Madison Square Garden is where I might be  but more likely
You'll find me in the back room of a dive bar with my mates
Havin' a pint with McDaid  discussin' records we made
That's how we plan it out  it's time to take it back now
Come on and take it back for us
Come on and take it back for us

 when in Rome
 getting high
 but I never get twanged (Twanged)
 chat shit get banged (What?)
 it's sick how it fits in my hand (Hand)
 or neeky grime beef
 he moves when I speak
 he shoot a guy (Guy)
 they just want me to sing
 go straight to the pub
 traveled a million miles
 when in Rome (When in Rome)
 when I squeeze off this little pen of mine
 now I got Ed on grime
 man are aliens
 but
 I want flows
 That's just the way things go
 amazin' flows
 he'll be wrappin' it up
 getting high (Getting high)
 when in Rome (When in Rome)
I love your hair like that
The way it falls on the side of your neck
Down your shoulders and back
We are surrounded by all of these lies
And people who talk too much
You got the kind of look in your eyes
As if no one knows anything but us
Should this be the last thing I see?
I want you to know it's enough for me
'Cause all that you are is all that I'll ever need
I'm so in love
So in love
So in love
I'm so in love
You look so beautiful in this light
Your silhouette over me
The way it brings out the blue in your eyes
Is the Tenerife sea
And all of the voices surrounding us here
They just fade out when you take a breath
Just say the word and I will disappear
Into the wilderness

You look so wonderful in your dress
I love your hair like that
Breathin' in the snowflakes
Burnt lungs  sour taste
Light's gone  days end
Struggling to pay rent
Long nights  strange men
And they say
She's in the Class A Team
Stuck in her daydream
Been this way since eighteen
But lately  her face seems
Slowly sinking  wasting
Crumbling like pastries
And they scream
The worst things in life come free to us
'Cause we're just under the upper hand
And go mad for a couple grams
And she don't wanna go outside tonight
And in a pipe  she flies to the Motherland
Or sells love to another man
It's too cold outside
For angels to fly

Ripped gloves  raincoat
Tried to swim and stay afloat
Dry house  wet clothes
Loose change  banknotes
Weary-eyed  dry throat
Call girl  no phone

Been this way since eighteen

Slowly sinking  wasting
Crumbling like pastries

An angel will die
Covered in white
Closed eye and hopin' for a better life
This time  we'll fade out tonight
Straight down the line

I showed you my hand and you still let me win
And who was I to say that this was meant to be?
The road that was broken brought us together
And I know you could fall for a thousand kings
And hearts that would give you a diamond ring
The joker and the queen
I was upside down from the outside in
You came to the table and you went all in
With a single word and a gentle touch
You turned a moment into forever
And I know you could fall for a thousand kings
And hearts that could give you a diamond ring
The joker and the queen

And I know you could fall for a thousand kings
And hearts that would givе you a diamond ring

And I can't sweep you off of your feet
Will your mouth still remember the taste of my love?
Will your eyes still smile from your cheeks?
And I'm thinkin' 'bout how
People fall in love in mysterious ways
Maybe just the touch of a hand
And I just wanna tell you I am
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
Maybe we found love right where we are
When my hair's all but gone and my memory fades
And the crowds don't remember my name
I know you will still love me the same

People fall in love in mysterious ways
And maybe it's all part of a plan
Hoping that you'll understand
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
That maybe we found love right where we are
The only evidence that you'd been here before
And I don't get waves of missin' you anymore
They're more like tsunami tides in my eyes
Weeks pass in the blink of an eye
And I'm still drunk at the end of the night
I don't drink like everybody else
I do it to forget things about myself
Stumble and fall with the head spin I got
My mind's with you but my heart's just not
So am I close to you anymore if it's over
And there's no chance that we'll work it out?
That's why you and I
Ended over U-N-I
And I said that's fine
But you're the only one that knows I lied

Everybody said we'd be together forever
Break-up the love like LEGO now
Never wanna turn into another like you
But you live in your halls and I live in a tour bus
Like everything I say seems to always sound awkward
We were nervous on the surface
Pain is only relevant if it still hurts
I forget like an elephant or we can use a sedative
And go back to the day we fell in love just on our first kiss
So am I close to you anymore if it's over
And there's no chance that we'll work it out?
Ended over U-N-I
And I said that's fine

And I said that's fine
But you're the only one that knows I lied
And maybe I can let myself down (Woah)
Keep lookin' around to make sure I'm not the only one to feel low
From all that I've done wrong
And I know you'll say that I'm the only one
But I know God made another one of me
To love you better than I ever will
'Cause you and I
Ended over U-N-I
And I said that's fine
But you're the only one that knows I lied
You and I
Ended over U-N-I

So I could just show up and bring the news
That she's gettin' older and I wish that you'd met her
Can I just stay a while and we'll put all the world to rights?
The little ones will grow and I'll still drink your favourite wine
So much has changed since you've been away
I wish that Heaven had visiting hours
So I could just swing by and ask your advice
What would you do in my situation?
I haven't a clue how I'd even raise them
What would you do? 'Cause you always do what's right
Can we just talk a while until my worries disappear?
I'd tell you that I'm scared of turnin' out a failure
So much has changed since you've been away
I wish that Heaven had visiting hours
And I would ask them if I could take you home
So I will live life the way you taught me
And make it on my own

Playing a different show every night in front of a new crowd
That’s you now  ciao  seems that life is great now
See me lose focus as I sing to you loud
And I can’t  no  I won’t hush
I’ll say the words that make you blush
I’m gonna sing this now
See  I’m true  my songs are where my heart is
I'm like glue I stick to other artists
I'm not you  now that would be disastrous
Let me sing and do my thing and move to greener pastures
I’m not fake  don’t ever call me lazy
I won’t stay put  give me the chance to be free
Suffolk sadly seems to sort of suffocate me  hey
Cause you need me  man  I don’t need you
You need me  man  I don’t need you

Call yourself a singer-writer  you’re just bluffing
Name’s on the credits and you didn’t write nothing
I sing  fast  I know that all my shit's cool
I will blast and I didn't go to Brit school
I came fast with the way I act  right
I can’t last  if I’m smoking on a crack pipe
And I won’t be a product of my genre
My mind will always be stronger than my songs are
Never believe the bullshit that fake guys feed to ya
Always read the stories that you hear on Wikipedia
Musically I’m demonstrating
When I perform live  feels like I am meditating
Times at the enterprise when some fella filmed me
A young singer writer like a Gabriella Cilmi yeah

All I want in this cold world is to make music and use it
Not to abuse it and get affected  infected with the who's who of music
Who did it  who is it  who's in it or what the hell does it matter?
All I want is a bit of dignity in me to battle this industry freely
To be me in this seedy  needy world  can you hear me?
Hey  so I keep singing that
When I first started this rapping shit I felt pressure from haters
Became invaded with sadists and just developed a hater radar
And made for the stars  kept my grind in the dark
And then appeared with a remedy kicking rhymes with a melody
Hennesey shots and Glocks  all these fools on the block
Who said you gotta be a gangster now to raise to the top?
With my head in the sky  Ed Sheeran  Urban Angel coming ready to die
So see the signs  stand to the side
Open your eyes and take a look and realize
The resurrection's arrived and as the mist clears
I arise from my tomb in disguise  all alone  Alonestar
Urban Angel rising from the ashes
Surprising all haters  guiding  now moving steady
You can find me in the club  bottle full of bub
Mummy I've got the X if you're into taking drugs
Into having sex  I ain't into making love
Come give me a hug if you're into getting rough
You can find me in the club  bottle full of bubbly

My eyes are red  I've been burning  I've been burning
My eyes are red  I've been burning  I've been burning
My eyes are red I've been burning  I've been burning on a spliff off your high grade
Now where I come from burning weed it is a habit
A big fat bag of high grade weed  you know I got to have it
Cause if I don't have it in my pocket I'm going to panic
Cause like I said where I come from weed smoking is a habit
Yup  we'll do da bun in the place up in the hood
One of them things I have inherited like a ghetto man should
One of them things is smoking weed it yes it makes me feel good
Burning high grade sensimilla  yes it makes me feel
But me is a man  ah  talk about sensimilla is a drug
And if I start to smoke it I'mma-nna turn into a thug
Where I come from that they talking could that only get you mugged
Where I come from burning weed it is a blessing from above
Where I come from yes we bun it when we listen rub a dub
Where I come from yes we bun after we just-a make a love
Where I come from yes we bun it when the sun starts shine
I blaze high grade weed all the time!
Now my eyes are red
Cause you need me  I don't need you
You need me man  my eyes are red
You need me man  I don't need you
You need me man  my eyes are red
And you need me  I don't need you
You need me man  my eyes are red
You need me man  I don't need you
You need me man  I don't need you
Woooah
Woooah
Woooah
Yea
Cause with the lyrics I'll be aiming it right
I won't stop until my name's in lights
With stadium heights  with Damian Rice
On red carpets  now I'm on Arabian Nights
Because I'm young I know my brothers gonna give me advice
Long nighter  short height and I gone hyper
Never be anything but a singer/songwriter  yeah
The game's over but now I'm on a new level
Watch how I step on the track without a loop pedal
People think that I'm bound to blow up
I've done around about a thousand shows but
I haven't got a house plus I live on a couch
So you believe the lyrics when I'm singing them out
Wow  from day one I've been prepared
With V05 wax for my ginger hair
Now I'm back to the sofa giving a dose of
What the future holds cause it's another day
Rucksack with the old clothes  I rap with cold flows
I'm back with the old jokes  in fact you don't know
On tracks I throw blows to make my punchlines relevant
If you can't keep up you'll get none  you're celibate
My flows developing  skin lacks the melanin
Give me a shot of adrenaline and I get it in
Do it for the hell of it
Cause ever since I hit the mainstream with The A Team I seem to sell a bit
I took what held me back with the women  then I packaged the image
Put in some content  then I sold it back as a gimmick
The fact is this  I'll end up dating actresses
Wake up on dirty mattresses  I think I'll need to practice this
But I make shit happen  call me a laxative
World's on my shoulders  I don't even know what Atlas is
Hard bars sharp like a cactus is
I'm back to rapping  back to back cause I've been practicing
I'm back to sing this
Cause you need me  man  I don’t need you
You need me  man  I don’t need you
You need me  man  I don’t need you at all
You need me  man  I don't need you
You need me  man  I don’t need you
You need me  man  I don’t need you
You need me  man  I don’t need you at all
You need me  man
I'll keep my last name forever  keep this genre pretty basic
And I'll be breaking into other people's tunes when I chase it
And replace it with the elephant in the room with a facelift
Into another rapper shoes using new laces
I'm selling CD's from my rucksack aiming for the papers
Selling CD's from my rucksack aiming for the majors
Nationwide tour with Just Jack  still had to get the bus back
Clean cut kid without a razor for the mustache
I hit back  when the pen hurts me
I'm still a choir boy in a Fenchurch tee
I'm still the same as a year ago but more people hear me though
According to the MySpace and YouTube videos
I'm always doing shows if I'm not I'm in the studio
Truly broke  never growing up  call me Rufio
Melody music maker  reading all the papers
They say I'm up and coming like I'm fucking in an elevator
Cause you need me  man  I don’t need you

Or hurt you again
But I got back-stabbed by a black cab
When I needed a friend
Playing a different show every night in front of a new crowd
See me lose focus as I sing to you loud
I'll say the words that make you blush
Let me sing and do my thing and move to greener pastures
