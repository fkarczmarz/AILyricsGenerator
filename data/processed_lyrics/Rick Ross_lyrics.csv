lyrics
"You better listen to your boss white boy.
Oh  I'm gonna walk in the moonlight with you.
You wanna hold my hand?
I need a hundred black coffins for a hundred bad men
A hundred black graves  so I can lay they ass in
I need a hundred black preachers  with a black sermon to tell
From a hundred black Bibles  while we send them all to hell
Black coffins! (I need a hundred...)
I seen a hundred niggas die
Unless it had to do with mine  in the middle of the night
Killers coming for you life  all you wanna do is shine?
I broke off the chains only the realest remain
I see your praying to Jesus  but will that help ease the pain?
Seen a brother get slain for a jar full of change
Yet I post on the block  look like I'm Big Daddy Cane
Is you a cat or a mouse? Keep them rats out the house
A lotta scars on my back  get tattoes all around
Hundred dead bitches  hundred black coffins

I need a hundred black coffins for a hundred bad men
A hundred black graves  so I can lay they ass in
I need a hundred black preachers  with a black sermon to tell
From a hundred black Bibles  while we send them all to hell
Black coffins! (I need a hundred...)
I seen a hundred women burn
As they stood firm  treat a nigga like a germ
What did she do to deserve? Put me on the farm
Pigs' feet in a jar  serve it to me warm
Got me working in fields  too many years it gets fatal
On the days that it rains  her smile bright like a summer
Our revenge is the sweetest  bitch cause I'm coming
Gonna die in my arms  for what you did to my mother (my mama!)
Hundred dead bitches  (Lord) hundred black coffins (why?)
I need a hundred black coffins for a hundred bad men
A hundred black graves  so I can lay they ass in
I need a hundred black preachers  with a black sermon to tell
From a hundred black Bibles  while we send them all to hell
Classic hip hop shit
Dr. D-R-E
Rozay and Jay
Let's get 'em!
We started out mopping floors
And now we front row at the awards
Number one for the last twenty years
Mothafucka scream cheers!
He wanted to shine at the swap meet
Till the white boys got him in that hot seat
I only love it when her hair long
You should listen to this beat through my headphones
The fuck you magazine niggas want from me?
I only love it when her hair long

See y'all niggas
Hit the switches on that shit one time
Ugh
Let the top down
I came a long way from the weed game
Twenty stack seats at the Heat game (Woo!)
And I'm still strapped with the heat man (Ugh!)
Can't be steppin' on a nigga feet man (Hah!)
80 pair of sneakers came from the D game
Brown bag money in a duffle bag
The homie whippin' chickens in his momma kitchen
Real nigga's dreams comin' to fruition
I only love it when her ass fat
We should listen to this track in my Maybach (Maybach Music)
I'm just tryin' to be a billionaire
Come and suck a dick for a millionaire (Ugh!)
Ugh
It's just different
I know it feels different
Ugh
I only love her if her eyes brown
Play this shit while you play around with my crown
Millions on the wall in all my rooms
Niggas couldn't fuck with my daughter's room
Niggas couldn't walk in my daughter's socks
I ran through that buck fifty Live Nation fronted me
I'm holdin' out for three
Two-seventy-five and I just might agree
I only love her if her weave new
Been hoppin' out the BM with your BM
Taking her places that you can't go with your per diem
Screamin' Carpe diem! until I'm a dead poet
I'll take a Ace in the meanwhile
Murder was the case that they gave me
Used to shop at TJ Maxx back in '83
I don't even know if it was open then
I ain't know Oprah then
Ugh! I love this shit like my own daughter
Young
In other words  retaliation is a must!
Boom boom boom boom!
I bow my head  I pray to God
Survival of the fittest: help me hold my chopper lord
If I die today  on the highway to heaven
Can I let my top down in my 911?
In my 911?
In my 911?
In my 911?

Financial fanatic  40 bricks in my attic
400K in my baggage  80 round automatic
You can't stop a bullet  this one for the money
Secret indictments  Porsche costs me 200
Fuck all these broke niggas cause all I do is ball
Ain't no more off days  my crib look like a mall
Fired the stylist  went and bought a big and tall
Niggas still schemin'  but we slidin' on 'em all
I remember pickin' watermelons
Now the Porsche cost me a quarter million
If I die tonight I know I'm comin' back nigga

Self-made millionaire (M-M-M-Maybach Music)
I'm a kamikaze in a Maserati
Worth fifty million and it's all on me
Say the word on the street is that my man got him
If I wasn't involved you wouldn't hear about him
All my CDs gold but the Visa darker
Bastard child but I got a fleet of cars
Double MG this little thing of ours
Niggas layin' on your crib while your momma sleep
Home-cooked meals for the real niggas
Hot TEC-9 for you little niggas
Wanna shoplift? Come and boost this
Cargo pants and my red bottoms

My nigga Rozay make millions while he getting sleep (Hah)
Sierra Leone all up in the link (Bling)
Spent your down payment on my landscape
Niggas sideways like the Phantom door
Hundred round drum sound like round of applause (Blrrt!)
Slicker than a can of grease
Coke damn near same price as dope now (Hah)
Money stuffed in my bag
Maybach shit
Cameras in the ceiling  Céline on my arm
Bright lights and dark corners as night embark on us
Refugees runnin' wild  Wyclef with a SIG Sauer
Nothin' to lose  I was starvin' from the start
Now the same cat drivin' Jaguars
Open fire when you see me yell out and make em whisper
The club that I'm a member  they'll be gone by November
Keys to the city got killers who slither with me
Billionaire bid  wrists on chill
Standin' in the field of dreams  tryna see a hundred mil
These boys goin' blind they just happy bein' free
In a world of so many I just wanted me a ki'
Sheesh! I just wanted me a piece
Slice of cheesecake before my niggas all deceased
These boys snort lines  I'm fine just sippin' wine
Amsterdam in the air  tomorrow on my mind
I'm Berry Gordy to the streets
With a kilo  so that boy had been a beast
I wanna be there when each one of my kids born
Royal blood  hundred acres each to live on
Real nigga to the day that I'm deceased
Even then I pray I'm livin' through these beats
Dope boy  you can tell by my sneaks
Burnin' Amsterdam green where it falls like a leaf

Born in the bricks with the short end of the stick
Always runnin' late  quick to show up with your bitch
The Hublot's cool but my Terminator's foolish
All stainless steel  quick to match it with my tool and
Red carpet event  the marijuana be lit
These niggas actin' like they want a war!
When it come to whackin' niggas I done won awards
I'm ridin' in some shit only I can afford
Shouldn't claim the hood til you build a rapport
Amsterdam state of mind: I just gave you a tour
I'm laughin' at the people who label me poor
Now I piss on Europeans  you'd think it was porn
I'm Berry Gordy to the streets
With a kilo  so that boy had been a beast
I wanna be there when each one of my kids born
Royal blood  hundred acres each to live on
Real nigga to the day that I'm deceased
Even then I pray I'm livin' through these beats
Dope boy  you can tell by my sneaks
Burnin' Amsterdam green where it falls like a leaf
I'm speakin' on unwritten laws  the code of the streets
I'm not the type of nigga that you bump into at a 7-Eleven and just pull your pistol on him
And do what the fuck you want to do
Niggas like me  you gotta get permission homie
And that could take a long time!
In that time  I'mma handle my motherfuckin' business..
Ugh! Ugh!
It's the red light district  nigga this Amsterdam
Wherever the fuck I'm at
It's a no go
We green light you bitch niggas
Just being somebody that the neighborhood respected
So at that point what else can you ask for?
(M-M-Maybach Music)
Tears runnin' down a nigga face
Still sleepin' on the floor when you deserve better
Got you reekin' through the cold even in warm weather
I thank the Lord I got some great friends
Just had seizure at the Super Bowl
Woke up in the third quarter lookin' for the smoke
And never will I call it right
Not perfect but I'm the one you would call at night
But rarely do I hear that this nigga done did it
When niggas in fatigues will keep you intrigued
'Cause the loss of life's the only thing niggas believe
So I pray you listen carefully
Then I become another motherfuckin' casualty

You do it for the love of you and I (for the love of you and)
Standin' on your block but you so out of place
Lights off so you never tend to speak much
Go your separate ways every time the lease up
I want fried chicken at my funeral
Everybody dyin' for the same things
I'm happy Donald Trump became the president
With a pocket full of weed inside the white house
Dead presidents tattooed on a nigga chest
Own the biggest residential pool in the U.S
Drake and Kanye can invite every bitch they ever met
Finger fuckin' bitches in the holy water
Then I go an tell what happened to my only daughter
So her daddy told it to her firsthand
Never perfect but it's not just 'bout them purses
Always speak and say hi
You just never ever walk on by (never ever walk on by)
You even stopped and put one in the sky (the sky)
You do it for the love of you and I (for the love of you and)

The streets could never teach me
All the things I got from you
I found myself in the wrong lane
I was strolling down a dark street
When this girl passed me by
She said you've always been a good friend (always been a good friend)
And you never never never let me down
Always speak and say hi
You just never ever walk on by (never ever walk on by)
You even stopped and put one in the sky (the sky)
Let's pull the two-seater out baby
It's where ever you wanna go!
J.U.S.T.I.C.E. League
Would've came back for you
I just needed time to do what I had to do
Caught in the life I can't let it go
Whether that's right I will never know
When I'm alone in my room sometime I stare at the wall
Put this music shit aside get it in on the road
A lot of quiet time pink bottles of rose
Exotic red bottoms whole body glittered in gold
Following fundamentals and following in the rental
I love a nasty girl who swallow what's on the menu
That money triple up when ya get it out of state
I need a new safe cause I'm running out of space

Living fast where it's all about that money bag
Top down right here is where she wanna be
As my goals unfold right in front of me
Every time we fuck her soul take a hold of me
Addicted like Pookie that pussy be controlling me
That thing keep calling
Fuck maintain boy: I gotta keep ballin!
Pink bottles keep coming
James Bond coupe pop clutch 100
Would've came back for you
Would've came
I talk slicker than a pimp from Augusta
I took some sense and made a nickel of it
I'm urgin' all daughters to kiss they mothers
With those lips that all that lipstick covers
You're never too grown up to miss and hug her
And girls countin' on me to be there like missin' rubbers
This ain't the life that I'm used to
Reintroduced to people I've been introduced to
Did you forget me?
Or are you too scared to tell me that you met me
And fear that I won't remember
I wish you could still accept me for me
The simplistic beauty that all of them Southerners have
I'm halfway across the world with dozens of bags
Feelin' like all four members of Color Me Badd
Which one of y'all got fleets on your keychains?
The seats for these Heat games?
I really think you stare at yourself and you see things
To stunt on these niggas we don't really fuck with
Fuck is up?
Havin' lunch and debatin' Ferrari prices
Twenty-three and goin' through a midlife crisis
I never threw away that paper with my Grammy speech
Because I haven't hit the pinnacles I plan to reach
Ugh
One nation under God
Real niggas gettin' money from the fuckin' start

I smell pussy on these niggas man
I try to let you pussy niggas eat
It's time to put your pussy boys to sleep
Pussy niggas always wanna talk
I'm busy getting pussy like a fucking boss
I smell a pussy from a block away
Lets shoot them pussies from a block away
They wanna see a nigga in a cage
Baby mama garnishing a nigga wage
I just went and got the Chevy sprayed
Pussy nigga wanna scratch a nigga paint
Pussy nigga wanna see you fall
Just know to bring them choppers when you see me call
I tried to let them pussy niggas eat
It's time to make you pussy boys extinct
I took a quarter Key to Polk county
All my central Florida nigga straight 'bout it
Broke down the brick I'm back in Bartow

J-Ville I went and bought a condo
Back to the crib where I get it by the car load

Fuck where you from  'cause all we deal with is color money

And I promise you my goals will exceed any physical pleasure
May your love come down so my mind might have you

Middle of the night  my nigga wanna Skype
I just count money for him  that shit just get him hype
They say it's hard to smile with a double life
In the middle of the night with a bloody knife
Lord give him a chance  every man should be free
He wanted him a degree but got him a ki
Open that door  just hopin' for more
They gave him a bond  I gave him a Porsche
I gave him a name  I gave him a shot
I gave him the game  I gave him a block
Smokin' on that gas  I be thinkin' too fast
Drug dealer's dream  now let's count this cash
Dope boy tatted on my neck
A real dope boy  I never write a check
Murder  a mothafuckin' murder
No you didn't see it but I know you bitches heard it
Blood on the corner  damn I miss my dawg
You dig?

Allow my flow time to sink into the tempo

I can talk about the bodies  I could tell you 'bout the killing
Duct taping niggas in the name of drug dealin'
Big body Benzes while the bitch niggas starve
Turtleneck Mercedes blowin' smoke up out the top

Niggas wanna crack jokes just to get close to me
Hope you know that I'm strapped like I supposed to be
Put a number on your helmet like it's Notre Dame
5 grand'll get you whacked  won't even know your name

Pacquiao purse  boy I took another belt

I wanna shine just like the summertime
They say them folk gave him a heap of time
Watching from my point you thought it was a fucking film
They know him as the myth but see I know it's him
Attempted murder on his life in that 360i
With my two eyes
Two different pistols
One with registered and one to get your issue
All this fame and fortune leave you traumatized

Damn  I grew up on that Cash Money
Bling bling  was well known to flash money
Hit the liquor store  after my Vic authority
Quick to switch a bitch up  pick up me a thicker shorty
Pistol on me  nigga  ain't no pickin' on me
We veterans so it's better if you go get your army
A thug holiday is where your body lay
Me and Trick Daddy come from a common place
So us gettin' money  that's just a conversation
It's so hard stayin' rich and miss the confrontations
Cigars in the Oval Office  Ronald Reagan
Hug Barack Obama  whisper  As-salāmu ʿalaykum
Live for the moment  die for the streets
Bible on the dash  kilos on the seat
I used to see you niggas on my TV screen
And wondered what was life like  was it all a dream?
And then I met you out on LiveNation dates
Came to the realization that your watch was fake
Damn... you nearly broke my heart

Omerta the code  Met Ball  parties with Vogue
Still blowin' thick smoke while you powder your nose
Such a head rush until the day the feds rush
That's when you niggas wish you put your bread up
Leased whips  bad blood  that shit'll sink ships
Fast money comin' slow  you better think quick
Rap game  so much fuck shit done
That's why this .45 in my Trukfit trunks
Fuck a skateboard  I went and got a Wraith  boy
Catholic record labels  niggas gettin' raped  boy
Birdman's a priest  moans in his synagogue
Publishin' is a sin  repent  forgive me  Lord
Shots fired  home invasion out on Palm Isle
Red beam detonators  who the bomb now?
Look you in your eyes  nigga  'fore I say good night
And pray that Mannie Fresh'll get to see the light
Damn  Stunna
I loved you  nigga
Hate it came to this
(Maybach Music)
You stole them boys' pub' and bought a foreclosure
Scott Storch demons in it  which is more poison
I handed over records  never charged a coin
But could sense the sentiment  I'm talkin' all along
All Miami issues  Rozay handle for him
Same way Big Ducky do for me in California
Never slippin'  got relationships with the trillest niggas
Tony Draper  J Prince and every Jimmy Henchmen
Plenty killers and I know that Diddy with it
Tyga  chinchilla  really ain't no penny pinchin'
Knew that you would never visit BG
Turk came home  take that boy a three piece
Shootin' dope  usin' coke  movin' like you the Folks
Sacrificin' half our life for your new music cult
You would give us self esteem and motivate our drive
But was in our pockets by the time we count to five
I pray you find the kindness in your heart for Wayne
His entire life  he gave you what there was to gain
I watched this whole debacle so I'm part to blame
Last request  can all producers please get paid?
Can't believe this shit  homie
I still love you  nigga
How the fuck  nigga  you touch half a billion  nigga
And your team starvin'  nigga?
You on an island  nigga  you came to my city  nigga
I let you in my city  nigga
And what hurt me the most  nigga
Is how you did my brother Khaled  nigga
Khaled was loyal to you  nigga
The pain I seen in my brother's eye  nigga
FaceTimin' my nigga  nigga  he took that to the chin  nigga
That's why my nigga blessed!
That's why my nigga Khaled blessed!
You put my nigga in the hole  homie
I don't feel you for that  my nigga
That shit hurt me  you under-dig? Umm
It's painful what you see real niggas do
When they get the paper  when they get the bag
You can't never forget 'bout lil bruh and them
I'll never forget 'bout lil bruh and them
Lil bruh and them  always remember
Lil bruh and them  this for lil bruh and them
I don't got a single sober vein in my body
I see that bottle after bottle got you goin' crazy
And doin' shows after shows got me so lazy
Don't you ever threaten niggas with a good time
Private elevator goin' straight to my unit
Now that penthouse at the Ritz where my home is
Tour bus like a National Geographic
Bitches runnin' wild gettin' faded in the bathroom
'Cause I got it
'Cause I got it
But now we got it
I don't got a single sober vein in my body

Turned you to a rich bitch by your first glass

I'm multiplyin' my money through different avenues
For my mother I applaud Ms. Afeni Shakur
And if I die today bury me in a dope-ass watch

Well we gon' be livin' like this for the rest of tonight
