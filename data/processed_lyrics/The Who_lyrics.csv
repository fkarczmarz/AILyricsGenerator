"Especially if you and me see it in together
So you think '21 is gonna be a good year?
Could be good for me and her
I had no reason to be over-optimistic
What about the boy?
What about the boy?
What about the boy?
He saw it all!
You didn't hear it (I heard it)
You didn't see it (I saw it)
You won't say nothing to no one
(I won't say nothing to no one)
Never in your life (Never in my life)
You never heard it (I heard it)
How absurd it all seems without any proof
(How absurd it all seems without any proof)
You didn't hear it (I heard it)
You didn't see it (I saw it)
You won't say nothing to no one (I won't say nothing to no one)
Never tell a soul what you know is the truth
(Never tell a soul what I know is the truth)

Got a feeling '21 is gonna be a good year

Why should I care?
Girls of fifteen (Sexually knowing)
The ushers are sniffing (Eau de Cologning)
The seats are seductive (Celibate sitting)
Magically bored on a quiet street corner
Free frustration in our minds and our toes
Out of my brain on the 5:15
Out of my brain on the train
Out of my brain on the train
A raft in the quarry (Slowly sinking)
Back of a lorry (Holy hitching)
Dreadfully sorry (Apple scrumping)
Born in the war (Birthday punching)
He-man drag in a glittering ballroom
Grayly outrageous in my high-heel shoes
Sadly ecstatic that their heroes are news

Strange as it seems his musical dreams ain't quite so bad
Ten years old with thoughts as bold as thoughts can be
Loving life and becoming wise in simplicity
Sickness will surely take the mind where minds can't usually go
Come on the amazing journey and learn all you should know
A vague haze of delirium creeps up on me
All at once a tall stranger I suddenly see
He's dressed in a silver-sparked glittering gown
And his golden beard flows nearly down to the ground
Nothing to say  and nothing to hear and nothing to see
Each sensation makes a note in my symphony
Sickness will surely take the mind where minds can't usually go
Come on the amazing journey and learn all you should know

His eyes are the eyes that transmit all they know
Sparkle warm crystalline glances to show
That he is your leader and he is your guide
In peaceful times I hold her close and I feed her
My heart starts palpitating when I think my guess was wrong
But I think I will get along
She's just a girl – she's a bomb
Athena  all I ever want to do is please her
My life has been so settled and she is the reason
Just one word from her and my troubles are long gone
But I think I'll  get along
She's just a girl – she's a bomb
Just a girl  just a girl
She's just a girl
Athena  my heart felt like a shattered glass in an acid bath
I felt like one of those flattened ants you find on a crazy path
I would of topped myself to give her time she did not need to ask
Was I a suicidal psychopath?
She's just a girl – she's a bomb
Consumed  there was a beautiful white horse I saw on a dream stage
He had a snake the size of a sewer pipe living in his rib cage
I felt like a pickled priest who was being flambed
You got me requisitioned Blondie
She's just a girl – she's a bomb

I'm happy  I'm ecstatic

Look into the face of a child
Measure how long you smiled
Before the memory claimed
How long would children remain
How long could children remain
Athena  you picked me up by my lapels and screamed leave her
It felt like waking up in heaven on an empty meter
And now you are stuck with a castrated leader
And I hate the creep  I didn't mean that
She's a bomb
I just said it
She is a bomb
I didn't mean it  please
She's a bomb
Athena  I had no idea how much I need her
My life has been so settled and she is the reason
Just one word from her and my troubles are long gone
But I get along
I get my back into my living
I don't need to fight to prove I'm right
Don't cry  don't raise your eye
It's only teenage wasteland
Put out the fire and don't look past my shoulder
The exodus is here  the happy ones are near
Let's get together before we get much older
Teenage wasteland  it's only teenage wasteland
Teenage wasteland
They're all wasted
I'd gladly give up all I had
I'd pay any price just to get you
I'd work all my life and I will
I'd call that a bargain
The best I ever had
The best I ever had
I'd gladly lose me to find you
Gladly give up all I got
I'd pay any price just to win you
Surrender my good life for bad
I'd call that a bargain

I'd gladly lose me to find you
Gladly give up all I got

Surrender my good life for bad
I'd call that a bargain
The best I ever had
The best I ever had
 to be the sad man
 to be fated
 they aren't as empty
 only lonely
 none of my pain and woe
 they aren't as empty
 only lonely
 crack it open
 tell me some bad news
 please give me a blanket
 let me wear your coat
 to be the sad man
He's the only soul in the world that's real
But I see a face coming through the haze
I remember him from those crazy days
Ain't you the guy who used to set the paces
Riding up in front of a hundred Faces?
I don't suppose you would remember me
But I used to follow you back in '63
You should see me dressed up in my uniform
(Bell boy!) I gotta get running now
(Bell boy!) Keep my lip buttoned down
(Bell boy!) Carry this baggage out
(Bell boy!) Always running
At someone's bleeding heel

Ain't you the guy who used to set the paces

I don't suppose you would remember me
But I used to follow you back in '63
You could learn a lot from a life like mine
I carry it behind this bleeding little badge what says
(Bell boy!) I gotta get running now

(Bell boy!) Always running at someone's heel
You know how I feel
Always running at someone's heel
Black and hairy  very small
Now he's up above my head
Hanging by a little thread
Boris the spider

Now he's dropped on to the floor
Heading for the bedroom door
Maybe he's as scared as me
Where's he gone now? I can't see

Waking up on Christmas morning
Hours before the winter sun's ignited
They believe in dreams and all they mean
Including Heaven's generosity
Peeping 'round the door to see
What parcels are for free in curiosity
And Tommy doesn't know what day it is
He doesn't know who Jesus was or what praying is
How can he be saved from the eternal grave?
Surrounded by his friends
He sits so silently and unaware of anything
And smiles and pokes his tongue at everything
Who've never seen light be enlightened?
Only if he's cured will his spirit's future level ever heighten
He doesn't know who Jesus was or what praying is
How can he be saved from the eternal grave?

Peeping 'round the doors to see

He doesn't know who Jesus was or what praying is
All alone  cousin
Let's think of a game to play
Now the grownups have all gone away
You won't be much fun
But I've no one to play with today
Do you know how to play hide-and-seek?
To find me it would take you a week
But tied to that chair you won't go anywhere
There's a lot I can do with a freak
How would you feel if I turned on the bath
Ducked your head under and started to laugh
What would you do if I shut you outside
To stand in the rain and catch cold so you die?
I'm the school bully  the classroom cheat
The nastiest play-friend you ever could meet
I'll stick pins in your fingers and tread on your feet
We're on our own  cousin
All alone  cousin
Let's think of a game to play
Now the grownups have all gone away
You won't be much fun
But I've no one to play with today

The nastiest play-friend you ever could meet
If I have to cut my hair?
I got to move with the fashion
Or be outcast
I know I should fight
And I'm still living at home
Even though it won't last
Five inches long
I'm out on the street again
And I'm leaping along
Dressed right for a beach fight
But I just can't explain
Why that uncertain feeling
Is still here in my brain
The kids at school
Have parents that seem so cool
And though I don't want to hurt them
Mine want me their way
I clean my room and my shoes
But my mother found a box of blues
And there doesn't seem much hope
They'll let me stay

Just to earn the respect of a dance hall friend?
Why do I have to move with a crowd
Of kids that hardly notice I'm around?
I work myself to death just to fit in
I'm coming down
Got home on the very first train from town
My dad just left for work
He wasn't talking
It's all a game
My fried egg makes me sick
I've seen things you've never seen
Talk behind my back
I'm off the beaten track
I'll take on anyone
Ain't scared of a bloody nose
Drink 'til I drop down
With one eye on my clothes
What is it? I'll take it
Who is she? I'll rape it
Got a bet there? I'll meet it
Gettin' high? You can't beat it
Doctor Jimmy and Mister Jim
He only comes out when I drink my gin
You say she's a virgin

I'm going back soon
Home to get that baboon
Who cut up my eye
Tore up my Levis
I'm feeling restless
Bring another score around
Maybe something stronger
Could really hold me down

 you talk about your woman  I wish you could see mine
 she brings eyesight to the blind
 the dumb begin to talk
 never fear
 she's got the power to heal you  never fear
I'm glad you won't see or hear me
Your mother left me here to mind you
Now I'm doing what I want to
Down with the bedclothes
Up with your nightshirt
You won't shout as I fiddle about
The tests I gave him show no sense at all
His eyes react to light the dials detect it
He hears but cannot answer to your call
All hope lies with him and none with me
Imagine though the shock from isolation
When he suddenly can hear and speak and see
All the time the needles flick and rock
No machine can give the kind of stimulation
Needed to remove his inner block

I often wonder what he is feeling
Has he ever heard a word I've said?
Look at him in the mirror dreaming
What is happening in his head?
Listening to you I get the music
Gazing at you I get the heat
Following you I climb the mountain
I get excitement at your feet!
Right behind you I see the millions
On you I see the glory
From you I get opinions
From you I get the story
What is happening in his head
He lived in the sand at the Isle of Man.
The kids would all sing  he would take the wrong key
So they rode on his head in their furry donkey
The kids couldn't hurt Jack
They dropped things on his back
But they couldn't stop Jack  or the waters lapping
And they couldn't prevent Jack from feeling happy

And people die from being old
Or left alone because they're cold
And bombs are dropped on fighting cats
And children's dreams are run with rats
If you complain you disappear
Just like the lesbians and queers
No-one can love without the grace
Of some unseen and distant face
And you get beaten up by Blacks
And when your soul tells you to hide
Your very right to die's denied
And in the battle on the streets
You fight computers and receipts
And when a man is trying to change
It only causes further pain
You realize that all along

Murdered in cold blood is what I'm gonna be

And now my wife is coming after me
Give me police protection
I'm gonna buy a gun so I can look after number one
With a machine gun
Gonna buy a tank and an aeroplane
She thinks I've been with another woman
And that's enough to send her half insane

Got picked up by the law

Feeling all the bumpers  always playing clean
Plays by intuition  the digit counters fall
He's a pinball wizard  there has to be a twist

Ain't got no distractions  can't hear no buzzes and bells

She wears on her chest
And when Daddy comes home
He never gets no rest
'Cause she's playing all night
And the music's alright
Mama's got a squeeze box
Daddy never sleeps at night
And the dog can't sleep
There's no escape from the music
In the whole damn street

Mama's got a squeeze box

You think my shoes are made of leather
But I'm a substitute for another guy
The simple things you see are all complicated
(Substitute) Your lies for fact
(Substitute) I see right through your plastic mac
(Substitute) My fine-looking suit is really made out of sack
I was born with a plastic spoon in my mouth
The north side of my town faced east
And the east was facing south
And now you dare to look me in the eye
Those crocodile tears are what you cry
(Substitute) Me for him
(Substitute) My coke for gin
(Substitute) You for my mum
(Substitute) At least I'll get my washing done

This girl could put him right
I'll show him what he could be now
Just give me one night
Leave us for a while

Gather your wits and hold on fast
Your mind must learn to roam
Just as the Gypsy Queen must do
You're gonna hit the road

Other guys dancing with my girl
That's fine
I know them all pretty well
But I know sometimes I must get out in the light
Better leave her behind

You only became what we made you
Thought you were chasing a destiny calling
You only earned what we gave you
You fell and cried as our people were starving
Now you know that we blame you
You tried to walk on the trail we were carving
Now you know that we framed you
I'm the guy in the sky
No surprise I told lies
I'm the punk in the gutter
I'm the new president
And I grew and I bent
Don't you know? Don't it show?
I'm the punk with the stutter
We tried to speak between lines of oration
You could only repeat what we told you
Your axe belongs to a dying nation
They don't know that we own you
You only see what we show you
We're the slaves of the phony leaders
Breathe the air we have blown you

I have to be careful not to preach
I can't pretend that I can teach
By pounding stages like a clown
And bloody faces slowly pass
The numbered seats in empty rows
(Okay!)
You declared you would be three inches taller
You only became what we made you
Thought you were chasing a destiny calling
You only earned what we gave you
You fell and cried as our people were starving
Now you know that we blame you
You tried to walk on the trail we were carving
Now you know that we framed you
I'm the guy in the sky
I'm the punk in the gutter
And I grew and I bent
Don't you know? Don't it show?
I'm the punk with the stutter
To get another shrink
I sit and tell him about my weekend
But he never betrays what he thinks
I went back to my mother
'Cause it runs in the family”

The cracks between the paving stones
Like rivers of flowing veins
Strange people who know me
Peeping from behind every window pane
The girl I used to love
Lives in this yellow house
Yesterday she passed me by
She doesn't want to know me now
I ended up with the preacher
Full of lies and hate
I seemed to scare him a little
So he showed me to the golden gate
Can you see the real me doctor
Can you see the real me mother
Can you feel me near you?
Tommy  can you see me?
Can I help to cheer you?

I'm your Uncle Ernie
And I'll welcome you to Tommy's Holiday Camp
My name is Tommy and I became aware this year
If you want to follow me  you've got to play pinball
And put in your ear plugs  put on your eye shades
You know where to put the cork
Hey you smoking mother nature  this is a bust
Hey hung up old Mr. Normal  don't try to gain my trust
'Cause you ain't gonna follow me any of those ways
Although you think you must
We're not gonna take it
We're not gonna take it
We're not gonna take it
We're not gonna take it
We're not gonna take it  never did and never will
Let's forget it better still

We're not gonna take it
We're not gonna take it

With our children at our feet
And the morals that they worship will be gone
And the men who spurred us on
Sit in judgment of all wrong
They decide and the shotgun sings the song
I'll tip my hat to the new Constitution
Take a bow for the new revolution
Smile and grin at the change all around
Pick up my guitar and play
Just like yesterday
Then I'll get on my knees and pray
We don't get fooled again
We knew it all along
And the world looks just the same
And history ain't changed
I'll tip my hat to the new Constitution
Take a bow for the new revolution
Smile and grin at the change all around
Pick up my guitar and play
Just like yesterday
Then I'll get on my knees and pray
We don't get fooled again

I'll move myself and my family aside
If we happen to be left half-alive
I'll get all my papers and smile at the sky
For I know that the hypnotized never lie
Do you?
Yeah
There's nothing in the street
Looks any different to me
And the parting on the left
Is now the parting on the right
And the beards have all grown longer overnight
I'll tip my hat to the new Constitution
Take a bow for the new revolution
Smile and grin at the change all around
Pick up my guitar and play
Just like yesterday
Then I'll get on my knees and pray
We don't get fooled again
Don't get fooled again
Yeah
Meet the new boss
You better  you better you bet  ooh

I call you on the telephone
My voice too rough with cigarettes
I sometimes think I should just go home
But I'm dealing with a memory that never forgets
I love to hear you say my name
Especially when you say yes
I got your body right now on my mind
But I drunk myself blind to the sound of old T-Rex (Hmmmm)
To the sound of old T-Rex (oh)  – and Who's Next
When I say I love you  you say you better
You better  you better you bet
When I say I need you  you say you better
You better  you better you bet
You better bet your life
Or love will cut you like a knife

I want those feeble-minded axes overthrown
I'm not into your passport picture – I just like your nose
You welcome me with open arms and open legs
I know only fools have needs  but this one never begs
I don't really mind how much you love me
Ooh  a little is alright
When you say  come over and spend the night
Tonight  tonight
When I say I love you  you say you better
You better  you better you bet
When I say I need you  you say you better
You better  you better you bet
You better bet your life
Or love will cut you like a knife
I lay on the bed with you
We could make some book of records
Your dog keeps licking my nose
And chewing up all those letters
Saying “you better”
You better bet your life
You better love me  all the time now
You better shove me back into line now
You better love me  all the time now
You better shove me back into line now
I showed up late one night
With a neon light for a visa
But knowing I am so eager to fight
Can't make letting me in any easier (oooh ooh)
I know I've been wearing crazy clothes
And I look pretty crappy sometime (oooh ooh)
But my body feels so good
And I still sing a razor line every time
And when it comes to all night living
I know what I am giving
I have got it all down to a tee
And it's free
When I say I love you  you say you better
You better  you better you bet
When I say I need you  you say you better
You better  you better you bet
When I say I love you  you say you better
You better  you better you bet
When I say I need you  you scream you better (ooh)
You better  you better you bet
When I say I love you  you say you better
You better  you better you bet
When I say I need you  you say you better
You better  you better you bet
When I say I love you  you say you better
You better  you better you bet
When I say I need you  you scream you better
You better  you better you bet
You better bet your life or love will cut you"
