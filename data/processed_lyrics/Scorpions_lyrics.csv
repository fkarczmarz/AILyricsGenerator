lyrics
"I don't want to leave
I don't know how to love
But you're the exception
You saved the man I was
And now I believe it
You changed the man I was
I guess you're the reason
I am breathing
I only know what I know
Then where you go I'll go
You know you remind me of a loving song
Like something new
Now that our time has only begun
Love breaks through
All through the years
We found our way to a better day
No more tears
I promise you
I will always be with you

But felt no affection
I really tried to love
I could never find
The right direction
I can not take back what's been said and done
Things I can not undo
Now our time has only begun
Love breaks through
All through the years
We found our way to a better day
No more tears
I promise you
I'll be with you
All through the years
We found our way to a better place
No more tears
I promise you
No time to call you today
Encores 'til eleven  then Chinese food
Back to the hotel again
I call your number  the line ain't free
I'd like to tell you come to me
A night without you seems like a lost dream
Love  I can't tell you how I feel
Always somewhere
Miss you where I've been
I'll be back to love you again
Always somewhere
Miss you where I've been
I'll be back to love you again
Another morning  another place
The only day off is far away
But every city has seen me in the end
And brings me to you again

The cats are all in heat
Out in the streets
Snakes are all around you
Dirty rats are on their way
They control you and they'll make you play
Out in the night
Glaring eyes in darkness
Tigers wanna fight
Out in the night
Spiders all around you
Spinning webs and make you pray
Tie you up and you can't get away
Bad boys running wild
If you don't play along with their games
Bad boys running wild
And you better get out of their way
Out in the streets
The dogs are on the run

How does it feel  babe  to let me feel your strength?
Don't be cruel  can't you see?
If you don't catch me now  I can't stop falling down
Just one more night and the devil got my soul
I need your love  babe  don't treat me this way
Oh  I'll miss you so much more than words can say
How does it feel  babe  to kill our destiny?
I swear I'm not gonna crawl  oh no
How does it feel  babe  to make a fool out of me?
How can you be so cold? Be so cold?
If you don't catch me now  I can't stop falling down

And the sharks try to cut a big piece out of life
It feels alright to go out to catch an outrageous thrill
You keep me burning
When the sunlight is rising up in my eyes
And the long night has left me back at somebody's side
It feels alright for a long sweet minute like hours before
You keep me burning
Always yearning
There is no dream that you can't make true
If you're looking for love
But there's no girl who's burning the ice away from my heart
Maybe tonight

Want you to stand up and dance
Gonna leave you no chance

Dust in the wind

This is the time for yourself to be free
You gotta follow your heart

You gotta follow your heart
Walking far away horizons
You will never walk alone

Away from home

Hear voices that talk without a word to say
Sometimes I hear the echoes of laughter
In the twilight of affairs and other tragedies
Sometimes it's easy to forget only for a moment
But there are nights you regret eternally
Whatever frozen hearts can do
Will melt the ice away
How you know what it's like
When good luck has changed the sides
And no sun shines in the dark and no angels
Ever hear your prayers in the night
When your fears come up your spine
When your life turns upside down it breaks your heart
When you get crushed in a house of cards
House of cards
It ́s so hard to find a way when life is in pieces
And the taste of a kiss is so bittersweet
Sometimes it's easy to forget only for a moment
But the man who'll rise up from the ashes is no one else but me
I'm standing in a waterfall
To wash the lies away

You sold your soul to feed your vanity
Your fantasies and lies

Once had a dream that we shared on the way
There was a place where we used to seek shelter

You led me on with a cloak and a dagger
And I didn't know you had made other plans
You had me believe we were meant for forever
I really thought my heart would be safe in your hands

My ship has passed you by
And though you promised me to show the way
You led me astray

My cat is purring  it scratches my skin
So what is wrong with another sin?

So give her inches and feed her well

Here I am

In the summer of 85
The clouds just went and the day became so bright
A child of love angel like
With the most beautiful smile
Growing up to be the sunshine of my life
Come talk to me
Don't run away
Don't let the distance grow
The door's wide open
Don't ever think
There is no way home
Sly come home tonight
The world is so bad you're drive them all mad
With your smile
Sly my joy and my pride
When the runaway train take you away
A part of me died
The years went by like the summer of love
So much changed in our lives
They're too many scars deep under my skin
Love turned to hate and hate to love
Let's start all over again
And now I wonder what life will bring
Just let us laugh
The tears away
No more hard feelings no
Because after all
You're my flesh and blood
I don't want you to fall

Sly come home tonight
The world is so bad you're drive them all mad
With your smile
Sly my joy and my pride
When the runaway train take you away
It needs time
To win back your love again
I will be there
I will be there
Love
Only love
Can bring back your love someday
I will be there

Fight
To win back your love again
I will be there

Only love
Can break down the wall someday
I will be there

If we'd go again
All the way from the start
I would try to change
The things that killed our love
Pride has built a wall so strong
That I can't get through
Is there really no chance
To start once again?
I'm loving you

Where nothing dares to grow
I taught you how to sing
You taught me everything I know
And thought the night is young
And we don't know if we'll live to see the sun
The best is yet to come
That we've only just begun
Through the highs and lows
And how can I live without you
You're such a part of me
And you've always been the one
Keeping me forever young
And the best is yet to come
Hey ah eh oh
Hey ah eh oh
Thinking of the times
How we laughed and cried
I wouldn't change a thing
I couldn't even if I tried
Through the wind and rain
The spirit of our song remains the same
And the best is yet to come

Reaching out to cross the great divide
You are drifting away
Mind and soul and body day by day
Nothing's stopping you and I
It's do or die tonight
So tell me why I'm alone
When we're lying here together
On a night that's so cold
And you're just a touch away
Baby try to hold on
Until we make it to forever
We're alive
And the future never dies
I've been dying inside
Holding back the tears I never cried
Now I'm down on my knees
Because everything you are is what I need
You're the meaning of it all
Don't let me fall you've got to

Your struggles are in vain
Soon black magic's dying
You'd better start crying

Throw out your evil desire
The dark king's kingdom

Came a time remembered well
When the strong young man of the rising sun
Heard the tolling of the great black bell
One day in the year of the fox
When the bell began to ring
It meant the time had come for one to go
To the temple of the king
Searching  seeking
With just one touch of his trembling hand
The answer will be found
Daylight waits while the old man sings
Heaven help me
And then like the rush of a thousand wings
It shines upon the one
And the day had just begun
One day  in the year of the fox
Came a time remembered well
When the strong young man of the rising sun
Heard the tolling of the great black bell
One day in the year of the fox
When the bell began to sing
It meant the time had come for one to go

There in the middle of the people he stands
Seeing  feeling
With just a wave of the strong right hand  he's gone
To the temple of the king
Far from the circle  at the edge of the world
He's hoping  wondering
Thinking back on the stories he's heard
Of what he's going to see
Heaven help me
Then all could see by the shine in his eyes
The answer had been found
Back with the people in the circle he stands
Giving  feeling
With just one touch of a strong right hand  they know
Another boring day
I leave it all behind me now
So many worlds away
And all we gonna do
Is walk around to catch the thrill
On streets we call the zoo
Make our dreams come true
And hungry eyes are passing by
On streets we call the zoo
Make our dreams come true

Do you ever ask yourself
Is there a Heaven in the sky
Why can't we get it right
Because we all live under the same sun
We all walk under the same moon
I saw the evening
Fading shadows one by one
I saw the children

Sometimes I think I'm going mad
We're losing all we had and no one seems to care
But in my heart it doesn't change
We've got to rearrange and bring our world some love
And does it really matter
If there's a heaven up above
We sure could use some love
Because we all live under the same sun
We all walk under the same moon
Because we all live under the same sky
We all look up at the same stars
That holds us together
Faith and believing is the key
This door of forever
We're every reason on earth
Now and again it's always us
When the rain fell and the flood came
And the wind blew hard like a hammer on these walls
We didn't crack or break or fall
There is a time
To face stormy weather
But we are always standing strong
A lifetime together
We don't regret anything
Now it's the two of us again

Everything seems to call your name
Yesterday you were leaving
Leaving life and all the pain
Everything wants you back again
Wants you back again
Wants you back again
I've found myself through you
And there was love in my life
I felt always naturally high
And my love had a home
But now my mind has started to roam
You're my life giving fire
And you carried all my love
Through you I was so inspired
You're engraved deep in my heart
My dreams recall us being one
I've searched for you to be free
My force of life you have always been
I feel blue since you've gone
Your breath of love surrounded me
When can I rejoin you to be free?
Rejoin you to be free
Rejoin you to be free
There is a voice in my head
There's a way to stay with you again
It's more than you ever had
And no death brings us apart
Our timeless love always grows
Because you are in my other heart
I know we've never been apart
Your love sets fire to my heart
We'll burn the sky
When it's time for me to die
I go to see the place once more
Just like a thousand nights before
I climb the stage again this night
Cause the place seems still alive
When the smoke is going down
This is the place where I belong
I really love to turn you on
I've got your sound still in my ears
While your traces disappear
I climb the stage again this night
Cause the place seems still alive
When the smoke is going down

You give me the feel I've been looking for
You give me your soul
Your innocent love
You are the one I've been waiting for
I've been waiting for
We're lost in a kiss
A moment in time
Forever young
When you came into my life
It took my breath away
It was love at first sight

When you came into my life
Because your love has found it's way
You make me dream
By the look in your eyes
I've been longing for so long

An August summer night
Soldiers passing by
Listening to the wind of change
The world is closing in
And did you ever think
The future's in the air
I can feel it everywhere

Take me to the magic of the moment
On a glory night
Where the children of tomorrow dream away
In the wind of change

And distant memories
Are buried in the past forever

And down to Gorky Park

Мимо идут солдaты
Слушaю я ветер перемен
Воздух нaполнен будущим
И чувствуется везде
Той ночи славной
Когда дети грядущего мечтают
Ветер перемен...
Зaковaны в прошлом
По нaбережной Москвы
Иду к пaрку Горького

Bajo al Gorky Park
Escuchando vientos nuevos
Verano atardecer
Soldados al pasar
Escuchando vientos nuevos
Se achica el mundo más
Quien iba a creer
El futuro ya se ve
Se puede hasta tocar
Soplando con los vientos nuevos
Llévame a la magia del momento
De la gloria
Donde los niños del mañana soñarán (Soñarán)
Los cambios que vendrán

I lose control when you look at me like this
There's something in your eyes that is saying tonight
To a new exciting life
It's all written down in your lifelines
It's written down inside your heart
You and i just have a dream
To find our love a place
Where we can hide away
To love each other now
Forever and a day
Time stands still
When days of innocence are falling for the night
I love you girl I always will
I swear i'm there for you until the day I'll die"
