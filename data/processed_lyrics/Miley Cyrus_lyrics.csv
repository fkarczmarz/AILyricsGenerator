" huh-huh
 felt like I could die
 sexy
 make me
 flex it
 and go through the roof
 we can't get it wrong
 yeah
 yeah
 yeah
 sexy
 make me
 flex it
 and go through the roof
 yeah
 like my guitar
 I see all the stars
 hang up that damn phone
 we can't get it wrong
 yeah
 oh
'Round and 'round and away we go
Four-by-four and away we go
'Round and 'round and away we go
And away we go and away we go
Four-by-four and away we go
Police wanna get him and put him in jail
I'ma do whatever to get him his bail
Hooked on donuts and rooster tails
'Round and 'round and away we go
'Round and 'round and away we go
Four-by-four and away we go
'Round and 'round and away we go
And away we go and away we go
Four-by-four and away we go

Pumpin' his breaks to the sound of the beat
Pumpin' his breaks to the sound of the beat
He don't understand what he's doin' to me
'Round and 'round and away we go (Yeah)
'Round and 'round and away we go
Four-by-four and away we go
'Round and 'round and away we go
And away we go and away we go
Four-by-four and away we go
It's twelve o'clock and I don't want to party
My big boyfriend and my big truck hobby
A little bit of dirt never hurt nobody
Now I got dirt all over my body
Might as well lie to L
His big fog lights is bright as hell
Sure you wanna ride with me?
I'm a crazy motherfucker from the Midwest
With a Mississippi flow and a Arch rest
Four-by-four with the altar steps
We doin' donuts underneath the arch (Yes)
A straight-up chick like twelve o'clock
I solemnly swear he was with me all day
'Round and 'round we go
Don't stop 'til I tell you so
'Round and 'round and away we go
'Round and 'round and away we go
Four-by-four and away we go
'Round and 'round and away we go
And away we go and away we go
Four-by-four and away we go
I probably shouldn't say this  but at times  I get so scared
When I think about the previous relationship we shared
It was awesome  but we lost it
It's not possible for me not to care
And now we're standin' in the rain
But nothing's ever gonna change until you hear  my dear
The seven things I hate about you
The seven things I hate about you  oh  you
You're vain  your games  you're insecure
You love me  you like her
You make me laugh  you make me cry
I don't know which side to buy
Your friends  they're jerks
When you act like them  just know it hurts
I wanna be with the one I know
And the seventh thing I hate the most that you do
You make me love you
It's awkward and silent  as I wait for you to say
But what I need to hear now  your sincere apology
When you mean it  I'll believe it
If you text it  I'll delete it
Let's be clear (Clear  clear)
Oh  I'm not comin' back
You're taking seven steps here

When you act like them  just know it hurts
I wanna be with the one I know
And the seventh thing I hate the most that you do
You make me love you
And compared to all the great things
That would take too long to write
I probably should mention the seven that I like
The seven things I like about you
Your hair  your eyes  your old Levi's
When we kiss  I'm hypnotized
You make me laugh  you make me cry
But I guess that's both I'll have to buy
Your hand in mine
When we're intertwined  everything's alright
I wanna be with the one I know
And the seventh thing I like the most that you do
You make me love you
(Sha  sha)
You do  oh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Hey
Are you listenin'?
Wonderin' where you've been
All my life
I just started livin'
Are you listenin'? Oh-oh
When you say you love me
Know I love you more
And when you say you need me
Know I need you more
Boy  I adore you
I adore you
Baby  can you hear me
When I'm cryin' out for you?
But when you're near me  uh
I feel like I'm standin' with an army
Of men armed with weapons

When you say you love me
Know I love you more (I love you more)

Boy  I adore you

Flowers in hand  waiting for me
Every word in poetry
Won't call me by name  only baby
The more that you give  the less that I need
Everyone says I look happy
When it feels right
I know that you're wrong for me
Gonna wish we never met on the day I leave
I brought you down to your knees
'Cause they say that misery loves company
It's not your fault I ruin everything
And it's not your fault I can't be what you need
Baby  angels like you can't fly down here with me
I'm everything they said I would be
La  la  la
I'm everything they said I would be
I'll put you down slow  love you goodbye
Before you let go  just one more time
Take off your clothes  pretend that it's fine
A little more hurt won't kill you

Close your eyes

You thinkin' that I'm sleepin' when I'm creepin' in the night
They say it's bad karma when you live a double life
They say it's bad karma being such a heartbreaker
I've always picked a giver 'cause I've always been the taker
I'd rather just do it  then I'll think about it later  uh-huh

You got a mean drummer face
Alright  I was sleeping next to him but I was dreaming about the other dude
And then all of a sudden  everything that he fucking did just made me cringe and it was so hard to fall in but so easy just to fall back right out again
This whole time  I could give to you and I could paint you pictures but I guess I could just never write a song and then maybe I'd never fell out of love with him in the first place
You're giving me a feeling in my head
Laying in my bed just thinking
Not really feeling like the one I want
Takes everything in me not to call him
I told all my friends I'm moving on
Your baby talk is creeping me out
Fuck me so you stop baby talking
You know what  in the beginning it was like we were fucking homies and shit and then all of a sudden you started with some fucking baby goo-goo tongue down my fucking throat
I mean  even in front of your mom
Dude  as if I'm not fucking awkward enough
I mean  you put me in these fucking situations where I look like a dumbass bitch and I'm not a fucking dumbass bitch

I'm feeling like I'm gonna vomit
I don't really wanna let go of you
I heard I change my mind way too often
Your baby talk is creeping me out
Fuck me so you stop baby talking
Alright  so  I'm gonna be honest
It's the super cutey shit  that's the main issue here
I mean  I'm fucking what?
Like  why the fuck would I wanna lick your teeth but I do
And remember there was that one time that I had like a 15 minute...
Well  that was kind of the best thing in the entire world
You know  maybe I could just get past this shit and I could get used to someone giving a fuck
I'm sorry I called you a creep and that thing about the vomit
Fuck me so you'll stop baby talking
Fuck me so you'll stop baby talking
Fuck me so you'll stop baby talking
Fuck me so you'll stop baby talking
I don't really wanna get over you
I heard I change my mind way too often
Baby talk is creeping me out

It's fine 'cause I'm in the mood

And you know we're gonna be alright
We'll be sleeping on a red-eye flight
Keep up with me 'til the end of the night
And we're just gettin' started
Always last to leave the party
Drugs rule everything around me
Wake up with new tattoos on my body
Drugs rule everything around me
We're all tryna fill the lonely
Drugs rule everything around me

Kinda dream that can't be sold
We were right 'til we weren't
Built a home and watched it burn
Started to cry  but then remembered I
I can buy myself flowers
Write my name in the sand
Talk to myself for hours
Say things you don't understand
I can take myself dancing
And I can hold my own hand
Yeah  I can love me better than you can

Match the roses that you left

But then you went around
And did what you wanted to do
And now I'm cryin'  cryin'
Ooh  it seemed like everything was going fine
I found the love that I thought was gonna last
Then I accidentally saw a few things in your cell
I even LOL'd
Man  I should've known
Why? Why you're doing what you do?
You  you might as well just tell the honest truth
See  I'm not really down with this
This ain't no texting shit
I don't really have much to say
I was over it the second that I saw her name
One of them's F and the other one's U
'Cause what you gotta do is go get yourself a clue
One of them's F and the other one's U

Oh  I know what's been goin' on
Don't even try to act like Mr. Super Nonchalant
What makes you think I'll stick around?
I'm not as stupid as you sound
And you sound really dumb right now
From A to Zed  ooh-ah
I got a lot of nasty things floating up in my head
But none of them are worth my time
You're not even worth this rhyme
And I don't  I don't give a flying

 they're both the same
 I don't need your past
 you don't have to ask
 but you can't resist
 you came here
 I don't need your past
 you don't have to ask
 babe
 babe
I was thinkin' about my life
And the questions made more questions
Starin' out into the night
Put my hand into hellfire
I did it all to make you love me and to feel alive
The old boys hold all the cards and they ain't playin' gin
I should walk away
But I think I'll stay
There are layers to this body
Primal sex and primal shame
They told me I should cover it
So I went the other way
I was tryin' to own my power
Still I'm tryin' to work it out
And at least it gives the paper somethin' they can write about

And his heart's an iron vault

And get blinded by their shine
Maybe caring for each other's just too 1969
The old boys hold all the cards and they ain't playin' gin
I should walk away
But I think I'll stay
I have too much to lose
So I think I'll stay
Past the manta rays and palm trees
Glowing creatures beamed down from great heights
Electric eels and red venom
My friend Big Twitchy rode the boat into the light
Surfed to the north break
We danced until there was nothing left
Just me and Twitchy
'Cause that's all we knew
How I'm doing what I'm doing in a fucking handstand

We took it kinda fast but you put it in slow

If it still hurts at all
I thought one of these days you might call
When you were feelin' small
Drownin' in my thoughts
Starin' at the clock
And I know I'm not on your mind
I wonder what would happen if I die
I hope all of my friends get drunk and high
Would it be too hard to say goodbye?
I hope that it's enough to make you cry
Maybe that day  you won't hate me
Go ahead  you can say that I've changed
Just say it to my face
One drink and I'm back to that place (To that place)
The memories won't fade (Won't fade)
Drownin' in my thoughts (My thoughts)

I hope that it's enough to make you cry
Got my mind goin' places it ain't wanna go
Sometimes I get a little too low
And I can't see myself through the fire and smoke
Shinin' through a door that I can't keep closed
Always buildin' cities on the hearts that you broke
I still feel high
I still feel high
Sometimes I stay up all night
'Cause you don't ever talk to me in my dreams
And I think about eventually you're holdin' me
And dancin' to the record like a movie scene
I still feel high
I still feel high

There will be no trees or air for us to breathe
I start feeling mad  but then I feel inspired
Thinkin' about the days
Coming home with dirty feet from playing with my dad
All day in the creek
He somehow has a way of knowing what to say
So when I'm feeling sad  he makes me feel inspired
We are meant for more
You're the handle on the door that opens up to change
I know it sounds so strange
To think we are meant for more
You're the handle on the door that opens up the change
I know that sounds so strange
Because you always felt so small  but know you aren't at all
And I hope you feel inspired
Oh  I hope you feel inspired
How can we escape all the fear and all the hate?
Is anyone watching us down here?

 but never said I was sorry
 isn't it a shame that it ended like that?
 but you never unpacked
 but we never came back
 so you take it too far
 and it hurts me
 but you'd never say that
 but we never came back
 it won't be easy
I never sat by the shore under the sun with my feet in the sand
But you brought me here and I'm happy that you did
'Cause now I'm as free as birds catchin' the wind
And sometimes I get so scared of what I can't understand
The sky's more blue in Malibu
Next to you in Malibu
Next to you (Baby)
We watched the sun go down as we were walkin'
I'd spend the rest of my life just standing here talkin'
You would explain the current as I just smile
Hoping that you'll stay the same and nothing will change
That's when I make a wish to swim away with the fish
'Cause it's supposed to be this hot all summer long
I never would've believed you if three years ago you told me
I'd be here writing this song

We are just like the waves that flow back and forth
Sometimes I feel like I'm drowning and you're there to save me
And I wanna thank you with all of my heart
The second that you said you loved me
Started questioning us
Are we really in love?
Tryna figure out chapter three
But you're not giving me anything
If this is what we are  then I gotta move on
You think this is everything  but this is no book of love
You might think I'm crazy
That I'm lost and foolish leaving you behind
Maybe you're right
You might think I'm crazy
That I'm lost and foolish leaving you behind
Maybe you're right
Maybe you're right
Here comes the part of you and me
Arguing about nothing
You tell me it's as good as it gets
Yeah  I'm real emotional
Blame it on your mental jokes
How much did you think that I could take?
So much for taking this too far
You can't blame me for who I am
It's too late for us to try to be in love right now

I look at you
You appear just like a dream to me
Just like kaleidoscope colors that
Every breath that I breathe
Don't you know you're beautiful?
When the waves are flooding the shore
And I can't find my way home anymore
I look at you
I look at you
We jumped  never asking why
We kissed  I fell under your spell
A love no one could deny
Don't you ever say I just walked away
I will always want you
I can't live a lie  running for my life
I will always want you
I came in like a wrecking ball
I never hit so hard in love
All I wanted was to break your walls
All you ever did was wreck me
I put you high up in the sky
And now  you're not coming down
It slowly turned  you let me burn
And now  we're ashes on the ground
Don't you ever say I just walked away
I will always want you
I can't live a lie  running for my life
I will always want you

I came in like a wrecking ball
I never hit so hard in love
All I wanted was to break your walls
All you ever did was wreck me
I came in like a wrecking ball
Yeah  I just closed my eyes and swung
Left me crashing in a blazing fall
All you ever did was wreck me
I never meant to start a war
I just wanted you to let me in
And instead of using force
I guess I should've let you win
I never meant to start a war
I just wanted you to let me in
I guess I should've let you win
Don't you ever say I just walked away
I will always want you
I came in like a wrecking ball
I never hit so hard in love
All I wanted was to break your walls
All you ever did was wreck me
I came in like a wrecking ball
Yeah  I just closed my eyes and swung
Left me crashing in a blazing fall
All you ever did was wreck me
Probably not gon' wanna play me on your station
Pourin' out a bottle full of my frustration
Here to tell you somethin' that you don't know
I'm the type to drive a pickup through your mansion
Maybe gettin' married just to cause a distraction
Here to tell you somethin' that you don't know
Am I wrong that I moved on and I
And I don't even miss you?
Thought that it'd be you until I die
But I let go
What the fuck do I know? I'm alone
'Cause I couldn't be somebody's hero
You want an apology? Not from me
Had to leave you in your own misery
Thought that it'd be you until I die
You might also like
Tryin' to see the stars through the new pollution
Maybe all the chaos is for your amusement
Here to tell you somethin' that you don't know
Wakin' up with people that we met for the first time
What the fuck do I know? I'm alone
'Cause I couldn't be somebody's hero
You want an apology? Not from me
I had to leave you in your own misery
Thought that it'd be you until I die
What?
What the fuck do I know? (Do I know) I'm alone (I'm alone)
'Cause I couldn't be somebody's hero
You want an apology? (Apology) Not from me (Not from me)
I had to leave you in your own misery
Thought that it'd be you until I die
Smoke Cuban cigars and get kicked outta bars before two
But only if it's with you
I wanna drive down to Texas  flip off my exes
But only if it's with you
I got some baggage  let's do some damage
I am not made for no horsey and carriage
You know I'm savage  but you're looking past it
I want that late-night sweet magic  that forever-lasting love
But only if it's with you
Let's crash a wedding tonight  get drunk by the lights
Then I'll pick a fight to make up on the floor of your room
But only if it's with you
I wanna cut off my hair and kick off my boots
But only if it's with you  oh
I got some baggage  let's do some damage
I am not made for no horsey and carriage
You know I'm savage  but you're looking past it
I want that late-night sweet magic  that forever-lasting—
I'm kind of crazy 'cause that's how you make me
But only if it's with you  oh

Only with you

Only with you  yeah

Only with you
You
 I've been asleep"
