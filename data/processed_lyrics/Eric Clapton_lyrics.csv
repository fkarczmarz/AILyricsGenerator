lyrics
"After midnight  we're going to chug-a-lug and shout
We're going to stimulate some action
We're going to get some satisfaction
We're going to find out what it is all about
After midnight  we're going to let it all hang down
After midnight  we're going to shake your tambourine
After midnight  it's all going to be peaches and cream
We're going to cause talk and suspicion
We're going to give an exhibition
We're going to find out what it is all about
After midnight  we're going to let it all hang down
After midnight  we're going to let it all hang down
After midnight  we're going to shake your tambourine
After midnight  it's all going to be peaches and cream
We're going to because talk and suspicion
We're going to give an exhibition
We're going to find out what it is all about
After midnight  we're going to let it all hang down
After midnight  we're going to let it all hang down
After midnight  we're going to let it all hang down
After midnight  we're going to let it all hang down
After midnight  we're going to let it all hang down
The autumn leaves
Of red and gold
I see your lips
The summer kisses
The sunburned hands
I used to hold
Since you went away
The days grow long
And soon I’ll hear
Old winter’s song
But I miss you most of all
My darling
When autumn leaves
You take my heart into everything you do
And it makes me sad for the lonely people
I walked that road for so long
Now I know that I'm one of the lucky people
Your love is making me strong
I've had enough bad love
I need something I can be proud of
I've had enough bad love
No more bad love
And now I see that my life has been so blue
With all the heartaches I had until I met you
But I'm glad to say now that is all behind me
With you here by my side
And there is no more memories to remind me
Your love will keep me alive
Thinking that I might have drove you too far
And I am thinking about the love that you laid on my table
I told you not to wander around in the dark
Do not you notice how the wheel goes around?
And you better pick yourself up from the ground
Before they bring the curtain down
Talking about a girl that looks quite like you
She did not have the time to wait in the queue
Before you accuse me  take a look at yourself
You say I've been spending my money on other women
Taking money from someone else
I called your mama 'bout three or four nights ago
I called your mama 'bout three or four nights ago
Before you accuse me  take a look at yourself
Before you accuse me  take a look at yourself
You say I've been spending my money on other women
You've been taking money from someone else
You know I don't know how to quit you  I'm gonna lose my mind

Pull one down for you
Shine it on my heart
So you could see the truth
That this love I have inside
Is everything it seems
But for now I find
It's only in my dreams
And I can change the world
I will be the sunlight in your universe
You would think my love was really something good
Baby if I could change the world
If I could be king
Even for a day
I'd take you as my queen
I'd have it no other way
And our love would rule
In this kingdom we have made
'Til then I'd be a fool
Wishing for the day

And his smile so bright
In his hands are the toys you gave
To fill his heart with delight
And in the ring stands a circus clown
Holding up a knife
What you see and what you will hear
Will last you for the rest of your life
There ain't no easy way round
All you friends gather round
Because the circus left town
Little man with his heart so pure
And his love so fine
Stick with me and I'll ride with you
'Til the end of the line
Hold my hand and I'll walk with you
Through the darkest night
And every little thing will be all right

Fell down on my knees
I went down to the crossroads
Fell down on my knees
Asked the Lord above for mercy
I went down to the crossroads
Tried to flag a ride
I went down to the crossroads
Tried to flag a ride
Nobody seemed to know me
Everybody passed me by
I am going down to Rosedale
Take my rider by my side
I am going down to Rosedale
Take my rider by my side
On the riverside
Tell my friend-boy Willie Brown
Tell my friend-boy Willie Brown
And I am standing at the crossroads
 just so troubled
 to make it you've got to try
 that's no lie
 to make it you've got to try
 that's no lie
 just so troubled
How many bridges I have got to cross?
How many times must I explain myself
Before I can talk to the boss?
Before I can talk to the boss?
How many times must I say I love you
Before you finally understand?
Won't you be my forever woman?
I will try to be your forever man
Try to be your forever man
How many times must I say I love you
Before you finally understand?
Won't you be my forever woman?
I will try to be your forever man
Try to be your forever man

 it made you sing
 we did not go far
 and suddenly then
 I have opened the door
 would I make you sing?
Me and my wife settled down
Now me and my wife are parted
Gonna take another stroll downtown
Irene goodnight  Irene goodnight
Goodnight Irene  Goodnight Irene
I'll see you in my dreams
Stop rambling  stop your gambling
Stop staying out late at night
Come home to your wife and your family
And sit by the fire so bright
I love Irene  God knows I do
Love her 'til the rivers run dry
If Irene should ever turn her back on me
Gonna take morphine and die
So much you tremble in pain?
Have you ever loved a woman>
So much you tremble in pain?
And all the time you know
She bears another man his name
But you just love that woman
You just love that woman
But all the time you know
She belongs to your very best friend
Have you ever loved a woman?
And you know you cannot leave her alone?
Have you ever loved a woman?
And you know you cannot leave her alone?
Something deep inside of you
I saw a flower glowing in the dark
It looked so pretty and it was unique
I had to bend down just to have a peek
It is really good to see you once again
It is really good to see you once again
I saw you walking underneath the stars
I could not stop cause I was in a car
I am sure the distance would not be too far
If I got out and walked to where you are
It is really good to see you once again
It is really good to see you once again
An old man passed me on the street today
I thought I knew him but I could not say
I stopped to think if I could place his frame
When he tipped his hat I knew his name

Tonight I feel broken in two
I've seen the stars fall from the sky
Holy Mother  can't keep from crying

Holy Mother  hear my prayer
Somehow I know you're still there
Send me please some peace of mind
Take away this pain
Holy Mother  hear my cry
I've cursed your name a thousand times
I've felt the anger running through my soul
All I need is a hand to hold
Oh  I feel the end has come
No longer my legs will run

Would you know my name if I saw you in Heaven?
Would you be the same if I saw you in Heaven?
I must be strong and carry on
A feeling soon begins to overtake me
There is love and there is hate
And down at my core is the hottest part
I can burn without fuel
If it should become too cold
I know I can endure the frostbite
I keep myself so close to my side
Just as the river runs into the sea
Is deafening the silence all around me

And down at my core is the hottest part
I can burn without fuel
And I will give you secrets too
An attitude that you may borrow
A gypsy woman said to me
One thing you must bear in your mind
You are young and you are free
But damned if you're deceased in your own lifetime
And down at my core is the hottest part
We can run without fuel
It's burning
This has gotta stop
Enough is enough
I can't take this BS any longer
It's gone far enough
If you wanna claim my soul
You'll have to come and break down this door
I knew that something was going on wrong
When you started laying down the law
I can't move my hands
I break out in sweat
I wanna cry
Can't take it anymore
This has gotta stop
Enough is enough
I can't take this BS any longer

I've been around
Seen it all
And I'm used to being free
I know who I am
Try to do what's right
So lock me up and throw away the key
This has gotta stop
Enough is enough
I can't take this BS any longer
It's gone far enough
If you wanna claim my soul
You'll have to come and break down this door
Thinkin' of my kids
What's left for them
And then what's coming down the road
The light in the tunnel
Could be the southbound train
This has gotta stop
Enough is enough
I can't take this BS any longer
It's gone far enough

Driving in a Pontiac
Just about to lose my mind
I was going to Arizona
Maybe on to California
Where people all live so fine
My mama says I am crazy
My baby calls me lazy
But I am going to show them all this time
Because you know I ain't no fool
And I don't need no more damn schooling
I was born to just walk the line
Living on Tulsa Time
Living on Tulsa Time
Going to set my watch back to it
Because you know that I have been through it
Living on Tulsa Time
So there I was in Hollywood
Thinking I was doing good
Talking on the telephone line
They do not want me in the movies
And nobody sings my songs
My mama says my baby's doing fine

Then I started thinking
That I really had a flash this time
That I had no business leaving
And nobody would be grieving
You see I am on Tulsa time
Living on Tulsa Time
Living on Tulsa Time
Going to set my watch back to it
Because you know that I have been through it
Living on Tulsa Time
Living on Tulsa Time
Living on Tulsa Time
Going to set my watch back to it

She puts on her makeup and brushes her long blonde hair
And then she asks me  Do I look all right?
We go to a party and everyone turns to see
This beautiful lady that's walking around with me
And then she asks me  Do you feel all right?
I feel wonderful because I see the love light in your eyes
And the wonder of it all is that you just don't realize
How much I love you
It's time to go home now and I've got an aching head
So I give her the car keys and she helps me to bed
And then I tell her  as I turn out the light"
