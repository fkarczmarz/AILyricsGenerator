lyrics
"We fell in love on a Sunday
Yeah I'll never forget
The way that you spelled my name
It took me a year
To find a new attraction
My hope and my fear
Is human interaction
Yeah I just want my love automatic
If artificial love makes sense
Artificial intelligence
Artificial
Artificial
Remember when we met?
I got obsessed on a Monday
And I'll never forget
I felt such a cliche
I'm wanting to be there
Dreaming of your soft skin
With no emotion
You can really make my head spin

It's all too real
Love the way you love me
Artificial intelligence
Way you love me
Love the way you love me
It's so clear
You make everything inside me feel
Just automatic hurt
Bring me back tonight
All the right friends in all the right places
So yeah  we're going down
They've got all the right moves and all the right faces
So yeah  we're going down
Let's paint the picture of the perfect place
They've got it better than when anyone's told ya
They'll be the King of Hearts  and you're the Queen of Spades
Then we'll fight for you like we were your soldiers
I know we got it good  but they got it made
And their grass is getting greener each day
I know things are looking up  but soon they'll take us down
Before anybody's knowing our name
They've got all the right friends in all the right places
So yeah  we're going down
They've got all the right moves and all the right faces

Do you think I'm special? Do you think I'm nice?
Am I bright enough to shine in your spaces?
Between the noise you hear  and the sounds you like
Are we just sinking in an ocean of faces?
It can't be possible that rain could fall
Only when it's over our heads
The sun is shining everyday  but it's far away
Over the world instead
They've got  they've got all the right friends in all the right places
So yeah  we're going down
They've got all the right moves and all the right faces

I know I could never be
Someone that'll look like you
It don't matter what you say
I know I could never fake

Got me ten feet off the ground
And I'm hearin' what you're saying
But I just can't make a sound
You tell me that you need me
Tell me that you're sorry
I sing this song mad but not mad enough to shoot you
In the morning with the roosters
On the corner with the boosters
And she's the fresh-cut and they're on her like sutures
I don't wanna see another hurricane
You will end up on the track of an on-comin' train

And all this shit is takin' place right in front of the daughter
Looking for answers all alone in the darkness of night

And I'm hearing what you're saying

Didn't think I'd turn around and say

Oh  that sunshine 'bout to come my way
May we never ever shed another tear for today
'Cause oh  I know that there'll be better days
Waking up in California
But these clouds  they won't go away
Every day is like another storm  yeah
I'm just trying not to go insane
Yeah  and the city's shining so bright
So many dark nights  so many dark days
But any time I feel the paranoia
I close my eyes and I pray
Oh  I know that there'll be better days
Oh  that sunshine 'bout to come my way
May we never ever shed another tear for today
'Cause oh  I know that there'll be better days
Been waking up to a new year
Got the past million miles away
I been waking up with a new fear (New fear)

Whatever you do  don't worry 'bout me

Lately I don't set alarms
But that's because of the ringing that's happening inside my head
Inside my head
It keeps me safe from harm
At least I tell myself I'm safe from harm
But really it's probably filling my dreams with dread
So I get out of bed
Can't take vacations in the brain
Hawaii under warm sun
I think I lost my mind but don't worry 'bout me
Happens all the time
In the morning I'll be better
In the morning I'll be better

Happens all the time

I was born  born to love you
Bust through the door said  What’s your name
Looking for somebody and you match the shame
Now don’t lie
Don't lie
You’ve seen the television and you know what’s up
The world's going crazy and you’re mighty stuck
So don’t lie
So don’t lie
I said here that’s where I’ll be living until my times up
Yeah found someone to keep my head up
Yeah  trading darkness for the dawn
I was born  born to love you
I was born  born to love you
Lost in stars since she was a girl
She dreamt of a place of a better world
It felt like sunlight
Tired of the days living in the dark
She ran to the place where the wild things are
It felt right
Cause it felt right

Ain't no doubt about it
No way to hide that sort of thing
Now I'm waiting for something better
Ain't nothing better worth imagining
I'm building bridges that I know you never wanted
Now own every single road that I could take
I said I...
Set me on fire
You can burn my bridges down
Send this out to sea
Send it where you want it
You can take your no for no or not at all
There's no filling up your spaces with fictionary places

Lord knows I’d cry if I was able
But that won’t get me through tomorrow
And no it’s not like I was counting
Or thought that we’d run out of days
So I’ll be holding onto something
Breathing the air you took away
And choke on the memories
And choke on the memories
Well I’ve been looking for some new words
To say just how you got to me
I wrote some letters that I might burn
Cause then you’re not just history
And I see your clothes in the closet
I hear your phone ring in the drawer
I’m not hoping for an answer

Do you need me every day and night?
We could feel this darkness with each other

But I’m tired of justifying
So I say to you
Come home  come home
'Cause I've been waiting for you
For so long  for so long
And right now there's a war between the vanities
But all I see is you and me
And the fight for you is all I've ever known
So come home
Ooh
I get lost in the beauty
Of everything I see
The world ain't half as bad
As they paint it to be
If all the sons  all the daughters
Stopped to take it in
Well  hopefully  the hate subsides
And the love can begin

Didn't we  didn't we  didn't we fly?
Know that I  know that I still care for you
But didn't we  didn't we say goodbye?
Swear I saw your face
At a coffee shop on 8th
Or maybe it was in my mind
And I swear that I heard your laugh
From a person that walked past me
At a party the other night
Never thought we'd ever have to go without

Address to places like Abbey Road

This has gotta be the good life
Like this city is on fire tonight

 we'd fight 'til I would give in
 perfect disasters
 reaching for the rafters
 we were sleeping in cars
 perfect disasters
 swinging from the rafters
 we were dancing in cars
Worn to the bones
I told myself  this could get rough
You came to me and said  that's enough
Oh  I know that this love is pain
But we can't cut it from out these veins  no
So I'll hit the lights and you lock the doors
We ain't leaving this room 'til we both feel more
Don't walk away  don't roll your eyes
Ah-ooh-ooh  ah-ooh-ooh
When  when you came home
Worn to the bones
I told myself  this could get rough
Oh  I know you're feeling insane
Tell me something that I can explain  oh
