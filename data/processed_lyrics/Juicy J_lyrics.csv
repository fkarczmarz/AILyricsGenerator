"So you niggas know what it is  4/20 bitch
High ain't no coming down
Roll up let's burn up
Turn up ain't no turning down
Chasing this fast money ain't no slowing down
Hol' up let's pour up for up cause it's going down
High ain't no coming down
Roll up let's burn up
Turn up ain't no turning down
Chasing this fast money ain't no slowing down
Hol' up let's pour up for up cause it's going down
Break it down  rolling up
My money too long can't fold it up
Poured up I'm drunk as fuck
I take more alcohol than a open cut
Early morning getting to the bread
So I call it breakfast in bed
Real nigga don't believe in ghost
But I'm stil chasing these dead prez
My eyes so low  I'm so lit
I might nod off after one more hit
In a foreign whip with a foreign bitch
I live every night like a porno flick
Bitch don't kill my vibe  ho don't kill my buzz
Bitch I'm so fresh and clean but my cup is full of mud
If she not fucking she gotta go
One monkey won't stop the show
I'm backstage with a flock of hoes
And I'm getting blowed like snotty noes
Hollywood I'm still stuntin'  makin' paper all around the country

Chasing this fast money ain't no slowing down
Hol' up let's pour up for up cause it's going down
High ain't no coming down
Roll up let's burn up
Turn up ain't no turning down
Chasing this fast money ain't no slowing down
Hol' up let's pour up for up cause it's going down
Let's blow it all can't take it with us
Step out the car they takin' pictures
That's paparazzi  that's TMZ
My Mercedes Benz that's AMG
Eyes like I'm chinese  out in Tokyo
Check my passport homie I do global shows
And I stay high ain't coming down
Smoking light green  don't fuck with brown
Rollin' up that loud  your dope ain't making no sound
I roll through the hood in that new Bugatti coupe
Pull up on yo baby momma  she treat my dick like a flute
Juicy J killin' the game  go ahead and buy you a suit
I spend yo ho signing bonus on just one pair of shoes
Let's get high-igh-igh-igh-igh-igh
Pour up a deuce
Matter fact make that four
Ok  now you got the juice
High ain't no coming down
Roll up let's burn up
Turn up ain't no turning down
Chasing this fast money ain't no slowing down
Hol' up let's pour up for up cause it's going down
High ain't no coming down
Roll up let's burn up
Turn up ain't no turning down
Chasing this fast money ain't no slowing down
Hol' up let's pour up for up cause it's going down
And I stay high  ain't coming down
Smoke light green  don't fuck with brown
Stay high  ain't coming down
Smoke light green  don't fuck with brown
And I stay high  ain't coming down
Smoke light green  don't fuck with brown
Stay high  ain't coming down
Smoke light green  don't fuck with brown
Shut the fuck up!

Mike WiLL Made-It
This that higher level stunting  make it rain a lot of hundreds
Gave that chick 30k to go get rid of her stomach
I'm a triple OG nigga 20 years and running
All my niggas down to ride like crash test dummies
And J don't stand in line  I ain't never had to wait
I'm the realest in this game  I ain't never had to fake
Forgiatos on the classic like that bitch got on some skates
Having dinner with Obama smelling like a pound of hay
I might blow a pound a day  smoking KK like a hippie
In the 60's with this chick  tryna give my dick a hickey
Had to get it out the mud  no wonder why I'm filthy rich
And I'm running through this money
Like it don't mean nothing to me  I might
Buy the highest bottle like it ain't nothing
Bitch  I'll buy 20 bottles worth of clothes like it ain't nothing
Drop a hundred thou' like it ain't nothing
Bitch  I'll go and buy a brand new car like it ain't nothing
Buy a new crib like it ain't nothing
Bitch  I'll go and buy a ton of bad bitches like it ain't nothing
Pull a hundred hoes  man it ain't nothing
When you getting money  stacks chips ain't nothing (Mafia!)

Pull up in the lowrider two hoes behind us
Police say that they can smell it but I make sure they don't find it
'Bout to build another whip and I ain't even got to brag
Three women got that bitch leanin'
Young Khalifa got the women screamin'
Done deal  done deal
When I pull up  it's a done deal
Lift the trunk  still rolling up
And I got one in the front  two in the back
Do what I want  don't need to relax
King of my city  I'm living to show 'em
I cannot be even  three wheelin' in traffic
This '61 I'm building 'bout to be a classic
I'm repping Taylor Gang – they asking  paper or plastic?
Buy the highest bottle like it ain't nothing (Oh shit)
Bitch  I'll buy 20 bottles worth of clothes like it ain't nothing
Drop a hundred thou' like it ain't nothing
Bitch  I'll go and buy a brand new car like it ain't nothing
Buy a new crib like it ain't nothing
Bitch  I'll go and buy a cougar bad bitch like it ain't nothing
Pull a hundred hoes  mane it ain't nothing
Getting paid like ghost do (Ghost do)
In the street  in the club too (Club too)
Designer everything  Ric Flair (Ric Flair)
I can buy the rap game  brick fair
And I run the game like a fucking arcade
If we talking money then I got a raise
Drink so strong  they think I got it laced
Buy the highest bottle like it ain't nothing
Bitch  I'll buy 20 bottles worth of clothes like it ain't nothing
Drop a hundred thou' like it ain't nothing
Bitch  I'll go and buy a brand new car like it ain't nothing

Now she fuck with Jeezy
Don't believe me? The shit's all over TV
That's how she make her dough
Seen her in New York
She say she fuck with Drake
I asked why she out this way
When will niggas learn?
Chicks be so high-class on the internet
She got that bag from Juicy J
She got that ass from Rudy Gaye
Now your silly ass down on one knee
(These hoes)
They for everybody (Everybody)
Still I love these hoes
They for everybody (Everybody)
Funny thing is I fell back out of love quicker
They don't pay attention to love anyway
They only concerned with what the haters say
Bottles be turnin these girls into thots
Instagram turnin these wifes into hoes
No real life they just readin the comments
Mess with a real one and get you exposed
I had a time when my mind was caught up
My niggas was lookin like what is he on
My family was too scared to talk to a nigga
Ain't comin back now the case just got closed
She do what she told
Sharin' is carin' that pussy ain't gold
Sorry you ain't in control
Just make sure you clean off that pole
They turn on the TV and get on the gram
And say that's relationship goals
Trust me don't save em' anything goes with...
(These hoes)
They for everybody (Everybody)
Still I love these hoes
They for everybody (Everybody)
Is you the police? (What? What?)
Why you cuffin' my nigga? (Why you cuffing then?)
Is you the police?
(These hoes)
They for everybody (Everybody)
Still I love these hoes

Loud pack in a plastic bag  smoke out in a gas mask
We party like we college kids  got more money than a powerball
Bitch I live that fast life every day in jet speed

Walkin' out the double tree  with my double cup
Got a nigga leanin' like he hit with uppercut
Ridin' in a such n' such  she like to suck n' fuck
She got that good-good  I'm talkin' touch n' bust
Put two blunts together like extension cords
Smoke the whole 'nother ounce cause a nigga bored
Take your main lady out and have her doin' drugs

Fuckin' hoes after shows  that's credits

32 G's that's a winzip
I'm rollin' up weed 'cause I need it
And I'm throwin' up my state I'm bulimic
Shawty got that meat like steak escape
