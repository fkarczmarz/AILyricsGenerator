lyrics
"I got suspended  ooh  you got suspended
For chiefin' a hunnid blunts  14 400 minutes
Fans all in the stands  they hands for Mr. Bennett
That racket over the net  ooh  give me my tennis
Shoes  give me a minute  ooh  I can't be tardy
My class is already started  they told my mom I'm retarded
But that 10 Day done in one night  Honda from a Hyundai
No tassel in the spring  but after summer I'm alumni
They took my nigga one night  and I was standing right there
An inch away from Heaven  a million songs from right here
A step away from South By  a swing away from Cali
A hook away from verses  I'm a dad away from rapping
So at the school they arrested him  back seat  squad car  nestled in
Shouts to the bitch nigga Heselton
Wit' his Big Show body ass wrestlin'
Finna see the 10 Day Pestilence  so far  so good  so special and
No stars  good jobs  or excellents
And I'm still so fucking non-echelon
Ooh  you got suspended  ooh  you not gon' finish
Ooh  you look familiar  ooh  you look like Kenneth
Damn  they gon' resent it  ooh  you representin'
A class of bad kids  14 400 minutes  ahh

I could spare a rib to get my baby back
I just wanna fall asleep where my baby at
So I don't wake up wondering where my baby at
I wonder if we'll make it back
I wonder Can I pay her back  please
65th and Ingleside
Way before Jamie got his jingles right
I was sleeping with you every single night
But I was still tryna act single right
65th and Ingleside
I was stacking chips like bingo night
I didn't have to pay for a single light
So I'ma make sure everything go right

Your sister owned the house we lived in
On the East Side that you rented
Little two flat  inexpensive
I didn't have a glove to pitch in
I didn't have a pot to piss in
Not to mention in Dro City
Not a lot of jobs with pensions
All my raps was 'bout suspension
Then one day Donald took me on tour
Young broke Chano ain't broke no more
Thought you wouldn't want me come and darken your doorstep
But I still haven't given you what's yours yet
65th and Ingleside
Moved downtown for a single life
None of my stars ever twinkled bright
'Til God decide to come bring you by
There's a way  out of no way
Swear I know everything's gonna be okay
So you know
There's a way  out of no way
Swear I know everything's gonna be okay
Gonna be okay
Where's the return on investment? My first A&R
That shit was played unless you would hit play in the car
We hit the Shell station  I tell you stay in the car
Back in the spot  don't put it in park
Leave that bitch running in case I come running
There it get late 'fore it's dark
Kensli couldn't play in the park
Now she could play in the stars
High rise  eye to eye with fireworks
So high your ears fire  they might've burst
Every time they buy a verse  I buy a purse
But you can't buy back time  that's just not how it works
Three jobs  you afforded the crib
Fuck child support  you supported the kid
A full rack a month  nothing short of my rib
So you first up  go in order of dibs
My big homie told me  Nigga growth and development
Go and settle down  don't settle for settlement
She got you closer to God than you two ever been
She moved over from Evanston  you moved over from Eggleston
First lady you knew  you can't marry her?
Got shit sonny  now you can't share?
New Dad step in  you can’t stare?
You knew the power in the woman that could lead you in prayer
On 65th and Ingleside
Feel like you remember every single lie
Truth is I just really need your finger size
So I can make sure that they make the ring so tight
There's a way  out of no way
Swear I know everything's gonna be okay
So you know
There's a way  out of no way
Swear I know everything's gonna be okay
Wore my jacket as a cape  and my umbrella as a cane
The richest man rocks the snatch-less necklace
Spineless bitches in backless dresses
Wore my feelings on my sleeveless
My weed seedless  my trees leafless
I miss my diagonal grilled cheeses
And back when Mike Jackson was still Jesus
Before I believed in not believing in
Cigarette stained smile all covered in sin
My big homie died young  just turned older than him
He still be screaming  I see his demons in empty hallways
I trip to make the fall shorter
Fall quarter was just a tall order
And I'm hungry  I'm just not that thirsty
As of late  all my verses seem not so verse-y
And all my words just mean controversy
Took the team up off my back  like That's not your jersey?
All this medicine in me hoping I don't get sick
Making all of this money hoping I don't get rich
'Cause niggas still getting bodied for foams
Sometimes the truth don't rhyme
Sometime the lies get millions of views
Funerals for little girls  is that appealing to you?
From your cubicle desktop  what a beautiful view
I think love is beautiful too
Building forts from broken dams  what a hoover could do
For future hoopers dead from Rugers
Shooting through the empty alley
Could've threw him an alley-oop
Helping him do good in school
Damn that acid burn when it clean ya
I still miss being a senior
And performing at all those open mic events
Eyes closed  eyes closed seeing arenas
And I still get jealous of Vic
And Vic's still jealous of me
But if you touch my brother
All that anti-violence shit goes out the window along with you
And the rest of your team
Smoking cigarettes to look cooler
I only stop by to look through ya
And I'm only getting greedier
And I'm still Mr. Youmedia
And I still can't find Talent
And I'm still choosing classmates that wouldn't fuck
Mom still thinks I should go back to school
And Justin still think I'm good enough
And Mama Jan still don't take her meds
And I still be asking God to show his face
And I still be asking God to show his face

You gotta click it or ticket
You gotta go get the gettin' before it's gone
End it quickly as it begun
Been a minute since Eminem was a blonde
I need a peace prize‚ mom invented the bomb
A nigga wanted more‚ I would only sit on the lawn
A nigga up next like strongly scented colognes
I'm 'bout to book a show at the Dimmsdale Dimmadome
I still could hit up Sony today and get a loan
And shout out to Miss Sylvia Rhone‚ we get along
But that boy advance gotta be bigger than Diddy Kong
I need stock and it gotta be Pippi Long
My next tour got eight legs like daddy long
I'm 'bout to have two kids that like daddy's song

I got my city doing front flips
When every father  mayor  rapper jump ship
I guess that's why they call it where I stay
Clean up the streets so my daughter can have somewhere to play
I'm the blueprint to a real man
Some of these niggas toss they tassel for a deal  man
I ain't goin' to hell or to Hillman
I got caught up with a little Xan
Couldn't stop me  but it slowed me  though
Yeah  a nigga famous  you don't know me though
But every DJ still play me  though
Damn  I don't even need a radio
And my new shit sound like a rodeo
Got the old folks dancing the do-si-do
'Til they fuck around  sign me to OVO
Ooh  I just might share my next one with Keef
Got the industry in disbelief  they be asking for beef
This what it sound like when God split a atom with me
I even had Steve giving out apples for free

It's too many young angels on the southside
Got us scared to let our grandmamas outside
You gon' make me take the campers way downtown
You gon' make me turn my BM to my housewife
I just had a growth spurt
It done took so long  my tippy toes hurt
You can keep the nose ring  I don't have to soul search
I'm still at my old church  only ever sold merch
Grandma say I'm Kosher  mama say I'm culture
GCI  107.5  angel goin' live

I speak of promised lands
Soil as soft as mama's hands
Running water standing still
Endless fields of daffodils and chamomile
Rice under black beans
Walked into Apple with cracked screens
And told prophetic stories of freedom
Found warmth in a Black queen for when I get cold like Nat King
I'm doing the dad thing
I speak of wondrous  unfamiliar lessons from childhood
Make you remember how to smile good
I'm pre-currency  post-language  anti-label  pro-famous
I'm Broadway Joe Namath
Kanye's best prodigy
He ain't signed me  but he proud of me
I got some ideas that you gotta see
Make a vid with shorty and they ship it like the Odyssey
They never seen a rapper practice modesty
I never practice  I only perform
I don't even warn  I don't eat it warm  I won't be reborn
I speak to God in public
I speak to God in public  He keep my rhymes in couplets
He think the new shit jam  I think we mutual fans
I used to dance to Michael  I used to dance in high school
I used to pass out music  I still pass out music
The people's champ must be everything the people can't be
I'm getting artsy-fartsy  house full of some Hebru Brantleys
You must've missed the come-up  I must be all I can be
Call me Mister Mufasa  I had to master stampedes

I'm gon' praise Him  praise Him 'til I'm gone
When the praises go up  the blessings come down

It seems like blessings keep falling in my lap

I don't make songs for free  I make 'em for freedom
Don't believe in kings  believe in the Kingdom
Chisel me into stone  prayer whistle me into song air
Dying laughing with Krillin saying something 'bout blonde hair
Said you the man of the house now  look out for your family
He has ordered my steps   gave me a sword with a crest
And gave Donnie a trumpet in case I get shortness of breath
I'm gon' praise Him  praise Him 'til I'm gone (Don't be mad)

That's the dual principle  sometimes I'ma be about some hoes
Sometimes I'ma wanna make a movie
And when it come to rapping fast  I'm the Higgs Boson (Yeah)
And though my style freakish
I could still break your body down to five pieces like I did Voltron
'Cause I'm addicted to the craft and I be off a OG
Never scared of mean spirits  methamphetamine lyrics
Cooler like I'm off of codeine  low key
Don't be so judgmental  even though I'm reminiscing
If I don't know what I miss is
I'ma end up figuring out that it's home
And my mother and my grandmother cocoa butter kisses
This is just a testament to the ones that raised me
The ones that I praise and I'm thanking
I need 'em but the chronic all up in my clothes
And I wanna get a hug  and I can't 'cause I'm stanking
Never too old for a spanking  IGH!

The  summers all lasted forever?
Hold that feeling forever
I remember the summer Lil' Chano got ahold of his household
The  same summer that widowed Gwyneth Paltrow
Back  when I could trust in my dogs like Balto
Never sold out but now we out-sold
That  was the summer I learned to love the great outdoors
Learned you get the feds if you can't keep yo' mouth closed
That summer left a couple marks like Groucho
That summer left a couple tan lines
I love my city they let me cut the line on the Dan Ryan
They walk on eggshells and landmines
They communicate with handsigns
Do you remember how when you were younger
The summers all lasted forever?
Hold that feeling forever
Do you remember how when you were younger
The summers all lasted forever?
Hold that feeling forever

None of my niggas ain't had no dad
None of my niggas ain't have no choice
JJ  Mikey  Lil Derek and them
79th Street was America then
Ice cream truck and the beauty supply
Blockbuster movies and Harold's again
We were still catchin' lightnin' bugs when the plague hit the backyard
Had to come in at dark 'cause the big shorties act hard
Okay now  day camp at Grand Crossing
First day  niggas shootin'
Summer school get to losin' students
But the CPD getting new recruitment
Our summer don't  our summer  our summer don't get no shine no more
Our summer die  our summertime don't got no time no more
'Cause you're my friend
Summer friends don't stay
You're my friend
Summer friends don't stay  stay around
Summer friends  summer friends
You're my friend
Summer friends don't stay
Summer friends don't stay  hey
Stay around here

Dad was workin' late  he treat the crib like it's a timeshare
I would mow some lawns  fold my ones like a lawn chair  hugh  hugh
Now I'm the same way  overtime all the time  every night  hey
Ready my blessin'  now I'm ready how I wait
Never let a friendship get in my way
Never let a blog get in my way
Make the whole song do whatever I say
79th  79th  79th  hey
79th  79th  79th  hey
Some of my homegirls got lost in the paperwork
They was good friends but I faked the flirt
'Cause if it ain't work  can't make it work
It's been a minute since I called on a friend
Fucked up and fucked all my friends
'Cause you're my friend
All my friends
You're my friend
All my—

Summer friends  summer
You're my friend
Summer friends don't stick around

So lay your head on my table  lay your  lay your head on my table
May the Lord give your journey mercy
May you be successful  grant you favor
And bring you back safely  I love you
When I was so young before I could remember
I would always treat my gang like family members
Even when I changed  a nigga never changed up
I always bring my friends  my friends  my friends  my friends up
When I was so young before I could remember
I would always treat my gang like family members
Even when I changed  a nigga never changed up
 in her way that she love me
 but your grandma ain't my grandma
 and beat the devil by a landslide
 you're my Sunday candy
 cause it's gonna rain
 it's gonna rain
 your peppermints is the truth
 had to match with the shoes
 I came and sat in your pew
 fifty rolls on my plate
 I like my hugs with a scent
 I ain't seen you in a minute let me take my butt to church
 cause it's gonna rain
 it's gonna rain
 Mama you know its gonna rain
 but I made it alright
 I've been waiting all night
 cause it's gonna rain

Now I'm missing work now  but it worked out
Had to buy a crib  'fore I bought my first house
Had my first kid  I love how she turned out
I love how she turned up  even if I'm burned out
I'ma have so many seeds  I could have a birdhouse
I'ma love on they mama  I hope it work out
I hope it work out
Luckily  my ex ugly
I don't eat  so she can't get no lunch with me
I don't reach  so she can't get in touch with me
Can't be buds with me
Don't know what to be
She gon' cuss at me
Told her give it a rest  so I keep custody
Keep it all side-eyes and side-hugs with me
I know that my girl's trust is a luxury
I don't want my next album sounding all Usher-y
But I must confess  I must confess
For every single ex  I want the best
I really wish you nothing but success
I know it's gonna work out

Doesn't it get dark  right before the sun peeks
And bares his face? And doesn't it get so hard to breathe?
But it's gonna work out  it's gonna work out
With nothing left to give  with nothing left to say
When no one says they're wrong  or sets the record straight
That shit might hurt now  but I'm with her now
Don't need closure now  just keep the shirt now
Sorry you were led to believe
Bunch of different stories that was never to be
No you isn't ugly I just said it to be
Funny we both know that you look better than me
Sorry I started runnin' when you ran into me
I'm just tryna be the kinda man I'ma be
And I'm getting better gotta hand it to me
Seem to always work out when you hand it to Jesus
Today I missed my workout  but it worked out
Now I'm missing work now  but it worked out
Had to buy a crib  'fore I bought my first house
Had my first kid  I love how she turned out
I love how she turned up  even if I'm burned out
I'ma have so many seeds  I could have a birdhouse
I'ma love on they mama  I hope it work out
I hope it work out
I believe in long distance love  God that's above
Bond that's so strong can't let y'all bald-headed—
We all gon' meet up in the up  in the upper room
If I run into em'  I'll be ru-running to em'
We could re-run the show  we could re-bump into 'em
If we read the wrong one  we could re-jump the broom
If we read the wrong one  baby we jump the groom
I'm ready to be groomed
I'm ready to assume  the position is filled
I was ret since the womb
I was not made for this  this was made for me
And it's gonna work out
Today I missed my workout  but it worked out
Now I'm missing work now  but it worked out
Had to buy a crib  'fore I bought my first house
Had my first kid  I love how she turned out
I love how she turned up  even if I'm burned out
I'ma have so many seeds  I could have a birdhouse
I'ma love on they mama  I hope it work out
Pretty as my hair
Ugly as my name
Dirty as my gold
Comfy as my chair
Ugly is my name
Ugly is my name
No weapon formed against me shall prosper
My sword look just like Michael's
He lent it to me  this a house of God
I'm just leasing  he rent it to me
This sentence he penned it too
That's a Gmail  he sent it to me
I can send you his contact  hit him if you in combat
Hit him if you in traffic  even if there ain't no static
That's my G  he got me shinin'
My hair  he made it tangled
My seed  don't need no lining
A halo fits on an angel
And if the shoe fits  I'll tie his and let the kiddie rap
Finally give the city back  and ask God for a piggy-back
Up on his shoulders I notice  I'm within earshot
I yell  Thanks for makin' us in your image
To  take a gamble on this love just like we do
What  a wonderfully crazy thing to do
I'm so powerful every time I look at you
No  memory of anything I couldn't do
Once upon a time I was unsure of myself
I would always claim I never had no help
To make your birthstone feel like rhinestone
The caterpillars that had burrowed inside my belly
Started to flutter before I learned how to fly
I had a bunch of midlife crises 'fore I turned twenty-five
I had to bury all the dancing that would burgeon inside
I turn to Casper any time a nigga turn on the slide
I had Jesus behind the wheel before I learned how to drive
'Cause it's poss'...

At being a good wife and giving a good life
To both of her lil' girls with ballerina tights
She called up the RE/MAX and opened her own site
And my mama sealed my fate when she opened the invite
The party was a good mixture of employees and friends
She told the people comin' to make sure they bring their kids
After we arrived and after standing around
Out from the back came three lil' survivors
All of these moments left up to chance
Everything will go right as it can
It's possible

To a pair of fair rings I would share with the bride
Every kiss begins with Claire's cut clarity size
Now we live in fear of doin' what our parents was tryin'
So every Rapunzel don't got the kind of hair you can climb
They say these boots were made for dancing like Mary J. Blige
Life'll never really end up like the start
We learned together how the back door feels
And we was jumping over brooms in tobacco fields
Until the white man found out black votes steal elections
It's still black folks at the back door still
And all they privacy been invaded
Almost every trait I got through the slave owner gone
Sometimes love come with its own barricade

Had to fly to Canada and sneak into the land
And I came in realizing nothing free in the land
I met my husband when I was seventeen out in Queens
While he was up North for a body
I bodied everybody and got known for my body
'Bout to walk down the aisle and be a mommy
Now I wouldn't exchange my life for Armani
Sometimes I feel like I'm dreaming and then it hits me
Gotta remember who I am when it slips me
Fuck they thought was sittin' in my seat?
Got a big bowl of ice cream sitting in my Jeep
'Bout to dead this whole beef and rock some gold teeth"
