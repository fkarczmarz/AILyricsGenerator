Sweeter than a rice cake
Cake worth sippin'

And you ain't afraid to show it
Put a candle on my ma'fuckin' back
Baby  blow it
Love the way you do it when you do it like that
Show up with them stacks
Rainin' racks on my rack
Wrap it up  wrap it up
Boy  while I take this bow off
Talk that talk

Daddy  make a wish
Put this cake in your face
Hahaha  and it's not even my birthday

Nose to nose (Nose to nose)
Palm to palm
We were always just that close (Just that close)
Wrist to wrist (Wrist to wrist)
Toe to toe (Toe to toe)
Lips that felt just like the inside of a rose
So how come when I reach out my finger
It feels like more than distance between us?
In this California king bed
We're ten thousand miles apart
I've been California wishing on these stars
My California king
Eye to eye (Eye to eye)
Cheek to cheek (Cheek to cheek)
Side by side
Arm in arm
Dusk to dawn
With the curtains drawn
And a little last night on these sheets

I've been California wishing on these stars
My California king
Just when I felt like giving up on us
You turned around and gave me one last touch
That made everything feel better
But I don't wanna seem so weak
Maybe I've been California dreaming
In this California king bed
We're ten thousand miles apart
Been California wishing on these stars
My California king
My California king
In this California king bed
We're ten thousand miles apart
I've been California wishing on these stars
Watching you pretend you're unaffected
You're pulling our connections  expecting me to let you go
But I won't
I know you don't need my protection
But I'm in love  can't blame me for checking
I love in your direction  hoping that the message goes
Somewhere close to you
Close to you
Like so close if they hurt you  you wouldn't find out
Just say now  I'm coming right now to be close to you
Said you let it go  you kept it
Working hard to perfect it
But now your fear is reckless  and it's out of your control
Well just let it go
I know you don't need my protection
But I'm in love  can't blame me for checking
I love in your direction  hoping that the message goes

I just really need your ass with me
I'm sorry 'bout the other night
And I know I could be more creative
And come up with poetic lines
But I'm turnt up upstairs and I love you
Is the only thing that's in my mind
You light my fire
Let's stay up late and smoke a J
I wanna go back to the old way
Every time you kiss me
Don't say that you miss me
Just come get me
We're too busy kissing
They know about your history
How you live and love like fuck rules?
Jump  jump  jump  jump
Jump  jump
Tell me that you love me  when you know you don't love me
But I guess  I guess  I guess it's all good
You can play the game  I'ma still do my thing
Ain't no better way for it to be put
When you fuck them other girls
I bet they be wondering why you always call my name
You think I'm gonna wait around  I ain't got all day
You don't need another lover
Don't you let it go
I already got it covered
Let the others know
If you want it  let's do it
Ride it  my pony

The future seemed so bright
Then this thing turned out so evil
I don't know why I'm still surprised
Even angels have their wicked schemes
And you take that to new extremes
But you'll always be my hero
Even though you've lost your mind
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
I love the way you lie
Now there's gravel in our voices
Glass is shattered from the fight
Even when I'm right
'Cause you feed me fables from your head
With violent words and empty threats
And it's sick that all these battles
Are what keeps me satisfied

Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
So maybe I'm a masochist
'Til the walls are going up
In smoke with all our memories
Smeared makeup as we lay in the wake of destruction (Shh)
That you pushed me into the coffee table last night so I can push you off me
Try and touch me so I can scream at you not to touch me
Run out the room and I'll follow you like a lost puppy
Know that no matter how many knives we put in each other's backs
That we'll have each other's backs 'cause we're that lucky
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I was his Marilyn Monroe
Brown eyes  tuxedo  fast cars
A James Dean on the low
Dean on the low
I ask you  What's the matter?
You say Oh  it's nothing at all.
Heart's racing outta control
And you knew that I couldn't let it go
You used to be this boy I loved
And I used to be this girl of your dreams
Who knew the course of this one drive injured us fatally?
You took the best years of my life
I took the best years of your life
Felt like love struck me in the night
I prayed that love don't strike twice
Red lipstick  rose petals  heartbreak
I was his Marilyn Monroe
Brown eyes  tuxedo  fast cars
A James Dean on the low

I feel so empty and hollow
And I'll never give myself to another the way I gave it to you
Don't even recognize the ways you hurt me  do you?
It's gonna take a miracle to bring me back
And you're the one to blame
And now I feel like  oh  you're the reason why I'm thinking
I don't wanna smoke on these cigarettes no more

No time to think  my turn to go
And you can see my heart beating
You can see it through my chest
Said I'm terrified  but I'm not leaving

Say a prayer to yourself
He says  Close your eyes
Sometimes it helps
And then I get a scary thought
That he's here  means he's never lost
And you can see my heart beating
Oh  you can see it through my chest
Said I'm terrified  but I'm not leaving
Know that I must pass this test

How could you let us down?
But they don't know what I found
Or see it from this way around
Feeling it overtake
All that I used to hate
I tried but it's way too late
All the signs I don't read
Two sides of me can't agree
When I breathe in too deep
Going with what I always longed for
Feel like a brand new person
(But you make the same old mistakes)
(Stop before it's too late)
Feel like a brand new person
(But you make the same old mistakes)
I finally know what it's like
(You don't have what it takes)
(Stop before it’s too late)
(I know there's too much at stake)
(Making the same mistakes)
And I still don't know why it's happening
(Stop while it's not too late)
And I still don't know

Finally taking flight
I know you don't think it's right
I know that you think it's fake

Point is I have the right
Not thinking in black and white
I'm thinking it's worth the fight
Soon to be out of sight
Knowing it all this time
Going with what I always longed for
Feel like a brand new person
(But you make the same old mistakes)
I don't care I'm in love
(Stop before it's too late)
Feel like a brand new person
(But you make the same old mistakes)
So how do I know that it's right?
(You don't have what it takes)
(Stop before it’s too late)
And I know that it's hard to digest
But maybe your story ain't so different from the rest
And I know it seems wrong to accept
And I know that it's hard to digest
A realization is as good as it gets
And I know it seems wrong to accept
Feel like a brand new person
In a new direction
Feel like a brand new person

She takes the lead
That's when I saw it in her eyes  it's over
Then  she said Te amo
Then  she put her hand around me waist
I told her no  she cried Te amo
I told her I nah gon' run away
But let me go
My soul hears a cry
Without asking why  I said Te amo
Wish somebody'd tell me what she said
Don't it mean I love you?
Think it means I love you
Don't it mean I love you?

But it keeps avoiding me
Sorrow in my soul 'cause it seems that wrong
Really loves my company
He's more than a man and this is more than love
The reason that the sky is blue
The clouds are rolling in because I'm gone again
And to him  I just can't be true
And I know that he knows I'm unfaithful
And it kills him inside
To know that I am happy with some other guy
I can see him dying
I don't wanna do this anymore
I don't wanna be the reason why
Every time I walk out the door
I see him die a little more inside
I don't wanna hurt him anymore
I don't wanna take away his life
I don't wanna be a murderer
I feel it in the air as I'm doin' my hair
Preparing for another date
A kiss upon my cheek as he reluctantly
Asks if I'm gonna be out late
I say I won't be long  just hanging with the girls
A lie I didn't have to tell
Because we both know where I'm about to go
And we know it very well

You almost feel ashamed  that someone could be that important
That without them  you feel like nothing
No one will ever understand how much it hurts
You feel hopeless  like nothing can save you
And when it's over and it's gone
You almost wish you could have all that bad stuff back
So that you could have the good

As your shadow crosses mine
What it takes to come alive
