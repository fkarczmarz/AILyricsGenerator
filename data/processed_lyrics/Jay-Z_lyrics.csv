lyrics
"When I know in my heart
I'm letting you down every day
Letting you down every day
Why do I keep on running away?
Took for these natural twins to believe in miracles
I harassed you out in Paris
We talked for hours when you were on tour
I said: Don't embarrass me instead of Be mine
That was my proposal for us to go steady
That was your 21st birthday
So I apologize
I seen the innocence leave your eyes
I still mourn its death and
I apologize for all the stillborns
I apologize to all the women whom I toyed with your emotions
'Cause I was emotionless
And because I fall short of what I say I'm all about
Your eyes leave with the soul that your body once housed
And you stare blankly into space
So I apologize
You might also like
I'm never gonna treat you
I'm never gonna treat you like I should
Oh
I apologize
Our love was one for the ages and I contained us
And all this ratchet shit and we more expansive
Not meant to cry and die alone in these mansions
Or sleep with our back turned
We supposed to vacay 'til our backs burn
We're supposed to laugh 'til our heart stops
And then meet in a space where the dark stop
And let love light the way
I never wanted another woman to know
Something about me that you didn't know
I will be emotionally available if I invited you over
I stew over  What if—
You over my shit?
I'm never gonna treat you
I'm never gonna treat you like I should
Oh
And if my children knew
I don't even know what I would do
If they ain't look at me the same
I would prob'ly die with all the shame
You did what with who?
What good is a ménage à trois when you have a soulmate?
You risked that for Blue?
If I wasn't a superhero in your face
My heart breaks for the day I have to explain my mistakes
And the mask goes away
And Santa Claus is fake
And you go online and see
I got ninety-nine problems  but a bitch ain't one
I've got the Rap Patrol on the gat patrol
Foes that wanna make sure my casket's closed
Rap critics that say he's Money  Cash  Hoes
I'm from the hood  stupid! What type of facts are those?
If you grew up with holes in your zapatos
You'd celebrate the minute you was havin' dough
I'm like  Fuck critics  you can kiss my whole asshole!
If you don't like my lyrics  you can press fast forward
Got beef with radio if I don't play they show
Rap mags try and use my black ass
So advertisers can give 'em more cash for ads
Fuckers  I don't know what you take me as
Or understand the intelligence that Jay Z has
I'm from rags to riches  niggas  I ain't dumb
I got ninety-nine problems  but a bitch ain't one – hit me!
Ninety-nine problems  but a bitch ain't one
If you're havin' girl problems  I feel bad for you  son
I got ninety-nine problems  but a bitch ain't one – hit me!

The year is '94  in my trunk is raw
In my rearview mirror is the motherfuckin' law
Got two choices  y'all: pull over the car or
Bounce on the devil  put the pedal to the floor
And I ain't tryin' to see no highway chase with Jake
Plus I got a few dollars  I can fight the case
So I pull over to the side of the road
I heard  Son  do you know why I'm stopping you for?
'Cause I'm young and I'm black and my hat's real low?
Do I look like a mind reader  sir? I don't know
Am I under arrest or should I guess some more?
Well  you was doing fifty-five in a fifty-four
License and registration and step out of the car
Are you carrying a weapon on you? I know a lot of you are
I ain't steppin' out of shit  all my paper's legit
Well  do you mind if I look around the car a little bit?
Well  my glove compartment is locked  so is the trunk in the back
And I know my rights  so you gon' need a warrant for that
Aren't you sharp as a tack?
You some type of lawyer or something?
Somebody important or something?
Well  I ain't passed the bar  but I know a little bit
Enough that you won't illegally search my shit
Well  we'll see how smart you are when the K9 come!
I got ninety-nine problems  but a bitch ain't one – hit me!
Ninety-nine problems  but a bitch ain't one
If you're havin' girl problems  I feel bad for you  son
I got ninety-nine problems  but a bitch ain't one – hit me!
Ninety-nine problems  but a bitch ain't one
If you're havin' girl problems  I feel bad for you  son
I got ninety-nine problems  but a bitch ain't one
Now once upon a time not too long ago
A nigga like myself had to strong-arm a ho
This is not a ho in the sense of havin' a pussy
But a pussy havin' no goddamn sense  try and push me
I try to ignore him  talk to the Lord
Pray for him  but some fools just love to perform
You know the type  loud as a motorbike
But wouldn't bust a grape in a fruit fight
And only thing that's gon' happen is I'ma get to clappin'
And he and his boys gonna be yappin' to the Captain
And there I go  trapped in the Kit-Kat again
Back through the system with the riff-raff again
Fiends on the floor  scratchin' again
Paparazzis with they cameras  snappin' em
D.A. try to give a nigga shaft again
Half a mil' for bail ‘cause I'm African
All because this fool was harassin' them
Tryin' to play the boy like he's saccharine
But ain't nothin' sweet 'bout how I hold my gun
I got ninety-nine problems  bein' a bitch ain't one – hit me!
Ninety-nine problems  but a bitch ain't one
If you're havin' girl problems  I feel bad for you  son
I got ninety-nine problems  but a bitch ain't one – hit me!
You crazy for this one  Rick
Gangsta nuh live in a tenement yard
Rude boy nuh live in a tenement yard
Shawn was on that gospel shit
I was on the total fuckin' opposite
That's a war chest in case you need your chest knocked off
Y'all be talkin' crazy under them IG pictures
So when you get to hell you tell 'em Blanco sent ya
Those were just some words you'll never hear again (Uh huh)
For the final time you don't believe these fools
I've never seen a worker rock so many jewels (Never)
I've never seen the runner with so many cars (Never)
My advice is just don't be too nice to niggas
Once upon a time in the projects
We the only ones really movin' like y'all say y'all do
We still movin' like y'all niggas say y'all did
Emory passed you niggas and he did a bid
Ty Ty jumped over niggas and he's like 5'6
I pulled out the pot when we was outta options

자기 신발 끝내주는데
자기 돈 좀 많나봐
자기 스타일 진짜 멋있다
To be arguing with your ass  if you ain't really ready
Girl  why you never ready? For as long as you took
You better look like Halle Berry... Or Beyoncé
Shit  then we getting married
I brought sand to the beach 'cause my beach is better
You can keep ya beach 'cause that beach whatever
Started out at The Darby  ended up at 1 Oak
Left the house with 100 grand  ended up near broke
Don't get mad at me  I'm buying bucket after bucket
When it's gone I'm like Fuck it
I replace it with another one
Can't take this money with you
Burn this shit up like I'm Richard
It's big pimpin'  baby (That's right)
It's big pimpin'  spendin' Gs
Feel me  uh-huh uh  uh-huh
Ge-ge-geyeah  geyeah
Ge-ge-geyeah  geyeah
You know I
Thug 'em  fuck 'em  love 'em  leave 'em
‘Cause I don't fuckin' need 'em
Take 'em out the hood  keep 'em lookin' good
But I don't fuckin' feed 'em
First time they fuss  I'm breezin'
Talkin' 'bout  What's the reasons?
I'm a pimp in every sense of the word  bitch
Better trust and believe 'im
In the cut where I keep 'em
'Til I need a nut  'til I need to beat the guts  then it's
Beep beep  then I'm pickin' them up
Let 'em play with the dick in the truck
Many chicks wanna put Jigga fists in cuffs
Divorce him and split his bucks
Just because you got good head  I'ma break bread
So you can be livin' it up? Shit  I
Parts with nothin'  y'all be frontin'
Me give my heart to a woman?
Not for nothin'  never happen
I'll be forever mackin'
Heart cold as assassins
I got no passion
I got no patience  and I hate waitin'

Makes a mill' up off a sorry ho
Then sit back and peep my sce-nahr-i-o
Oops  my bad  that's my scenario
No  I can't fuck a scary ho
Now every time  every place  everywhere we go
Hoes start pointin'  they say: There he go!
Now these ma'fuckers know we carry mo'
Heat than a little bit
We don't pull it out over little shit
And if you catch a lick when I spit
Then it won't be a little hit
Go read a book  you illiterate son of a bitch!
And step up your vocab!
Don't be surprised if your ho's there out with me
And you see us comin' down on yo' SLAB
Livin' ghetto-fabulous  so mad  you just can't take it
But  nigga  if you hate now
Then you wait while I get your bitch butt-naked
Just break it  you gotta pay like you weigh
Wet with two pairs of clothes on
Now get your ass to the back as I fly to the track
Timbaland  let me spit my prose on
Posted up in the pro-zone
That's the track that we breakin' these hoes on
Ain't the track that we flows on
But when shit get hot then the Glock start poppin' like ozone
We keep hoes crunk like Trigger-man
For real  it don't get no bigger  man
Don't trip  let's sip  gettin' throwed on the flip
Gettin' blowed with the motherfuckin' Jigga Man  fool!

Holla at broads at the mall
If he up  watch him fall
Nigga  I can't fuck wit' y'all
If I wasn't rappin'  baby
I would still be ridin' Mercedes
Comin' down and sippin' daily
No record 'til whitey pay me

Well fuck you...bitch

Can I hit in the mornin' without givin' you half of my dough
If I couldn't get you finer things like all of them diamond rings
Bitches kill for would you still roll
If we couldn't see the sun risin' off the shore of Thailand
If I wasn't a eight-figure nigga by the name of Jigga
Would you come around me or would you clown me
See yourself with a nigga working hard at a nine to five
If you couldn't see yourself with a nigga when his dough is low

We invite you to somethin' epic  you know?
Well  we hustle out of a sense of hopelessness
Sort of a desperation
Through that desperation  we become addicted
Sort of like the fiends we accustomed to servin'
But we feel we have nothin' to lose
What do you bring to the table?
While I'm watchin' every nigga watchin' me closely
My shit is butter for the bread  they wanna toast me
I keep my head  both of them  where they supposed to be
Hoes'll get you sidetracked  then clapped from close feet
I don't sleep  I'm tired  I feel wired like codeine  these days
A brother gotta admire me from four fiends away
My pain  wish it was quick to see
From sellin' 'caine 'til brains was fried to a fricassee
Can't lie  at the time it never bothered me
At the bar  gettin' my thug on properly
My squad and me lack of respect for authority
Laughin' hard  happy to be escapin' poverty  however brief
I know this game got valleys and peaks
Expectation for dips  for precipitation we stack chips  hardly
The youth I used to be  soon to see a mill'in
No more Big Willie  my game has grown
Prefer you call me William
Illin' for revenues  Rayful Edmond-like
Channel 7 News  round seven jewels  head dead in the mic
Forgettin' all I ever knew  convenient amnesia
I suggest you call my lawyer  I know the procedure.
Lock my body  can't trap my mind
Easily explain why we adapt to crime
I'd rather die enormous than live dormant  that's how we on it
Live at the main event  I bet a trip to Maui on it
Presidential suites my residential for the weekend
Confidentially speakin' in codes since I sense you peekin'
The NSX rental  don't be fooled  my game is mental
We both out of town  dog  what you tryin' to get into?
Viva Las Vegas  see ya later at the crap tables
Meet me by the one that starts a G up
This way no Fraud Willies present gamblin' they re-up
And we can have a pleasant time  sippin' margaritas

My mind is infested with sick thoughts that circle
Like a Lexus  if driven wrong it's sure to hurt you
Dual level like duplexes  in unity
My crew and me commit atrocities like we got immunity
You guessed it  manifest it
In tangible goods  platinum Rolex'd it
We don't lease  we buy the whole car  as you should
My confederation  dead a nation
Explode on detonation  overload the mind of a said patient
When it boils to steam  it comes to it
We all fiends  gotta do it: even righteous minds go through this
True this  the streets school us to spend our money foolish
Bond with jewelers and watch for intruders
I stepped it up another level  meditated like a Buddhist
Recruited lieutenants with ludicrous dreams of gettin' cream
Let's do this  it gets tedious
So I keep one eye open like CBS — you see me stressed  right?
Can I live?
Can I live?
Can I live?
I'm ready for it
Eastside nigga with the feets high
Your eyes speak the truth when everything else lies
May pretend that we kin but the vibes don't fly
I'm surprised y'all think you can disguise y'all truths
I seen eyes wide as they're about to shoot
Y'all body language is all remedial
How could you see the difference between you and I?
My crash course was much tougher
Round friends who kill they friends
Then hug their friends' mothers
Memories may sneak down my cheek
But I could see a side-eye in my sleep

My eyes wide shut to all the lies

You think he wanted the masters with his masters?
You greedy bastards sold tickets to walk through his house
I'm surprised you ain't auction off the casket
I've seen pure admiration become rivals
I've been to Paris at least two times
I can't tell if your image is just a flare
I've been out of touch for a couple years
I've been ready for this for real
Hopin' I can touch what I see
Eastside nigga with the feets high
Always keep a smile when they want me to frowns
Keep the vibes and they stood my grounds
They will never ever take my crown
Who Jah bless I say no man curse
Things gettin' better when they thought it would be worse
Here comes the officers askin' for a search
They found no weapon just only a draw of herbs
You in the presence of a king
Put in the belly of the beast
These niggas like rotary phones
Niggas always try to knock a nigga down
Knock me to my knees about a million times
Uncle said I'll never sell a million records
I sold a million records like a million times
These niggas shouldn't let me in

See my name come across on CNN

Illuminati want my mind  soul and my body
Dear God  I wonder  can you save me?
Secret society  tryna keep they eye on me
Dear God  I wonder  can you save me?
Illuminati want my mind  soul and my body
Dear God  I wonder  can you save me?
I can't die  I can't die  I can't die
This shit is wicked on these mean streets
None of my friends speak  we're all tryna win
But then again  maybe it's for the best though
'Cause when they're seein' too much
You know they're tryna get you touched
Whoever said illegal was the easy way out
Couldn't understand the mechanics
And the workings of the underworld  granted
Nine-to-five is how you survive  I ain't tryna survive
I'm tryna live it to the limit and love it a lot
Life ills poisoned my body  I used to say fuck mic skills
I never prayed to God  I prayed to Gotti
That's right  it's wicked – that's life  I live it
Ain't askin' for forgiveness for my sins  ends
I break bread with the late heads
Pickin' their brains for angles on all the evils that the game'll do
It gets dangerous  money and power is changin' us
And now we're lethal  infected with D'evils

We used to fight for building blocks
Now we fight for blocks with buildings that make a killin'
The closest of friends when we first started
But grew apart as the money grew and soon grew black-hearted
Thinkin' back when we first learned to use rubbers
He never learned  so in turn I'm kidnappin' his baby's mother
My hand around her collar  feedin' her cheese
She said the taste of dollars was shitty  so I fed her fifties
About his whereabouts I wasn't convinced
I kept feedin' her money 'til her shit started to make sense
Who could ever foresee?
We used to stay up all night at slumber parties
Now I'm tryna rock his bitch to sleep
All the years we were real close
Now I see his fears through her tears
Know she's wishin' we were still close
Don't cry  it is to be
In time I'll take away your miseries and make it mine

By D'evils in the form of diamonds and Lexuses
The Exorcist got me doin' sticks
Like  Homie  you don't know me
But the whole world owe me  strip!
Was thought to be a pleasant guy all my fuckin' life
So now I'm down for whatever  ain't nothin' nice
Throughout my junior high years it was all friendly
But now this higher learning got the Remy in me
Liquor's invaded my kidneys
Got me ready to lick off – Momma  forgive me
I can't be held accountable  D'evils beatin' me down  boo
Got me runnin' with guys  makin' G's  tellin' lies that sound true
Come test me  I never cower
For the love of money  son  I'm givin' lead showers
Stop screamin'  you know the demon said it's best to die
And even if Jehovah witness  bet he'll never testify
D'evils
Dear God  I wonder  can you save me?
 now I'm down in Tribeca
 they love me everywhere
 my Dominicanos (Dímelo!)
 I could trip a referee (Come on)

 addicted to the limelight

You're far too kind
Now  can I get a encore? Do you want more?
Cookin' raw with the Brooklyn boy
So for one last time  I need y'all to roar
Now  what the hell are you waitin' for?
After me  there shall be no more
So for one last time  nigga  make some noise!

I'm Young H-O  rap's Grateful Dead
Back to take over the globe  now break bread

On the low  but the yacht got a triple deck
But when you Young  what the fuck you expect? Yep  yep
Grand openin'  grand closin'

To the only thing that matters in just a matter of years (yeah)
As fate would have it  Jay's status appears
To be at an all-time high  perfect time to say goodbye

Wearin' the 4-5  it ain't to play games with you
It's to aim at you  probably maim you
If I owe you I'm blowin' you to smithereens

And I need you to remember one thing (One thing)

Can you imagine what kind of life it is to live?
In the shadows people see you as happy and free
Because that's what you want them to see
You live in the shadows for fear of someone hurting your family or the person you love

But you live with the fear of just being me
Living in the shadow feels like the safe place to be
No harm for them  no harm for me

I was born to get cake  move on and switch states
Cop the coupe with the roof gone and switch plates
Was born to dictate  never follow orders  dick face
Get your shit straight  fucker  this is Big Jay
I— hahahaha (You don't know what you're doin'— doin'— doin'—)
Will not lose  ever
Heaven can wait  we're only watching the skies
Hoping for the best but expecting the worst
Are you gonna drop the bomb or not?
Let us die young or let us live forever
We don't have the power but we never say never
Sitting in a sandpit  life is a short trip
The music's for the sad men
Forever young  I wanna be forever young
Forever young (Young)  I wanna be forever young (Forever young)
(Ayy  may the best of your todays be the worst of your tomorrows)
Do you really want to live forever  forever? Forever young
(But we ain't even thinkin' that far  ya know what I mean?)
So we living life like a video (Video)
Where the sun is always out and you never get old
And the champagne's always cold and the music's always good
And the pretty girls just happen to stop by in the hood
And they hop they pretty ass up on the hood of that pretty ass car
Without a wrinkle in today 'cause there's no tomorrow
Just a picture-perfect day that last a whole lifetime
And it never ends 'cause all we have to do is hit rewind
Leave a mark they can't erase  neither space nor time
So when the director yells cut  I'll be fine
I'm forever young

My name shall be passed down to generations

Forever young  I wanna be forever young (Forever young)
You ready  B?

Look for me
Young  B  cruisin' down the Westside Highway
Doin' what we like to do  our way
Eyes behind shades
This necklace the reason all of my dates been blind dates
But today I got my thoroughest girl with me
I'm mashin' the gas  she's grabbin' the wheel  it's trippy
How hard she rides with me  the new Bobby and Whitney
Only time we don't speak is durin' Sex and the City
She gets Carrie fever  but soon as the show's over
She's right back to being my soldier
'Cause mami's a rider and I'm a roller
Put us together  how they gon' stop both us?
Whatever she lacks I'm right over her shoulder (Woo)
When I'm off track  mami is keepin' me focused
So let's lock this down like it's supposed to be
The '03 Bonnie and Clyde: Hov' and B  holla
All I need in this life of sin is me and my girlfriend
(Me and my girlfriend)
Down to ride 'til the very end  is me and my boyfriend
(Me and my boyfriend  that's right)
All I need in this life of sin is me and my girlfriend
(Me and my girlfriend  look for me)
Down to ride 'til the very end  is me and my boyfriend
