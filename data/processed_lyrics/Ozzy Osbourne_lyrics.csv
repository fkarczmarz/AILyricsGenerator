lyrics
"And he looked back at me  crying tears of defeat from his eyes
He said I know all the lies that you hide behind every fake smile
Am I gonna be lonely like you
For all my life
I've been livin' in yesterday
All my life
A dollar short and a day too late
I was standing at the edge  looking down at the drink in my hand
And it looked back at me  saying How in the hell have you been?
I've been drier than dirt  dragging all of my thoughts through the quicksand
Now I'm quenching my thirst and I'm running like
All my life
I've been livin' in yesterday
All my life
A dollar short and a day too late
All my life
Heaven can take me
But no one can save me from Hell again
You'll never erase me
I'm back on the road again

All my life
I've been livin' in yesterday
All my life
A dollar short and a day too late
All my life
Waking from the dead of night
Vengeance is boiling
He's returned to kill the light
Then when he's found who he's looking for
Listen in awe and you'll hear him
Bark at the Moon
Hahahahaha
Years spent in torment
Buried in a nameless grave
Now he has risen
Miracles would have to save
Those that the beast is looking for
Listen in awe and you'll hear him
Bark at the Moon
You might also like
They cursed and buried him along with shame
Howling in shadows
Living in a lunar spell
He finds his heaven
Spewing from the mouth of hell
Those that the beast is looking for
Listen in awe and you'll hear him
Bark at the Moon
*Howling*
And feeling belief grow
Rise above the obstacles
People beseech me
But they'll never teach me
Things that I already know (I know)
Dreams that have shattered
May not have mattered
Take another point of view
Like chasing a rainbow
I can tell a thing or two (That's true)
You've got to believe in yourself
Or no one will believe in you
Imagination like a bird on the wing
Flying free for you to use (OK baby)
I can't believe they stop and stare
Their disbelief suppresses them
But they're not blind
It's just that they won't see

I'm a believer
I ain't no deceiver
Mountains move before my eyes
Destiny planned out
I don't need no handout
Speculation of the wise
Ayy
Crazy  but that's how it goes
Millions of people living as foes
Maybe it's not too late
To learn how to love and forget how to hate
Mental wounds not healing  life's a bitter shame
I'm going off the rails on a crazy train
I'm going off the rails on a crazy train
(Let's go)
I've listened to preachers  I've listened to fools
I've watched all the dropouts  who make their own rules
One person conditioned to rule and control
The media sells it and you live the role
Mental wounds still screaming  driving me insane

I'm going off the rails on a crazy train

I know that things are going wrong for me
Heirs of a cold war  that's what we've become
Inheriting troubles  I'm mentally numb
Crazy  I just cannot bear
I'm living with something that just isn't fair
Mental wounds not healing  who and what's to blame?
I'm going off the rails on a crazy train
I'm going off the rails on a crazy train
Hahahahahahaha
 and doom
 in his room
 the sky
 in his eye
 in his mind
 turns you blind
Watch me die another day
Hopeless situation
Endless price I have to pay
There's no choice
Diary of a madman
Walk the line again today
Entries of confusion
Manic depression befriends me
Hear his voice
There's no choice
A sickened mind and spirit
The mirror tells me lies
Could I mistake myself for someone
Who lives behind my eyes?
Will he escape my soul
Or will he live in me?
Is he trying to get out
Or trying to enter me?

Monday till Sunday in stages
So you keep hangin' in the dark
I'll hunt you down cause I'm the dog
The bounty hunter
Wondering will mother earth survive
Hoping that mankind will stop abusing her sometime
And here we are still fighting for our lives
Watching all of history repeat itself time after time
I'm just a dreamer
I dream my life away
I'm just a dreamer
Who dreams of better days

I'm hoping that the dawn will bring a sign
A better place for those who will come after us this time

So it's no wonder that he grew up to be so wild
So he protected his feelings in walls he imagined
But castles crumble exposin' a frightened child
Fire in the sky
Can't you see that all my castles are burning?
Fire in the sky
Won't you help me now my castles are burning?
In solitude he couldn't deal with his own existence
The burning questions in the castles have still remained
God only knows how he searched in vain for the answers
Fire in the sky
Can't you see that all my castles are burning?

Here we go now
Oh no  oh now
Here we go now
Got a crazy feeling I don't understand
Got to get away from here
Feeling like I should have kept my feet on the ground
Waiting for the sun to appear
Mamma's going to worry
I've been a bad  bad boy
No use saying sorry
It's something that I enjoy
Because you can't see what my eyes see
(I can see it  I can see it)
And you can't be inside of me
Flying high again
I can see through mountains  watch me disappear
I can even touch the sky
Swallowing colours of the sound I hear
Am I just a crazy guy (you bet)

Tomorrow will I find the sun or will it rain?
I live in shame

Do you have any memories? Hahaha
Dark memories  dark memories
They keep me up all night
You left me half-empty
Why are you always right?
Can't change me  can't change me
No matter how you try
You break me  forsake me
Right now I wanna die
So it's goodbye (Bye  bye)
So it's goodbye (Bye  bye)
No future  no  no  no future

Can he see or is he blind?
Can he walk at all
Or if he moves will he fall?
Is he alive or dead?
Has he thoughts within his head?
We'll just pass him there
Why should we even care?
He was turned to steel
In the great magnetic field
Where he traveled time
For the future of mankind
Nobody wants him
He just stares at the world
Planning his vengeance
That he will soon unfold
Now the time is here
For iron man to spread fear
Vengeance from the grave
Kills the people he once saved
Nobody wants him
They just turn their heads
Nobody helps him
Now he has his revenge

I couldn't look her straight in the face
A blue addiction I live in disgust
Degradation I'm being eaten by lust
No bone movies 
Inspiration that's blue and uncut
Can't kick the habit obssesion of smut
Voyeur straining in love with his hand
A poison passion pulsating gland
Flaps
I shouldn't do it the guilt tells me why
I just can't stop it I try and I try
X-rated demon that lives in my head
Hungry for bodge and he wants to be fed
A stairway to darkness in the blink of an eye
A levee of tears to learn she'll never be coming back
The man in the dark will bring another attack

Something in my visions  something deep inside
Where did I wander? Where do you think I wandered to?
I've seen life's magic  astral plane I travel through
I heard them tell me that this land of dreams was now
I told them I had ridden shooting stars and said I'd show them how
Over and over  always tried to get away
Living in a daydream  only place I had to stay
Fever of a breakout burning in me miles wide
People around me talking to the walls inside
I heard them tell me that this land of dreams was now
I told them I had ridden shooting stars and said I'd show them how

 why'd he let the Devil do his work on me? Oh yeah
 what am I doing here?
 better run and hide
 you believe their lies
When it took him by surprise
And with one pull of the trigger
He would vanish overnight
Dancing by the roadside
Holding on for dear life
Then a gun from out of nowhere
Made a widow of his wife

Single file down the runway
Feeling fine
Over and over again
Who can we get on the case?
We need Perry Mason

Over and over again

We need Perry Mason
Someone to put you in place
Calling Perry Mason again
For they know not what they do
Looking back in history's books
It seems it's nothing new
Heaven is for heroes
And hell is full of fools
They're breaking God's own rules
Please let my mother live
Father of all creation
I think we're all going wrong
The path they're taking
Seems to be breaking
And it won't take too long
Children of the future
Watching empires fall
And the seas had turned red
In the land of the dead
Before it's too late
And all the things I've done to me
I'm still looking for the answers
I'm still searching for the key
The wreckage of my past keeps haunting me
It just won't leave me alone
I still find it all a mystery
Could it be a dream?
The road to nowhere leads to me
Through all the happiness and sorrow
I guess I'd do it all again
Live for today and not tomorrow
It's still the road that never ends
The wreckage of my past keeps haunting me
It just won't leave me alone
I still find it all a mystery
Could it be a dream?

The road to nowhere's gonna pass me by
I hope we never have to say goodbye
The wreckage of my past keeps haunting me
It just won't leave me alone
I still find it all a mystery
Could it be a dream?
The road to nowhere leads to me
The road to nowhere leads to me
The road to nowhere leads to me
The road to nowhere leads to me
Finally found a way of thinking
Stormy day won't see me sinking
I can't conceal it like I knew I did before
Waiting on the shore
On the eve when you set sailing
Ship of joy will stop you failing
I can't conceal it like I knew I did before
Waiting on the shore
As the shore sinks in the distance
Gold that's brighter than the sunlight
Dawning on a new horizon
Brighter than the sun that's rising
Three thousand sails on high are straining in the wind
A raging sea below
The skyline is bleeding black and red (How did they get here?)
They might just try to eat us
Everybody wants them until we meet them
Scary little green men? It's the end
They're hiding amongst us everywhere (They don't belong here)
They might just try to eat us

Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah

Huh!
Whispering (Whispering  whispering)  the time has passed for choices
Golden days are passing over  yeah
I can't seem to see you baby
Although my eyes are open wide
But I know I'll see you once more
When I see you  I'll see you on the other side
Yes  I'll see you  I'll see you on the other side
Leaving (Leaving  leaving)  I hate to see you cry
Grieving (Grieving  grieving)  I hate to say goodbye
Dust and ash forever  yeah
Though I know we must be parted
As sure as stars are in the sky
I'm gonna see you when it comes to glory
And I'll see you  I'll see you on the other side
Yes  I'll see you  I'll see you on the other side  yeah

Never thought I'd feel like this
Strange to be alone  yeah
But we'll be together
Carved in stone  carved in stone  carved in stone
Hold me (Hold me  hold me)  hold me tight I'm falling
Far away (Far away  far away)  distant voices calling
I'm so cold  I need you darling  yeah
I was down  but now I'm flying
Straight across the great divide
I know you're crying  but I'll stop you crying
When I see you  I see you on the other side
Yes  I'll see you  see you on the other side
I'm gonna see you  see you on the other side
God knows I'll see you  see you on the other side  yeah

I can hear my heavy breathing
Paid for the kill  but it doesn't seem right
Something there I can't believe in
Voices are calling from inside my head
I can hear them  I can hear them
Vanishing memories of things that were said
They can't try to hurt me now
But a shot in the dark
One step away from you
Just a shot in the dark
Always creeping up on you  alright
Taught by the powers that preach over me
I can hear their empty reasons
I wouldn't listen  I learned how to fight
I opened up my mind to treason
But just like the wounded  and when it's too late
They'll remember  they'll surrender
Never a care for the people who hate
Underestimate me now

Straight to Hell tonight
We're going straight to Hell

I'll make you lie  I'll make you steal and kill
I'll make you crawl until your final thrill
Enjoy the ride  I'll plant my bitter seed

Suicide is slow with liquor
Take a bottle  drown your sorrows
Then it floods away tomorrows  away tomorrows
Evil thoughts and evil doings
Thought that you'd escape the reaper
You can't escape the Master Keeper
'Cause you feel life's unreal and you're living a lie
Such a shame who's to blame? And you're wondering why
Then you ask from your cask  Is there life after birth?
What you saw can be Hell on this earth  Hell on this earth
Now you live inside a bottle
The reaper's traveling at full throttle
It's catching you  but you don't see
The reaper's you and the reaper is me
Where to hide? Suicide is the only way out
Don't you know what it's really about?

Take me away
It's never getting me flaps  no flaps
There's nothing left of me to devour
You've had your fill  I'm all I have left
What can stop your hunger for power?
'Cos you took advantage of things that I said
Now the feeling is dead
And that's the ultimate sin
And that's the ultimate sin
Any way I look at it now
The doors are closed and cannot be opened
Bury your anger and bury your dead
Or you'll be left with nothing and no one
There's no point in screaming 'cos you won't be heard
Now the tables have turned
It was the ultimate sin
It was the ultimate sin
It was the ultimate sin
It was the ultimate sin

If you mess with me you're playing with fire
Winds of change that are fanning the flames
Will carry you to your funeral pyre
It's pulling you down  it's your final descent

When it's the ultimate sin
When it's the ultimate sin
When it's the ultimate sin
When it's the ultimate sin
Not every soul can be saved (You reap what you sow)
They kill and we give them fame
So tell me who is to blame

The kids are running as fast as they can
Their silence echoes with rage
How many more will it take? (You reap what you sow)
The devil loves a parade

Death doesn't answer when I cry for help
No high could save me from the depths of Hell
I'll drown my mind until I'm someone else
Don't take care of me  be scared of me
My misery owns me
I don't wanna be my enemy
My misery owns me now
Under the graveyard
We're all rotting bones
Oh-oh-oh  oh-oh-oh
Everything you are
Can't take it when you go
Oh-oh-oh  oh-oh-oh
I ain't livin' this lie no more
Ain't livin' this lie no more
Oh-oh-oh  oh-oh-oh

We all die alone
Cover my eyes so I can't see clear
One sip away from everything I fear
Ashes to ashes  watch me disappear
Closer to home because the end is near

Nothing done and nothing said
Talking to me with your eyes
What they say is no surprise
Things are so much different now
But nothing lasts forever
I wanna talk to you

I know you know I know too
Is it me or is it you?

Please talk to me

Come on now baby

Till in your heart you realise
If you chose to criticise
You choose your enemies
Everything that I say and do
In your eyes is always wrong
In a sick society?
You're no different
No different to me
Look at yourself instead o' looking at me
With accusation in your eyes
Do you want me crucified
For my profanity
Concealing your crimes behind a grandeur of lies
If you think you're without sin
Be the first to cast the stone

Is that envy in your eyes
Reflecting jealousy
Tell me the truth and I'll admit to my guilt
If you'll try and understand
Is that blood that's on your hands
From your democracy
You're no different
No different to me
You're no different
No different to me"
