 that's wack (Straight up)
 money made me ign'ant (It did)
 I might let you go
 back to the crib
 back to the
I went with realness instead
But all the real niggas I know either crazy or dead
Niggas keep asking on whether this dude’s for real or not
That’s why these older songs that I used to make I’d release free
That’s why I come first like my cell phone
I rap about my dick and talk about what girls is fly
So why does everyone have a problem with talking stupid shit?
Or is it real shit?
Like when you make out with your best friend’s baby sis
You know the one with short hair you used to babysit?
And kiss her while she’s sleeping and sneak out the front to catch a flight
It's just making up for fucks I missed in high school
I keep it wrapped until I meet the right one
All I wanted was some more like Ashton
I ain’t the coolest but I know I got passion
I got passion!

I really wanna do her right and it doesn’t matter
We’ve got all the shine we need to find
I really wanna do her right and it doesn’t matter

Am I serious? I don’t even know
Are you hearing this? This shit is laughable
Is there room in the game for a lame who rhymes?
Who wears short shorts and makes jokes sometimes?
My mom loves to text me Psalm verses
She don’t look at me like I’m the same person
And I don’t want them missing a son like Bon’s last name
I wanna go inside the club with no gold piece
And walk in with no ID and No I.D
No matter how far the hood seems
We all still got hood dreams
I always wanted to get picked on the cool team
But alone is exactly how I should be

Tiny heart  tiny beat
Oh  thinkin' 'bout the time we spent falling in love together
I don't wanna leave you  I don't wanna deceive you
But oh  when mama cries from daddy's lies
Don't take him away  oh
'Cause I've had my time  oh!
Don't take my baby boy
Don't take my pride and joy
I hope I stay close  I hope I stay close
All the pain  all the tears
Many nights  many years
This love for me is fading
You waited  but I never came home to you
I've never lied about us
We were never supposed to be together

Hard for a Pitchfork  soft for a Roc-a-Fella
Music was my side chick  but now we’re moving in together
Always felt misunderstood  I guess I have to tolerate
APC jeans  brown leather jacket on
Kitsuné cable knit  cardigan from Rag & Bone
Thick Filipino chick  homemade bracelet
Her booty make her just a rapper  she ain’t gotta say shit
I’m someone they admire
Set the game ablaze  I’m an arcade fire
Laughed at my rise like my motion was funny
The ride is easy when the dollar’s there to grease the wheels
Now everybody tell me what to do and how to feel
It seems the more I try to connect with the world
I am feeling more alone than I ever have felt before
I wanna pick up the phone  ask my dad how to handle it
But what will happen when my dad’s not there to answer it?
I try to clear my mind of thoughts that only slow me down
Like when these niggas called me faggot and we homies now
But we are not homies  I just keep you around
‘Cause all your talkin’ is the noise I need to kill the sound
Of all these voices tellin’ me no one can help me out
We are alone  I’m just the only one to figure out

These words I wrote for you when you were fuckin’ other dudes
The only thing I need from you now is some solitude
I used to be this guy sittin’ with an open heart
Now my computer screen’s the only place I feel a spark
I don’t fuck with fake bitches
Except for when I fuck with fake bitches

Of these girls who wouldn’t talk to me a year ago
You could switch all of my words out with Plies’  right?
We are just some rappers  got no luxury of subtlety
No subjects when we’re rappin’  we say it like we hear it
I put it on a track and I hope you get the spirit ‘cause

EXT. CHURCH PARKING LOT - DAY
All the parents in the parking lot are hugging and kissing their kids. Lots of kids are laughing. The Boy keeps walking until he reaches a black limousine parked at the far end
A chauffeur (old heavyset white guy) stands holding the door open waiting for The Boy
       CHAUFFEUR: Ey! Look who it is
The Boy's FATHER (Rick Ross) is sitting by the far door. The limo starts off
See Childish Gambino LiveGet tickets as low as $69The Boy and his father sit in silence for what feels like 8 hours
       FATHER: How was camp?
The Boy shrugs
       FATHER (CONT'D): You make any friends?
       THE BOY: No
The father laughs under his breath...but the laugh turns into a smh
       FATHER: Elise made you something special tonight
       THE BOY: Frito pie
       FATHER: I don't know. She didn't say-

The Father's phone rings:
       FATHER: Hello
Father hangs up. His cell phone goes off
INT. BOY'S ROOM - DAY
The Boy rips the bag of pop tarts open with his mouth as he sits at his desk and opens his laptop. There's a picture of a woman holding a child. She's wearing one of those fly tracksuits from 1995. The ones people wore a lot during the centennial Olympics
He starts checking his mail. His friend FAM sent him something that says this is you with a link. The Boy clicks the link and a video of a woman blowing a horse comes up. The Boy watches the video for longer than you should watch a horse blowing video. He closes the video
This nigga sound like a broke-ass Future!  is the top comment
The Boy stares. Then types fuck u niggers in the comments
He waits. He takes a bite out of his pop tart
The Boy smiles...bec a use the in t e  rnet15 YEARS LATER**************
INT. THE BOY'S ROOM - EARLY MORNING
Little hills of dirty clothes grow up the walls from the floor. Same pile of shoes is there. Wall with same dirty spot. The closet is filled with white shirts and flower shorts. There's one very old and tattered Shearling coat that hangs to the right
INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY
The Buddha statue again. There's empty old beer and Pellegrino bottles on the bar. The entire back of the living room wall is glass. The boy walks briskly to the kitchen

CUT TO:
EXT. SANTA MONICA CONDOS - DAY
The 911 pulls up to a nice condo complex. Fam honks the horn for a while. Like a jerk
Fam honks more
He was looking for something to retweet on his time-line. People say dumb shit all the time...
...someone tweeted roscoe's wetsuit
...what's that?
The Boy drops roscoe's wetsuit into Google. A Yahoo answer comes up for it. The answer to what is roscoe's wetsuit? is...roscoe's wetsuit. Hilarious
       SWANK (re: boards): How we supposed to get these in there?
       FAM: You guys take your car
       STEVE: What about your boards? Where are they?
       FAM: Can we borrow some?

Fam honks the horn
       SWANK: I'm drivin that Porsche the way back. I know that shit
Swank and Steve walk toward their car parked on the street

       FAM: I don't know
They drive off
EXT. DOCKWEILER BEACH - DAY
They setup camp and start changing on the beach
       MARCUS: I thought someone was bringing girls
       THE BOY: No one wants to get up this early
       MARCUS: Did you ask white girls?
       THE BOY: I asked every girl
       FAM: You a lie. You didn't ask anybody. You don't leave the house
       STEVE: Why white girls?
       MARCUS (CONT'D to AJ): See? This is what I mean about Donnie Darko happening to me
A plane flies low overhead. (Dockweiler is right next to LAX)
       MARCUS (CONT'D) (staring at the plane)
It's gonna crush me
       SWANK (re: girl): It's like seeing a mermaid
       STEVE: Maybe it's a manatee
       MARCUS (R. Kelly): I'ma flirt
Marcus runs to the water with his board. They all follow
EXT. OCEAN - MORNING
Marcus swims up to the girl on his board
       MARCUS: Sup
       GIRL: Hi
       MARCUS: I'm Marcus
       SASHA: Sasha

       MARCUS (not mean...just serious): It's a fucking classic
       STEVE (to Sasha. Out of breath): Hi. Did Marcus ruin it already?
       SASHA: Yes
Steve splashes Marcus
Swank takes a plastic bag with four blunts in it. He takes one out. He lights up a blunt. Talks with it hanging in his mouth
       SWANK: How long you been surfing?
       SASHA: Ten years. You?
       SWANK: Bouta month
AJ: Cops don't come out here. It's a good place to smoke. You want some?
He passes it. She takes a hit
       SWANK: What you doin tonight?
       SASHA: My friend's birthday in Santa Monica
       SASHA: What's your DJ name?
       AJ: Twercules. no DJ. Just Twercules. I got a tumblr where I post my mixes. It's getting pretty popular. I don't know. You sing? Model? Act?
       SASHA: I'ma go in
Sasha starts paddling and catches a wave into the beach
       AJ: I shouldn't have said bitches
       MARCUS (thinks): ...you didn't
AJ thinks on this. This is probably saying more about him than he realizes
EXT. BEACH - MORNING
Sasha carries her board onto the beach. The Boy is sitting there
       SASHA: You goin in?
       THE BOY: Don't know yet
       SASHA: Then why'd you put on your wetsuit?

She starts walking

       SASHA: I'll remember. I'll bring some friends
She walks off

EXT. I-10 - EVENING
The guys drive down the highway eating In-N-Out. Head nods all around. Swank is now driving the Porsche. Crazily. Fam is with The Boy and the rest of the guys in the other car. Marcus drops his animal style fries on the floor
       MARCUS: Fuck
       FAM: You see you fuckin up this car?
       THE BOY: It's fine
       FAM: He's driving crazy. (iphone goes off) And he's textin me

Fam and Cheese do that handshake thing they do. Fam walks in
Some guys in a black SUV rolls by and yell at the dude next to The Boy
       MAN IN CAR: Dont let me catch you out here Jay! Don't let me catch you!
The Boy watches this for a second. He looks down for a moment...
Someone has spray painted roscoe's wetsuit on the sidewalk. He stares at it
The Boy snaps out of it. Then takes out his phone and starts recording the fight. Fam walks out and sees the fight in action
       MAN IN CAR: I got something for yo ho-ass my nigga!
POP. POP
..what's happening?
Jay is bleeding from his stomach. The Boy is seeing this through his phone. It takes a moment for him to realize-
POP. POP
...run. now
Fam is already running. Everyone in the line is screaming and running. The Boy runs
       COP: Drop your weapon!
(these are cleaner and succinct) POP.POP.POP
The Boy felt something
       SOME NIGGA: Damnnnnn.....!
       HIS FRIEND: WORLDSTAR!
The Boy's phone rings:
       THE BOY: Yeah

INT. CAR - NIGHT
       FAM: That shit was NUTS!
       STEVE: I knew something was about to happen. I knew it
       MARCUS: Donnie Darko. I'm tellin you
The Boy is looking at the footage on his phone. He's got a death on video. It's looped. Over and over
The Boy touches his shearling coat...there's a hole in it. Bullet hole? He puts his finger through...
...i shouldn't be (here)
He looks at Fam and Steve. They're talking
       FAM: BAP! BAP! BAP! Oooow. That nigga lit up
The Boy just keeps watching the video
       FAM: Yo. You got it on video?
       THE BOY: Yeah
       FAM: Wow...you caught the end of his journey on video. That's dope. (then) We gotta pic up Doc from the jazz club

Fam and The Boy Stand in the back. Doc is on stage playing saxophone with a band. He's doing a solo
       THE BOY: Does it weird you out that you almost died today?
       FAM: Not really. I'm not trippin on death
       FAM: Doc be hanging with the weirdest people. Look at these niggas. They all look like James Blake. Is that who likes Jazz now?
       FAM: That's not your job. You do it cause it's funny. You're rich. We don't have to do anything
       THE BOY: Yeah. Isn't that sad?
       FAM: Sad? We are making moves. What about that line me and Swank are gonna start selling?
       THE BOY: All we did was print shirts for ourselves. Who else is buying that shit? And the whole reason we wanted to make shirts is cause Tre made some and they were dope
       FAM: I don't know what to tell you. We are doing dope shit. We are making moves. We can do whatever we want-
       THE BOY: But none of it matters cause we're doing it for ourselves! We're just jerking off for each other. No one in the future's gonna give a shit I made a shirt once

But is it too soon for Japanese girls? Too tsunami?
Is it racist if I say she tastes like edamame?
Was I supposed to stay uncool? Please remind me
I ain't got shit to say to ya  I'm known for bad behavior
Makin' out with girls who black and yellow like a bumblebee

But these girls I'm kissin' chase the blues away like Gargamel

But I'm afraid to text her What the fuck it take so long for?!
What the fuck has changed? Is it swagger? Is it money?
I still dress the fuckin' same and my nose is still as ugly as the day you fuckin' met me
They're tellin' me I'm the rapper for these white kids
'Cause black kids can't possibly like the same shit
I wanna bring you back to the studio  try and get your number
These black girls with natural hair who keep up with their Tumblrs

I wanna suck your breasts and finger blast to Frank Ocean
Her pussy tastes like vanilla  tasty ho
It's crazy how these labels and these blogs are on my dick
I'm Pryor in his last years: comedian who's sick
I don't feel so good  'cause I don't get sleep
And I'm always travelin'  and I don't go home
And my friends don't call  'cause I turned off my phone
I've made mistakes  I bumped my head
Inside of this girl  inside of my bed
I'm sorry that I fucked her  but now you know that she's not the one

How the world should be: perfectly

It's hard to make Hov the footsteps you followin'
Especially when your niggas look like Carlton
The pretty girls usin' skin so soft
Only be likin' black dudes with their hats broke off
Fuck you! I'm from the projects
My mom was just workin' to give me options
For the only black kid at a Sufjan concert
Somethin' they wanna say but couldn't 'cause they embarrassed
All I do is make the stuff I would've liked
Now I'm firefly like a burning kite
And you's a fake fuck like a fleshlight
Even dudes who like me straight lookin' at me crazy
Girls used to tell me I ain't cool enough
But gettin' time of day from a model is new to me
Bein' me isn't as hard as it used to be

 then I'll pay for all the food on the Earth  man
 it's an enemy of Batman
 niggas call me faggot 'cause they closeted
 comin' out the backside of a rocket ship
 you dudes are the opposite of Loch Nesses
 we can squash the beef right now like sausages
 say it like a white kid
 your booty's big as hers  say that to my white bitch
 my dick is made of carrots
 I meant honeys  oh  forget it
 I will not fail summer

Tryin' to hold me down  oh
You such a fuckin' lame!
It's what they used to yell back in seventh grade
My mama said she'd get me that new jacket when the cost go down
Hit the office  stole some Tommy Hil' from lost and found
Not bad for a family of foster child
Lookin' fly  man  I'm flossin' now
But them niggas saw through me
Are you serious? What is this?
Took the jacket off third period  ellipsis
Listening to Sky Is the Limit on my Walkman
Thinking if Biggie can make it through it  man  then I can
Dope-boy swag  I always wanted that
But my persona was always more of that Arthur Ashe
But no love for the son of a commuter who was a radio head
And okay at them computers at the post office
It's funny how you smoke niggas then you start coffins
All my people need throat lozenge
My fear is dead  ambition drove the hearse
But niggas got me feelin' I ain't black enough to go to church
Culture shock at barber shops 'cause I ain't hood enough
We all look the same to the cops  ain't that good enough?
The black experience is black and serious
'Cause being black  my experience  is no one hearin' us

I'm trippin' off the other day
'Cause God knows what these white kids sayin'  dude
You're not not racist 'cause The Wire's in your Netflix queue
Subtle racism  it's hard to pin it
'Cause you'd only understand if you were me for just a minute
This one kid said somethin' that was really bad
He said I wasn't really black because I had a dad
I think that's kinda sad
Mostly 'cause a lot of black kids think they should agree with that
If you're a father  you should stick around if you could
'Cause even if you're bad at it  you could Tiger Woods or MJ
We warriors  we all need senseis
Change everything that we've done so far
I don't mean makin' B.E.T. T.E.R
I mean just the way that we see each other
I won't stop until they say:
James Franco is the white Donald Glover
Yeah  these niggas wanted Cookie  but instead I gave 'em Loch Ness

All I ever really wanted was to change the game
Spent the year kicking ass and taking names
Mama told me I was special when them test scores came in
My lifestyle simple: Live easy and Bruce Willis
That’s why these fucking emcees want their asses back
Don’t you know that I’m a rapist? Ask a track
But these smart middle-class black kids need a role model
Than pill-popping all these drugs so I can stay awake
You think about your old girl and how breaking up’s a mistake
Black dudes assume I’m closeted or kinda gay
White people confused like girl on Glee and Gabourey
IAmDonald is a full-time job
These niggas want me to fail so they can write me off

Dirty girls love my dick  they’re cockroaches
I come hard like my life keep her pussy tight
You want a dude who keep it real and stay hood
I’m just happy these girls seem into me now
That’s why you niggas fail like all of your parents’ marriages
When I called her mixed like the crowd at my last show
She said to write her something nice on the next track
I worked hard on that song like day and night
I didn’t know he had it in him
Renaissance man with a Hollywood buzz
I refuse to go back to not liking who I was because
These fake sounds
All the things that we felt

I know what you’re ready to be (be)
But it isn’t with me (me)
So I’m ready to leave you alone
I don’t really wanna fight like this

I used to walk on the beach at night
I remember
The best time was when well  me and you
We got all our friends and we got a tent
We slept in it
Not the whole night  but just enough time
Magic happened  nothing was born luckily
It's up to me  but
Then we left
The times have changed
The pleasures that I feel
They say you never say never  it's real
Electric eels in the water  we should probably not go deep
I like to stare at you and look at you when you sleep
I wake up feelin' like you won't play right
It made me put away my pride

And I wonder what they'd say if that EP drop

They're all the same so I don't need these clothes
Same white shirt with his nappy ass hair

This is on a bus back from camp
I'm thirteen and so are you
Before I left for camp I imagined it would be me and three or four other dudes
It turned out it would be me and just one girl. That’s you
And we're still at camp as long as we're on the bus
And not at the pickup point where our parents would be waiting for us
We're still wearing our orange camp t-shirts. We still smell like pine needles
I like you and you like me and I more-than-like you
But I don’t know if you do or don't more-than-like me
You've never said  so I haven't been saying anything all summer
Content to enjoy the small miracle of a girl choosing to talk to me
And choosing to do so again the next day and so on
A girl who's smart and funny and who  if I say something dumb for a laugh
Is willing to say something two or three times as dumb to make me laugh
But who also gets weird and wise sometimes in a way I could never be
A girl who reads books that no one’s assigned to her
Whose curly brown hair has a line running through it
From where she put a tie to hold it up while it was still wet
Back in the real world we don't go to the same school
And unless one of our families moves to a dramatically different neighborhood
We won't go to the same high school
So  this is kind of it for us. Unless I say something
And it might especially be it for us if I actually do say something
The sun's gone down and the bus is quiet. A lot of kids are asleep
We're talking in whispers about a tree we saw at a rest stop
That looks like a kid we know
And then I'm like  “Can I tell you something?”
And all of a sudden I'm telling you
And I keep telling you and it all comes out of me and it keeps coming
And your face is there and gone and there and gone
As we pass underneath the orange lamps that line the sides of the highway
And there's no expression on it
And I think just after a point I'm just talking to lengthen the time
Where we live in a world where you haven’t said “yes” or “no” yet
And regrettably  I end up using the word “destiny”
I don't remember in what context. Doesn't really matter
Before long I'm out of stuff to say and you smile and say  “okay”
I don't know exactly what you mean by it  but it seems vaguely positive
And I would leave in order not to spoil the moment
But there's nowhere to go because we're on a bus
So I pretend like I'm asleep and before long  I really am
I wake up  the bus isn't moving anymore
The domed lights that line the center aisle are all on
I turn and you're not there
Then again a lot of kids aren't in their seats anymore
We're parked at the pick-up point  which is in the parking lot of a Methodist church
The bus is half empty. You might be in your dad's car by now
Your bags and things piled high in the trunk
The girls in the back of the bus are shrieking and laughing and taking their sweet time
Disembarking as I swing my legs out into the aisle to get up off the bus
Just as one of them reaches my row
It used to be our row  on our way off
It's Michelle  a girl who got suspended from third grade for a week
After throwing rocks at my head
Adolescence is doing her a ton of favors body-wise
She stops and looks down at me
And her head is blasted from behind by the dome light  so I can't really see her face
But I can see her smile. And she says one word: “destiny”
Then her and the girls clogging the aisles behind her all laugh
And then she turns and leads them off the bus
I didn't even know you were friends with them
I find my dad in the parking lot. He drives me back to our house and camp is over
So is summer  even though there's two weeks until school starts
This isn't a story about how girls are evil or how love is bad
This is a story about how I learned something and I'm not saying this thing is true or not
I'm just saying it's what I learned
I told you something. It was just for you and you told everybody
But this means there isn't a place in my life for you or someone like you
Is it sad? Sure. But it's a sadness I chose
I wish I could say this was a story about how I got on the bus a boy
But that's not true. The truth is I got on the bus a boy. And I never got off the bus
 I swear to God I am
 I swear to God I am
 let me say I'm drunk off of shitty wine
 you had enough of mine
 you never gave me any sign

 I think there's something special

Lost all of our woe
I know this music shit ain't shit
And all these random niggas in my house make you anxious
And I ain't never told you that our love would be painless
But I was so in love with you I thought we could make it
Prioritize on our lives and made you into a business
That's why you wasn't surprised when I had made my decision
And it's nice to have a felon when the boys get violent
The Mexicans tried to jump me at the club
Funny thing was I thought they were stepping to show me love
When I ain't in her arms all I'm making is enemies
Hear 'em screaming obscenities at a nigga
Wanted to live bigger
Them Edenwald projects was eatin' our concept
Gun Hill Road made them summers feel cold
On the same train that my parents met on
Twenty years later and my thoughts still ghetto
Got your own couch now but you don't feel better
Lost all of our woe
Hood niggas don't want to be—
I will try to be gentle
My love....
Worst rapper to ever spit on an open mic
Worst rapper to ever get on so many likes
Worst rapper to ever blow up and over night
Headlines saying he leaving to be a rapper
With niggas saying:
Who knew that every rapper with a new crew
You drive until the lease up
Well I'm sitting on top of the world
There's only one second secure
And I can't get it back
Find solace in the fact my ball bigger
Give a fuck 'bout y'all niggas
Get the point like ball kickers
Your girl play my music
So that's thumbs down to your new shit

Buddha stance on a forest on the ayahuasca
Looking down on my confidence
I wet the bed the first night on my tour bus
I can't name a lot of rappers that you better than
Tear myself down first to make 'em pay in advance
Heard a lot of y'all talking behind his back
When he walking out
The same dudes who laughing after you go
Be the same dudes emailing asking you 'bout your show
It's on FX? Tight nigga
Me and my homies making flicks
Me and my homies making beats
Me and my homies making hits
We saw this kid get shot up by the cops in Atlanta
They shot through his Phantom
And tandem cannons were blamming him
He was standing there like 20 seconds before
What's the point? I don't know
Why am I here? Why am I alive? Why do you care?
Khalifa's first name now there's urine on him (Eww)
Damn 'Bino why you gotta do it to em?
There's levels to the shit like a wedding cake
My new girl so pretty that the world shine
My new girl getting kissed by the coastline
My new girl so pretty we can bovine"
