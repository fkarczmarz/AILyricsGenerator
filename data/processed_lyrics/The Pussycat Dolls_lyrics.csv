"I got a problem
Shopaholic's  what they call 'em
Gimme shoes and give me bags
How much you want?
I need 'em bad
All them girls be checking my bags
While they be biting my swag
I guess they know I'm bad (Bad)
What a bad little girl I am (I got a problem) (Bad bad)

I know you've given me everything
It's so hard to let my guard down
But my instincts tell me I should run away
Searched my whole life and now I found
The answer I needed
(Chorus:)
So I'm calling all angels
I've been lost so long
Shine a light for me
I'm calling all angels
Help me to be strong
Now I'm on my knees
Now you gave me the one I need
I know that forever-is all I need to believe
I'm calling all angels
I'm calling all angels
(Verse 2:)
Answered all my prayers
And still I can't see the light
I'm filled with so much fear
From shadows deep inside
You might also likeAnd I would give this world away
To break these chains that refuse to set me free
(Chorus:)
So I'm calling all angels
I've been lost so long
Shine a light for me
I'm calling all angels
Help me to be strong
Now I'm on my knees
Now you gave me the one I need
I know that forever- is all I need to believe
I'm calling all angels
I'm calling all angels
(Bridge:)
Im not asking you for love.. but asking you..
To show me how..to love..
(Chorus:)
So I'm calling all angels
I've been lost so long
Shine a light for me
I'm calling all angels
Help me to be strong
Now I'm on my knees
Now you gave me the one I need
I know that forever- is all I need to believe
I'm calling all angels
I'm calling all angels

Oohoohooh (yeaheah)

Oh yeah (oh yeah)
Two hands to touch me with
Feelin' more than butterflies
Put on a slow CD
And throw the pillows on the floor
Come sit right next to me
You know what I'm waiting for
Take me away
I think you know the place that I'm talkin' 'bout
Let's get it straight
You can lay me down on a bed of roses
Places as far as I'm about to go
Can you curl my toes?

Want you to take your time
But don't take any more
Just lock your lips with mine
And I'm under your control
You whisper in my ear
Things are really heatin' up
Could spend the whole night here
And it still won't be enough
Take me away
I think you know the place that I'm talkin' 'bout
Let's get it straight
You can lay me down on a bed of roses
Places as far as I'm about to go
Can you curl my toes?
You gotta give me a story
I can talk about when the girls go out
And you don't have to worry
I swear I'll tell them you how you put it down
So I'ma lay back and relax
Cause I know that the night's only 'bout to beginning
Kiss me once twice and I'll know it
If you can curl my toes over again
(And again and again and again and again and again...)
Ooh you
You can lay me down on a bed of roses
Places as far as I'm about to go (ohoohoohooh)
Can you curl my toes? (you can)
You can lay me down on a bed of roses (oohohoh)

As she drops the ring to the floor
She says to herself You've left before
And he shattered something as
She dragged her suitcase down the path
To the driveway
She had never gone that far
Normally this would be
The time that she
Would let him talk her out of leaving
As she got into her car
She said No
Happily never after
I'll never let another teardrop fall
As she drove away she starts to smile
Realized she hadn't for a while
Wonderin' why she stayed in such denial

Who's gonna make your day the way that I do?
No one loves you like I love you
No one in the world (Let's go)
No one loves you  like I love you
No one in the world
You want your girl to give advice
But you're always  always right
You want her naughtier than nice
And you don't ever wanna fight
You want her hanging out at home
Even when she's alone
You want everything  but that's a dream
Tell me  tell me
Who's gonna love you  baby?
Who's gonna be there for you?
Who's gonna keep the faith the way that I do?
Who's gonna hold you down?
Pick you up off the ground?
Who's gonna make your day the way that I do?
Who's gonna be there for you? (Ohh)
Who's gonna keep the faith the way that I do?
Who's gonna hold you down? (Hold you down)
Pick you up off the ground?
(Who's gonna love you?)
Who's gonna make your day the way that I do?
Nobody  nobody
Nobody  nobody
Nobody  nobody
Nobody  nobody
Nobody  nobody
Nobody  nobody
Nobody  nobody
Nobody  nobody
Who's gonna be there for you?
Who's gonna keep the faith the way that I do?
Who's gonna hold you down? (Hold you down)
Pick you up off the ground?
All of a sudden it's a herd
Chickens be talkin' i keep walkin'
They're just a flock of birds
Players and gators gorillas
Holding up the walls (ooh-ooh)
Half past two it's a zoo (ooh)
I'm sippin' and slippin' on my Pinot
But i know what he wants
Two steps ahead of ya
Predator he's out on the hunt
Lookin' Like Bambi I'm candy
And he want a taste (ooh-ooh)
Half past two it's a zoo (ooh)
(Chorus)
Look at all these animals in here
Movin' like some wild and crazy bandits
Party people up in a panic
So gone they on automatic
Look at all these animals in here
Movin' like some wild and crazy bandits
You're lookin' for a mate we'll find you a boo
You just might see one in this zoo
You might also likeZoo zoo zoo
Animals on the loose (loose loose)
We get up like it's a zoo (zoo zoo)
Animals on the loose (loose loose)
It's like we up in the zoo
Zoo-oo-oo-oo
(Verse 2)
Strut like a pony on it
Thoroughbred in here with a flawless mane
Wandering like crazy hit me baby
I'm wild and I can't be tamed
Eagle eye I spot him
I got him I don't have to chase (ooh-ooh)
Half past two it's a zoo (ooh)
He picks up my fragrance he goes crazy
He scoops me like Tarzan
We hit the floor while we proceeded
To do our mating dance
Heated we needed back up
And you getting in the way (ooh-ooh)
Half past two it's a zoo (ooh)
(Chorus)
(Bridge)
You can't expect for me to just sit right here
And keep it together babe (keep it together babe eeh-eh-eeh)
The animal in me it won't let me be alone and everything
Is about to drive me crazy (is about to drive me crazy eeh-eh-eeh)
(x2)
I just can't take anymore
I think i'm losing control
Feel like letting it go
Giving in to my instincts"
