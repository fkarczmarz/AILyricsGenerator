lyrics
"Here comes the pain!
What the hell am I sayin'?
I don't know about malevolent
Sure as hell decadent
Walls! Let me fall! Fuck you all!
Fuck it!
Who the fuck am I to criticize your twisted state of mind?
Feels like a burn from which you never learn

Go
You can't kill me 'cause I'm already inside you
You can't kill me 'cause I'm already inside you
You can't kill me 'cause I'm already inside you
You can't kill me 'cause I'm already inside you
A harvest of seclusion and regret
The burning can begin
A period of ash is what you get
The quiet is a curse
But my respect was shown to you by force
Another day too late
Another neck too eager for the rope
Liar
Liar
Yesterday was hard
Tomorrow's just a promise of the same
When friends have all subscribed
To spitting on the ground to say my name
Fire on the ice
December in the summer kills the heart
Your hate is no surprise
I guess I have to die to play my part

You close your eyes and join the blind
Slit your wrists for peace of mind
Turn your back and show us the truth
There's only one way to remember it for you
(Hold the weight)
Never trust the one beside you
(Carried away)
You know just as much as I do
(Hold the weight)
Do it all for what you really love
(Carried away)
Use you up until they've had enough
(Hold the weight)
Never trust the one beside you
(Carried away)
You know just as much as I do
(Hold the weight)
Do it all for what you really love
(Carried away)
Use you up until they've had enough
Clench your teeth and tighten your grip
True victims and survivors learn to make war
Don't want to be the sad man singing anymore
I did it all wrong so I'd get it all right
Liar
Liar
Coming like a hell-bent killing machine
Can't afford to be the goddamn wreckage
Burn it all again at a million degrees
Calling all the adamant upper-level
Undefeated counterfeit cunts with a reason to fear
Throw away all the meaningless shit that's clinging
The enemy is here  I said stop
Give it to three
I'm gonna show you how to do it if you know what I mean
One by one against  give me the name
All you shiny pretty never-wills ruined the game
You hold all the keys  so the chains shouldn't hold you
I know you heard me  I fucking told you
Old does not mean dead  new does not mean best
No hard feelings  I'm tired of being right about everything I've said
Yours does not mean mine  kill does not mean die
We are not your kind
No excuses  I challenge you to all out fucking life
Drop that shit and put it on a pedestal
Children are afraid of the gods
Raise your hands and show me what's impossible
That makes us even  never tell me the odds
What a bore  I'm getting stuck in a metaphor
I don't wanna go to sleep
I need a breakdown quick in negotiations
Get it all together and remember to seethe  stop

I'm gonna show you how to do it if you know what I mean

I gotta know now  you better tell me
Old does not mean dead  new does not mean best
No hard feelings  I'm tired of being right about everything I've said
Yours does not mean mine  kill does not mean die
We are not your kind
I challenge you to all out life
We are gathered here today to get it right
Repeat after me:
I will not celebrate mediocrity
I will not worship empty shells
I will not listen to worthless noises
I will not subject myself to selected predictable choices

My quality should not be bought and sold
For convenience's sake  ever

All out life  yeah
I challenge you to all out fucking life  yeah
 dirty teeth in the crease
 it occurs to me
 and I think I'm going to
 we will deceive our better selves
 we had to simply comply
 did you cultivate?
 there's a nihilist...
 fallen by the side
 we'll deny it
 it would've taken just one word to stay from you
 you can tell me it's no use
 and I'm
Let him crave your wisdom
Let him crave
Let him be provoked
And tomorrow is still a step behind
So hear me out
Let's hear it for the damaged
Who understands but the broken?
Developed in the arms of spite
I'm all fucked up and I make it look good
Adrenaline sight tonight
I'm overthrown
I'm over your throne
I'm over it
Blessed are the fires that have burned me

Remember how you spent the best part of forever
In a state of pure disease?
It was another thing altogether
To forget that you brought out the worst in me
You just wish you'd hate like I do
Fighting off a generation too uptight
We're all dressed up with nobody to kill
The rhetoric stops tonight
I'm overthrown
I'm over your throne
I'm over it
Blessed are the fires that have burned me
Now's not the time for denying
Shifting the focus to scare
Let's not forget we're all guilty
All three dimensions polluted by earnest despair
I'm overthrown
I'm over your throne
I'm overthrown
I'm over your throne
I'm over it
Let him crave understanding
Let him crave your wisdom
Let him crave
Let him be provoked
God's in a coma
Put faith in a life support
Running away won’t feel the same
If you reach your metaphysical last resort
It's a miracle you haven't broken any laws
We are not entitled to surviving
So keep your friends and your enemies thriving
(Good for you) What a cliché
(Just not true) What a giveaway
(What comes now) Can’t be the last one
Falling down
Every time this happens
I'm breaking a promise
I made to a version of me
Why can't I covet
And keep it away
From the leeches who want to deceive?

What is coming has begun
It's something that you gotta see
We lie and say that it's too late for some redemption
What is coming has begun
An ending I won't live to see
We tell ourselves it can't be hell if there's no heaven
In a sick perversion of a spider’s web
Crawling over all the spent digested pieces
Celebrate the dead
Here come all the judging eyes
Gotta pave the road with your best intentions
I only wish you could picture a future
That doesn’t resemble your crazy inventions
(Good on you) I don't mean it
(Dream come true) I don’t need it
(What goes up) Another hollow one
Must come down

We tell ourselves it can't be hell if there's no heaven
A mirror only works if you open your eyes
But even then you have to understand what's inside
The easy part is always hardest to see
The weight of the catalyst
Gonna tell you all about it for the savages
(Good for you) Not another one
(Just not true) Not another one

Even now  I realize the time I'll never get
Another story of the bitter pills of fate
I can't go back again  I can't go back again
But you asked me to love you and I did
Traded my emotions for a contract to commit
And when I got away  I only got so far
The other me is dead
I hear his voice inside my head
We were never alive
And we won't be born again
But I'll never survive
With dead memories in my heart
Dead memories in my heart
Dead memories in my heart
You told me to love you and I did
Tied my soul into a knot and got me to submit
So when I got away  I only kept my scars
The other me is gone
Now I don't know where I belong

 it's me and no one else
 you'll never take me
 come on
 so I'll take you with me
 so kill me just in case
 so kill me just in case

It's the only thing that slowly stops the ache
But it's made of all the things I have to take
If the pain goes on… A-a-a-ah!
I have screamed until my veins collapsed
I've waited as my time's elapsed
Now all I do is live with so much fate
I've left behind this little fact
You cannot kill what you did not create
I've gotta say what I've gotta say
And then I swear I'll go away
But I can't promise you'll enjoy the noise
I guess I'll save the best for last

You're left with me 'cause you left me no choice

 am I the only motherfucker with a brain?
 but all they do is complain
 all you have to do is get rid of me!
 you lied to me for so long
 there's a sense of it
 it's shit that you gave me
 'cause you bled through
It's been years since anyone could be a friend
It's the fear that kills the feeling in the end
Can we face it? Can we shape it? Can we really die?
If rain is what you want... all you have to do is close your eyes
Just close your eyes...
I am watching resurrections start to crawl
Is there any chance in hell? Any chance at all?
Do we need it? Do we see it? Is it really there?
If rain is what you want... then take your seats  enjoy the fall
Enjoy the fall
The only thing deeper than my last breath
The only thing darker than my last death
But my cities... will never sleep again
In these diamonds  we're left with colored glass
As pressure takes its toll  we will outlast
But you can't break my heart
As long as I can be myself  I'll never fall apart
And you can't take me in
If I'm not broken  break me down
So I will never feel alone again

Her canvas doesn't leave a lot to fantasy
But her peace of mind can't stay inside the lines
It's so confusing  the methods that she's using
She knows she shouldn't leave a mark that I can see
Will she ever find one million of a kind?
It's cold and lonely  but that's because she told me
Lost inside her dirty world  no one hurts this pretty girl but her
Oh  she's beautiful
A little better than a man deserves
Oh  I'm not insane
Please tell me she won't change
Maybe I should let her go
But only when she loves me (She loves me)
How can I just let her go?
Not until she loves me (She loves me)  oh
I guess there's nothing left to do but have my way
She can feel it's right  so she doesn't close her eyes
She smiles and answers  it doesn't seem to matter

This fucking life is killing me!
Tearing me inside

Too far gone  I'm catatonic
Leaving you to criticize
Empty shell and running naked

Fists clenched tight in the pockets of my hoodie

Then fill your mouth with all the money you will save
Sinking in  getting smaller again
And the rain will kill us all
Throw ourselves against the wall
But no one else can see
The preservation of the martyr in me
There are cracks in the road we laid
But where the temple fell  the secrets have gone mad
This is nothing new  but when we killed it all
The hate was all we had
Who needs another mess? We could start over
Just look me in the eyes and say I'm wrong
I think we're done  I'm not the only one

Eyes can't see me  careful with your breathing
Get away  or they get to feed
Strength's not enough  be defiant
You're looking for a reason to suffer  you'll find it
But if you want to live to be better  begin it
Your energy will keep you from getting exhausted and purge it

Vultures salivate poison to exterminate
It's the dawn of the Renaissance
Emancipation  cattle on displacement
You want to reason  but there is no response
I won't allow this to happen
Another situation I feel like I'm trapped in
Nothing is my business and business is gone
I wish you all would fuck off
And go back to hell where you belong

This is the age of consent
You'll get a day in the sun before I kill your fucking lights
Burn up in your atmosphere
Burn up in your utmost fear
Desecrate your temples
Only hell and hate remain
Don't look for crows to scatter
Prepare for judgment day
We are kill gods

Can I find a way to get there?
Bury your head in the ground
Will you falsify for your fair share?
Will you come testify in the court of myopic opinion?
Or will you settle for oblivion?

Before I cut my heart open... and let the air out
Some wind spilled before me
In the strangest manner that had
Broke away my tear spout
As I lie there with my tongue spread wide open
A black widow had offered me a sweetheart tube
As I injected the candied heart that I selected
It's hard to stay between the lines of skin
Just 'cause I have nerves don't mean that I can feel
I wasn't very much fun to be with anyway
Just let the blood run red 'cause I can't feel!

(I won't let this build up inside of me) She isn't real
(I won't let this build up inside of me) I can't make her real
(I won't let this build up inside of me) She isn't real
 she continues to see
 she is home to me
 it's worse
 forever
Kneel down and clear the stone of leaves
I wander out where you can't see
I've felt the hate rise up in me
Kneel down and clear the stone of leaves
I wander out where you can't see
Goodbye!
Everything is 3D blasphemy
This is not the way I pictured me
Is it a dream or a memory?
I've felt the hate rise up in me
Kneel down and clear the stone of leaves
I wander out where you can't see

I have sinned by just
Makin' my mind up and takin' your breath away
I've felt the hate rise up in me
Kneel down and clear the stone of leaves
I wander out where you can't see
I've felt the hate rise up in me
Kneel down and clear the stone of leaves
I wander out where you can't see
Goodbye!
You haven't learned a thing
I haven't changed a thing
The flesh was in my bones
The pain was always free
You haven't learned a thing
I haven't changed a thing
The flesh was in my bones
The pain was always free
I've felt the hate rise up in me
Kneel down and clear the stone of leaves
I wander out where you can't see
I've felt the hate rise up in me
Kneel down and clear the stone of leaves
I wander out where you can't see
This song is for the dead
With my face against the floor
I can't see who knocked me out of the way
I don't want to get back up
I'm too busy being calm to disappear
I'm in no shape to be alone
Contrary to the shit that you might hear
Don't let this symbolism kill your heart
Just like we should've done right from the start"
