lyrics
"You're prettier than that
Now I kinda wish that you said so
Would've put in more effort
'Cause I know I won't let you down
Look alive and come with me
You're to die for every day
Drag you out at midnight to dance in headlights
And making out in the rain
Look alive and come with me
You're to die for every day
Let's do it ovеr again
Look alive and come with me
You're to die for every day
Drag you out at midnight to dance in headlights
And making out in the rain
Look alive and come with me
You're to die for every day
Let's do it over again

I'll go on all your adventures
If you wanna find yourself
I've been to so many places
But I've never felt better
'Cause I know I won't let you down
Look alive and come with me
You're to die for every day
Drag you out at midnight to dance in headlights
And making out in the rain
Look alive and come with me
You're to die for every day
Let's do it over again
Look alive and come with me
You're to die for every day
Drag you out at midnight to dance in headlights
And making out in the rain
Look alive and come with me
You're to die for every day
Let's do it over again (It works)
They say be one with the city
So I'm standing in the sun all day
Got their manners mapped out
And so their smiles are playing tricks on me
I try to laugh it all off
Truth is I'm lost 'cause I'm supposed to be
I follow you anywhere you go
I follow you anywhere you go
And I say that we'll be there through it all
I'll follow you anywhere you go

Get high by the beach all day?
You should know I haven't changed
Get high by the beach all day?
I'll follow you anywhere you go
I'm always too drunk to drive
And so I'm never in the driver seat
Then we go out with your friends
All these new faces are a blur to me
To pretend that I get it
'Cause I'm hopin' it will click someday
I'll follow you anywhere you go
And I say that we'll be there through it all
I'll follow you anywhere you go
Get high by the beach all day?
You should know I haven't changed (You should know)
Get high by the beach all day? (Get high by the beach all day)
Get high by the beach all day? (Get high by the beach all day)
You should know I haven't changed (You should know I haven't changed)
Get high by the beach all day? (Get high by the beach all day)
I wanna know what you're thinking
Hoping you’re getting the hints
Getting more obvious with them
Who'll be making the move?
Feels kinda weird when it's you and I
And I
Our bodies tangled tight in the purple light
You don't belong to me
Are you gonna tell her?
Our bodies tangled tight in the purple light

I run my fingers through her hair
Crushing my hope that this could go anywhere
I'm just a memory of good times
She's not mine
Love hurts when you hold her
But it's over
Love hurts when you're deep in
She's forgetting
She was just as bad as the boys
Bad as the boys

Love hurts when it's fire

But she kiss him
She was just as bad as the boys

Young and scared of love affairs  so keep your conscience down
The world is beautiful  believe it with another line
Keep it up  if you're lucky enough  you know you're winnin' at life
Piles of paper  gonna make 'em roll around in it
Watch it dripping from her lips and wash your sins with it
Keep it up  if you're lucky enough  you know you're winnin' at life
Safe with me
Move so free
Silently
Don't talk about it
Sweep it under the rug like we do  do
Don't talk about it
If you're sittin' with us  then you're in  too
(We) Don't talk about it
Your medallions blindin' your mind  too
Know you're lovin' the highs

You're better off  I'm glad that he's gone
He's gone  he's gone
You're better off  I'm glad that he's gone
I got a girlfriend  she's got a boyfriend
She calls me crying every day 'cause they got problems
He likes complaining  she's compromising
Coming to me for real advice when he just playing
I can tell she loves him way too deep
He loves being fucking hard to please
Cover the basics  it's pretty easy
He's a bitch with some expectations
Did you go down on his birthday? (Yup)
Did you let him leave a necklace? (Yup)
Or did you show him all your crazy? (No)
Blow him up on the weekends? (Mmm)
Did you give in to his ego
Just to give a little confidence?
I think you know it's time to let go

Counting all the calories
Now get 'em up
Body positivity
Help me out

Break till I wither away

How am I back here again?
I know my mirrors are lyin'

Love myself tonight and I think you can feel the same
Things I say don't usually come easily
There's one thing I need you now to know 'bout me
You know I'm under the influence
So don't trust every word I say  I say
When I'm under the influence
You know I'm under the influence
So don't trust every word I say  I say
Sounds good without makin' sense

I'm so intoxicated and faded
I'm in the club  barely made it
I see the look on your face
And it says that you want it later
But you ain't too in the way
And I fly you to different places
You call your crew in amazement
'Cause they ain't doin' the same shit
Barely knew what your name is
Don't care who you just came with
Make a move and get famous
Get your mission completed
Usually gotta politic or entertain
But I just got a couple things I wanna know
'Cause everything is moving slow
I usually wouldn't ask this though  but
You know I'm under the influence
When I'm under the influence
So don't trust every word I say  I say

They say the same about me
I don't care if it's all true
I want you hangin' with me
Rumors are their only friend
Spread their shit around's what turns them on
I can see all eyes expand

Think I'm fallin' out of my feelings (Yeah  you all save that night for me)
Hey  you got drugs?
Just need a pick-me-up
Only for tonight (We don't wanna go home)
Don't tell anyone I was with ya
Yeah  it's good stuff (Don't go)
But I'm resistant now
Take it if you want (Promise tonight you can brag 'bout tonight)
Go wild with our scars unhealed
We could be romantics for life
Like drugs make us feel unreal
A long way from home met this girl caught my sight
Smoke a little somethin' 'til the doubt subsidin'
We could be romantics for life
Go wild with our scars unhealed
We could be romantics for life
Like drugs make us feel unreal
(We could be romantics)

'Bout your life
It's none of their business who we love
Holding me down in my seat
'Cause we could be romantics for life
Go wild with our scars unhealed
We could be romantics for life
Like drugs make us feel unreal (unreal)
('Cause we could be)
We could be real
We could be real
(We could)
(Drugs make us feel)
We could be real
We could be real
We could be romantics
With our bodies talking
So I regret nothing
I wonder what you told her to make her stay
She'd rather smile and pretend with ya than let go
Blaming me for all the sadness
Didn't know 'bout you two
This whole thing is on you

Don't even bother with your lies
Won't let you see her when she cries

Keep saying I'm danger  but thinking I'm love
I'm out on the dance floor  drinking my tears
Acting all cliché  and facing my fears
Curious minds  hearts pounding
Fingers in ties  wet  dripping
Curious minds  lips  lick 'em
Pupils grow wide
I feel that thing that jolts me  fucks with me good
Shivering gold  I shiver in gold
Wild  real  that thing’s like moon rocks rolled up in love
Shivering gold  I shiver in gold
Kissing it better  the physical phase
Take in your body  I sit on your face
I see you smiling  covered in me
Curious minds  hearts pounding
Fingers in ties  wet  dripping
Curious minds  lips  lick 'em
Pupils grow wide (wider)

Losing high when the beat goes down
Fading in  take off all my clothes
Into you  my frustration grows
Take me now  want you to bring me home
You're my stranger in the dark
I am lonely  lonely heart
Waiting for someone to take me home
You're my stranger in the dark
I am lonely  vagabond
Hold me down  want you to bring me home
Let's begin  love making you beg for the win
I'm the prize you get if you do everything I say
Get you high  I get you high
I wanna be what you want me to be
You're my stranger in the dark
I am lonely  lonely heart
Waiting for someone to take me home
You're my stranger in the dark
I am lonely  lonely heart
Waiting for someone to take me home
(Someone to take me home)
You're my stranger in the dark
I am lonely  vagabond
Hold me down  want you to bring me home

So you're my last hope and  and I don't care what you do
Leave my heart open  I'm gonna leave it for you
And got your bottles of potion
I believe in karma
Set the waves into motion
The struggle is real
When you don’t tell me how you feel 'bout this love
The struggle is real
When you don’t tell me how you feel 'bout this love
The struggle is real
So you got all the answers
Hold the reigns on your dancer
Pull me underwater
Tell 'em nobody gets hurt

Pretend like I don't hurt

The struggle is real
When you don’t tell me how you feel 'bout this love
The struggle is real
When you don’t tell me how you feel 'bout this love
When the sun wouldn't come out
When I was called to make a statement
I'd wait for you to figure out
Why what you said just a minute ago
Triggered feelings from before
From the time you don't remember
But I never really understood
How people move on from a heart to love another
But I never really understood
How people move on from a heart to love another
I picked at all that I could think of
I guess I picked that up from you
No one could make me feel so useless
I know I did it to you too

Why cuts so deep every word that we speak?

How people move on from a heart to love another
But we're in the same crowd
Always at the same scene
So I don't know how
I'm supposed to act fine
When we used to be burning love
That died
Colder than ice
Why am I surprised?
But I guess that's how
I guess that's how we do it now
But I never really understood
How people move on from a heart to love another
But I never really understood
How people move on from a heart to love another"
