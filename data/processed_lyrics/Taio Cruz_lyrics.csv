lyrics
"Baby you should know you are the one that I see
Everything about you is the way that I like
We can do it baby anytime of the night
Cause you stay down and you always go right
Even when we tired girl you wanna go twice
I just wanna tell you're the one that I need
I feel the lotion feel emotion
And I just gotta tell you one more time
You're the best damn girl in the whole wide world
Baby you're the best in the whole wide world
You're the only one that I'm ever gonna need
The best damn girl I've ever seen in my life
Every time I look at you I'm proud that you're mine
Everything about you got me feeling all right
We can make love anytime that you like
You might also likeI just wanna tell you're the one that I need
Baby you're the one the only one for me
I feel the lotion feel emotion
And I just gotta tell you one more time
You're the best damn girl in the whole wide world
Baby you're the best in the whole wide world
You're the only one that I'm ever gonna need
Best damn girl
Check it now mama you are the bestest
That's why I say it lookin' at you in your eyes baby
Now listen one more time
You're the best damn girl in the whole wide world
Baby you're the best in the whole wide world
You're the only one that I'm ever gonna need
Best Girl
Now I may not be the worst or the best
But you gotta respect my honesty
And I may break your heart
But I don't really think there's anybody as bomb as me
So you can take this chance in the end
Everybody's gonna be wonderin' how you deal
You might say this is Ludacris
But Taio Cruz tell her how you feel
Before I love and leave ya
They call me heartbreaker
I don't wanna deceive ya
If you fall for me
I'm not easy to please
I might tear you apart
I'm only gonna break break your break break your heart
I'm only gonna break break your break break your heart

Should just let you leave and push you out of my life
But I don't decide 'cause I know that I
Just can't survive without you
And I know inside I never let you go
'Cause I'm sure you're the one
Even through the rain it's clear  you're the one I want
And no matter how we fuss and fight  girl
You should always know  I just can't stop loving you
That's why I can't say go

Even through the rain it's clear that you're the one I want

Move your body  and do what you like
Keep it going if it feels alright
Move your body  and do what you like

The more I struggle the more I get deep
I go full throttle down the dark streets
And there is trouble ahead I get weak
It's like I'm running through a red light
Girl you know you make me weak

And there's no turning back cause
We've gone too far
I'll drive you like a fastcar
And there's no turning back cause
We've gone too far
I'll drive you like a fastcar
It isn't like me to get caught up
But when you running you're never quite free

Look at them move  Look at them shake
Look at they features  beautiful creatures
And make love to them on beautiful beaches
I'm ready for the world  but the world ain't ready for me
Patience is a virtue  wait and see
Don't believe?
