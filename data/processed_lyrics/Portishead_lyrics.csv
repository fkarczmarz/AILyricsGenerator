" hidden eyes
 take a shot now
 it's true
 assume the dye
 enjoy
 take a shot now
 it's true
 what and why
 it's true
 the bitter taste
 descent or race
 buried lives
 it's true
 it's true
All the clouds may be white
But when you smile
That I can hardly wait
To hold you
Enfold you
Never enough
Render your heart to me
All mine
You have to be
From that cloud number nine
Danger starts the sharp incline
And such sad regrets
As they swiftly fall
Make no mistake
You shan't escape
Tethered and tied
There's nowhere to hide from me
You might also like
All mine
You have to be
So don't resist
We shall exist
Until the day
Until the day I die
All mine
All the clouds may be white
But when you smile
That I can hardly wait
To hold you
Enfold you
Never enough
Render your heart to me
All mine
You have to be
From that cloud number nine
Danger starts the sharp incline
And such sad regrets
As they swiftly fall
Make no mistake
You shan't escape
Tethered and tied
There's nowhere to hide from me
You might also like
All mine
You have to be
So don't resist
We shall exist
Until the day
Until the day I die
All mine
Stranger things will come your way
It's just I'm scared
Got hurt a long time ago
I can't make myself heard
Sin  slave of sensation
Full fed  yet I still hunger
Torn inside
Down inside
Sin  slave of sensation
(I'll never fall in love again)
(It's all over now)
At last  relief
A mother's son has left me sheer
The shores I seek
Are crimson tastes divine
I can't make myself heard
You might also like
Sin  slave of sensation
(I'll never fall in love again)
Going where never been
Running round my defenses
Been afraid  felt the grain
Open doorways full of shame
My own life I resented
Winter sigh  summer's gone
Holding off tomorrow's sorrow
Rushing out  Rushing in
Losing out  losing the
Identity of my heart
Didn't fold  chase the tear
Never let go  now I'm there
It's over  it's over
Winter sigh  summer's gone
Holding off tomorrow's sorrow
So I won't anymore
Winter sigh  summer's gone
Holding off tomorrow's sorrow
Reset in stone this stark belief?
Salted eyes and a soiled dye
Too many years
But don't despair
This day will be their damnedest day
Did you feed us tales of deceit?
Conceal the tongues who need to speak?
Subtle lies and a soiled coin
But don't despair
This day will be their damnedest day
Your swollen pride assumes respect
Talons fly as a last disguise

So don't despair
This day will be their damnedest day
Reset in stone this stark belief?
Salted eyes and a sordid dye
Too many years
But don't despair

Conceal the tongues who need to speak?
Subtle lies and a soiled coin
But don't despair
This day will be their damnedest day

Talons fly as a last disguise

So don't despair
This day will be their damnedest day
Alone with my self-doubtin' again
I try not to struggle this time
For I will weather the storm
I gotta remember (Gotta remember)
Don't fight it (Don't fight it)
Even if I (Even if I)
Don't like it (Don't like it)
Somehow turn me around (Somehow turn me around)
No matter how far I drift
Deep waters (Deep waters)
What the truth should be
And no one decided
That I'd feel this way
If you felt as I
Would you betray yourself?
But you can't deny how I feel
And you can't decide for me
No one should fear
What they cannot see
And no one's to blame
It's just hypocrisy
It's written in your eyes
And how I despise myself
But you can't deny how I feel
And you can't decide for me
And it's your heart
That's so wrong
Mistaken
You'll never know
Your feathered sacred self

But you can't deny how I feel
And you can't decide for me
And you can't deny how I feel
Playing with this bow and arrow
I'm gonna give my heart away
Leave it to the other girls to play
For I've been a temptress too long
Just
Give me a reason to love you
Give me a reason to be a woman
I just wanna be a woman
We're all looking at a different picture
Through this new frame of mind
A thousand flowers could bloom
Give me a reason to love you
Give me a reason to be a woman
I just wanna be a woman
So don't you stop being a man
Just take a little look
From outside when you can
Sow a little tenderness
No matter if you cry

Of forever and ever

Playing with this bow and arrow
I'm gonna give my heart away
Leave it to the other girls to play

Playing with this bow and arrow
Gonna give my heart away
Leave it to the other girls to play
For I've been a temptress too long
Just
When everybody knew what they wanted
It ain't here today
Through the times of lasting love
When parents talked of things tried and tested
It don't feel the same
Dreams and belief have gone
Far beyond the shrinking skies
Where money talks and leaves us hypnotised
It don't pave the way
Underneath the fading sun
The silent sum of a businessman
Has left us choking
Dreams and belief have gone

When everybody knew what they wanted
It ain't here today
Dreams and belief have gone
No hesitation
Give me
All that you have
And it's been so wrong

And it's been so wrong

And it's been so wrong
Is it all as it seems
And it's been so wrong
We'd ever known each other
And new evidence is what we require
In this world
I stand on the edge of a broken sky
Would you pass me by?
Just to wait for a while
So confused
My thoughts are takin' over
Unwanted horizons place me instead
Won't let go
I stand on the edge of a broken sky
Would you pass me by?
For no reason have I but fear
And I ain't guilty of the crimes you accuse me of
But I'm guilty of fear
I'm sorry to remind
But I'm scared of what we're creating
This life ain't fair
Gotta try a little harder
It could be sweet
Like a long forgotten dream
And we don't need them
To cast the fate we have
Love don't always shine through
'Cause I don't wanna lose
This life ain't fair
You might also like
Gotta try a little harder
It could be sweet
But the thoughts we try to deny
Take a toll upon our lives
We struggle on in depths of pride
Tangled up in single minds
'Cause I don't wanna lose
This life ain't fair
Gotta try a little harder
'Cause I don't wanna lose
This life ain't fair
Gotta try a little harder
These dreams that pass me by
This salvation I desire
Keeps getting me down
'Cause we need to
Recognize mistakes
For time and again
So let it be known for what we believe in
I can see no reason for it to fail
'Cause this life is a farce
I can't breathe through this mask
Like a fool
From this oneself
Testify or tell
It's fooling us now
So let it be known for what we believe in
I can see no reason for it to fail
'Cause this life is a farce
I can't breathe through this mask
Like a fool
 hidden eyes
 take a shot now
 it's true
 assume the dye
 enjoy
 take a shot now
 it's true
 what and why
 it's true
 the bitter taste
 descent or race
 buried lives
 it's true
 it's true
I thought I'd see it at the cold light of day
But now I realize that I'm only for me
If only I could see you turn myself to me
And recognize the poison in my heart
There is no other place  no one else I face
No remedy will agree with how I feel
Here in my reflecting  what more can I say?
For I am guilty for the voice that I obey
Too scared to sacrifice a choice chosen for me
If only I could see you turn myself to me
And recognize the poison in my heart
There is no other place  no one else I face
I'm just emotionally undone
When I have tried to find the words
To describe this sense absurd
I'm only losin' myself
My desire I can't hide
No reason I'm alive for
I can't divide or hide from me
I don't know who I'm meant to be
I guess it's just the person that I am
Often I've dreamt that I don't wake
Enjoy the gift of my mistake
I'm only losin' myself
My desire I can't hide
No reason I'm alive for

I'm only losin' myself

In a half lit world
I'm frightened to believe
But I must try
If I stumble if I fall
Have I got the strength to ask
Beyond the window
I feel this fear alone
Until we have
Total honesty
If I tremble or fall
Should I feel a moment with you
To softly whisper
I crave nothing else so much
Longing to reveal
Total honesty
I can feel your touch

 but I have never seen
 a turning from deceit
 oh no
 this silence I can't bear

I can't find my way
'Cause the child rose as life
Tried to reveal what I could feel
I can't understand myself anymore
'Cause I'm still feeling lonely
Feeling so unholy
'Cause the child rose as light
Tried to reveal what I could feel
And this loneliness
It just won't leave me alone
I'm fooling somebody

Deceiving to breathe this secretly

I struggle with myself
Hoping I might change a little
Hoping that I might be someone I wanna be
'Cause I don't know what I've done to deserve you
And I don't know what I'll do without you
'Cause I don't know what I've done to deserve you
And I don't know what I'll do without you
Ces crimes d'illusions
Nous trompent tous
Maintenant je suis las
C'est tout ce que je ressens
It's only you
Who can tell me apart
And it's only you
Who can turn my wooden heart
L'ampleur de notre guerre
Ce n'est qu'un rêve
On a tout ecrasé
Ca je peux le voir egoistement
Nous avons echoué
C'est tout ce que je ressens
It's only you

Quietly whisper

A wisdom that took me away from the bed
Spoke of the glory that we had become

Holding down sweet charity

But I'm aching at the view
They have values of a certain taste
The innocent they can hardly wait
Turning to dishonesty
With western eyes and serpents' breath
They lay their own conscience to rest
But then they lie and then they dare to be
Hidden heroes candidly
