lyrics
" you thought you had your man
 he ran when you tried to blast that man
 he sprinted
 son's finished
 you was aight with him
 why was he in the way?
 stays reclusive
 got that look like he always about to do shit
 one eyebrow raised
 'cause of a
 act like you killed on purpose
 you put work in
 your gun's a virgin
 read the bulletin
 now hollow heads getting heated
 constantly getting weeded
 I know they got on binoculars
 we balling 'til they come lock us up
 blowing 20 tonight
 Bob Marley Marlin' all through the night
 never cold turkey to war
 live forever  that's Insh'Allah
 shoppers in back of the limo
 God forgives and I don't
 act like you killed on purpose
 you put work in
 your gun's a virgin
 read the bulletin
 you just an accident murderer
 shot in the dome
 homicidal with weapons
 that I'm guessing
 I used to test them
 choke 'em out playing wrestling
 I see them now they repping
 gangsta little niggas
 but will he change really?
 I think of Wayne Perry
 but you aren't a name to me
 it wasn't necessary
 act like you killed on purpose
 you put work in
 your gun's a virgin
 read the bulletin
Oh my God  they speak venomous on the boy
Oh my Lord  my enemy is fear and I'm sure
Oh my God  they want the end of me 'cause I'm pure
It's a trend for these men to die on their own sword
Journey far  learn who you can be
But you can learn who you are when you around family
Chip off the shoulders of soldiers  on their grizzle
My granddaddy Mack Little married Nannie Little
They passed down wisdom  blessings were given
Pray my sins don't get passed to my children  I made a killin'
I'm alive like the morning star
Court Jordan's for the price on stock  so what the Hornets are?
Eatin' foie gras and caviar  listen
Adam and Eve
Don't fall too far from the apple tree  ayy
Adam and Eve  Adam and Eve
Don't fall too far from the apple tree  apple tree
The ghosts of gangsters dance
Chinchillas shake on the hanger  the force of this banger
The voice triggers somethin'  what is this conundrum?
Still puff the loud  it's nothin' less than a quarter pound
Savage narrative  every verse that I write bursts light
Brings awareness to my personal life
See my doctor more  sweat in the sauna or the spa
Spendin' fifty large at the Bellagio
Spent twenty on a bad bitch I hardly know
New girl every night  two girls was every other night
Sexual addiction  gangster tradition
I'm just good at existin'  existin' in my truth
As long as I enjoy the fruit  yeah

What come first  peace or the paper?
Before I had a piece of paper  peace was in my favor
Before I sat to eat at the table  it had leeches and traitors
Brothers is swine
It's so hard to trust 'em 'cause my hustle is mine
It's evident they all the same  with gray hair and still mean muggin'
You stay frontin'but these clowns got false crowns  fictitional kings
You broke my heart  Fredo
You bring this thing of ours down to a fable
Be advised my guys dyin'  enterprisin' at a boss's table
There's always room at my table
Insecurities is keepin' you disabled
All this money to get  is there less time?
They ain't stopped printin' money  'cause they made mine
I learned to stretch time  these are the best times
I'm in my neighborhood in stadiums  the Mets' kind
With restaurants and Carbone  spicy rigatoni go hard
A red Bordeaux  oh God

Time to take affirmative action  son
They just don't understand  you know what I mean?
You know what I mean?
Niggas don't understand the four devils:
Wicked niggas  man
And let's all wash this money through this laundromat
Sneak attack  the new cats in rap worth top dollar
In fact  touch mines and I'll react like a Rottweiler!
Who could relate? We play for high stakes at gunpoint
Roam in your own zone or get kidnapped and clapped in your dome
We got it sewn  The Firm art of war is unknown
Aristocrats politickin' daily wit' diplomats

Criminal thoughts in the blue Porsche
My destiny's to be the new boss
That nigga Paulie gotta die  he too soft
That nigga's dead on a ki of heroin
They found his head on the couch wit' his dick in his mouth
I put the hit out!
Yo! The smoothest killer since Bugsy  bitches love me
In Queens where my drugs be  I wear Guess jeans and rugbies
Bring your heater  all your C.R.E.A.M. go between us
Real shit! My Desert Eagle got a ill grip
I chill wit' niggas that hit Dominican spots and steal bricks
My red beam made a dread scream and sprayed a Fed team
Corleone be turnin' niggas to fiends
Yukons and ninja black Lexus
'Mega — the pretty boy with Mafia connections
Yo  my mind is seein' through your design like Blind Fury
And push cakes inside the casket at Just' wake
It's sickenin'  he just finished biddin' upstate
And now the projects is talkin' that Somebody gotta die shit
It's logic  as long as it's nobody that's in my clique
My man Smoke know how to expand coke in Mr. Coffee
Feds cost me two mill' to get the system off me
Life's a bitch  but God forbid the bitch divorce me
I'll be flooded with ice so Hellfire can't scorch me
Your top papi Señor Escobar
In the black Camaro  Firm deep
All my niggas hail the blackest sparrow
Wallabees be the apparel through the darkest tunnel
I got visions of multi millions in the biggest bundle
In a Lex pushed by my nigga Jungle
E-Moneybags got Moët Chandon  bundle of 62
They ain't got a clue what we about to do
My whole team  we shittin' hard like Czar
I keep a phat marquess piece  laced in all the illest snake skin
From BK to the 'Bridge  my nigga Wiz
Operation Firm Biz  so what the deal is?
I keep a phat jew-el  sippin' Cristy
Sittin' on top of fifty grand in the Nautica Van  uh!
We stay incogni' like all them thug niggas in Marcy
The gods — they praise Allah with visions of Gandhi
Bet it on  my whole crew is Don Juan
On Cayman Island with a case of Cristal
And Baba Shallah spoke  nigga with them Cubans that snort coke
Flippin' the bigger picture
The bigger nigga with the cheddar was mad dripper
He had a fuckin' villa in Manilla  we gotta flee to Panama
We got 48  which mean a whole lot of C.R.E.A.M
Now add the other 2 that 'Mega bringin' through
Mad coke and mad leak plus a 500  cut in half is 250
Now triple that — times 3  we got three quarters of another ki
Turn the motherfuckin' lights down
Turn the music up in the headphones
Make niggas mad and shit like
Just start dancin' in this muh'fucka
Yeah  (yeah) we just come outta nowhere
I feel like a Black Republican  money I got comin' in
Can't turn my back on the hood  I got love for them
Can't clean my act up for good  too much thug in him (nah)
Huddlin' over the oven  we was like brothers then (what?)
Though you was nothin' other than a son of my mother's friend
We had covenant  who would've thought the love would end?
Like Ice Cold's album (uhh)  all good things
Never thought we sing the same song that all hoods sang
Thought it was all wood-grain  all good brain
We wouldn't bicker like the other fools  talk good game
Never imagine all the disaster that one good reign  could bring
It's kill or be killed  how could I refrain?
And forever be in debt  and that's never a good thing
So the pressure for success can put a good strain
On a friend you call best  and yes it could bring
Out the worst in every person  even the good and sane
Although we rehearsed it  it just ain't the same
When you put in the game at age sixteen
It all to a head like a coin  cha-ching
The root of evil strikes again  this could sting
Now the team got beef between the Post and the Point
This puts the ring in jeopardy – indefinitely

Guess they ain't strong enough to handle their jail time
Weak minds keep tryin'  follow the street signs
I'm standing on the roof of my building
I'm feelin' the whirlwind of beef  I inhale it
Just like an acrobat ready to hurl myself  through the hoops of fire
Sippin' 80 proof  bulletproof under my attire
Could it be the forces of darkness
Against hood angels of good  that form street politics?
Makes a sweet honest kid  turn illegal for commerce (uhh)
To get his feet out of them Converse – that's my word

Bye baby  I guess you knew why I walked away
When we walked to the altar  that was an awesome day
Did counselling  couldn't force me to stay
Something happened when you say I do  we go astray
Why did we mess it up? We was friends  we had it all
Reason you don't trust men  that was your daddy fault
He in the grave – let it go  he no longer living
Said you caught him cheating with mom  fucking other women
Fuck that gotta do with us? Here's the keys to the newest truck
No matter who you fuck  that was before me
Wanted you as my shorty since I saw you screaming
Hate you so much right now
Should've saw the meaning  angry black women
Actions of a demon  I'm leaving
I guess you just knew and blew a good thing  baby (Bye baby)
You know I'm saying bye-bye (Bye-bye baby)

Bye baby  I guess you know why I had to leave
Seven months in your pregnancy  'bout to have my seed
Let's take it back some years  rewind it to the happy years
You and your Star Trak fam  I'm thinking you cats are weird
Then I tatted you on my arm so niggas would know
I thought no one could stop us  matching gold watches
I was your Johnny Depp  you was my Janis Joplin
Better than you knew yourself  and I knew this for certain
Crib in the Dominican  we got away from everybody
You screaming at the racist cops in Miami was probably
Bailed you out  next morning we got clean
Like it never happened  then later we at that Heat game
Just another day in the life  of two people in love
But it wasn't enough  so baby guess what...
I guess you just knew and blew a good thing  baby (Bye baby)
OH! OH! AHHHHHHHH! Bye-bye (Bye-bye baby)
I can't believe that this is happening to us
'Cause I'm saying bye-bye (Bye baby) Forever
'Cause I'm saying bye-bye
I guess you just knew and blew a good thing  baby
Listen  could you imagine writing your deposition?
Divorce lawyer telling you how this thing gonna be ending?
With you paying out the ass and I'm talking half
It’s either that or die  I wanted peace of mind
And all I seen was suckers  cowards
But look at yourself! Speak louder  bruh!
You live with your baby moms
And scared to make an honest woman out of her
At least I can say I tried  plus enjoyed the ride
Plus we got our little boy  my little joy and pride
Next go round I hope I pick the truest type
Goodbye!
(Bye baby) Baby.. baby
You know I'm saying bye-bye (Bye-bye baby)
I can't believe that this is happening to us
'Cause I'm saying bye-bye (Bye baby)
I guess you just knew and blew a good thing
You know I'm saying bye-bye
I guess you just knew and blew a good thing  baby
Gimme the key back  baby
'Til we make love just one more time
Make it seem forever
This is our last and final goodbye
I heard he was hidin' somewhere I can't see
Where is he  the man who was just like me?
Heard he was hidin' somewhere I can't see
And I'm alone  and I realize that when I get home
I wanna go through my red and my cherry
I wanna go through my red and my cherry
I want someone who like the champagne I like  my a-alike
Someone to talk me off the bridge any day or night
She teach me how to live  she ain’t afraid of life
Not easily impressed with the rich and famous life
'Cause she done been there and heard all the rumors before
She loves art  she ride out with me on my music tour
She like the herb's natural medicine  she cookin' good
She tell me everything is cool when it ain't lookin' good
Who not after material wealth but get dough still
Or maybe an educator  a lady with etiquette
Who can be from out the hood or even work for the president
As long as there’s no selfishness
Yes  as long as her love for the people is deep-rooted and evident
You can be easily recruited  you’re heaven-sent
Your smile put me at ease
You’re the woman I need  but where is she?

New York streets where killers'll walk like Pistol Pete
And Pappy Mason  gave the young boys admiration
Prince from Queens and Fritz from Harlem
Street legends  the drugs kept the hood from starvin'
Pushin' cars  Nicky Barnes was the '70s
But there's a long list of high-profile celebrities
Worldwide on the thorough side of things
One day grabs me  as I'm about to blast heat
40-side of Vernon  I turned while he asked me
What you up to? The cops gon' bust you.
I was a teen drunk off brew
Stumbled I wondered if God sent him
'Cause two squad cars entered the block
And looked at us  I ain't flinch when they watched
I took it upstairs  the bathroom mirror  brushed my hair
Starin' at a young disciple
I almost gave my life to what the dice do
Yeah man  throwin' them bones
Hopin' my ace get his case thrown
His girl ain't wait for him  she in the world straight hoein'
While he lookin' at centerfolds of pretty girls showin'
They little cooch  gangstas don't die  he's living proof
The D.A. who tried him was lyin'
A white dude  killed his mother during the case
Hung jury  now the D.A. is being replaced
Pre-trial hearing is over  it's real for the soldier
Walks in the courtroom  the look in his eyes is wild
Triple-homicide  I sit in the back aisle
I wanna crack a smile when I see him
Throw up a fist for Black Power  'cause all we want is his freedom
He grabbed a court officer's gun and started squeezin'
Then he grabbed the judge  screams out  Nobody leavin'

Know the business  ran Tennessee for years  now they chillin'

Responsible  the nigga still alive in a hospital
Midnight they crept in his room and shot the doctor too
See  my cousin's in the game  thuggin' and thangs
He plugged me with a dame who was half-Mexicano
Gave the ass up  I'm a mack daddy Soprano
She passed me the indigo  but the imbecile
Shoulda never tippy-toed  thought my eyes were closed
Openin' the hotel room door to let her goons in
But I moved in a manner on some Jet Li shit
I let the hammers blow  wet three kids
See honey thought I had somethin' to do with all the drama
'Cause I was with a crew that had her people killed
Called up my cousin  told him I ain't fuckin' with you
He responded cool  but told me out here this how motherfuckers—

But I was too scared to grab the mics in the parks and
Kick my little raps ‘cause I thought niggas wouldn't understand

Hip-hopper since a toddler
One homeboy became a man  then a mobster
If it dies  let me get my last swig of vodka
RIP  we'll donate your lungs to a rasta
Went from turntables to MP3's
From Beat Street to commercials on Mickey D's
From gold cables to Jacobs
From plain facials to Botox and face lifts
I'm looking over my shoulder
It's about 80 people from my hood that showed up
And they came to show love
Be what I wanna be
If I work hard at it
I'll be where I wanna be
I know I can (I know I can)
Be what I wanna be (Be what I wanna be)
If I work hard at it (If I work hard at it)
I'll be where I wanna be (I'll be where I wanna be)
'Cause she smells of corrosion and death
Watch the company you keep and the crowd you bring
'Cause they came to do drugs and you came to sing

This is for grown-looking girls who's only 10
The ones who watch videos and do what they see
You can host the TV like Oprah Winfrey
You thinking life's all about smoking weed and ice
You don't wanna be my age and can't read and write
Begging different women for a place to sleep at night
Smart boys turn to men and do whatever they wish

There was empires in Africa called Kush
Gold was converted to money it all changed
Money then became empowerment for Europeans
The Persian military invaded
Africa was almost robbed naked
Egypt was the place that Alexander the Great went
He was so shocked at the mountains with black faces
Shot up they nose to impose what basically
They learn to survive until they gain control

Save the music
Just use me for whatever the fuck they want
I don't get to say shit
Just grab me  just do what the fuck they want
Sell me  throw me away
Niggas just don't give a fuck about a nigga like me  right
It's like I'm a motherfucking gun  I can't believe this shit
Word up  word up
I seen some cold nights and bloody days
They grab me  bullets spray
They use me wrong  so I sing this song to this day
My body is cold steel  for real
I was made to kill  that's why they keep me concealed
Under car seats  they sneak me in clubs
Been in the hands of mad thugs
They feed me when they load me with mad slugs
Seventeen precisely  one in my head
They call me Desert Eagle  semi-auto with lead
Ohio to Little Rock to Canarsie  living harshly
Beat up and battered
They pull me out  I watch as niggas scattered
So I beg for my next owner to be a thoroughbred
Keeping me full up with hollow heads

Always  I'm in some shit!
My abdomen is the clip  the barrel's my dick
Uncircumcised  pull my skin back and cock me
I bust off when they unlock me
Results of what happens to niggas shock me
I see niggas bleeding  running from me in fear
Stunningly  tears fall down the eyes of these so-called tough guys
For years  I've been used in robberies
Giving niggas heart to follow me
Placing peoples in graves  funerals made 'cause I was sprayed
I was laid in a shelf with a grenade
Met a wrecked-up TEC with numbers on his chest that say:
Five-two-oh-nine-three-eight-five-and-zero
Had a serial defaced  hoping one day police would place
Where he came from  a name or some sort of person to claim him
Tired of murdering  made him wanna be a plain gun
I make myself jam right in my owner's hand

Yo  weeks went by and I'm surprised
Still stuck in the shelf with all the things that an outlaw hides
There's a grenade in a box  and that TEC that kept crying
He's 'bout to fall to pieces 'cause of his murder career
Yo  I can hear somebody coming in
Open the shelf  his eyes bubbling
He said it was on  I felt his palm troubled him
He placed me on his waist  the moment I've been waiting
My creation was for Blacks to kill Blacks
It's gats like me that accidentally go off  making niggas memories
But this time  it's done intentionally
He walked me outside  saw this cat
Knowing niggas is waiting in Hell for him
Sick of them thugs  sick of wrath of the next man's grudge
What the other kid did was pull out  no doubt
My owner fell to the floor  his wig split
Now I'm happy  until I felt somebody else grab me
I wonder.. will it take me under?
I don't know
Imagine smoking weed in the street without cops harassing
Imagine going to court with no trial
Trooping outta state for a plate of knowledge
Lacing ya clique up with diamond Roles
Just some thoughts for the mind

My mic check is life or death  breathin' a sniper's breath

Sneak a Uzi on the island in my army jacket linin'
Hit the Earth like a comet—invasion!
Nas is like the Afrocentric Asian: half-man  half-amazin'
‘Cause in my physical I can express through song
Delete stress like Motrin  then extend strong
I drink Moët with Medusa  give her shotguns in Hell
From the spliff that I lift and inhale  it ain't hard to tell
The buddha monk's in your trunk  turn the bass up
Not stories by Aesop
Place your loot up  parties I shoot up
School a fool well  you feel it like Braille
It ain't hard to tell  I kick a skill  like Shaquille holds a pill
Vocabulary spills  I'm Ill plus Matic
I freak beats  slam it  like Iron Sheik
Jam like a TEC with correct techniques

And groove even smoother than moves by Villanova
You're still a soldier  I'm like Sly Stone in Cobra
Packin' like a Rasta in the weed spot
Vocals will squeeze Glocks
MCs eavesdrop  though they need not to sneak
My poetry's deep  I never fell
Lord have mercy  Jesus Christ

Y'all don't know about my Biggie wars
Who you thought Kick in the Door was for?
But that's my heart  y'all still trippin' off the Jigga shit
Real niggas listen up and I'ma tell you how the whole thing start
Off top I brung Queens up from hard times
Rockin' at the Fever  streets was all mine
It was my version of the blues  droppin' out schools
The crack epidemic had rap representin' new rules
So I got in them shoes  tried 'em  wore them
Wasn't a perfect fit so I couldn't sport 'em
Young murderers ride  I knew all them
Jungle got shot  Will died  we was warrin'
I wrote it in my album
I was 18 when Lake seen the Island  and Lord held me down and
My surroundings started changin'  I had a baby
I was makin' my rounds with AZ
Niggas started noticin' my flow and was open when
The Golden Child closed 'em in
With more style than them older men
Puff tried to start a label  Prince Rakeem had formed Wu-Tang
Snoop and Dre had a new thing
So Puff drove his new Range through Queensbridge Projects
He let me drive it  before Ready to Die hit
Big and I hit blunts performin' at the Ark
Next thing you knew  Big blew and all the ballin' starts
He had Kim in his crew  I found Fox
Only niggas in New York with number one charts
Big was ahead of his time  him and Raekwon
My niggas  but dig it  they couldn't get along
That's when Ghostface said it on The Purple Tape
Bad Boy bitin' Nas album cover  wait
Big told me Rae was stealin' my slang
And Rae told me  out in Shaolin  Big would do the same thing
But I borrowed from both them niggas
Jigga started to flow like us  but hit with Ain't No Niggas
Had much Versace swagger
Big admired the Brooklynite and took him in as Iceberg the rappers
Today  don't know nothin' about this boss shit
There's more shit to wantin' to be this King of New York shit

Rap became a version of Malcolm and Martin
Rest in peace Will  Queensbridge live on
There's some ghetto secrets I can't rhyme in this song
There's some missing pieces I had to leave out
Had lost trust for Steve Stoute at some point 'til I got to know him
We old friends  but what's loyal?
Puff soaked Interscope offices with champagne bottles on Steve
And Steve thought the drama's on me
'Cause previously it would've been  against whoever
Friends forever
However  I learned  with some niggas it's all business
But I'm a street dude with morals
Then this nigga's with Jigga too much
He used to say Jay wanted my spot
I laughed  stayed home  never hung a lot
A quiet man who used to be alone plannin'
Baby moms thought I was too quiet  couldn't stand it
She hit the streets  later on she hittin' the sheets
With a rapper who wanted me on his songs  thinkin' he strong
I taught her how to watch for cars who might follow
Taught her street shit that I know
Her weakness was shine yo
Now I get my paper longer
Illmatic I was boss  It Was Written I flossed
One of the most creative LP's ever to hit stores
In The Firm I learned I Am NAStradamus
QB's Finest  Oochie Wally  faced more problems
I gave it all up so I can chill at home with Mama
She was gettin' old and sick so I stayed beside her
We had the best times  she asked would I make more songs
I told her not 'til I see her health get more strong
In the middle of that  Jay tried to sneak attack
Assassinate my character  degrade my hood
'Cause in order for him to be the Don  Nas had to go
The Gam-B-I-N-O rules I understood
What y'all want  see  I already had
The Gift and The Curse? Fuck that shit  the first you'll be last
I'm the man's man  a rapper's rapper
G-O-D  S-O-N – they'll be none after
I was Scarface  Jay was Manolo

Fuck who's the baddest  a person's status depends on salary
And my mentality is money-orientated
I'm destined to live the dream for all my peeps who never made it
'Cause yeah  we were beginners in the hood as Five Percenters
But somethin' must've got in us  'cause all of us turned to sinners
Now some restin' in peace and some are sittin' in San Quentin
Others  such as myself  are tryin' to carry on tradition
Keepin' this Schweppervescence street ghetto essence inside us
'Cause it provides us with the proper insight to guide us
Even though we know  somehow we all gotta go
But as long as we leavin' thievin'  we'll be leavin' with some kind of dough
So  until that day we expire and turn to vapors
Me and my capers will be somewhere stackin' plenty papers

One quarter through life  some godly-like thing created
Got rhymes three sixty-five days annual  plus some
Load up the mic and bust one  cuss while I pus from
My skull  'cause it's pain in my brain vein  money maintain
Don't go against the grain  simple and plain
When I was young at this I used to do my thing hard
Robbin' foreigners  take they wallets  they jewels and rip they green cards
Dipped to the projects  flashin' my quick cash
And got my first piece of ass  smokin' blunts with hash
Now it's all about cash in abundance
Niggas I used to run with is rich or doin' years in the hundreds
I switched my motto  instead of sayin'  Fuck tomorrow!
That buck that bought a bottle could've struck the lotto
Once I stood on the block  loose cracks produce stacks
I cooked up and cut small pieces to get my loot back

So I'll begin with the basics and flow from the heart
I know you think my life is good 'cause my diamond piece
But my life been good since I started finding peace
My nigga's like a locomotive
Queensbridge to Bushwick
You ain't even supposed to be here
You know where you at?
Use my tongue to tear the skin hanging from the roof of my mouth
Soon as I heard them iron wheels screeching
When it came to a halt whoever walked off got caught
Token man safe behind a locked door for sure
Bugging on how his imagination was so sick
Alcohol aging my niggas faster than felonies
I'm here y'all
This for my trapped in the 90s niggas
For my trapped in the 90s niggas
A baby's bein' born same time a man is murdered
The beginning and end  as far as rap goes
It's only natural  I explain my plateau
And also what defines my name
Pac was like Jesus  Nas wrote the Bible
Now what you're 'bout to hear's a tale of glory and sin
No I.D. my mentor  now let the story begin
Along comes a one son called a offspring
Screams got in the game and took bread out
Freedom or jail from Fayetteville to QB though
'Cause back when I was young there was massive niggas
Execs askin' will he live to see his own release date happen
Straight off the corner with the armor  Arm and Hammer
But I had appeal  I was a charmer
Yet still bein' my mama's son was my biggest honor
This shit was just kinda just a hobby in my project lobby
We was tryna be the Queensbridge Cosby's
But the street life robbed me of that  so I had to put it in raps
And who could I ask for help? Older niggas was gettin' mad
But that's the gift and the curse  that's the good and the bad
At least you got Jay  but he already one of the greats
And it's hard for the great to tell somebody how to be great
Nigga I tried and niggas threw that shit right back in my face
They took my cosign  but they ain't let me EP their tapes
And when they joint tanked  that's when they point blame
The first album freedoms and them fourth album pressures
A big difference between 'em but I get why you said it
Radio records are needed  I just wanted it to bring the warnin'
Global warmin' to that cold world you was breathin'
That's some advice I never got
If I don't sell another record  I'll just steady rock
While you was writin' down my rhymes I was just tryna show you
That if you say what's on ya mind  you can stand the test of time

Push the pool stick in your new crib

Live amongst no roses  only the drama
For real  a nickel-plate is my fate  my medicine is the ganja
Here's my basis  my razor embraces many faces
Your telephone blown  black  stitches or fat shoelaces
Peoples are petro  dramatic  automatic .44 I let blow
And back down po-po when I'm vexed  so
My pen taps the paper  then my brain's blank
I see dark streets  hustlin' brothers who keep the same rank
Pumpin' for somethin' — some'll prosper  some fail
Judges hangin' niggas  uncorrect bails for direct sales
My intellect prevails from a hangin' cross with nails
I reinforce the frail with lyrics that's real
Word to Christ  a disciple of streets  trifle on beats
I decipher prophecies through a mic and say Peace!
I hung around the older crews while they sling smack to dingbats
They spoke of Fat Cat  that nigga's name made bell rings  black
Some fiends scream about Supreme Team  a Jamaica Queens thing
Uptown was Alpo  son  heard he was kingpin
Yo  fuck  rap is real! Watch the herbs stand still
Never talkin' to snakes 'cause the words of man kill

 thick as yellow bitches for the suck of it
 It was Nas I used to hustle with
 past this
 I'm still not fully adjusted
 I've driven those toys
PS 111 had free lunch
Embarrassed but managed to get a plate...
We was kids hungry
She getting home late...
So I decided now I'm in charge
Either stay full or starve
Trying to cop quarters and trying to move that hard
Roll with a shooting squad
How could I not succumb? How could I not partake?
Licked off a shot for fun
What's got inside my brain?
Dudes who switch up and change
They wanna carry me like I'm some kind of lame
Either that or the pistol blow

What it say kid?
What up  kid? I know shit is rough doin' your bid
When the cops came you shoulda slid to my crib
Plus  congratulations  you know you got a son
I heard he looks like ya  why don't your lady write ya?
Told her she should visit  that's when she got hyper
Flippin'  talkin' about he acts too rough
He didn't listen  he be riffin' while I'm tellin' him stuff
Fuckin' with them niggas from that fake crew that hate you
But yo  guess who got shot in the dome-piece?
Jerome's niece  on her way home from Jones Beach
It's bugged—plus little Rob is sellin' drugs on the dime
Hangin' out with young thugs that all carry 9's
And night time is more trife than ever
What up with Cormega? Did you see him? Are y'all together?
If so  then hold the fort down  represent to the fullest
Say what's up to Herb  Ice and Bullet

Dear Born  you'll be out soon  stay strong
Out in New York the same shit is goin' on
The crackheads stalkin'  loudmouths is talkin'
Hold  check out the story yesterday when I was walkin'
That nigga you shot last year tried to appear
Like he hurtin' somethin'
Word to mother  I heard him frontin'
And he be pumpin' on your block
Your man gave him your Glock
And now they run together — what up  son? Whatever
Since I'm on the streets I'ma put it to a cease
But I heard you blew a nigga with a ox for the phone piece
Wildin' on the Island  but now in Elmira
Better chill  ‘cause them niggas will put that ass on fire
Last time you wrote you said they tried you in the showers
But maintain  when you come home the corner's ours
On the reals  all these crab niggas know the deal
When we start the revolution all they probably do is squeal
But chill  see you on the next V-I
I gave your mom dukes loot for kicks  plus sent you flicks
Your brother's buckwildin' in 4-Main  he wrote me
He might beat his case  'til he come home I'll play it lowkey
So stay civilized  time flies
Though incarcerated your mind dies
I hate it when your moms cries
It kinda makes me want to murder  for reala
I even got a mask and gloves to bust slugs  but one love
Sometimes I sit back with a Buddha sack
Mind's in another world  thinkin'
How can we exist through the facts?
Written in school text books  bibles  et cetera
Fuck a school lecture  the lies get me vexed-er
So I be ghost from my projects
I take my pen and pad for the weekend
Hittin' L's while I'm sleepin'
A two-day stay  you may say I need the time alone
To relax my dome  no phone  left the 9 at home
You see the streets had me stressed somethin' terrible
Fuckin' with the corners have a nigga up in Bellevue
Or HDM  hit with numbers from eight to 10
A future in a maximum state pen is grim
So I comes back home  nobody's out but Shorty Doo-Wop
Rollin' two phillies together  in the Bridge we call 'em oo-wops
He said: Nas  niggas caught me bustin' off the roof
So I wear a bulletproof and pack a black tre-deuce.
He inhaled so deep  shut his eyes like he was sleep
Started coughin'  one eye peeked to watch me speak
I sat back like The Mack  my army suit was black
We was chillin' on these benches
Where he pumped his loose cracks
I took the L when he passed it  this little bastard
Keeps me blasted and starts talkin' mad shit
I had to school him  told him don't let niggas fool him
‘Cause when the pistol blows
The one that's murdered be the cool one
Tough luck when niggas are struck  families fucked up
Coulda caught your man  but didn't look when you bucked up
Mistakes happen  so take heed  never bust up
At the crowd  catch him solo  make the right man bleed
Shorty's laugh was cold-blooded as he spoke so foul
Only 12  tryin' to tell me that he liked my style
Then I rose  wipin' the blunt's ash from my clothes
Then froze  only to blow the herb smoke through my nose
And told my little man I'ma ghost  I broze
Left some jewels in his skull that he can sell if he chose
Words of wisdom from Nas: try to rise up above
Keep an eye out for Jake  Shorty Wop  one love
To all my niggas locked up
From Queensbridge and all over
To my man   one love
To my man Herb  one love
To my man   one love
Can't forget my motherfuckin' heart  Big   one love

Y'all just wanna deal with drama
Talk about niggas who got things  y'all ready to kill his mama
Everything you into is underworld related
You sell your man out  not even your girl is sacred
To pull guns quick and always look behind the shoulder
Think of how many dudes died tryna be down with you
Everybody's under six feet of ground  but you
You a survivor  knowin' all the beef is ill
You got a bunch of thugs with you even now that's ready
A bullet hit your heart and ambulances take you away
Whose sons you killed and you ain't got a cut on your face?
Unmarked police cars roam the streets hard  the heat is God
Somebody tell these shorties reach for the stars
Instead they tell 'em how to reach through the bars holdin' a mirror
Lookin' down a tier in jail  makin' weapons to kill ya
He sighs with eyes that seen a war too many
Cold-blooded murderers  universal
These hot-headed youngsters always get into trouble
Reactin' before thinkin'  they easily irritated
And murder's premeditated  it's a fact that we sinkin'
Instead of movin' forward to blow up  so what's the science?
People shoutin'  police pushin' the crowd
And on the ground's a young soldier with meat hangin' out him
Am I hallucinatin' off the hazin'?
Or did I just see a nigga shoot another nigga's face in?
It's a ugly nation  cops circle the block with mug shots
Photograph pictures of suspect faces
It's usually two or three niggas who innocent
But if they lock the wrong ones up  then someone'll snitch
A divide-and-fall strategy  they aren't fair
I dig in my bag of weed that's covered with orange hair
This Color Purple'll make Whoopi give me the pussy
And Celie  Oprah and Danny Glover gots to feel me
This is how I escape the madness

Straight up  shit is real
And any day could be your last in the jungle
The corners is the hot spot  full of mad criminals
Who don't care  guzzling beers
We all stare at the out-of-towners
Before we get the four pounders and take their face off
The streets is filled with undercovers  homicide chasing brothers
The D's on the roof tryin' to watch us and knock us
And killer coppers even come through in helicopters
I drink a little vodka  spark a L and hold a Glock for

Thinking it can't happen 'til I trap 'em and clap 'em
And leave 'em done  won't even run about gods

I think we need to let them niggas know it's real  man
True indeed  knamsayin'?
But when it's real you doin' this
Even without a record contract  knamsayin'?
No question
Been doing this since back then
I'm sayin' regardless how it go down we gon' keep it real
We tryin' to see many mansions and Coupes  kid
Takin' niggas a long time  man
Who got the Phillies? Take this Hennessy
Ayo  dunn
Light them Phillies up  man!
Niggas stop fuckin' burnin' Phillies  man
Light some Phillies up then!
Pass that henrock  pass that henrock!
Nigga  act like you know!
Yo  we drinkin' this straight up with no chaser
I ain't fuckin' with you  nigga
I'm saying though  man
You know what time it is
Niggas don't listen  man
CB4 Gusto  your luck low  I didn't know 'til I was drunk though
You freak niggas played out  get fucked and ate out
Prostitute turned bitch  I got the gauge out
96 ways I made out
Montana way  the Good F-E-L-L-A  verbal AK spray
Dipped attache  jump out the Range  empty out the ashtray
A glass of 'Zé make a man Cassius Clay
Red dot plots  murder schemes  32 shotguns
Regulate with my thuns  17 rocks gleam from one ring
Then let me let y'all niggas know one thing
There's one life  one love  so there can only be one King
The highlights of livin'  Vegas-style  roll dice in linen
Antera spinnin' on Millenniums
20G bets I'm winnin' 'em  threats I'm sendin' 'em
Lex with TV sets—the minimum  ill sex adrenaline
Party with villains  a case of Demi-Sec to chase the Henny
Wet any clique with the semi TEC  who want it?
Diamonds I flaunt it  chickenheads flock  I lace 'em
Fried  broiled with basil  taste 'em
Crack they legs way out of formation
It's horizontal how I have 'em fuckin' me in the Benz wagon
Can it be Vanity from Last Dragon? Grab your gun  it's on though
Shit is grimy  real niggas buck in broad daylight
With the broke MAC  it won't spray right
Don't give a fuck who they hit as long as the drama's lit
Yo  overnight thugs bug ‘cause they ain't promised shit
Hungry-ass hooligans stay on that piranha shit

Across the street  you was wildin'  talkin' about how you ran the Island in '89
Layin' up  playin' the yard with crazy shine
I cocked the baby 9  that nigga gravy mine  clanked him
What was he thinkin' on my corner when it's pay-me time?
So dumb  felt my leg burn  then it got numb
Spun around and shot one  heard shots and dropped  son
Caught a hot one  somebody take this biscuit 'fore the cops come
Then they came  askin' me my name  what the fuck?
Got my gat back  time to backtrack
I had the drop  so how the fuck I get clapped?
Black was in the Jeep watchin'  all he seen speed by was a brown Datsun
And yo  nobody in my hood got one
That clown nigga's through  blazin' at his crew daily
The 'Bridge touched me up severely  hear me?
So when I rhyme  it's sincerely yours
Be lightin' L's  sippin' Coors on all floors in project halls
Contemplatin' war  niggas I was cool with before
We used to score together Uptown  coppin' the raw
But  uh—a thug changes  and love changes
And best friends become strangers (Word up)

Bring the shit  man! Live  man!
Whose world is this?

Understandable smooth shit that murderers move with
The fiend of hip-hop has got me stuck like a crack pipe
Suede Timbs on my feets makes my cipher complete
Whether cruisin' in a Sikh's cab or Montero Jeep
I'm out for presidents to represent me (Say what?)

When the world turned its back on me
I was up against the wall
I had no foundation
No friends and no family to catch my fall
I picked up a pen and I wrote my way— out
I picked up the pen like Hamilton
No political power—just lyrical power
Flickerin' lights inside my project hall
Writin' songs about rights and wrongs and bails bonds
I'm the architect like I wrote the code to Waze app
The definition of what It Was Written means
Know what I mean?

I picked up a pen and I wrote my way out!
Runnin' out of time like I'm Jonathan Larson's rent check
My pops tried in vain to get me to fight back
The lengths to which I'd go to learn my strengths and knock 'em senseless
I know Abuela's never really gonna win the lottery
This Puerto Rican's brains are leakin' through the speakers
And if he can be the shinin' beacon this side of the G.W.B and
Shine a light when it's gray out?
(I wrote my way out)
No lovin' arms to keep me warm
This hurricane in my brain is the burden I bear

Yo
They plan was to knock me out the top of the game
But I overstand they truth is all lame
I hold cannons that shoot balls of flame
Right in they fat mouth then I carve my name
Your arms too short to box with God
I don't kill soloists  only kill squads
Fame went to they head  so now it's Fuck Nas
Yesterday you begged for a deal  today you tough guys
I seen it coming soon as I popped my first bottle
I spotted my enemies tryna do what I do
Came in with my style  so I fathered you
I kept changing on the world since Barbeque
Now you wanna hang with niggas I hung with
Fuck bitches I hit  it's funny I once said
If I ever make a record  I'll take a check
And put something away for a rainy day to make my exit
But look at me now  ten years deep
Since the project bench with cracks in my sock  'sleep
I never asked to be top of rap's elite
Just a ghetto child tryna learn the craft of the streets
But look at me now

And diamond rings can poison a rap star
I saw a dead bird flying through a broken sky
Wish I could flap wings and fly away
To where black kings in Ghana stay
So I could get old  my flesh rot away
But that'll be the day when it's peace
When my gat don't need to spray
When these streets are safe to play
Sex with death  indulge in these women
Vision my own skeleton swimming in eternal fire
Broads play with pentagrams in they vagina
Like the Exorcist  then they gave birth to my seeds
I beg for God's help  why they love hurting me?
I'm your disciple  a thug certainly
I'm the N  the A to the S-I-R
If I wasn't  I must've been Escobar
.45 in my waist  staring at my reflection
In the mirror  sitting still in the chair like Mike Concepcion
When everything around me got cloudy
The chair became a king's throne  my destiny found me
It was clear why the struggle was so painful
Metamorphosis  this is what I changed to
And God  I'm so thankful

When the media slings mud  we use it to build huts
You fail to embarrass him  harassin' him
To my life  your life pales in comparison
So go write whatever blog  messiness is not ever the God
Do what's necessary  I'm never worried
Listen vultures  I've been shackled by Western culture
You convinced most of my people to live off emotion
That's why we competin'  death by the chrome barrel
Forgot the secrets  my Kilimanjaro bone marrow's the deepest
You can peep at the comments  but don't fall for that
We want freedom  I'm a scholar  an almanac
People do anything to be involved in everything
Inclusion is a hell of a drug
Some people have everything they probably ever wanted in life
And never have enough

From the birth of a child  the world is foul
Excursions of a searchin' child
Should learn to take nothin' personal
A parent hates to watch his baby's face
Takin' his first immunization shots  but this is great
The child's introduction to suffering and pain
Understands without words  nothin' is explained
Or rushed to the brain  lookin' up at his parents' face
Like  I thought you would protect me from this scary place?
Why'd you let them inject me?
Who's gonna know how these side effects is gonna affect me?
Who knew I would grow to meet presidents that respect me?
If Starbucks is bought by Nestlé  please don't arrest me

In Italy  I'm Eduardo Baccari
And I could sell Alaska to Russia  no pressure
It was a haunted by dead rich whites
Mad a nigga bought his crib to hang up pictures of black Christ
Circular driveways  black cars and black ice
Did good for a staircase loiterer  euphoria
What you saw when you seen a teen turn to a warrior
Did every Fourth of July  bustin' in the sky
It was important to a guy who was mob-minded
Future Murciélago driver 'til Lambos got average on me
I started likin' the look like I ain't had no money
Yellow taxi seats over Maybach seats
Just to remind me  just to inspire me
To stay focused  it's a real sick society
Just 'cause I got your support don't mean you're buyin' me
I'm buyin' back the land owned by the slave masters
Where my ancestors lived  just to say a rapper
Made a change  the pants-sagger put plans in action
To lay claim the Pan-African made it happen
You'll live  and you'll learn
See 'cause you've never been the same anyone else
