lyrics
"I feel like I'm out of my mind
It feel like my life ain't mine (Who can relate? Woo)
I've been on the low  I been taking my time
I feel like I'm out of my mind
It feel like my life ain't mine
I don't wanna be alive  I don't wanna be alive
I just wanna die today  I just wanna die
I don't wanna be alive  I don't wanna be alive
I just wanna die
And let me tell you why
All this other shit I'm talkin' 'bout  they think they know it
I've been praying for somebody to save me  no one's heroic
I know I'm hurting deep down  but can't show it
I never had a place to call my own
I never had a home  ain't nobody callin' my phone
Where you been? Where you at? What's on your mind?
They say every life precious but nobody care about mine
I've been on the low  I been taking my time
I feel like I'm out of my mind
It feel like my life ain't mine (Who can relate? Woo)
I've been on the low  I been taking my time
I feel like I'm out of my mind
It feel like my life ain't mine

I want you to be alive  I want you to be alive
You don't gotta die today  you don't gotta die
I want you to be alive  I want you to be alive
You don't gotta die  now let me tell you why
It's the very first breath when your head's been drowning underwater
And it's the lightness in the air when you're there chest-to-chest with a lover
And when you stare at your reflection  finally knowing who it is
I know that you'll thank God you did
I know you're the reason I believe in life
What's the day without a little night?
I'm just tryna shed a little light
It can be hard
It can be so hard
But you gotta live right now
You got everything to give right now
I've been on the low  I been taking my time
I feel like I'm out of my mind
It feel like my life ain't mine (Who can relate? Woo)
I've been on the low  I been taking my time
I feel like I'm out of my mind
It feel like my life ain't mine
I finally wanna be alive  I finally wanna be alive
I don't wanna die today  I don't wanna die
I finally wanna be alive  I finally wanna be alive
I don't wanna die  I don't wanna die
Pain don't hurt the same  I know
The lane I travel feels alone
But I'm moving 'til my legs give out
And I see my tears melt in the snow
But I don't wanna cry  I don't wanna cry anymore
I wanna feel alive  I don't even wanna die anymore
Oh  I don't wanna
I don't wanna
Alright  here we go
Yeah yeah  yeah
Money on my mind  so I'm too paid
Came a long way from G'burg
Puttin' in work like Ferg
New York to L.A.  Hawaii and Japan
I'm the motherfuckin' man  'least I'm feelin' like I am
Got the whole wide world in the palm of my hand
But don't give a goddamn  I'm Sam-I-Am
What that even mean? I don't know what you talkin' 'bout
Why nowadays everybody got a palm out?
PLP  yeah that be me and that be what I rhyme 'bout
I have arrived  all you rappers are in timeout
RattPack  where you at? (Everywhere worldwide!)
I know you been waitin' for this world to collide
B. O. double B. Y.  H. A. L. L.  and Folarin
'Bout to take it back like Doc and Marty inside the DeLorean
I am no historian  but here to make my predecessors proud
All you bitch niggas not allowed?
I put it on everything  I really want a cop out
But I did good for a dropout
Hop out the coupe  chicken heads go crazy
Gotta sound swag when the flow get lazy
What up? What good? Where you at? What you been on?
Anybody steppin' to me  promise they get shit on
Better hop up on the train 'fore you miss the chance to—
Hop up on the—hop up on the train 'fore you miss the chance to get on
Mixtape Bobby  that's the type of shit I spit on
Woo!

I said you gotta survive  gotta survive
Gotta survive  I said you gotta survive
Gotta survive  gotta survive (Wale though)
Uh  smooth criminal  Mike Jack
Throw a subliminal  put your woman in black dress
They was in Timberlands  I was reppin' them Nike boots
'Member them nights that momma couldn't come right back
I'm on the path right now  put the plight on the mic
If I write mine down  I incite my crowd
I put Solbiato down (wholetime  wholetime!)
Used to go to Mark Twain  Mo County co-signed me
Got many flows that any ho would vouch for
I got many foes cause many hoes be out for
Had the Penny Foams  remember those was copper
Had so many homies talkin' 'bout  How you got those?
I'm Phil Knight in real life  I'm real Nike
It's flight club in my house  they not like me
More than likely they ain't got the heart to fight me
It's a lie  somebody seein' me needs some Visine  yeah
Let me let it breathe
Saint Laurent level  weather never worry me
I'm well aware they be wildin’ when they talkin' me
They bitches in the ballot but whenever I be on the scene  oh
Hammers in the Uber  I be limousine though
Diamonds lookin' fluke but I got the same glow
And I got a juice back around the way though
My chain like a penguin's Pellegrino (woo!)
We cold  we cold
Used to be in LakeForest with the Kobe fro
Eddie Bauer coat  Foams and a load of dope
Boat load of white hoes I sold it to nigga
I was tryna survive  tryna survive
I was tryna survive  yeah  yeah
I was tryna provide  I was tryna survive
I put it down every time
Got some niggas alive  I got some niggas that not
Pour a little of brown liquor and look in the sky
Did it all for the capital  hope you haven't forgot
Hoes love me a lot  niggas hate me a lil
Anybody can hear me for real give me they props
Hookin' up with a couple models  nobody's gon' try to play us
The motto is get your paper and make you a lot
Pulling up with the Young Sinatra  I'm looking like Sammy Davis
The MGM or the Vegas to shake up the rocks
And the Stadium poppin'  the Palladium poppin'
It's a fifty a place nigga  she thinkin' about it
I'll be damned
And it's on now
Everybody know that it's on now (I'll be damned)
Get in the zone now
I said it's on now
Everybody know that it's on now (I'll be damned)
Ohh  get in the zone now
Everybody alive  everybody alive
Everybody that's listening to this feeling alive
Come on now feel the vibe  come on now feel the vibe
Everybody alive  everybody alive
Everybody that's listening to this feeling alive
Come on now feel the vibe  come on now feel the vibe
I said you gotta survive  gotta survive
Gotta survive  I said you gotta survive
Gotta survive  gotta survive
Gotta survive  I said you gotta survive
Never out of breath like an asthmatic  I done had it
For this shit  I'm an addict  back in Maryland livin' in the attic
Flowin' erratic  bringin' the static  bustin' like an automatic
I'm badder than the baddest and madder than the maddest
My flow the fattest  hotter than a desert in Nevada
None of the badder  fuck all the chitter and chatter  none of it matter
Pull the trigger and listen to the pitter and patter  let 'em shatter
'Cause I'm rippin' and livin' and strivin'  the killer
The Ripper  he callin'  we'll go and he'll flow and you know
Goddammit  I'm back at it
Never outta breath like an asthmatic  I done had it
For this shit  I'm an addict  back in Maryland livin' in the static
Flowin' erratic  bringin' the static  bustin' like an automatic
I'm badder than the baddest and madder than the maddest
My flow the fattest  hotter than a desert in Nevada
None of the badder  fuck all the chitter and chatter  none of it matter
Pull the trigger and listen for the pitter patter  let 'em shatter
I'm rippin' and livin' and strivin' the killer
The Ripper  he call and we'll go and he flow and you know
I'm rippin' and livin'  strivin' the killer
Ripper  he callin'  we'll go and he flow
Listen  rippin' and livin' and strivin' the killer  the-
Alright  we gon' do this one more time (Listen listen)
I'm rippin' and livin' and strivin'  the killer
The Ripper  he call and we'll go and he flow and you know
This what we gon' do right now
I'ma test my syllable ability  you know what I'm sayin'?
I like to call this shit my syllability
I've been sippin' on this tequila right now
This one of the last songs we recording for this motherfucker
So I'ma really gonna go off on y'all right now
We gon' do this shit in one breath  alright?
This ain't no editin'  we gon' do it like this
Are y'all ready? (Yeah)
I'm rippin' and livin' and strivin' to kill it
The Ripper  he'll call and we'll go and he flow and you know
Flippin' it  rippin' it
Like the motherfuckin' script and I'm ready to go
When I buy it then break it  roll it (Daaaaaamn!)
Then lick it and smoke it  choke on it later  yeah
Slicin' emcees like Darth Vader
Decapitate a hater the second I spit it
Say hell yeah (Hell yeah!)
Say hell yeah (Hell yeah!)
Say hell yeah (Hell yeah!)
Say hell yeah (Hell yeah!)
We're dealing with truths and rights
Come some more into my sight
(You no hear me yet?)
(Hear me live and direct)
(Walk with your tap)
Yeah  in London talkin' to rhêtorík 'bout my life and shit
I thought the album was finished but I keep writing shit
It's kind of funny how life changed and rearranged
No matter what happens  everything ain't gon' be the same
The incredible album  what an incredible outcome
I grip the mic and then talk to the people like I'm Malcolm
I used to think the fame and money was the motivation
Until I toured the world and met the people face to face and
Understood that the power was harnessed in that basement
It ain't about the money and notoriety
It's about the people and making a difference in society
But don't get it twisted  this life I'm living is like a movie
The Godfather  the Goodfella wielding a Uzi
One with the people  if the people is wondering who's he?
Same level  the same rebel that never settled
Pullin' strings like Geppetto who overcame the ghetto
And I know you wrote me and I still ain't answered
I used to spend all my time conversing with you
But now I write this song to let you know I'm hurting with you
Besides the shows and meet and greets  y'all only see me on the street
And even then  that shit is rare—I just don't go outside
'Cause honestly I don't fuck with this world  I'd rather hide
Shit I ain't perfect  if you heard different then someone lied
People in my ear telling me  Talk that shit
Actions speak louder than words  I'd rather walk that shit
Since the first album  I'm one of the highest earners on the label
Within six months I put the second one on they table
I played sold out shows in parts of the world I can't pronounce
Release the tickets  watch them disappear when we announce
Fuck all that murderous syllable shit right now  just let me bounce
The mood around me is people smokin' it by the ounce
Leave Friday for the show and come back Monday with a hundred grand
Don't fuck with checks  so when I bounce I prefer cash in hand
You know my first week looking crazy due to high demand
'Cause people don't buy music in this day and age  they buy the brand
There's ups and downs  don't get me wrong but back when I ain't have shit
Felt like I woulda sold my soul to make it with this rap shit
Thank God  he never let Lucifer close enough to ask
Let me attain it by workin' hard and busting my ass
Achieved a lot in life  but what's a lot with more to gain?
At least I don't drink to avoid the hurt  we call that champagne

Yeah  I'm supplyin' the wood like Elijah
In the cut  smokin' on indica
Might fuck around and compartmentalize ya
They say  they say life is a bitch
And if that is the case then I'm finna surprise her
No  I am not an advisor  but I do advise ya
To pay attention  never need to mention
I'm that motherfucker bustin' heads
Finna push it to the ledge
Yeah  I been smokin' my meds
Ain't got no love for the feds
Can't let fame go to yo' head
Fuck with me  watch where you tread
I'm finna kill it instead
I'm finna  I'm finna  I'm finna
I will  I will  do it like I never done it
And I wanna run it and I wanna keep it goin' and goin'
Like infinity  be the only entity to ever rip it apart
From the start like this  from the heart like this
Finna murder it  a million miles a minute  no nitrous
Doin' righteous
I-I been  I-I-I been down this road before
Everybody think that they do but they don't
Swear to God that they would but they won't
Spittin' riddles in the middle of a past-time
Me in my mind  feelin' divine  like yeah
Finna get it like yeah—yeah
I done made 20 million dollars (Preach)
I don't flex to be acknowledged (Preach)
At this point it's common knowledge (Preach)
All you haters been abolished (Preach)
You in the club throwin' dollars  but I'm savin' mine so my kids go to college (Preach)
Or maybe whatever they wanna do (Preach)
Just as long as they never say (Preach)
Daddy blew 20 million dollars (Ayy)
He had to flex to be acknowledged (Ayy)
He in the club throwin' dollars
And now cannot afford to send me to college (Ayy)
Daddy just wanna be loved
Just like everybody wanna be accepted (Ayy)
But somehow he had neglected
Me and my momma for all of this rap shit (Ayy)
No  I cannot fuck with that shit (Ayy)
No  I cannot fuck with that

Who you know dropped an album
Back to back to back to back to back to back again?
I'm back again to snap again
And goddamnit  it ain't no other way around it
Yeah  it's happenin'  'cause I've been livin' in a world on my own
Leave me alone  I'm in the zone
Where I've been prone to destroy shit
You cannot avoid this  wack mothafuckas have annoyed this
Yes  you know I enjoy this
Preach  mothafuckin' preach
Yeah  I'm tryna reach everybody in the streets
Writin' words to the beats
Each one teach one  yeah  I'm tryna reach one
Who the beast one?
That be me  on the top to the East one
Tell me how you really wanna do it right now  time to murder this
Shout out everybody  no fuckin' around  ain't heard of this
Heard of us  we ain't goin' nowhere  it's a herd of us
Hold up  roll up
Levitated like I'm David Blaine
Livin' a dream like I'm David Aames
Talk all you want  we are not the same
Step in the spot  now they know the name
Sold more albums my first week than Harry Styles and Katy Perry
If that ain't a sign of the times
Then I don't know what is  man this shit is scary
'Cause bitch  I've been blowin' up like C-4
And I'm 3 for 3 like a free throw
Anybody hatin' on the boy  take a step back and then deep-throat
Now my phone blowin' up like ring
That Kevin Durant  I'm a champion
Check the numbers  I'm a champion
Can't sleep on the boy anymore
But the haters that love to hate gon' pop an Ambien
Star Lord  champion
Know the name  now they know the alias  that's for sure
Seen a lot of shit (Yeah)
Seen a lot of shit
I seen a lot of shit I shouldn't have but never forgot it though
Brothers on the corner selling crack like it was nada though
Walk inside my kitchen baking soda all up on the floor
Police banging on the door while gripping a .44
I was just a youngin' but this type of shit I seen before
Half breed motherfucker grip the mic and he flow
I just wanna keep the peace and help people
Give some of this money that I'm making to the people
And just don't understand 'cause I'm flyer than Knievel
Been through a lot of shit but I keep it on the D-Lo
Never bustin' in 'em streets but I keep it G though
Only thing I talk about is everything that we know

We gon' live it up 'til we bring it back down
I hope you live a long life hatin'
So successful they probably say I signed with Satan
I'm still all up in your girl jeans like a crease
Matter fact like a geneticist
Keep it RattPack 'til the beat go
Fans know my lyrics deeper than the sea floor
But we dumb it down so they spin it on the radio
Let me bring it back down
They think it's a game right now (Yeah)
Back where I came from now
We gon' live it up 'til we bring it back down
They think it's a game right now
Back where I came from now
We gon' live it up 'til we bring it back down
Been looking for holy water  now I’m praying for a flood
It feel like time passing me by slower than a slug
While this feeling inside of my body seep in like a drug
Will you hug me  rub me on the back like a child?
Tell me you love me  need me
Promise me you’ll never leave me
Even though my daddy  you know he blacker than the street
With a fist to match  more solid than concrete
Tell white people I’m black  feel the need to retreat
Like I should be ashamed of my granddaddy Malik
But my beautiful black brothers and sisters
Want to act like I’m adopted
Go back in time to when my nigga daddy
Impregnated my cracker momma and stopped it
My oh my (My oh my)
Oh my (My oh my)
I said oh my (Oh my)
Somebody pinch me
Black man screaming  trying to convince me I’m not black
So why the white man wanna lynch me?
Damn  my skin fair but life’s not
And I'd be lying if I said I didn’t care what whites thought
Or black people said  shit
Maybe it’s in my head
Like a single mother praying In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida
Looking around on the ground for a serpent to feed her
Praying to God  wondering why her baby daddy beat her
Feeling like the devil finna come and defeat her
All alone in the wintertime  close to the heater
Wondering what’s gonna happen
And how the world gonna treat her
How could her momma mislead her
And her daddy just leave her?
Like abracadabra when that magician pull on the lever
Oh my

Feeling like I need to hide
Everybody wonder why I get high
'Cause I can’t fight the feeling inside
Feeling innocent in a sense has got me feeling on the fence
And all this shit is so intense
Don’t wanna go to this event
Just wanna stay home and invent
I’m taking shots and drinking liquor
But that shit don’t make a dent in how I’m feeling
And yes I’m willing to keep chilling on this shit
I know there's someone out there far away
Who's feeling all this shit
And yes I know that when I’m low
There's so much further I can go
And so I look up to the sky
Oh my  oh my
(I said oh)
I feel the Aryan in my blood  it's scarier than a Blood
Been looking for holy water  now I’m praying for a flood

Atom: So what now? What advice can you give me?
God: What advice can I give humanity?
Atom: I suppose so
Kai: Damn man  we’ve been walking forever
Thomas: Well  Thalias tracking system says we’ll be there in just over an hour
Kai: Shit  at least we got good walking music or is that it?
Look into my eyes
Tell me you could see beyond the smile that I'm puttin' on
This front that I'm puttin' up for you
I spill my soul into a microphone
With poems written in blood
In hopes that it's enough for you
Do you love me yet?
Do you love me yet?
No? Okay
I'll go harder for you
In fact  I rap till I collapse
All I wanted was acceptance  my latest lesson
I'll never feel your approval till I accept my own
Come from a messed up home  destitute and less informed
About the ways to raise a child up
To not become a product
Of his environment  I need to cry and vent
But I done built this wall up
Actin' like everything's all good
But in reality I'm lookin' for something
Through bumpin' my favorite rappers I came up after
Eyes closed  I zone till five or so in the morn'
I'm used to being alone
Shit  you know how long I've been out on my own?
Chasing dreams  fantasies of a throne
One day I wake up and see that it didn't exist all along
Till then I will pen verses that fans consider brilliant
Boosting my ego with every million that spills in
And still then
I won't find solace  so where's the logic in that?
Worrying 'bout if they think Logic can rap
When it all just goes back to a childhood  need to be loved
By parents that was in too deep with the drugs
Be who you are  identify as a star
No one tells you you're that
It's something that you just know
The world be stealing your glow
Your mama did what she could
Her life was miles from good
Your father fell in the trap
They set for you when you black
They met when they was low
And therefore you a product of that
And so your trauma is deep
Don't bury it you should weep
And clean it out of your system  then truly forgive 'em
Just my opinion  only then can you find peace
Just start to notice happiness don't come from album release
I've been through it before
Can only share with you what I know
And you'll never be me  no matter how hard that you try
This is for youngins out there wondering how far you can fly
The truth is that you could go further than the stars and the sky
But if you want to then you ought to know why
Are you running from something
With hopes of becoming someone
That's finally worthy of love
Let me tell you now  you're worthy enough
Fuck approval from strangers  that shit is dangerous as hell
Find God  learn to accept yourself
I got them Nikes on my feet as we speak  homie
Yeah
Shout out to Mac Miller
All I do is rhyme  all I do is get this money
All I do is grind  play shows and chill with honeys
I'm one of a kind (Sinatra)
All I do is rhyme  all I do is get this money
All I do is grind  play shows and chill with honeys
I'm one of a kind
Ugh  yeah
And at this moment in time  I’m on a road when I write this rhyme
Sitting behind Raheem Devaughn while he’s passed out
'Bout to hit the station 'fore our gas is out
Good god  you know we fly
Day dreaming out the window  watch how buildings pass me by
See I ain’t signed but at this point in time
I'm feeling like the 3-6-8th
Wonder of the world  just might steal your girl
All I do is rhyme and get money  that’s my repertoire
Baby what’s the deal  have you ever heard of some shit so real?

Ever since I was a youngin I knew I’d break in the game
While you worshiped other rappers that leave you less entertained
I was strategizing before the people knew my name
Fame what I shall attain on the road to success
Bumping Jay in the H.O.V. lane
Searching for wisdom in women but only getting brain

It was December of 2015 in sunny Los Angeles California in the heart of Hollywood
I stood next to my wife in a line surrounded by hundreds of other people on our way to watch Star Wars
When suddenly I was engulfed with fear and panic
As my body began to fade
In this moment my mind was full of clarity
But my body insisted it was in danger
I looked around and I told myself I was safe  I was fine
But I was convinced that something was wrong
Before I knew it I felt as though I was going to
Fall and fade away
My body grew weak
And soon enough I found myself in a hospital bed being told what I went through was anxiety
I refused to believe this story
I searched and searched for the cause of what had happened to me
I began to feel detached from reality
I felt as though I was seeing the world through a glass
I got blood work done
Analysis of my mind and body to no avail
The doctor said it was anxiety
But how could it be anxiety?
How could anxiety make me physically feel off balance?
How could anxiety make me feel as though I was fading from this world and on the brink of death?
Derealization
The sense of being out of one’s body
I’m not here
I’m not me
I’m not real
Nothing is
Nothing but this feeling of panic
Nobody understands
Nobody knows the sufferings
This physical feeling
It can’t be anxiety
It can’t
Or can it?
Can it in fact be the mind controlling the body?
Yeah  of course
I’m so in control of my mind and my body
But I’m subconsciously forcing myself into a state
Of self bondage entangled by the ropes of my own mind
I am unhappy
Not with life
But with this feeling
But I look in the mirror and I see a child
I am an adult who recognize grown ups don’t really know shit
And they never did
And it scares me
Cause now I’m just a grown up who doesn’t know shit
But one thing is I do know this feeling  this horrible feeling is going to kill me
No  no this feeling
This anxiety is nothing
I have anxiety
Just like you  the person I wrote this for
And together we will overcome this feeling
We will remember despite the attacks and constant feeling of our mind and body being on the edge
That we are alive
And any moments we have free of this feeling we will not take for granted
We will rejoice in this gift that is life
We will rejoice in this day that we have been given
We will accept our anxiety and strive for the betterment of ourselves
Starting with mental health
We will accept ourselves as we are
And we will be happy with the person we see in the mirror
We will accept ourselves
 no false rap
 what a view

 I'll let it spill

 goin' places they never go

I ain’t ashamed of my beautiful Mexican wife as a matter of fact
I know you fucking with that
And I’m not scared of the people who tell me I should be
Do what you love and don’t ever wonder what it could be
Everybody from my hood  everybody know I’m good
Sometimes I’m misunderstood
But that's just the uneducated that never related and feel like I'm fading off
They feel like I'm fading
I'm right out my mind
Tell 'em!
Momma don't love me
Daddy don't love me
Wonder why I drown in the bubbly
You could be anything you wanna be
'Cept the person you don’t wanna be
Let him hate let em love
Wondering if everybody still like this up above
When that push come to shove
Make me wanna pull up with the  with the gat in the glove like
I just wanna be free
Not a slave to the stereotype
All alone in my room in the middle of the night
I don’t have the words but my stereo might
Not perceived by the things I believe or the color of my skin
Or the fact I’m attracted to her  maybe him
Or the fact I’m a single mother living all alone
Looking for a man and a home to call my own
But I already have one
Son  say:
Black is beautiful
Be black and proud
Fuck everybody hatin' on me right now  I’m black and proud
I’m just as white as that Mona Lisa
I’m just as black as my cousin Keisha
I’m biracial so bye Felicia
Praise Black Jesus now call the preacher
Maybe Jesus was black
Maybe Jesus had dreads

Do you really wanna be famous?

Of this album's creation...
I used to long for you and adore you
My life was just fine way back before you
Now when you reach out I just ignore you
'Cause this ain't a love song (Woah)
You did me so wrong for so long
For so long
All you ever seem to do is scream and make it all about you
And so I doubt you
I doubt you even know what's on my mind
I doubt you even know why I left you behind
I know that I've been living

Know my name around the world but it still ain't hit me
All the talent in the world and they still don't get me
I didn't talk about my race on the whole first album
But black vs. white bullshit was the still the outcome
How come these motherfuckers can't seem to let it go?
Judging rap by race instead of the better flow
Who gives a fuck who made it? I penetrate it and innovate it
Chilling with B-I-G D-A-Double-D-Y K-A-N-E
Thinking they slick as fuck like the finna befriending me
Fuck all these cats on the internet
I love hip-hop and I hate hip-hop
'Cause people that love Pac hope that Drake get shot
Now let me let off
Racism on television and magazines
Country don't give a fuck who I am
Just a youngin' on the rise with a mic in my hand
The .45 Glock that my older brother pop—shot
 can’t get no more cheddar
 I'm never gon’ give in
 that's why I been thinkin'
 I'm scared that I’m fallin’

 I self-medicate
 that's why I keep goin'
 that's why I keep perserverin'
 I'm a fag
 I ain't black in the slight least
 give me the power to battle depression
 round after round
 I wish I was rich
 don't fuck with division
 but I'm rich and I think that I am
 just love 'em
 put your ego on the shelf
 love yourself
I've just been drivin' Ms. Daisy
With my hands on the steering wheel
And my eyes on the pavement
I give a fuck 'bout where they went
I owe my lawyer a payment
They talkin' 'bout no arraignment
Now I wonder where the rain went
I been countin' what's on my bucket list
And not on my blessings
I-I-I can't end up like my mama poppin' anti-depressants
But I know who I am (Know who I am)
I've just been drivin'

Tales from my hood  not a sight like this
Where they up to no good on a night like this
And they murder motherfuckers just 'cause
Type of shit I see  you probably wonder where I was
I was in the crib  just sittin' on the rug
Basedheads comin' through lookin' for the plug
Now  born and raised in my area
Beautiful by day  by night it's hysteria
Fuck around and bury ya tonight
Ridin' with my homies on sight
Momma tell me to come in at night
Now I really gotta go  but they never know
Livin' life to the fullest  I gotta blow
Po-po finna bust in the door  we got blow in the crib
In the kitchen over there next to the baby with the bib
Goddamn  what it feel like  middle of the night
Wakin' up  scared for my life
Never had the heat  just a knife
When the gat go blat like that
Guarantee you it’s a wrap
Finna put you on your back like that
Just breathe  while their mama grieve
Bullet to the dome like an Aleve
Gotta leave for the premises  to murder my nemesis
‘Fore they even call the cops
Do it for the money and the bitches
And the drugs and the props
Tell me why another body even gotta drop
Get shot off top for some shit that was gang related

Never had the chance  yeah
Stay strapped  but I hate it when I take it out
If you want it I'ma lay it out
Hope my little brother make it out
Every night what I pray about what I pray about
Check it  uh yeah  got a son on the way
But I cling to the streets even though I wanna run away
I imagine a better life
Where I never had a debt in life
Hit you with the *gunshots* in the dead of night
Sellin' crack to my own pops
Pushin' this weight on my own block
If I sell a brick I can buy a house
If they find the key they might lock me up
But I take the chance 'cause I need that shit and don’t give a fuck
Take the chance  'cause I need that shit and don’t give a fuck
 — Get down or lay down
Hit ya with the Beretta  you better stay down
Stray shots on the playground
Livin' how I'm livin' with the life that I'm given
Anybody that’s ridin' with me  I’m ridin' with 'em
Show me the enemy  and I'ma hit 'em
The second I bit 'em  I get 'em
And hit 'em with the venom
Ain’t no need to pretend I'ma never do it
I knew it  already been through it
I do it for the street  for the fam  for the life
Guess who I met last night  man
You know your land-  land chick? The fuck (Woo)
She just run up on me like  Yo (What?)
Nah mean? We talkin' and shit- (Crazy)
We gotta-we gotta stay- (Blap-blap!)
Oh  we heard man

Crazy thing that I heard  the homie say he ran around the corner from here
(Right around the corner?) Nah mean? (It's on  it's on!)
Sort that new life  he should look out (I'm gon' kill a nigga tonight)
Okay (I'm like-) (I mean if-) (Shit)
(Nobody-nobody) and we ready  the whole hood ready (This car creeping)
And the police they rushin'
Go to my head like concussion
I'd rather not have this discussion
My mind racing for the elevation of the toxic in my blood
Where my mind  don’t know now
But I know where it was
I need Nikki  where is Nikki?
Baby girl  please come and get me
Now I’m old and shit is trippy  but I know that God is with me
This that baby mama drama
Give a fuck about a man  I know I'ma
End of the month  that’s the worst of the month
But the first of the month put the weed in the blunt
That welfare check  check
Won’t ever bounce like my daddy did
But I’m glad he did 'cause it made me strong
Made me help somebody with this song
Paint the picture of my life
Growing up what it was like
Section 8  grab a plate
Food for thought  gravitate
Food stamps  Social Services tryna take me away
My mama locked up  I pray to God that I see her today
Just me and my homies  people that know me
Only ones that know
Around my way (Around my way)
Living day by day (Living day by day)
Corn rows and hang time  automatics and gang signs
Five-O with them K-9's
Manhunt when it's game time
They was robbing the ice cream man in broad day
Now I’m running from the police
Don’t know how  but I got away
Selling weed to my homies
And a girl in the building that know me
Such a youngin  such a fool
Now I’m breaking into school
'Cause my homie told me to
What to do  what would you?
When will I lose my anonymity
And become one with the enemy?
Tell me  would I be the enemy?
Feel like nobody in front of me
I can feel the vibe

Bobby  what are you thinking?
What are you dreaming about?
Bobby  what’s inside?
What are you thinking right now?
What are you thinking?
Go to sleep
I guess maybe I was thinking things would be different now
'Cause when I wake up  my dreams fade
Everything cascade
In this vanilla sky  I feel like David Aames
Why must I open my eyes?
I wish I could stay asleep forever
Attain every goal I wanted and watch it repeat forever
Will it happen? Maybe never
I picture myself at the top but I know that I’m dreaming
Will I wake up before I finally confront all my demons?
Maybe not—All I know is this life I live
I can’t live it no longer
Wish I was stronger  wish that I could survive
Turn on the TV  let it wash my brain
Pretend that family’s my family to avoid the pain
Hello children  how was school?
It was good  how 'bout you?
Are you ready for dinner?
I’m able to set the table
'Til I snap out the fable when that TV turn off
And I realize I’m back in hell

Hello?
Just  I’m on my way home  every time

Oh shit!
Life  what’s it all about?

The space between spaces
Beyond time and existential intelligence
Forget  fuck all the hippy shit  where am I?
What’s the last thing you remember  Atom?
I was in the store  I bought some smokes
I came outside  the phone rang  I...
How do you know my name?!
You were walking home from work when you died
Died? Dead? I’m dead? I’m dead?!
It wasn’t an act of courage or bravery  but it was your time
What do you mean it’s my time? What? I got...
What about Vanessa? What about the baby?
Your wife and son? You see  that’s what I like to hear
You find out you’re dead and the first thing you worry about is others
Man  answer me  what about my family?
What’s going on with Vanessa?
They’re doing just fine
You see  your wife was cheating on you
Wait  wait  the bitch did what?!
And even though she loved you dearly
She was a bit relieved you would never find out
Wait  what the fuck you mean she cheated on me?
How you gon' tell me I’m dead then gon' tell me my wife cheated on me?!
Atom  none of that matters now
Walk with me
Wait  what is this? Is this...Is this heaven?
No
Well  I don’t see no pitchforks
Little red people runnin' around
It ain’t too hot up in here so I guess this ain’t hell either
I think the easiest way to describe it  this white void
Is to look upon it as a waiting room
So...are you God?
Why  Dad?
Because you came out of my balls  nigga
Hahahahahaha

Whenever she is around  you know I come quickly
Vivid memories of Chicago  south side where I go
From Reggies to the House of Blues  progress is the motto
Man the first show that I ever done sold out was in Chicago
Maybe not  I don't know why my mind is changing
Rearranging this dangerous melody  uh
Yeah  and I know that ain't nobody finna ever be ahead of me
All that competition right there is dead to me
Feeling the vibe  shit is outrageous
Boy  I've been feeling courageous
This shit right here  I've been at it for ages
Feels like I'm running through mazes
Everybody has they phases
And I'm feeling it uh  hope when I'm forty I'm still in it
One of the few that be killing it  uh
Yeah  young motherfucker that be giving what he living
On the road to success so you know that I'm driven
But they didn't wanna publish it
But right now I'm on some other shit
I'm in a different world  I'm with a different girl
I'm with the same team  but it's a different scheme
Remember back when I couldn't even pay the bills
And I'll never forget how that feels back when I would

I look out the window like Goddamn  that's what I really do
Don't know why I fear the planes  sometimes I wish to sustain
If I look back on it I would do it all over again
Been on this plane way too long  I can't wait to see you again
Oh my God this turbulence has got me sippin' on this liquor
Like  Who are these niggas?
Just landed in Europe and this model bitch is tryna smash
Now I'm riding on the train  all this shit inside my brain
Just left a hotel in Belgium  damn them waffles was insane
Smoking blunts in Amsterdam
Oh my God  this is my jam
May-December by Mos Def
In my headphones  that's the man
And they wonder why I never get high
And they wonder why I never get high
And they wonder why I never get high
And they wonder why I never get high
These thoughts inside my mind be fuckin' with me when I'm all alone
I really like this girl she bad as fuck  why must I run away?
It feel like self assassination  I can't put this gun away
God damn  what's the plan? Not complacent where I am
Reminiscing when I hit the road back in that mini van
Up to date the couple years  now my idols are my peers
I was on the road to nowhere till I decided to veer
Used to give a fuck what people thought  hoping that they would notice
Stop giving a fuck cause music gotta be the only motive
Mind racing on and off the track  I'm going locomotive
I can't believe you don't like Tarantino
You mean like Inglourious Basterds?—I didn't see that
What?!—I didn't  I don't know—
Oh my God! Have you seen 'Pulp Fiction'?
Yeah  but I don't really remember it
On the train? With the scenery?
No—You haven't seen that?
No—With the dude from 'Donnie Darko'?
Who's that?—Oh my God
Well  I still wanna know what your favorite Tarantino movie is...
My favorite Tarantino movie—?
And they wonder why I never get high

Fuck around and bomb a hater
Straight to your mind now
Feel this shit like it's some Braille
Way too heavy for the scale
It ain't never room to fail
Only growing and prevail
When my anxiety rise and I feel like I'm in hell
Take a moment and inhale
Count to five then exhale
Then we run that motherfucker like a marathon
All that shit you talkin' out your mouth just won't sustain me
Logic pickin' up the slack like denim
Spit it with venom
Never pretend to be somethin' that I'm not
And you ain't shit when you stand next to me
No kiddin' like vasectomy
And I'll rearrange your trajectory
Black and white like a piano and I'm proud to be
And fuck whoever tell me I am not allowed to be
So much plaque up on my wall I need a dentist
Step up to the mic and it's a homicide
You gon' fuck around and leave 'em ruined like that
You gon' fuck around and leave 'em ruined like that
Bloodstream only way to make it to my brain
I tried some others but man they just not as good as you
Going crazy 'cause I only feel this good with you
Maybe I'm just not as strong as I once was
When we're together lately I don't even feel a buzz
I'm addicted to this shit like it was hard drugs (Drugs)
Nikki baby  I love you but now I gotta go
'Cause in the end what happens you already know
Probably wonder where I been at  I been laying low
But in my mind I'm wondering what I'm paying for (Paying for)
All these other bitches on my dick but I can't fuck with that
You're the only girl I need I gotta have you back
Even though you turn my lungs black (My lungs black)
Tell me where you been Jack (Been Jack)
Uh  I know this shorty that go by the name of Mary
I used to fuck her way back when I didn't know a thing
Skipping school with all my homies on some truancy
But when I ended things with her it was just you and me
Doing me good  that's what I thought at first
Me and you together  swear to God that's all that worked
Away from you though man it's just so hard to work (Hard to work)
Uh  my heart is hard at work
We been together like ten years
Goddamn  took me as a young man
What will they write upon my grave?
A free man born as a king  who died as a slave
But everything he gave her was for nothing though
Oh no I can't fade that shit I gotta let you go
You got me tripping like a flight to Vegas
All this shit you got me doing man it's outrageous
All I know is I'm living the life I never would
Finally let you go  I thought I never could
Don't get me wrong  can't forget the times shared
Seem like everywhere I go  I always know you're there
Tried to run but my legs won't
I look away but my head don't
I love it when you're fresh
I love it when I take your top off and we share the same breath
I hate it that I need you  Nikki
But I love it when I feed you  Nikki
I hate that I bleed for you
Uh  I long and I need for you
But I love it when I taste you (Taste you)
Nothing can replace you (Replace you)
I wish I could erase you  you’re everywhere I go
But you're everywhere I long to be
And all these other people that don't seem to understand
I'm just a man they always ask what’s wrong with me
Man you're everything I crave
You're the only thing I let in that would put me in the grave
I'm a king  you're my Coretta

I've been posted with my Queen like Coretta King
So much money on the road I ain't even had a minute
Not a single second chilling in my new place
Motherfuckers getting two-faced
Cause a brother finally eating
Not to mention everybody gettin' two plates
You know I only got two traits
What the fuck is there left to talk about
Industry only respect me because I'm ballin' out
You never know who there for you until you fallin' out
And that's the reason I've been in the kitchen
Who the one that gave 'em remission?—you know the name
Lyrics all up in your skull like when the barber buzz it
Come to think about it everybody seemed to love it
I've been at it for the people that been lovin' my shit
Not the people that been hating

I gotta beware of the people
But I take care of the people
When I jump in the cockpit and rock it
Been done had this in my pocket
I had to wait to unlock it
Open that locket and see the picture I painted
On the rise like a defendant
That was charged with possession like an exorcism
My division is solely my vision
Motherfucker wanna push it to the limit
I've been at it like an addict
Never at the party like I'm democratic
'Lotta static on the radio
Fuck everything that they represent
No never when I slide up in the spot
Just a youngin' in the game
Looking for validation
With all the wrong things on my mind for motivation
Just chillin' at the crib on a PlayStation
Man it's been a good ride up
Everybody want me to lace 'em
Fist full of money then we head back to the mansion
Couple years back you ain't give a damn

Plus my other sister just went back to her old dude
He whoopin' her ass—I'll kill him  I'll kill him
I'll motherfuckin' kill him  I said  I really want to kill him—but I can't
'Cause if I do  po-po gon' claim I'm the villain  but I ain't
See my vision from pictures I paint
Do you feel it like I feel it? I grip the mic and then kill it—okay  I'm gone
As memories resurface from hella long in my past
Chillin'  sippin' Sinatra from a flask
Little Bobby  just a youngin'  skating was my hobby
Tryna stay out of trouble  my homie in jail for robbery
Welfare  food stamps  and stealing from the sto'
Come home and see an eviction notice taped to my do'
Can't take no mo'  mama on drugs  daddy M.I.A
What can I say? I just wanted to be a kid and play
To this day  I pay homage to the gods  to the greats
Never stolen  I'm from Maryland
Where they shoot you in the dark of the night
Like Christopher Nolan  for talking outta your colon
Catch me rollin' with the realest
Lyricism the illest  my chain is the chillest  Sub Zero
Far from a hero  bitch  I'm De Niro in Goodfellas
If your bitch around me  best bring an umbrella

Not by busting and killing though I've had my share of stealin'
But by putting pen to this pad and dispersin' these feelings
While the label only care about making a killin'
Feel my energy—I ain't talking E-N-E-R-G-Y  I mean inner G
That's the shit they never see
But I own supremacy  number one—I better be
Bitch  I said  I bet I be.
Take my kindness for weakness  trying to get the better of me
Tell me  how is they gon' remember me?
As the artist that concocted the perfect recipe?
Or will they be addressing me  talking less of me
Just 'cause I was different
Just 'cause I was doing what I love?
And the fans say they love you  but they push and they shove
'Cause they want what they want how they want when they want it
I just gave them twenty songs  now they want another hunnid
Worldwide tours  type of shit I always wanted
While the rest of 'em just worry 'bout bitches and gettin' blunted
Still that same motherfucker from that YS1
Only difference: I'm stronger and better from when I begun
So when people that never knew me  they tell me that I changed
That my music is different and my vision's rearranged  I just stop (I just stop)
And do my best to refrain
From having conversations with people that ain't in my lane
Will I die? (Will I die?) Will I live?
Give the world everything I have to give
This is feelings on the page  know my wisdom  not my age
Understand that I'm a man not defined by his wage
Even though it's in the millions  that shit don't define my brilliance
Open your mind and maybe you can see the billions
Of people that separated  but all equal
To know the ending  one must understand the prequel  uh
I swear this music in my genes like Denim
Lyricism seep in 'em like venom
Yes  I know the flow hotter than Lucifer even though heaven sent him
Spit it like Holy water  prophetically repent 'em

Shady Grove Hospital in Rockville  Maryland
7:36 a.m.  where a biracial baby was born
To a black father and a white mother
Father that wasn’t there
Same as his mom
(Way  way back)
So I’m gonna tell you about that  right?
And I’m gonna tell you about how
All this young boy ever wanted was happiness
All he ever wanted was positivity
All he ever wanted to do was entertain
And this boy went through hell
'Cause how in the fuck is you gonna have
All these black babies with black men but you racist
The kids at school callin' him a cracker
Identifying as black  looking as white
Being told what you can or can’t be
This kid went through everything
He went through...
He saw narcotics in the household
There was crazy shit that happened to this kid
And he persevered while the whole world said
What they said?
Said you wouldn’t be shit!
And that’s why the message is always peace  love and positivity
See  he always saw things from two sides
He always saw things from two sides
He always knew that the message
Everybody was born equal
He knew that because he saw that
(Take it back  take it way back
Take it way)
Because he was stripped and torn down
By his black brothers and sisters that were uneducated
And that did not know
And he was stripped and he was torn down
By his white side that did not know
These people that are ignorant
That cannot see the bigger picture
That must fight and kill and murder each other
But once again  all he ever wanted to do
Was spread a message of equality
(Take it back  take it way back
Take it way  way back to the first)
Now imagine this child growing up
And seeing the craziest shit
Being a part of the craziest shit
Running around with the wrong people
Running around with guns and knives
And fighting and stealing and  and all this
Because he didn’t know  he didn’t know!
But he knew deep down in his heart that it wasn’t right
And he knew that he needed to get away from it
Now I want you to also imagine  that at 17 years old
Two jobs that he works in the morning and the evenings
And then he would then come home
To about eight or nine hours of sleep
Working on music  persevering
Grabbing the remote control and looking in the mirror
And pretending to see thousands and thousands and thousands of people
Just chanting his name
Hoping that it would happen
No-no!
(Take it back  take it way back
Take it way  way back to the first)
And he said fuck that
He said equality for all man
Now I want you to also imagine
People telling him that he did not live this life
“You just a white boy
You ain’t never experienced that shit
We didn’t live with you  we didn't live in your Section 8 household
We didn’t live with the narcotics and violence in your household
(Take it back  take it way back
Take it way  way back to the first black man)
And this young man persevered in spite
(Take it back  take it way back
Take it way  way back to the first black)
And that man is here today  proud
A lover of all human beings
And he’s here to say:
Even though we’re all born and created equal
We are not treated equally
There’s extremists on every side
And you should just do your best to live life
And let other people believe whatever they wanna believe
As long as they’re not hurtin' anybody
You can believe they’re going to hell
You can believe it’s not right
You can believe you’re superior  fine
Living life on the East Coast
Way back in the day trying to beat most
Anybody that wanna do what I do
Well let me keep it one hunnid with you
And so they wonder who am I—so high (So high)
I said they wonder who am I—so high
I laugh again when they don't understand
Everybody wanna live a life like this
Make music like there's no Grammy
I don't give a fuck though
I'ma just do what I do with my crew
Ain’t no telling what I'm finna do
But I promise that I'ma keep writing for you
It's all for you—it's all for you

Who am I—so high (So high)
I said they wonder who am I—so high
Let me take this time to find the rhyme
And know that I'm the only one
There is no one besides the only one
And you know I gotta let 'em know
Created a world no one has been to
Everybody probably wonder what I'm living like
Despite what they say is right and wrong
Despite they wonder (Wonder)
Who am I—so high (So high)
I said they wonder who am I—so high
What do I desire?

 don't give a fuck
 I swear a test
 no disrespect
 It's my time
 just my rhymes
 I run that
 type of girl I wanna fuck her mind
 Go 'head
 it's been a long time
 so I gotta go
 the one nobody would vouch for
 'til the end
 'til the end
 yeah
 they may be misguided— somebody has led them on the wrong path!
 God's mercy every day that they live is extended to them and they have another opportunity to be saved!
Dog 'round—from a—from a—dog 'round—once a
Dog 'round—from a—from a—dog 'round—once a
Dog 'round—from a—from a—dog 'round—
The only thing I'ma give you motherfuckers is the dial tone (Yeah)
Flashbacks of a youngin' sippin' that purple Kool-Aid
Skippin' school with my homies and chiefing reefer for two days
Bumping Triple Six
Who the bitch ridin' with me?
But finally gettin' cake like a happy belated
Please decipher my linguistics
And now we blowin' up like spontaneous human combustion
My consumption is the illest
You might also like
The only thing I'ma give you motherfuckers is the dial tone
Me and my homies that know me blowing up like the Taliban
Fuck around and get messed up
You know that I'm one of a kind
Draped up and I'm dripped out (And I'm dripped out)
Know damn well that they don't give a fuck
I be on that finger-flippin' killin' shit up in the cut
That's what's up
All these bitches out here tryna gas it up
Can I do it like you do it? That's what they be askin' us
Now they know my name through the nation
Dash of autotune so y'all can feel the pain
The only thing I'ma give you motherfuckers is the dial tone
(Please leave a message after the tone)
But I insist you call me back 'cause I miss you
'Cause lately it feel like I’m just not yo' sister at all—all
You tell me I'm beautiful and yet no man wanna date me
Haunted by vivid memories of that man who raped me
You always seemed to pick up the phone and somehow I feel
I hate him and if I see him I swear I tell him that
I can feel the Devil around me as they all applaud
And even when you gone I can call whenever he hit me
In Paris? What a beautiful destination
Please don't be spiteful of all my small talk
I think we're overdue a long talk
It gets me thinkin' 'bout incredible moments we've had
But do you think you could stop rappin' about my drug use?
And when the time is right I know that you gon' take care
Can I have some tickets to your next show?
Would you stand wit' me?
Can I have some money for my new honey that's hella fine?
I forgot to mention I got divorced from yo' step-mom
Maybe you could tell *beep*
I've been feelin' under pressure
Brothers and sisters that hit me up just to reminisce
But sometimes I wake up and wonder just what the fuck I'm doin'
Never sacrifice this feelin' even though my heart it bleed
Never sacrifice this feelin' even though my heart bleed

 never givin' up 'round the almanac

 the stigmas that the RZA and the GZA

 Wu-Tang pumpin' through your veins

 they better take it from me
 I'm tryna buy me a train with it
 see me flyin' to Spain with it
 and I ain't gonna change with it

 everybody is a gangbanger
 but we all got the same anger
 homie  that's hateful

Like goddamn  like goddamn
Yo yo yo yo yo  yo yo yo
Okay now take a trip inside my mind like you was off to Venice
It's me and B-I-G L-N-B-O cookin' like chemists
Take 'em back to way back when  like Dennis the Menace
Causin' mayhem on the come up like a young apprentice
Smokin' weed and gettin' higher than a flight attendant
Hip-hop descendant  gold Jesus on my pendant
Got to pull it out for everyone that's in attendance
Okay  back in the day as a College Park tenant
Still can't believe I didn't get a shorty pregnant
Man  that's the definition of a life sentence
'Cause I couldn't keep it in my briefs  man that's pathetic
Fuck all that back and forth  this ain't a game of tennis
I'll be in my mothafuckin' chamber like the senate
Scared to go outside but I know I can't prevent it
I'm  forever alone in my mind (Yeah yeah)
See I'm a self-diagnosed hypochondriac
Either at the crib  or on the tour bus is where you'll find me at
But I swear that I'm not that neurotic over here  yeah

Sippin' on a martini  takin' my pick at bitches like eenie meenie

Okay the flow delicious  bounty huntin' like Sid Vicious
The young Spiegel  interstellar with my retrieval
Furthest from evil  I throw this shit back like medieval
I spit at it like a Beretta
You know I get better by givin' the people
Always been driven  out of sight and yet never hidden
The Return of the Jedi
Bitch I bet I do the show and catch a red eye
Ho I said I leave 'em dead  I know I do
This shit is (overdue  pass me the fifth and I'm comin' through)
The B-I-G L-E-N-B-O on the way to Rio
Ay dios mio  lookin' for a Latin Leo
To hold a brother down like the white man
Fuck that nigga
Even in a pair of cuffs  know we always keep it real
Like goddamn  don't even step like I ain't the man
I'm just (301 reppin'  second I step in Maryland)
I gotta conceal it like a murder weapon
I kept in the glove  Ratt Pack you know it's all love
We the realest so fuck you if you ain't feel this
Throw a Molotov in your crib
And tell them bitches to bill us  we the illest
Finger fuck a critic
Shit is darker than The Chronicles of Riddick
Smack you with the palm  save the back for your mom
 like a shark
 right?
 bing
 I keep it real
 It's Logic

 money maintain
(Rest in peace Mac Miller)
It's been like 10 years
Here we go (Yeah)
Visualizin' and realizin' my life is fuckin' crazy
I'm one of the illest and bitch
They just hit the tape while I sip scotch
The flow sophisticated
All these youngins do is whine like they inebriated
But you know we still us
I'm single-handedly running the game like a Sony
While the rest of these rappers is acting
Smoke like a rasta
These racist motherfuckers hate that last line
Probably haters on the internet ain't got nothing to bargain

That's the type of bullshit that they frequent
Of course we could never forget Biggie and young Shakur
Fuck these youngins talking outta they ass with no class
I'm here to school 'em
Respected by my peers from Drizzy to Cole to Kenny
Thank you for the love and inspiration plenty
From good credit to good weed
I can make any woman succeed
Control you with a heart of greed
I'm in the pocket of mafia crime lords and presidents
Not a soul on earth would love me if I weren't me
The shit people do to get a piece of me astound me
Blood stains my face when drug deals go wrong
I'm given to the greatest athletes when they go long
You could put me in check
But I'm still laughing all the way to the bank
I'm the reason that the Titanic sank
I usually come around on the first and fifteenth
If you owe me to somebody then they'll leave you beneath
People go crazy when they feel me
In the Middle East they drill me
I knew these two dudes that's always been homies since fifth grade
Only thing on they mind that wasn't me was get laid
'Cause he coulda sworn he had more weight in his stock
But before he had the chance to pull the trigger
Oh shit here come the cops
They saw the gun and blew them both away
'Cause you never know when you're gonna go
'Cause you never know when you're gonna go

And I hereby ratify and confirm that Logic is motherfucking paid
Can't nothin' stop me  I'm on a roll (I'm on a roll!)
Always on time 'cause my eyes is on my Rollie-olex
I don't trust nobody  put my homies on the payroll
Fuck with me now or you'll never know (Never know!)
My name Bobby Tarantino (Tarantino! Yeah)
Too busy countin' stacks  uh
Pickin' up the slack (Slack)
Logic never wanna flex  but Bobby finna bring the facts
And I know that they talking  can't fuck with the tone
Talkin' shit 'bout Logic  I never respond
I'll let success talk  'cause a word of advice:
More achievements for yourself and less talk
If I ever did  I dead you in this game with no respawn
But you push the issue 'cause I give you more press than your publicist could ever get you
Anyone that hate me  I wish you success
I wish you look in the mirror and ask yourself why you suppressed
The feelin's of self-hatred that you want project on me
Bet if I never picked up the mic  then we might be homies
But you jealous  you look at my life and you feel envy
Constantly comparing yourself to me and feel empty
Most people that don't fuck wit' me ain't never shook my hand
They don't understand
But no matter what happen you know that–
