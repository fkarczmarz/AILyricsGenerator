lyrics
"Wake up...
My peoples tired of waiting for reparations to pay us
But that's just another trick to enslave us
Push the minimum wages
Then watch out when mother struggled to raise us
Allah said to save the babies from the cold
Pour wisdom in the cup so the truth overflows
Old time religion will not bring us satisfaction
Without action now who can disagree with me?
That you could show and prove to me
But still you face east and nod your head to me religiously
You might also like
The world won't get no better
If we just let it be
The world won't get no better
Now's the time for us to come amongst this nation
They believe in that Cream like Julius Caesar
Ripping the chains of the remains of all of the leaders
Never worship the image of evil swine eaters
I'm on the back of the bus with two fine divas
That I recite in this song
For all my people that's out there persevering through the storm
Penetrate through the gate and bring the Clan along
The world won't get no better
If we just let it be
The world won't get no better
Wake up and realise the times
That we living in the world is getting more iller than ever
But it was a dream like Martin Luther
He had a vision that could move a mountain
And then they shoot us down like wild animals
The nerve of them cold-hearted killers
With blue suits slaying our black youth
The earth cries from all the blood that's being spilled
And that's the Willie Lynch tactics that separated the masses
Taught us all to think backwards
The world won't get no better
If we just let it be
The world won't get no better
For all my peoples incarcerated  for those who ain't make it
Victims of worldly ways  memories stays engraved
All my live brothers is locked down with high numbers
Ten feet gates surround the building  keep us sealed in
The projects  lifeless like a Vietnam vet
Constant war  except for threats of enemy conquest
Crooked cops comb my building complex that's in the rumble
Streets are like a jungle  can't let my cypher crumble
Vivid thoughts  Devils resort to trick knowledge
They kick garbage  lust for chicks and quick dollars
I know the pain the game bring  I did the same thing
Spaced out in the staircase  performin' a sting
It's hard to keep control  I bless those who seek a scroll
Tryin' to reach a whole nation and break the sleeper hold
Not a role model  I walk a hard road to follow
I sold bottles of sorrow then chose poems and novels
The gospel was told  some souls it swallowed whole
Mentally they fold  and they eventually sold
Their life and times  deadly like the virus design
But too minute to dilute the scientist mind

You can't party your life away  drink your life away
Smoke your life away  fuck your life away
Dream your life away  scheme your life away
'Cause your seeds grow up the same way
A voice cries from the wilderness of the North
A representation of the families that lost one
All victims of incarceration
Or other divisions of the family structure
Youths are injected with serums that leads to skin irritations
Babies being born with disfigurations  experimentations
On their faces  there bear worry-ations
Of mothers that carry the pain
Of blood stained streets where sisters mourn and wail
Fifth brothers been slain from hails of gun fire
It lightly begins to rain
Screams of terror are hidden by the passin' trains
This can't be little Hussein
His uncle cries as he drops to his nephew's side  holdin' his cane
Just give me a name
Of who has inflicted this bitter sickness  and left us to witness
The wise shall flourish inherit  Halls of Fame
Crime visions in my blood got me locked in prison
It's a never endin' battle with no endin' or beginnin'  listen
Some love the speed  some satisfy a need
One flew astray  and it caught my little seed
The righteous man was beat with many stripes  pipes
Take in my energy  breath and know the rest
'Cause the good die young and the hard die best
You can't party your life away  drink your life away
Smoke your life away  fuck your life away
Dream your life away  scheme your life away
'Cause your seeds grow up the same way
'Cause your seeds grow up the same way
'Cause your seeds grow up the same way
Y'all bitches love dances  and pullin' down your pants
While your man's on tour  your spendin' up his advances
The whole projects is trapped in six
You either high school drop-outs  one to three cop-outs
Fifteen years old  shorty ass and top out
Ninety-nine cent beer drinkin'  pussy stinkin'
Fuckin' so much  your ass and titties start shrinkin'
Can a devil fool a Muslim nowadays?
Inside my lab  I'm goin' mad
Took two drags off the blunts  and started breakin' down the flag
The blue is for the Crips  the red is for the Bloods
The white's for the cops  and the stars come from the clubs
Or the slugs that ignites through the night  by the dawn early light
Why is sons fightin' for the stripe?
As we dwell through this concrete hell  callin' it home
Don't wind up like your old dad
Still searchin' for them glory days he never had
So many bad want to scheme for American dream  no more kings
The cash rule everythin' now  we goin' down
These babies lookin' up to us  it's up to us
The Million Man March MC's  get on the bus
Though the devil mind state blood kin cannot relate
No longer brothers  we unstable
Like Cain when he slew Abel  killin' each other
You can't party your life away  drink your life away
Smoke your life away  fuck your life away
Dream your life away  scheme your life away
'Cause your seeds grow up the same way
'Cause your seeds grow up the same way
Dinn-dnn-dnn-ta-dnn

For you to examine the rhyme merchant
Lace MC's with styles when they rhyme drunk
Eight Diagram sword swinga armored tank force
You got lost off the snare off Impeach the President
Whether in Amsterdam smokin' seven grams of green
This Witty Unpredictable shot is critical
Said he know that sounds define the note
Too many dope niggas I see starvin'
A fugitive bass playin' rap czar

Just when you thought we would fold our hand
Against all odds we raised the bet like we changed the plans
It was live on air but in between station breaks
I was holdin a pair and just made the table stakes
A safeguard against the crusaders in capes
If I double down they say the Gods are sharks
If we win against the house they thought the cards was marked
We draw hit after hit from a royal flush menu
While the dealer promoted the full house venue
A spade in the club with the heart to wear diamonds
The high roller who got credit upon signin
Recourse of bluff game's your muscle
Banana coat matchin with the ratchet
Flow through your hood in the mean tints that's giant

And niggas know that habit's behind me
Now I'm a weed fiend jettin' to Palmetto
Pushin' the big joint from down South
So if you're filthy stacked up  better watch your back and duck
'Cause these fiends  they got it cracked up
Now my man from up North  now he got the loft
It's solid as a rock and crazy salt
Desert Eagle his dick and put him in a yoke
And to know for sure  I got reck and rip shop
I pointed a gat at his mother's knot
Fuck that!

Kickin' the fly clichés  doin' duets with Rae and A
Happens to make my day
Though I'm tired of bustin' off shots  havin' to rock knots
Runnin' up in spots and makin' shit hot
I'd rather flip shows instead of those
Hangin' on my livin' room wall  my first joint and it went gold!
I want to lamp  I want to be in the shade
Plus the spotlight  gettin' my dick rode all night
I want to have me a phat yacht
And enough land to go and plant my own sess crops
But for now it's just a big dream
'Cause I find myself in a place where I'm last seen
My thoughts must be relaxed  be able to maintain
'Cause times is changed and life is strange
The glorious days is gone and everybody's doin' bad
Yo  mad lives is up for grabs
Brothers passin' away  I gotta make wakes
Receivin' all types of calls from Upstate
The God left lessons on my dresser
So I can bloom and blossom  find a new way
Continue to make more hits with Rae and A
Sunshine plays a major part in the daytime
Word up  it's all like that… yeah
It's like this  I'ma start from the top
Inspectah Deck  he's like
He's like that dude that'll sit back and watch you
Play yourself and all that  right?
And see you sit there and know you lyin'
And he'll take you to court after that
'Cause he the Inspectah  that's why he the and
And also he the Rebel I.N.S
You know what I'm sayin'?
And Shallah Raekwon  he the Chef
He cookin' up some marvelous shit to get your mouth waterin'

It's like mad different methods to the way I do my shit
You gotta smoke a bean in here  anyhow

'Cause there ain't no father to his style
That's why he the Ol' Dirty Bastard

He on some now you see me  now you don't
Know what I'm sayin'? And and  the RZA
He the sharpest motherfucka in the whole Clan
He always on point  razor sharp
And the GZA  the G is just the Genius
He  he's the backbone of the whole shit
He the head  let's put it that way
We form like Voltron  and GZA happen to be the head
You know what I'm sayin'?
So what's like  I mean what's like
Your ultimate goal against in this in this industry?
Can I say this one? Can I say this one?
Feel like we ain't get what we want yet
And really really get the way we gotta go
That's when you know it's on
You know what I'm sayin'?
'Cause right about now  I ain't braggin' or nothin'
That I know that everybody wanna hear
'Cause I know I've been waitin' to hear
You know what I'm sayin'?
But straight up and down  'til we get the goal
We gon' keep goin'
Yeah  'cause we tryin' to do all this
We tryin' to make a business outta this  man
We ain't tryin' to-- know what I'm sayin'?
Affiliate ourselves with them fake-ass A&Rs and all that
We tryin' to make our own shit
So that when our children  word
So that when our children  all our seeds and whatever
They got somethin' for theyselves right there
We ain't tryin' to hop in and hop out right quick
Know what I'm sayin'?
We out for the Gusto  and we gon' keep it raw
Careful!

You must think first before you move
Toad style is immensely strong
And immune to nearly any weapon
Raw like cocaine straight from Bolivia
My hip-hop will rock and shock the nation
Like the Emancipation Proclamation
Weak MCs approach with slang that's dead
You might as well run into the wall and bang your head
I'm makin' devils cower to the Caucasus Mountains
Rap styles vary and carry like Mariah
I come from the Shaolin slum and the isle I'm from
Is comin' through with 'nough niggas and 'nough guns
You'll catch a sharp sword to the midsection
Don't talk the talk if you can't walk the walk

Comin' to buy grocery from me
Pretendin' to be a hip-hop MC
You must bring the Ol' Dirty Bastard type slang
Dirty Ho gettin' low with his flow
Introducin' the Ghostface Killah
No one could get iller
On the mic while you was kickin' that fast shit
Remember that shit? I know you don't remember jack
And then you thought I was bugged out and crazy
Homicide's illegal and death is the penalty
What justifies the homicide when he dies in his own iniquity?
It's the master of the Mantis Rapture comin' at ya
We have an APB on an MC killer
Looks like the work of a master
Evidence indicates that his stature
The flow changes like a chameleon
Plays like a friend and stabs you like a dagger
This technique attacks the immune system
You scream as it enters your bloodstream
Erupts your brain from the pain these thoughts contain
Movin' on a nigga with the speed of a centipede
And injure any motherfuckin' contender
And immune to nearly any weapon
Toad style is immensely strong
And immune to nearly any weapon
 the Ol' Dirty BZA
 the Ghostface Killah
 stomp on the beat

Fisher Price My First Timberlands
Nigga got on a Lamont Sanford dress shirt
Your shirt look like a dish rag
When you see us  when you see us flashin' and shinin' and buildin'
Only ones who we got respect for is the niggas that we say peace to
My team be bellyachin'  hungry niggas on the swarm again
What up? He made a move  try to assist it
Now my proposal rips the global
Remember baggy jeans  Timberlands in November
Shorty called me Santa in December
But guess what? My Wallys got messed up
Autograph pressed up  what? Blessed enough to blow your rest up
We scrape that  Land O' Lake that
Mazola rap will get you sent back
Represent the gentlemens who bent that
Flash medallions like Italians  La Costra Nostra
We movin' through your hood like we supposed to  flexin'
Like that bad-ass bitch in Dead Presidents
Ad on the billboard store  check it now
You get the gold dick award  it's like jail and it's the sixth floor
Half of y'all niggas built your vine from my stress tree
You fuckin' idiot  playin' with my Clan but you be fearin' it
Fake one  I'm guaranteed to make you take one
Please  y'all niggas money's gettin' low
But could you come back  though
Set up shop and get the fat glow?
Tired of y'all  mostly inspired by y'all
So what the deal now?

No more said  knew your chump ass was dead

Still shame on a nigga who tried to run game
Your version of perversion  fuckin' bitches on Persian rugs
Washin' niggas like detergent  it's the surgeon
Slugs propels from Bobby Steele's twelve gauge
Front page Daily Chronicle reads
Hell up in Gotham  take heed and protect your seeds
You fall like autumn leaves
You lack tranquility in your rap utilities to fuck with the abilities
Race like a sperm cell to the ovary
Microphone post tone like a rotary phone
Ancient poems of poetry
Old scrolls  explosive head bullets
Black hooded  Timberland-footed ninjas
With full metal jacket clips and know how to put it in you
Surrender your goods and your merchandise for no purchase price
I'm certainly a heist for your ice is curtains  advice
Come quietly  Wu-Tang Clan rules society
Because of variety  so maintain your high anxiety
I need eighteen points on my next joint
This high anointed king to make a deal  I be the one to appoint
Steve Rifkind must've been sniffin'
To catch somethin' so dope it left Monica Lynch pussy drippin'
I fuck hundreds of bitches and spent millions of dollars
And built with thousands of scholars
My life saga from the hill to the harbor
Legal 'caine grind like Nicaragua
I gave birth to MCs  thieves and bank robbers
We drove expensive whips and took worldwide trips
And my dick's been sucked by the finest lips
Fancy delicatessens and the world's best refreshment
But none of the above compare to the 120 Lessons
Or my queen and my seed and the homes that I rest in
Enter my zone  get blown in ninety-nine sections
This rhyme has no limitation  this time there's no hesitation
Collectin' minds at the door
What the fuck you think I'm flowin' for? It's rhyme and reason
Bite the bullet  niggas is fowl and it's duck season
We at odds 'til we even  motherfucker
Taste mine  straight shots in dirty glasses
Bring it to 'em  room service
Under pressure and mad nervy
Wavin' guns at the clergy
Ticallion  we ain't worried
Keep them sick niggas seven-thirty
Picture this  watch the birdie
These bastards is old and dirty
With sharp hymns that be stabbing you
Pins and needles  needles and pins
'Nuff said  dick in your mouth like Tempest Bled'
As I race track with thoroughbreds  duckin' the Feds
Feed 'em food  let the fake evaporate
Reconstruction  that's the whole science on my production
Maybe y'all niggas snitch
You's a loner  Adidas shell top while I sip a Corona
Read the Robb Report  then bone her
Buy you some jewels  here's some food
Chill  y'all niggas know what time it is
James Bond Bimmers behind me on Bacardi Limon
Check out the pitch like Nolan Ryan  he caught a slug for lying
Militia  rollin' in position
Casa Blanca Cuban link Christian
Lex retali' back whistling
Fake fucks
How dare you rebuild the Wu-Tang Clan against me
For that you’re gonna die
I may not be the one to stop you  but somebody will very soon
Also  the Wu-Tang Clan will rise again
It's the Wu (Wu-Tang) creepin in the shadows (Wu-Tang)
(Oh baby  for heavens sake)
Sir I  Excalibur  (Wu-Tang...)
(Oh baby  for heavens sake)
(Oh baby  for heavens sake)
Yeah
My rap style swing like Willie Mays
My eyes Purple Haze  my solar rays’ll burn through shades
Rhyme grenades raid the airwaves  catch this rap page
I glide like  hovercrafts on the Everglades
Manufacture poems to microphones  bones fracture
Limited edition composition spark friction
Zero tolerance  dominant intelligence
Wu original  true colors stem from the melanin
I circulate the tri-state and vibrate beyond the Richter
Fly sistas flock when they spot this live nigga
The crowd seducer black your third eye before I lose ya
Verbal high  leave styes in the eyes of Medusa
Narrow margin  of your odds to dodge the marksman
Murder rap  kill you soft like Roberta Flack
Words attack like a British Bulldog  observe the stats

Now all pay tribute to this entity
A spark that surges through the undergrowth
Overwhelming the populace from the entry
The Wu-Tang Dynasty  has emerged
From this elite fleet I was appointed to strike the vital nerve
Mouths tend to utter and speak empty words
Observe the magnetic attraction as we breathe
Seeds of MC's that these fake ass industry niggas
Feed off  the chrome might tend to squeeze off
And spray  an array of shots
That travel downwind  just respect my prolific pen
As I ascend  the minds of the weak
To rise and take power Eiffel tower-ing over the land
As we stand  expanding our cream
A dollar to every grain of sand
Let the mind use the physical as planned
(Oh baby  for heaven's sake)
(Oh baby  for heaven's sake)
Try to comprehend check out my new suit
Darts blend aim take fire pure destruction
Fallin out the sky tall sniper
Raps by Cappadonna hit the countryside
Poetry whirlpool  RZA and True collide
We produce article exception to the rule
We the black men that struck oil  the hardboiled
Cats that made that Watergate thing go spoiled
The heavy-handed  locked down stranded with Cyrus
Off-the-wallers  basketball gun brawlers
Smoked out throw both fists for nine-seven
Slang reverend  put the best work in
(Oh baby  for heaven's sake)
(Oh baby  for heaven's sake)
(Oh baby  for heaven's sake)
(Oh baby  for heaven's sake)
Yo

 I'd like to see you try that
I want everybody  to put your work down  put your guns down
And report to the pit  the gravel pit
Leave your problems at home  leave your children at home
We gon' take it back underground  I be Bobby Boulders
Wu-Tang Clan on yo' mind one time
It's the jump off  so just jump off my nigga
Check out my gravel pit
A mystery unraveling
Wu-Tang is the CD that I travel with
Don't go against the grain if you can't handle it
Ha  holocaust from the land of the lost
Behold the pale horse  off course (off course)
Follow me  Wu-Tang gotta be
The best thing since Starks and Clark Wallabees
African killer bees blackwatch
On your radio  blowin out yo' watts
From Park Hill  the house on haunted hill
Every time you walk by your back get a chill
Let's peel  who want to talk rap skills
I spit like a semi-automatic to the grill
Elbow grease  and elbow room
Baby play me  baby fall down  go boom
Party people gather round  count down to apocalypse
(I'm the kid with the golden arms)
And I'm the motherfuckin Hot Nicks pass the blunt
My nigga don't front
You had it for a minute but it seem like a month
Now I'm chokin  smokin  hopin

Hey  kid  walk straight  master your high

Can't stand niggas that floss too much
Can't stand Bentleys they cost too much
Kid wanna get up then kid get touched
Kid wanna stick up then kid get stuck
I'm the one that called your bluff
When your boy tried to act tough

Between the tré and the dough boy  we bred different
So bear witness  this can leave you with head missing
If y'all can hear me  I guarantee you the feds listening

This my Cohiba  cigar blow
Even Tony Stark knows the tension is thick as Wallabee Clark soles
But did I mention I'm sick and gotta be hardcore
Money over bimbos  that's what the Mob for
Rappers stuck in limbo 'cause they were settin' the bar low

Drag him through a drive-thru like he ordered the combo

Then come defeat  that's my beliefs and I stand on 'em
Give you the beats  no Doc Dre or brands on 'em
Some men want 'em  these verses hot and the fans want 'em
I'm from the school of them hard knocks with harder standards

Photogenic  tears just burst out my wig
Plus he dropped one
Oh shit  here come his Old Earth with no shoes on
Screamin'  holdin' her breasts with a gown on
She fell and then lightly touched his jaw  kissed him
Rubbed his hair  turned around  the ambulance was there

Weeks ago he strip-searched the God and gave him back his coke

Interaction with the wise and civilized
The mind caused matter to fall into a center
A great deal of heat that'll radiate within ya
From out of this collision
The central cord became thick enough to trap its own light and bring vision
Each drop full of Hip Hop energy
Balanced on all sides such great symmetry
The bars unlocked the power of the stars
The mirror in the telescope pinpoint the gods
From a distance  acting as a guiding coach
Analyze the board  universal approach
Retune the soul to a certain pitch
Changing the frequency frequently  hitting a certain switch
The love is paramount  the connect is brotherly
Respect for the intellect and broad discovery

Wanted niggas to fuck her raw dog without no condom

I smell sess  pass the method
Let's get lifted as I kick ballistic
Missiles and shoot game like a pistol
Clip is loaded when I click bang (Bang)
A Wu-Tang slug hits your brain
J-U-M-P  jump  and I thump
Make girls rump like pump and Humpty Hump
Wild  the Shaolin style is all in me
Child  the whole damn isle is callin' me
P-A-N-T-Y  R-A-I-D-E-R  mad raw  I don't fry
Meaning  no one can burn or toss and turn me
Ooh  I be the super sperm
Chim-chimney  chim-chim  cher-ee
Freak a flow and flow fancy free
Now  how many licks does it take
For me to hit the Tootsie Roll center of a break?
Peep and don't sleep  the crew's mad deep (Wu-Tang)

And you didn't have friends to begin with  I'm—

Through the 36 Chambers of death  kid
Aiyo  I roll like a Bat out of Hell
Evil acapell's fly  spittin' out of my grill
Before I hit the sky with springtime colors  juicy as a Sunkist
Certain broads double Dutch this  they carve it in they wrist
Pillsbury blazes  straightening combs left on the stove
Crumbs in my lady hair  plus yours  the look gold
God  the old chain and ball technique
Got these vegetable lasagna niggas in they whips  jumpin' out they seats
18 Bronzemen Pt. II
We like Dorothy Hamill on ice — we in your hood  we might circle
Hats down low in the Range  switch lanes

Draped out  shinin' like a fresh 50 cent piece
Yo  girlfriend  come here  oh shit! You my man's niece!

Let the shot spark soon as his pit bull barks
Tire scars from skid marks leaves from jams in school parks
Witness forget his original statement
Even in protection programs  there's no escapement
Gunned down  three in town  hit king from seven crowns
Spent rounds  catch him while he rhyme in the Zebra Lounge
Wounded back in the '83 summer heat
Up in 3-0-9 park  rhymin' off the drummer's beat
I stalked the city streets  demonstratin' mic wrecks
All lookin' stank  I ain't playin' with a full deck
And as they nervously stare  I know they scared
They saw the comin' of Wu in neon in Times Square
Household name  assassin  Killa Bee
Mill to the grain that posses the Wu trilogy
Quick to spot those that bite  camouflage and blend
Those that got styles  they got identical twins
Don't stress the small thing  copycats are finicky
Without skills  they master the art of mimicry
But I go line for line on the whole page
Forty wolves on deck with burners in they snorkel
Criminology  pea soup Wallabees

Non-rappin' rappers in the booth and they don't write
Fuckin' stupid ass rappers
Acting out of they character  I shoot and stab rappers
P! What it do  nigga?

Shit  it's a thing of pure beauty

Nigga  when Sean write hard
Niggas do anything for it like Klondike Bars

Splash the handcrafted Gucci from the shirt to the shoe wear
I crush the rings out  wife-beater tee with no wings out
I got stamina  I'll long-dick a bird 'til she sings out
La-la-la-la  Bobby Dig' convert Lady Gaga
Back to heterosexual  I'm classic like Impala

Come fully packed with a fat rugged stack
Shame on you when you step through to
The Ol' Dirty Bastard straight from the Brooklyn Zoo
And I'll be damned if I let any man
Come to my center  you enter the winter
Straight up and down  that shit is packed jam
You can't slam  don't let me get fool on him  man
The Ol' Dirty Bastard is dirty and stinkin'

Ejectin' styles from my lethal weapon
My pen that rocks from here to Oregon
Here's more again! Catch it like a psycho flashback
I love gats  if rap was a gun  you wouldn't bust back
I come with shit in all types of shapes and sounds
And where I lounge is my stompin' grounds
I give an order to my peeps across the water
To go and snatch up props all around the border
And get far like a shootin' star
'Cause who I are is livin' the life of Pablo Escobar
Point-blank as I kick the square biz
There it is  you're fuckin' with pros  and there it goes
It's 10 o'clock  ho  where the fuck's your seed at?!
Feelin' mad hostile  wearin' Aeropostale
Flowin' like Christ when I speaks the gospel
Stroll with the holy robe
Then attack the globe with the buckus style  the ruckus
Ten-times-ten men committin' mad sin
Turn the other cheek and I'll break your fuckin' chin!
Slayin' boom-bangs like African drums
(We'll be!) Comin' around the mountain when I come
Crazy flamboyant for the rap enjoyment
My Clan increase like black unemployment
Yeah  another one dare!
G-Gka-Genius — take us the fuck outta here!
The Wu is too slammin' for these Cold Killin' labels
Some ain't had hits since I seen Aunt Mabel
Be doin' artists in like Cain did Abel
Now their money's gettin' stuck to the gum under the table
That's what you get when you misuse what I invent
Your empire falls and you lose every cent
For tryna blow up a scrub
Now  that thought was just as bright as a 20-watt light bulb
Should've pumped it when I rocked it
Niggas so stingy  they got short arms and deep pockets
This goes on in some companies
With majors  they're scared to death to pump these
First of all  who's your A&R?
A mountain climber who plays an electric guitar?
But he don't know the meanin' of dope
Money's lookin' for a suit-and-tie rap that's cleaner than a bar of soap
And I'm the dirtiest thing in sight
Matter of fact  bring out the girls and let's have a mud fight!
You best protect ya neck!
You best protect ya neck!
You best protect ya neck!

Struck a match to the underground  industry ignited
From metaphorical parables to fertilize the Earth
Wicked niggas come  try to burglarize the turf
Scatting off soft-ass beats them niggas rap happily
Tragically  that style deteriorate rapidly
Uncompleted missions  throwing your best known compositions
You couldn't add it up if you mastered addition
Where I come from  getting visuals is habitual
You're more safe walking on hot coals in rituals
I splash the paint on the wall  formed a mural
He took a look  saw the manifestation of it was plural
Rhyming while impaired  dart hit your garment
Pierced your internal streamlined compartments
Just consider the unparalleled advantage
Of a natural disaster that's impossible to manage
Bitchass niggas counterfeit the funk
I smoke the bead of the skunk  tree top of the trunk
Moonshine drunken monk  your head get shrunk
Your treasure sunk  I be fucking bitches by the chunk
My name black  you worms wanna play in my dirt
Bitch stop  my Momma serve free lunch from the church
I cum like a thousand doves
Unglove the noose  watch a nigga transfuse
Dirty add to the fuse  heavy at the booze
I don't walk  I get carried
Gold and platinum Frisbees on my wall  looking properly
But comely  I U.F.O. you Wright Brothers

My grandfather  step up and get knocked right the fuck out

 we scoop up C.R.E.A.M. like Breyer's
 Shaolin imported chambers been recorded
 time for royalty audit
 but he's an expert at throwing knives
 niggas couldn't fuck with the
 shots hit the ceilin'
 I strive for perfection
 shots I give
 but he's an expert at throwing knives

Wu buck wild with the trigger
Shame on a nigga who try to run game on a nigga
Wu buck—I'll fuck your ass up!
Blaow! How you like me now? Don't fuck the style
Get your teeth knocked the fuck out?
You could never capture the Method Man's stature

Yo!
I come with that ol' loco style from my vocal
Couldn't peep it with a pair of bifocals
Be on you like a house on fire—smoke ya
Got burnt once—but that was only gonorrhea
So I can get fizzy-funky for ya
Rah! Here comes the Tiger vs. Crane
I'll be like wild with my style
Wu! is comin' through at a theater near you
And get funk like a shoe
What?
Aiyyo Dunn this song is called Sunshower
Cause we approachin the final hour
You know I ahh all I can say to my brothers and sisters right now
Cause this globe is about to explode with hatred
Of the prism of light but still blind
Will end up in the everlastin winter of hellfire
Throw on this mix just picks your third eye out
Along with your wicked fraternal from generals to colonels
Releasin thermonuclear heat that burns you firmly
And permanently upon this journey
Through the journal of the book of life
Those who took a life without justice
Will become just ice ice ice
It's been taught that your worst enemy couldn't harm you
As much as your own wicked thoughts
Now you're bein persecuted by that universal court court court
Iron hell with the strong blend of rape and blend of sandal
You could travel every square inch of the planet Earth and still be
Ninety-three million miles away from the sun
Know the ledge to where your heart is
Or fall off into the internal hell that's uncharted
What you thought life was a sport? A game?
Ain't worth the eternity inside a sulfur lake
Of life and fed God Degree of light to my head

Two hundred thousand million atmosphere cubic feet of air we breath
While niggas minds are trapped twenty thousand fathoms beneath
And shatter bone fragments
Cops love the block you gettin backed up by Dragnet
Thrown into a six by eight steel cabinet
Those who haven't learnt get returned
You freaky ass niggas get burned
Some walk around like they ain't concerned
With the hell goin on inside the world
Why do grown men molest little girls?
Is it because the girl's breast has swelled
I started off as a pawn in this marathon of life
To far heights so dark that even wit a bright light
You couldn't see a spark of light
Kickin rhymes three hours straight with no pause
Boostin from Freeport sunrise to Amityville morgue
Started out writin fables to makin beats on lunchroom tables
To wearin long cables that hung down to the navel
So pack some crack and fat sacks of skunk
Back when Wu-Gambinos were called F.O.I. MC's
All and Together Now Crew B.C.C
Old Earth got nervous walked me to Shaolin sent me to Curtis
While Meth Chef and Deck was off the New Dorp
For white boys who took steroids
Buildin up bicep tricep pectoids and deltoids
Back when our girlfriends was virgins
Cuttin class with Ghost tryin to bag hoes in Murry Bergtraum
A Maybeldine beacon night school Washington Irving
These young Gods was seekin
Hoes in Westinghouse and Clara Barton and Medina
Girls who sung like Sarafina
On the corner of Belmont and Picket Avenue I seen her
As if I dreamed her
So it's always hope
See subway train run through the city like blood through the veins
So take heed to these words
And feel the power of the Sunshower
Approachin the final hour
Let's come together under the wings
 me and the gods gettin' ripped
 forty dogs in my lip
 'boom boom' the bass would blast
 brothers had began to discuss
 heh heh heh heh heh ha
 my mother sent him out for bread
 it's a hot day in the summer
 BOW! Then he snatched the bag
 then he jetted up the Ave
 the noise up and down the block
 Rakeem!) What? (Your little brother got shot!)
 then I dropped down to his feet
 then I held him by his head
 that's when I knew he was…
 of us laughin' all the time
 my ace Big Moe from the shelter
 Thelma had a rep that was higher than her neck
 you know how it is when you're blitzed
 somethin' got to give
 I said I'll take next
 take this raincoat and practice safe sex!
 I am airin' out
 he came out laughin' with glory
 but he got caught with the H.I.V
 doc says two more years
Six niggas walked in flashing they gems piece
Aight  one dark-skinned nigga  fifty-six inch rope
Wrapped around twice  smash the Gilligan boat with ice
They threw sign language  ordered hot coffee wit' a danish
Relax  whispered they  Rap entertainers
Had Lizzy on  two Japanese birds with furs look good  kid
Laid back  handling hors d'ourves
It's like round three  we too black for BET
You memorize the 1 to 40? I'm at the 19th degree
If a civilized person doesn't perform his duty  what shall be done?
Pardon me  God  that nigga got a gun bulging out his sweatpants
Check out his stance
See the side of his grill? Look like my cousin Lance
He wanted crush bone leather with the strings dark
Now I remember  he from Bear Mountain
He and Mitch Greene shot the fair one near the water fountain
Seventh round  Chavez bleeding from his right ear
Yo  keep your eye on that same nigga from right here
Popcorn spilling all on Liz Claiborne
Ghost had the fly Gucci mocks wit' no socks on
Seen Deion Sanders in the back with the phat fur on
Working them hoes with the fly Wu shirts on
Mixed drink session  dun  pour me some more
Chef leathered down  blinking at Chanté Moore
Tenth round  Chavez tearing 'em down
Sweet Pea  get ya shit off
It's like blacks against the Germans  getting hit off
Smooth and them walked in  Brownsville representing
They sent a bottle over  autograph blessing
Chef  pull out the doo-doo  twist the dank - pink noodles
Yo  they wound up stopping the fight
Steels took a point away from Chavez
Rematch scheduled on October 9th
How you  God? (Studying 120 right now
Call me back at the God Hour)
The Fuck? It's just the new way of thinking
Light up the broccoli  kid
Throw the relish in my back pocket
That's how we doing it
Bound by honor  sword take over the set
Rap from here to Quebec
Slam you like Hamill's Whitewater Scandal
Wally sandal just a sample  my niggas fertilize thoughts
One nasty can blew
My pen sterile  won't perform if I'm not lampable
Asking my man'll get you slapped down  play the anthem
Silent nines sounding like crickets  snatch your worker’s shipment
Just like a long sleeve  guess who ripped it?

Two fingers is all in your hole  think I can fit three
Grab my shit and place it gently on your clit
Ping-pong pussy  wide world the womb
Titties sagging  stomach on some shriveled up prune shit
Too much air in your pussy
You screaming that it's talking to you  daddy

Lightning rod bob  black candy cane attached to God
Thick like a Great Adventure cigar  in your garage
Pregnant pussy have you fall out  like Remy on the house
Watch the teeth when slobbing my shit  you bit it on the couch
Dry pussy lead to friction burns  plus beef I hone

Guns of Navarone tearing up your battle zone
Rip through your slums
Loop my voice on the LP
Run for your team and your six can't rhyme groupies
So I can squeeze with the advantage and get wasted
My deadly notes reign supreme
Your thought is basic compared to mine
Take a free ride on my thought
I got the fashion catalogs for all y'all to all praise due to God
The saga continues
Pocket full of shells out the sky Golden Arms
Tunes spit the shitty Mortal Kombat sound
The fake false step make the blood stain the ground
Escape from your dragon's lair
Through your spine to the top of your cerebral cortex
Make you feel like you bust a nut from raw sex
Enter through your right ventricle clog up your bloodstream
Heart terminal like Grand Central Station
Program fat bass lines on Novation
Getting drunk like I'm fucking ducking five-year probation
Many of the victim families save their ashes
Those who went back received penalties for the acts
Another heart is torn as close ones mourn'
The track renders helpless and suffers from multiple stab wounds
And leaks sounds that's heard
93 million miles away from
Came one to represent the Nation
This is a gathering of the masses
That come to pay respects to the Wu-Tang Clan
The high chief Jamel Irief takes the stage
Light is provided through sparks of energy
From the mind that travels in rhyme form
Giving sight to the blind
The dumb are mostly intrigued by the drum
Death only one can save self from
This relentless attack of the track spares none
Look at all these crab niggas laid back
Lamping like them gray and black Puma's on my man's rack
Codeine was forced in your drink
You had a navy green salamander fiend
Bitches overheard you scream
Blowing like Shalamar in '81
Connect thoughts to make my man child walk
While my pen blow lines ferocious
Don't erase none of that good shit in the beginnin'
That pinky ring shit  yo
It's that pinky ring shit  the legend of masked kid
Shoot out the speakers when my guns get jurassic
Superbad  who am I? Dolemite classic
The vandal's back  hands on Angela Bassett
I handle my plastic  gunplay I mastered
No coke  dope mixed down with acid on record
Broken down and crafted in seconds

Nuff respect father Eton with Addies
My brothers can't wait to squeeze the automatic
They need wreck like a drug dealer need a addict
Floatin' on the 95  sting like a killer bee
Your hands can't hit what your eyes can't see
From dark matter to the big crunch
The vocals came in a bunch without one punch
Reputation enhanced  since the cause was probable
So you compare contrast but don't blast
Through extreme depths  with the pen I hold fast
Watch the block thirst for one became all
Shot 'em with the long forgotten rainfall
Delivered in a brutal fashion with simplicity
The blind couldn't verify the authenticity
The rhyme came from the pressure of heat
Then it was laid out  on the ground to pave streets
I got my uzi back
I got my uzi back

That's the mental war
That's the battle between God and devil
Take the devil off your plane
Thats the mental devil that exists within your body
That's destroying and decaying your mind
The mind controls the body
Everything within must come out
Don't look towards the sky cause there's no heaven above
But heaven and hell exist within
Heaven is what you make it and hell is what you go through
There is only one God
There is a only one
One revolution yeah
At one time it was told to me
That man came from monkeys
That we were swinging from trees
Now the story is about to close
It was a hundred percent of us
That came on the slave ships
Eighty five percent of our people was uncivilized
Poison animal eaters
They're slaves of the mental powers
They don't know who the true and living God is
And their origins in the world
So they worship what they know not
And they're easily lead in the wrong direction
Ought to be lead in the right
And now you got the ten percent who are rich slave makers of the poor
Who teach the poor lies that make the people believe
That the all mighty true and living God is a spook in the sky
And you can't see him with the physical eyes
They're also known as blood suckers of the poor
And then you got the five percent
Who are the poor righteous teachers
Who do not believe in the teachings of the ten percent
Who is all wise and know who the true and living god is
And teach that the true and living god is a supreme being black man from Asia
Otherwise known as civilized people
Peace we out
