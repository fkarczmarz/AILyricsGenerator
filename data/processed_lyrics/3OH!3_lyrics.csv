lyrics
"High as outer space man
Fucking ridiculous
Exit seat while I'm riding on your plane man
Singing slow jams in between gold teeth
At a karaoke stand with your girl getting drunk chief
She singing Journey
Getting hella horny
So she grabbed my face like Sigourney
At the 7-Eleven
Parked in the alley out back we found heaven
At the 7-Eleven
Tracing lines on your skin we found heaven
She said she heard of me from that album Want
She used to bump it in the Target parking lot
In her '97 Dodge
Well that's hot
It's more like you'll be catching flies on your eyelids
But I keep crashing in the rocks of the sirens
Playing murder-fuck-kill with death on a desert island

At the 7-Eleven
Parked in the alley out back we found heaven
At the 7-Eleven
Tracing lines on your skin we found heaven
We lit a fire and said a prayer beneath the typhoon rain
Then we'd wake up and we'd be here and it'd be light again
Tequila soda
Talkin' like I'm Yoda
Trying to convince a girl that my bed ain't a sofa
Just come over
Maybe I could show ya
Would you join me on a date through time?
I'll take you to the future
Where I blew your mind
At the 7-Eleven
Parked in the alley out back we found heaven
At the 7-Eleven
Tracing lines on your skin we found heaven
At the 7-Eleven
Parked in the alley out back we found heaven
At the 7-Eleven
I know exactly what it's from
They're turning off the street lamps
They say the day is almost done
There's a ringing in my ears now
I remember how it was
The feeling we had last night
And it won't stop now because
We don't wanna see this day go
'Cause if the party is dead
We can bring it back to life
If you listen to the words that I say
'Cause if the party is dead
All we need is candle light
And a little bit of dynamite
Everybody will get out of our way

I got a song stuck in my head
I know exactly why it's there
There's a noise outside my bedroom
And I don't even care
All we gotta do is just let go
We can make it through the night
'Cause if the party is dead
We can bring it back to life
If you listen to the words that I say
'Cause if the party is dead
All we need is candle light
And a little bit of dynamite
Everybody will get out of our way
Woah-oh-oh-oh-oh
Woah-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
(We can bring it back to life)
Woah-oh-oh-oh-oh
Woah-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
'Cause I'm never gonna get these drums out of my head
And I'm never gonna get some sleep inside of my bed
'Cause if the party is dead
We can bring it back to life
If you listen to the words that I say
'Cause if the party is dead
All we need is candle light
And a little bit of dynamite
Everybody will get out of our way
(We can bring it back to life)
Woah-oh-oh-oh-oh
She's like bang bang
You won't even feel the pain
She's like bang bang
Faster than a bullet train
She's like bang bang
You won't even feel the pain
She's like bang bang
You read that I was bad news
Before you even met me
You know the dudes I hang with
They ain't exactly friendly
99 bottles on the wall until they're empty
You were such a plain Jane
Now you go bang bang
But I know you'll never let it slide
All I got is one shot to fix this
And you know I'm gonna make it right
So put your hands in the air
Hands in the air

Hands in the air

I had thirty missed calls and a dirty mixed drink
When you found me getting in flirting with the girl on the sink
Call me David Copperfield
And you can play the blame game
I think it goes bang bang
But I know you'll never let it slide
All I got is one shot to fix this
And you know I'm gonna make it right
So put your hands in the air
Hands in the air
So put your hands in the air
Hands in the air
She's got her finger on the trigger like bang bang
And they're right there in the middle like bang bang

That if you wanna get to the top
Then you better learn how to steal
You better learn how to raise your hand if you wanna come here and talk to me
I rock a bus pass 'cause you know that talk is cheap
Can't make a living dropping shit just like colostomy
Upset your neighbors when the music makes you stomp your feet
Upset the dead when we're in the graveyard dropping beats
Crack your head when we take you out and rock the street
Now everybody go ahead and sing along with me
We are the same old Boulder motherfuckers
You'll be at the same job while the aliens abduct us
We are the same old Boulder motherfuckers
You'll be at the same job while the aliens abduct us
Wrapped in a Navajo poncho
With a beard soaked in patchouli to drip into your nachos
I can get your blood boiling like Al Pacino
'Cause I'll be the one rapping in your ear
While you're waiting for your frappuccino
We glow like mutant ooze that turns us into ninjas

Watch the houses disappear  row by row
Head hurts  sweatshirts
Eyes to the ground  a town of introverts
Cold sweat gets old
Want the serotonin to come home
Wake up  no luck
Telling time by lines of beer in my cup
Take away all my fun
You know you can tie a noose around my tongue
The man at the wheel driving my mind is drunk
The focus is gone
Claustrophobia
The walls are slowly closing in
This town has a hold of us
The claws are tearing at my skin
Now my conscience is leaving
The words are for speaking
There's no one to speak them to
Claustrophobia

I always hoped that you could just stay dead
Radioactive in your crown of lead
Deep underneath the pillars of this bed
Yeah  I always hoped that you would just stay dead

This town has a hold of us
The claws are tearing at my skin
Now my conscious is leaving
The words are for speaking
There's no one to speak them to

 I’d whisper it softly
 I think I’ll stay right here

 I see the glimmer in your eyes
 pick up all my dirty clothes
 well I wouldn’t be the same
Dirty mind  dirty mind  d-d-d-d-dirty mind
I tried to leave the house but she won't let me out
Deadbolts locked  got me strapped to the couch
She's got a dirtier mind than my mouth
But I hate to say  the more you fuck  the better for your health
She wants me at the party  she wants me at the mall
She wants me in a bathroom stall

And fingers' crossed like the promise of Cub Scouts
And we know that the picture in her heart-shaped locket’s
Far from an inanimate object
She’s as dark as the blood pulsing under her skin
Still afraid of the boogey man under her bed
And we know that the ashes in the urn was a person
And we never should have burned him
Break it down to a fraction
I’m doing decimal subtraction to find a reaction

I gotta get you out and take this chance
I caught her cornering the pictures in her purse
A white reflection of the window of his hearse
And she knows not to be another wife in waiting
So she’s just a widow that I’m dating
Rolled up sleeves with a carton in it’s fold
A rusted chain with a cross that once was gold
And I look from a distance as the coffin closes
And disappears below the roses
We got the music that you can’t stand still to
And even if you don’t dance (don’t dance)

We got the music that you can’t stand still to
And even if you don’t dance (don’t dance)

You better not be dancing
I’ve been feeling some type of way about her
‘Cause she like to play around and she know she got it
In turn and make a kid not really want it
A bad bitch who know she a bad bitch
Worst type in the world if you ask me
So I’m sitting here trying to go through the motion
Get along but it would be better if we boned
I beat my dick like it owe me money
I guess it be the Moon Man who cracked the case
Won’t trust a ho ‘cause the ho won’t trust me
Won’t trust a ho ‘cause the ho won’t trust me

I really need something to tell me it's okay not to think
Because I've been to all these bars and I've seen all these places
I've hit on all these girls  I've heard the same conversations
'Cause I already know all the words that she'll say
And I'll be creeping out the window at the first sight of day
'Cause every single night it seems to go the same way
I think I've been here before
I think I've run into you
I know the things that you do
'Cause this is déjà vu (woah)

Mister bartender  you will kick me out
And the blond girl in the back  you'll put your tongue down my mouth
And the greaser in the jacket's gonna pick a fight
And they'll probably kick my ass 'cause I'm drunk every night

Before they lock me up for all the bad things that I do?

In the parking lot I told you
Didn't even know you'd take back the hours we wasted
We're frozen in the headlights
We're slipping on the black ice
Shouldn't have to act nice
I found out you were mutual the night you said that you went home
You played me like a musical
Said ignorance is beautiful
I found out you were mutual the night you said that you went home
You tricked me with the dude I know the wrong
You said you wouldn't
But you did it
Why you lying?
I ain't kidding
This love's not real

You can wash me with your water
Purify me till I shiver

You're way too young to fall apart
You're way too young to play these games
But you better start
But you better start
This is when it starts
From the beating of your heart
'Til the streetlamps talk to you
Jumping off of the edge
Oversleeping your head
Everything's turning dark to you
I went to pick up the parts
The doctor's hiding the charts
He won't let me see this side of you
It's on the tip of my tongue
You know you're way too young
To have someone lie to you
You'd better find somebody else and get a hold of yourself
You're way too young to be broken
You're way too young to fall apart
You're way too young to play these games

Today was a good day?
Well  that wasn't today
No  that wasn't today
Saw a picture of my ex with a new dude
Lyin' on a beach in Cancun
Got me thinkin' this way
A rainbow of gray
Wrapped up in these feelings like a goalie glove
Holy fuck  I'm a middle-aged cliché

Should probably have some kids by now

Why haven't you been on a date?
It's just you and me now
And a couple of our hometown friends

Whiskey in a tea cup
Lipstick on the edge while you talk

You deserve my promise
To love the twisted little beautiful disaster that's inside of you
When you're dying for affection
You cut me down to save his name
I think he should be the one who's chokin' on your chain
Instead of giving you all of his pain
Put your mayne on a leash

You put my picture in a box
It was the one inside your locket
What happened to the keys
That used to jingle in your pocket?
Your fingers say to come
But your eyes say I should stop it
If I regret all I’ve done
I would be trapped inside that locket
You put my picture in a box
What happened to the keys
Your fingers say to come
If I regret all I’ve done
You put my picture in a box (‘Cause I’ve seen it before)

Your fingers say to come (And I just want you to know)
But your eyes say I should stop it
If I regret all I’ve done
I would be trapped inside that locket
A place you'd stop off on the highway
But all of those things changed on the day
You packed up your bags and you ran away
All they say is how you've changed
Every day I stay the same
So you can keep the necklace that I gave to you
I'll keep the shitty tattoos
You and me
You and me
I count the empty bottles up on the bar
And the lights in this place are too dim to see

They tell me you're all I've got
I just need these dreams to stop
You can keep the necklace that I gave to you
I'll keep the shitty tattoos
You and me
You and me
You told me I should move on (On)
You told me I should move on
You and me
Three babies in the backseat singin’ to you
And my hom—and my homies all singing to it
3OH... 3OH!3
I ain’t callin’ for a close-up
Bitches with the nose jobs
I’ma do it how I always have
Whiskey in a 40 bag
Pissin’ in the alleyway
Out back of where the party’s at
I’ma spend it on a new whip
Bitches with the huge tits
I’ma do it how I always do
Sleep until the break of noon
Wakin’ just to make it through
Another night of shakin’ you
I mean what can I say?
Three babies in the backseat singin’ to you
And turn it up on your radio
I got 200 seconds and I'm ready to go
I mean what can I say?
Three babies in the backseat singin' to you

I ain’t signing on a new lease
Models with their nose bleeds
I’ma run it like a marathon
Party ‘til I’m 50
Wake up on my parent’s lawn
Them cops still out to get me
And I ain’t sippin’ on a mixed drink
Talking to a rich skank
Filled up like a sperm bank
I’ma go where I always go
Drinks are on the house
Whiskey’s on the rocks
While your sister’s on my mouth
I mean what can I say?
Three babies in the backseat singin’ to you
And turn it up on your radio
I got 200 seconds and I'm ready to go
I mean what can I say?
Three babies in the backseat singin' to you
And turn it up on your radio
I got 200 seconds and I’m ready to go
And if I was a rich man
I’d never been to sea
Could I take you anyways?
And if I was a sick man
I’d never meant to be
Would you love me anyways?
Or would you marry me?
I mean what can I say?
Three babies in the backseat singin’ to you

All the Claws that she drinks while she drives me insane
I tried making friends with her feelings
But her feelings weren't very friendly with me
Slow burn when she put me through hell
Told me I had to work on myself
So good at projecting her issues
Rain forest full of tears in her tissues
I could be mad at the way she put all the shady
Skid marks wash out
Skid marks wash out
It's just a little stain
And everything will fade
Skid marks wash out
I hurt myself trying to carry
All the skeletons that you try to bury
Had to take off all my clothes 'cause of you
You might also likeTell me was it worth it
Putting up with bullshit
Knowing that I just go home and turn on all the faucets
I let the water run over my chest
While at the center you ruin my bed 
I could be mad at the way she put all the shady
Skid marks wash out
Skid marks wash out
It's just a little stain
And everything will fade

Whistlin' and tryin' to flirt with me
Don't take this personally
'Cause we were never in love
It doesn't really matter who you say you are
Singin' out the window of your car
Find another girl across the bar

Now
I’m drunk and so is everyone else
In this devil town
They won’t let me turn around
To get one last look at my baby
Go ahead and build it up again
This city’s just cemeteries and
Forgotten men
My only hope’s to see you
And even if I never do
You might also like
And I know what you’re thinking
That won’t stop this drinking
It’s the least I can do
‘Cause this life is anything but certain
When they close the final curtain
You’ll get a glimpse of the truth
‘Cause you’re still around
Go ahead and burn it down
I’m drunk and so is everyone else
And I can bite my tongue
Cause it would take all week
To tell you where I'm from
I know what you're about
Why don't you close your mouth?
And step right over here
So we can dance this out
These lazy days are way too long
High above the ground
The club is getting dark
And I can feel the heat
I set my hands right down
To right below your knees
If this is all there is
Then this is all there can be
Cause I don't see no road

Paved the way on empty roads
Into a grave gold headstone
And the path you take might be your own
Where did you go? When the sun rose
To find these streets of gold
Where did you go? When the sun rose
Now I know how to get off these dirt roads
To find these streets of gold
You walk on streets of gold
I went back home to heal the pain
And feel the ice rushing through my veins (Fuck)
I always thought it'd be forever
So I went and got your name
In a tattooed heart
You don’t need to worry about
So just block me 'cause I blocked you
I covered up your name

 you're too fine
 I gotta go  I'm finished with the show
 I won't say no

 I gotta go  I'm finished with the show
 I won't say no

 I gotta go  I'm finished with the show
 I won't say no

Turn up the volume  blow out the speakers
Best clothes on  goin' down on fire
Turn the lights off  turn the music higher
And now you're never gonna break me down  gonna break me down
This is all I can take  so farewell
'Cause you're never gonna find me now  gonna find me now
We are young! (whoa)
We are young! (whoa)
We drink and we fight and we love just because
We are numb (whoa)
We're on the run (whoa)
And you're never gonna chase us down...
We are young
Dance with the devil  don't be shy
Nothing's gonna stop us  we can't die
Sleepin' in a bed  waking up outside
At least I can say I tried
So fathers  don't let go of your daughters
We take what we want  we don't borrow
Think I found a message in a bottle

Because I'm like that  'cause I'm like that
I'm gonna buy you all a drink and I'll be right back
Drinks at the bar
With her friends there standing so far
But it feels near
If only she looks
I could take her home with me
I'll buy you a round
If you come close
Turn up the sound
Turn the lights down
Give me a chance
I will take her home with me
(You're gonna love this!)
Yeah  I don't know what's happening
And I swear to ya honor
That in my car the girl was biting on my lips like Jeffrey Dahmer
I just drove her back to my place for a night cab
