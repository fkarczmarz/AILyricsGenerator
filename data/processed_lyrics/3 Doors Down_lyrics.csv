"I've got to make this life make sense
Can anyone tell what I've done?
I miss the life
I miss the colors of the World
Can anyone tell where I am?
'Cause now again I've found myself so far down
Away from the Sun that shines into the darkest place
Away from the sun again
I'm over this
I'm tired of living in the dark
Can anyone see me down here?
The feeling's gone
There's nothing left to lift me up
Back into the world I know
'Cause now again I've found myself so far down
Away from the Sun that shines into the darkest place
Away from the Sun
That shines to light the way for me
To find my way back into the arms
That care about the ones like me
Yeah

It's down to this
I've got to make this life make sense
And now I can't tell what I've done
And now again I've found myself
That shines to light the way for me
'Cause now again I've found myself so far down
Away from the Sun that shines into the darkest place
Away from the Sun
That shines to light the way for me
To find my way back into the arms
That care about the ones like me
Yeah
And laid it right here for you
And I've tried so hard
That's the best that I can do
Please understand I am not who I was
You used to be all that I had
Now you're just not what I need
I've got to get over you and I know
Then I can get back to me
'Cause they don't wash away
All the things that we've been through
I've put behind me my share of the shame
We could call villains but it's all in vain
You used to be all that I had
Now you're just not what I need
I've got to get over you and I know
Then I can get back to me
All of my life I've waited hoping
Wanting you to see me the way that I am
Someone understands

I've got to get over you and I know
Then I can get back to me
Then I can get back to me
(Then I can get back to me)
To live the life that's in his dreams
At night he lies awake and he wonders
Why can’t that be me?
Cause in his life he's filled with all these good intentions
He’s left a lot of things he’d rather not mention right now
But just before he says goodnight
He looks up with a little smile at me and he says
If I could be like that
I would give anything
If I could be like that
What would I do?
What would I do?
Now and dreams we run
She spends her days up in the north park
Watching the people as they pass
And all she wants is just a little piece of this dream
Is that too much to ask?
On a quiet little street
All she wants is just that something to hold onto
That’s all she needs
Yeah

Falling in
Watching the stars on the big screen
Then he lies awake and he wonders
Why can’t that be me?

Falling in
Mothers staring down
She don't know where he's been
Or how long he's been out
'Cause I'm trying to be somebody
I'm not trying to be somebody else
This life is mine I'm living
Don't you know me? I won't ever let you down
The day has come
The sun is moving on
She don't know where he'll go

And I am my own
I'm trying to be somebody

Don't you know me?
I'm trying to be somebody

This life is mine I'm living
Don't you know me? I won't ever let you down
I'm not trying to be somebody else
Don't you know me? I won't ever let you down
I won't be nobody else
Then you got that look in your eye
There is something you've got to know
And you said it as you started to cry
I've been down the wrong road tonight
And I swear I'll never go there again
I've seen this face once before
And I don't think I can do this again
There's something I can't see
There's something different in the way you smile
Behind those eyes you lie
And there's nothing I can say
Cause I'm never gonna change your mind
Behind those eyes you hide
As you turned to walk away
I saw another look in your eye
And even though it hurt like it did
I couldn't let this be your goodbye
You say that you're sorry
And you say now that it hurts you the same
Is there something here to believe
Or is it just another part of the game?

That's ever gonna make you change your mind
Behind those eyes you hide
When this started out
That everything would turn out this way
First it was a phone call
Then it was another
From a mother who was ready to play
She said things that no one ever told me before
But how could I have known
That she wanted to settle a score
Then a man came in
I can finally see it
And it looks like you're having fun
But when I get back
You're gonna be bleeding
So I think son you better run
Now I think I should be leaving
Cause it looks like I’ve had enough
She was a deceiver but I had to believe her
When she told me she was in love
I knew I could fix it
In just another minute
But I guess it was a minute too late
I knew he was coming
And I should have been running
If he caught me I would never escape
Now I know it never should have been a surprise
But how could I have known
That she was only telling me lies

She was a deceiver but I had to believe her
When she told me she was in love
Don't blame me
It's not my fault
Don't blame me
I'm not the one
Cause a man came in
I thought you were leaving
But I see you're still having fun
Now I’m back and you're gonna be bleeding
So I think son you better run
Now I see I should be leaving
Cause it looks like I’ve done enough
She was a deceiver but I had to believe her
When she told me she was in love
They built this world and I have come
For a cryin' shoulder
This could be the last time
You will stand by my side
Will you fly with me this evening?
They carved my body not of stone
A pretty maze of emptiness
This could be the last time
You will stand by my side
Will you fly with me this evening?

But I don't know where I am
I wish that I could move
But I'm exhausted and nobody understands how I feel
I'm trying hard to breathe now
But there's no air in my lungs
There's no one here to talk to
And the pain inside is making me numb
I try to hold this under control
They can't help me because no one knows
I'm feeling weak and weary
Walking through this world alone
Cuts me to the bone
I've got something to say
But now I've got nowhere to turn
It feels like I've been buried underneath
All the weight of the world

I try to hold this under control
They can't help me because no one knows
I'm blind and shaking
Bound and breaking
I hope I make it through all these changes
God I feel so frustrated lately
Stand the heroes waiting for your cries
So many times you did not bring this on yourself
When that moment finally comes
I'll be there to help
On that day when you need
Your brothers and sisters to care
I'll be right here
Citizen soldiers
Holding the light for the ones that we guide
From the dark of despair
Standing on guard for the ones that we sheltered
We'll always be ready
Because we will always be there
When there are people crying in the streets
When they're starving for a meal to eat
When they simply need a place to make their beds
Right here underneath my wing
You can rest your head

Citizen soldiers
Holding the light for the ones that we guide

Standing on guard for the ones that we sheltered

Because we will always be there
There... there... there...
Hope and pray that you'll never need me
But rest assured I will not let you down
I'll walk beside you but you may not see me
The strongest among you may not wear a crown
On that day when you need
Your brothers and sisters to care
I'll be right here
On that day when you don't have the strength
For the burden you bear
I'll be right here
Citizen soldiers
Holding the light for the ones that we guide
From the dark of despair
Standing on guard for the ones that we sheltered
We'll always be ready
Now you're here  and my head lays
Beside your body  pillowed under mine
You were poison  spinning 'round my mind
Welcome to my world she said
Do you feel alive? she said
It's all a bad dream spinning in your lonely head
Welcome to my world she said
Separated world  she stayed separated
Down poison  down poison
Body withered  body died
Time to take away this life
Bad enough to die from one  not to mention four or five
Welcome to my world she said
Do you feel alive? she said
It's all a bad dream spinning in your lonely head
Welcome to my world she said
Separated world  she stayed separated
Down poison  down poison

Welcome to my world she said
Do you feel alive? she said
It's all a bad dream spinning in your lonely head
Welcome to my world she said
Separated world  she stayed separated
Down poison  down poison
Just because I have nothing to give
So you call this your free country
Tell me why it costs so much to live
Tell me why
This world can turn me down
But I won’t turn away (oh no)
I won’t turn around
All my work and endless measures
Never seem to get me very far
Walk a mile just to move an inch now
Even though I'm trying so damn hard
I'm trying so hard
This world can turn me down
But I won’t turn away
And I won’t duck and run
'Cause I'm not built that way
When everything is gone
There is nothing there to fear
This world cannot bring me down
No  'cause I'm already here

Down on my knees

I must have told you a thousand times
I'm not running away

No  I won't pass away
This world can turn me down
But I won’t turn away
And I won’t duck and run

When everything is gone
There is nothing there to fear
This world cannot bring me down
No  'cause I'm already here
This world can turn me down
But I won’t turn away
And I won’t duck and run
'Cause I'm not built that way
When everything is gone
There is nothing there to fear
This world cannot bring me down
That you're here with me
Close my eyes and remember every breath
Every memory
Through all these sleepless nights alone
I still feel you
Across these miles away from home
That I'll never get used to
A part of me with you
Every time you go
I feel it in my soul
When you were in my arms
Every time you go
Every time you go
I count the days until you're back again
Back here by my side
Something in me dies
I hear your voice over the phone
And God I miss you
Still all these miles away from home
That I'll never get used to

When you were in my arms
Every time you go
Every time you go
Every time you go
You were in my arms
Every time you go
She laid her body down
The damned walked in beside her
And he laid his money down
He said don't try to scream now
But I want this one to hurt
I'm gonna get my money's worth
He said they never listen
She said they'd never understand
That I don't this for pleasure
I just do it cause I can
I swear I didn't want to
And I swear I didn't know
That things like this could happen
To a 17-year old
And I've bundled up all of these fears inside
And I've bottled up all of this pain
And no one or nothing can take this away
But I won't let it happen again
Never again
In the haze of a smoky room
He chokes that bottle down
It's been a month since her saw her face
Underneath the blood stained gown
He thinks about that little girl
And the one he has at home
Walking down that road alone?

Maybe I'm just crazy or the devil got inside
And I've bundled up all of these fears inside
And I've bottled up all of this pain
And no one or nothing can take this away
But I won't let it happen again
'Cause I don't care this time
Don't tell me what to believe
'Cause you won't be there
To catch me when I fall
But you'll need me when I'm not here at all
I'm going down in flames
I'm going down in flames
I'm falling into this again
Don't tell me how life is
'Cause I don't really want to know
Don't tell me how this game ends
'Cause we'll just see how it goes
Catch me when I fall
Or you'll need me when I'm not here at all
I'm going down in flames

All the way
All the way down here
I'm falling down again
But now I can't 'cause you're not here but you're always on my mind
All these things I ask myself and I don't know why
(When it's the first time)
When is the first time that you'll never see someone again?
(When it's the last time)
When it's the last time you weren't ready for it to end?
When will I leave you standing alone there in the dark?
(It's never easy)
When it's the first time that you'll never see someone again?
When it's the last time you weren't ready for it to end?
When will I leave you standing alone there in the dark?
And I hope this will heal in time 'cause I can't go on like this
And right now I would give my life for one last kiss

Looking for a brand new way to fall down
It's no surprise that things gotten worse
And I thank God you never let me drown
But I didn't have to lie to myself for so long
I didn't have to let myself get so far gone
I didn't have to make the ones I love feel so alone
I didn't have to die to go to heaven
I just had to go home
While I was having the time of my life
I think my soul died a little every day
I always called to say I'm sorry
You said it's okay
But you should be through it all
You never walked away
But I didn't have to lie to myself for so long
I didn't have to let myself get so far gone
I didn't have to make the ones I love feel so alone
I didn't have to die to go to heaven
I just had to go home

Into the arms of my angel
Into the peace I left behind
All I had to do to save my own life
Was to look into your eyes
But I didn't have to lie to myself for so long
I didn't have to let myself get so far gone
I didn't have to make the ones I love feel so alone
I didn't have to die to go to heaven (to find my angel)
But I didn't have to lie to myself for so long
I just had to go home
I just had to go home
‘Cause I’m not doing so good without you
The things I thought you’d never know about me
Were the things I guess you always understood
So how could I have been so blind for all these years?
Guess I only see the truth through all this fear
And living without you
And everything I have in this world
And all that I’ll ever be
It could all fall down around me
Just as long as I have you
Right here by me
I can’t take another day without you
And to be back in your arms where I belong
Sorry I can’t always find the words to say
But everything I’ve ever known gets swept away
Inside of your love

Sorry I can’t always find the words to say
But everything I’ve ever known gets swept away
Inside of your love
And everything I have in this world
And all that I’ll ever be
It could all fall down around me
Just as long as I have you
Right here by me
And everything I have in this world
And all that I’ll ever be
It could all fall down around me
Just as long as I have you
Since the last time that I saw your pretty face
A thousand lies have made me colder
And I don't think I can look at this the same
But all the miles that separate
Disappear now when I'm dreaming of your face
But you're still on my lonely mind
And I dream about you all the time
But you're still with me in my dreams
The miles just keep rolling
As the people leave their way to say hello
I've heard this life is overrated
But I hope that it gets better as we go
But you're still on my lonely mind
And I dream about you all the time
But you're still with me in my dreams

Yeah
And then they sent me on my way
I left my love and forgot my dreams
I lost them along the way
Those little things you say
When words mean so much
You never back down
And they all shy away
You always listen to me
And what do I get to get me through these sleepless nights?
And what do I have to hold when no one's there to hold me tight?
And what do I see?
The only thing that gets me through
This is what I feel and I feel you
And this ain't no bed of nails
But they're not roses just the same
That'll take me further from my home

And what do I see?
The only thing that gets me through
That's when she comes alive
Ooh ooh
Maybe it's just something that you can only see in the light
Ooh ooh
A pretty little vixen dancing out on the scene
Don't get too close
Or you'll never feel the same way again
If everything you see is what you're believing
Then she'll be holding your heart
And by the time the sun goes down
You won't know who you are
She likes to do it in the dark
Ooh ooh
Just when you think it's all over
It's where it all starts
It sounds like an angel is calling my name
And all her moves won't let you get away

But she had you from the start
And by the time the sun goes down
You won't know who you are
She likes to do it in the dark
She likes to do it in the dark
Oh
Searching for one thing
And I know it has to be there somewhere
All this room without knowing
The way this is going
As long as it takes me anywhere
There's life and there's one dance
There's fate and there's one chance
To find out who I want to be
And I know it's inside of me
I look to the far side
Searching for daylight
And loving in hindsight
That won't work for my life
Let me forget all that went wrong
There's life and there's one dance
There's fate and there's one chance
To find out who I want to be
And I know it's inside of me
There's love in so much more
That waits behind that door
There's so much that I want to see

And I know it's inside of me

And never mind the pain you've put me through
'Cause every little thing you say
And every little thing you do
It makes me doubt all of this
What are you waiting for?
Look what you did
Is this who you wanted me to be?
Look what you did
Is this how you wanted it to be?
This life you gave away
Was meant for me
Forget about the trip that you've been on
Or so it seems
Never mind the lies that you told my tears
'Cause every little thing you said
And every little thing you did
You made me doubt all of this
Is that what you're waiting for?

I don't know how I can face this pain
I'll keep it inside so you can't see
I don't think I can go on this way
And how life was
Just you and me lovin' all of our friends
Living life like an ocean
But now the current's only pulling me down
It's getting harder to breathe
It won't be too long and I'll be going under
Can you save me from this?
This could be the end of me
And everything I know
I look ahead to all the plans that we made
And the dreams that we had
I'm in a world that tries to take 'em away
'Cause all this time I've just been too blind to understand
What should matter to me
It's what we believe in

And everything I know
Oh-oh
There might be more than you believe
There might be more than you believe
And there might be more than you can see
But I won't go
When you don't know where you've been?
You hide the shame that you're not showing
And you won't let anyone in
A crowded street can be a quiet place
When you're walking alone
And now you think that you're the only
One who doesn't
Have to try
And you won't have to fail
If you're afraid to fly
Then I guess you never will
You hide behind your walls
Of maybe nevers
Forgetting that there's something more
Than just knowing better
Your mistakes do not define you now
They tell you who you're not
You've got to live this life you're given
Like it's the only one you've got

Have to try
And you won't have to fail
If you're afraid to fly

Forgetting that there's something more
Than just knowing better
Your mistakes do not define you now
They tell you who you're not
You've got to live this life you're given
Like it's the only one you've got
What would it take
To get you to say that I'll try
And what would you say if
This was the last day of your life
You hide behind your walls
Of maybe never's
Forgetting that there's something more
Than just knowing better
Your mistakes do not define you now
They tell you who you're not
You've got to live this life you're given
Like it's the only one you've got
You hide behind your walls
Of maybe nevers
Forgetting that there's something more
Than just knowing better
Your mistakes do not define you now
They tell you who you're not
You've got to live this life you're given
I left my body lying somewhere in the sands of time
But I watched the world float to the dark side of the moon
I feel there's nothing I can do  yeah
I watched the world float to the dark side of the moon
After all  I knew it had to be something to do with you
I really don't mind what happens now and then
As long as you'll be my friend at the end
If I go crazy then will you still call me Superman?
If I'm alive and well  will you be there a holding my hand?
I'll keep you by my side with my superhuman might
Kryptonite
You called me strong  you called me weak
But still  your secrets I will keep
You took for granted all the times I never let you down
You stumbled in and bumped your head
If not for me  then you'd be dead
I picked you up and put you back on solid ground

As the plane was touching down
And all I could think about was Monday
Maybe I'd be back around
If this keeps me away much longer
I don't know what I would do
You've got to understand it's a hard life
That I'm going through
And when the night falls in around me
I don't think I'll make it through
I'll use your light to guide the way
'Cause all I think about is you
And New York is getting kind of cold
I keep my head from getting lazy
I just can't wait to get back home
And all these days I spend away
I need your love to hold me up
When it's all too much to bear

Being someone else
I tried to kill the pain
Nothin' ever helped
I left myself behind
Somewhere along the way
Hoping to come back around
To find myself someday
Just let me be myself
So I can shine with my own light
Let me be myself
Would you let me be myself
I'll never find my heart
Behind someone else
I'll never see the light of day
Living in this cell
It's time to make my way
Into the world I knew
Take back all of these times
That I gave in to you

Would you one time...oooh
Let me be myself
But one more lie could be the worst
And all these thoughts are never resting
And you're not something I deserve
This world falls on me
And this seems real to me
I'm torn between this life I lead and where I stand
So let me go
Let me go
I dream ahead to what I hope for
And I turn my back on loving you
How can this love be a good thing
When I know what I'm goin' through
This world falls on me
And this seems real to me

So let me go
Just let me go
Wander closer to the edge
Nothing valued think no fear
Always wondering why you're here
All your purposes are gone
Nothing's right and nothing's wrong
Nothing ventured  nothing gained
Feel no sorrow  feel no pain
Kiss me while I'm still alive
Kill me while I kiss the sky
Let me die on my own terms
Let me live and let me learn
Now I'll follow my own way
And I'll live on to another damn day
Freedom carries sacrifice
Remember when this was my life
Looking forward  not behind
Everybody's got to cross that line
Free me now to give me a place
Keep me caged and free the beast
Falling faster  time goes by
Fear is not seen through these eyes
What there was will never be
Now I'm blind and cannot see

Someday I will find
A love that flows through me like this
This will fall away
This will fall away
You're getting closer
To pushing me off of life's little edge
'Cause I'm a loser
You're getting closer
You're holding the rope and I'm taking the fall
'Cause I'm a loser
This is getting old
I can't break these chains that I hold
My body's growing cold
There's nothing left of this mind or my soul
Addiction needs a pacifier
The buzz of this poison is taking me higher
And this will fall away
This will fall away

And did I ever tell you differently?
I tried to give you all that you deserved
And never mind the things you said to me
Along the way I didn't say all the things I felt inside myself
You took away all that I thought was mine
And then you gave it all to someone else
You said you only wanted love
But love wasn't enough
So soon enough you said goodbye
But goodbye only reminded me
Of all that I can see
And I can see your love was a lie
Everybody told me I was crazy
But you told me to believe your lies
Guess I was hoping that your love might save me
But I think I died a thousand times
I never knew this side of you
The side that I wish I had never seen
Soon enough I guess I would discover I had a lover that could be so mean

Need some time for myself
I’ll give you anything that you want me to
But I don't have the time  so I’ll get up with you
There's too much of you  but there's not enough of me
There's not enough of me
Same old song  world moves on while I’m still in bed
Meet tomorrow today just to get ahead
Jump the gun on the run
I’m the only one who thinks I’m falling behind

He spills his heart on a page and
He watches words flow away then
His feelings lie on the page alone
There waiting
For someone who cares to read them
To open their eyes to see them
To see if they can make his thoughts their own
To find out that maybe your life's not perfect
Maybe it's not worth what he gives away
You can see that this broken soul is bleeding
So you concede your feelings inside yourself
And wander through my heart
Letting you see through me
Now only consumes me
What happens to a soul when
It's trapped inside his emotions
And all of these words he's spoken
They bind him to the life he's left behind
And every new step he takes he
Knows that he might not make it
To all of these dreams that he has yet to find

As I fall apart
You can see that this broken soul is bleeding
So you concede your feelings inside yourself
And wander through my heart
Letting you see through me
Now only consumes me
Forget your pain and watch me fall apart
'Cause I can't leave behind all these things that I knew
They're all gone
And I've lost track
Of all the ones I loved and turned my back
Inside myself the words I say
It couldn't be the truth when lies got in the way
But tomorrow will be a brand new day
And I hope that it brings the chance that I forgot to take
And I know there's so much I can be
If I can be strong enough to throw away these weak pieces of me
These tired eyes and hollow skin
They remind me of the places that I've been
It feels like I'm living inside my own ghost
But tomorrow will be a brand new day
And I hope that it brings the chance that I forgot to take
And I know there's so much I can be

And killing time while I'm there
On too many people and too many things
And it makes me feel like hell
You have gone as I can see
And all of this she says to me
There's too many questions
And too many strings
And they won't keep their self tied
On a roller coaster ride
It feels like I'm lying next to a ghost at night
I don't know why I gave you my heart
Cause sometimes it feels so wrong
But despite of all this weather
I know why we are together
And I swear right now
I'm right where I belong
I know I get a little bit crazy
But I never done you no wrong

There’s too much pressure and I'm bent
I've got no time to move ahead
Have you heard one thing that I’ve said
And all these little things in life
They all create this haze
There’s too many things to get done
And I’m running out of days
And I can’t last here for long
I feel this current it’s so strong
It gets me further down the line
It gets me closer to the light
And all these little things in life
They all create this haze

I can’t see through this haze
My friend tell me why it has to be this way
There’s too many things to get done
She knows what she says will change everything
She's laid through so many sleepless nights
Mother  that man took my soul away
Father  how could you ever treat me this way?
Brother  don't ever let him do this again
This time it’s over  I’m gonna make it end
Now it’s over and the old man is dead
Lying on the ground  bullet in his head
She stood at the foot of the guilty bed last night
She held what could set her free for the rest of her life
She did all that she said that she planned to do
Mother  that man took my soul away
Father  how could you ever treat me this way?

She just keeps it bundled up
And never lets it show
She can't take much more of this
But she can't let it go
All the things she says
While he's just lying there
Without someone to hear her cry
She slips off into a dream
About a place to hide
This love she feels
Everything she's ever known
Or ever thought was real
Seems like it's been thrown away
Now how's she gonna live
Those words he never spoke
Of all the times before
She tried to show him love
While he would only ask for more

Now how's she gonna live
A brand new morning shines
As she wakes up alone again
This time to face the day
She swears there's time to make it
As she simply walks away
 would you still know me?
 would you hold me
 I can’t let you go
 would you still follow me?
 would you love me tomorrow? Please?
 I can’t let you go
 can't let you go
I don't tend to wear them well
But I own scars that show and they've got a story to tell
I bite my lip and walk away
And I know what I should say
There's so much on my mind
But you don't want to hear it
If you could see me on the other side
You might find me fighting for my life
But I'm still alive
This little high we're on
It ain't for the weak at heart
We've got a role to play
And I'm gonna play my part
I felt the stone that burns
I've held it in my hands
I threw it all away
Cause I never could kill it

Where the hell we are?
Another night I feel it come to life
How could this go so far?
The life I love is the one I lead
It gets crazy but that's fine by me
'Cause I don't see the day
When I run all night
But I’ve got to say there's no other way
'Cause I’m having the time of my life
The words you sing bring back memories
Of so many days that have gone
I look back and smile at those forgotten miles
And laugh at all that went wrong
What I am is what I want
And I’ll be this way 'til I’m dead and gone

And it's been so long lord since I’ve been home
A handful of memories  some still seem clear
A few regrets  a couple of melodies  that remind me of you
I could say that I won't miss this  but that wouldn't be the truth
There's no one here to blame  and this is the only way
There's nothing left for us  to say
It's time to let you go  it's what we have to do
It's time to give this up  I think that we both knew
There's nothing left to say  there's nothing left to prove
And now it's time to turn and walk away from
What's left of me and you
What's left of me and you
Box of letters  that old t-shirt  still brings me back to you

A few pictures  two tickets
From a trip we took last year
A handful of memories
There's secrets in this life that I can't hide
But somewhere in this darkness
There's a light that I can't find
Or maybe I'm just blind
Or maybe I'm just blind
So hold me when I'm here
Right me when I'm wrong
Hold me when I'm scared
And love me when I'm gone
Everything I am and everything in me
Wants to be the one you wanted me to be

Even if I could
I'd give up everything
If only for your good

They all say that I don't know what I am doing
I say they don't hardly understand
Why can't they remember
What I'll never forget
How these dreams can come undone
When you're young
You give what you give 'cause they make you
Trapped inside a place that won't take you
And they want you to be what they make you
It's already over and done
When you're young

Everything's OK (everything's OK)

And now I'm falling in
There's so many things this weary soul can't take
Maybe you just caught me by surprise
The first time that I looked into your eyes
There's a life inside of me that I can feel again
It's the only thing that takes me where I've never been
I don't care if I lost everything that I have known
It don't matter where I lay my head tonight
Your arms feel like home
Feel like home
This life ain't the fairytale we both thought it would be
But I can see your smiling face as it's staring back at me
I know we both see these changes now
I know we both understand somehow
There's a life inside of me that I can feel again
It's the only thing that takes me where I've never been
