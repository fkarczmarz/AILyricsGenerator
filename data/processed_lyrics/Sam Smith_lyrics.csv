"You found the one  you found the one
I think I can finally face that
I'm not the one  never was the one
God  I dodged a bullet
I ran fast right through it
I love myself too much to fight you
You found the one  another one
You found the one  another one
You found the one  another one
Honestly  I'm happy for you
I do not wish you no harm
I met your boyfriend  he's beautiful
Please treat him like he's someone
Someone perfect  someone so divine
Someone special  someone good inside
I don't want him to hurt like me
Just please treat him like he's someone
You found the one  you found the one
I think I can finally face that
I'm not the one  never was the one
God  I dodged a bullet
I ran fast right through it
I love myself too much to fight you
You found the one  another one

Move through him like water
Love stains on the sun
Don't say I didn't warn ya
You'll never be enough
Move through him like water
Love stains on the sun
Don't say I didn't warn ya
You'll never be enough
You found the one  you found the one
I think I can finally face that
I'm not the one  never was the one
God  I dodged a bullet
I ran fast right through it
I love myself too much to fight you
When you put the phone down  I began to cry
What are you to do when the person that you love just says no?
So I'm gonna play my favourite rhythm
Gotta get you out my system
I would do anything to keep you off my mind
I'm gonna have to call my sisters
Be around the ones who listen
Anything to drown you out tonight
Baby  you make me crazy
Why'd you have to fill my heart with sorrow?
Save me  make it all hazy
So I don't think about you 'til tomorrow
It wasn't enough  but you could've had the guts to face me
It would have meant so much if you'd looked me in the eye
Oh  why do I always fall for the ones who have no courage?
I must see some kind of beauty in their lies

Such a burden  this flame on my chest
No insurance to pay for the damage
Yeah  I've been burnin' up since you left
I've been smokin'  oh  more than twenty a day
Blame it on rebellion  don't blame it on me
Wish I was younger back to the nineteenth of May
I had an open mind  swore to never change
Funny how time goes by
Had respect for myself  that river ran dry
You reached a limit  I wasn't enough
It's like the fire replaced all the love
I've been burnin'  yes  I've been burnin'
Such a burden  this flame on my chest
No insurance to pay for the damage
Yeah  I've been burnin' up since you left
Oh  if you ever called  I will run straight back
Give you my forgiveness and the shirt off my back
No friends to turn to  yeah  I messed up that
Wish we could smoke again just for a day  oh

Have it all  rip our memories off the wall
All the special things I bought
They mean nothin' to me anymore
But to you  they were everything we were
They meant more than every word
Now I know just what you love me for (Mmm)
Take all the money you want from me
Hope you become what you want to be

Chasing bodies to fix the parts
I don't know how I reached this place
So far from heaven  so far from grace
Am I wrong to give in to the pressure?
'Cause I feel like the city's got the better of me
Oh  this casual love isn't what it seems
And I try to imagine something closer
And somebody who is good for me
I'm so tired of all this searching
Go home to nothing or stay out for more?
Give in to someone or lock down my door?
Or drown all my shadows  drown them like before?
I'm drowning shadows once more
The more I drink  the more I drown
If I'm not thinking  I won't get down
The more I rise above it all
The less I care about the fall

 You're dancing in the movies
 you take my breath and steal the things I know
 saving me from out of the cold
 my only direction
 mmm
 we fight like lions
 you take my breath and steal the things I know
 saving me from out of the cold
 my only direction
 oh
 my only direction
 my only direction
There's so much I really miss about you
And I haven't felt free without you
All of the memories feel like magic
All of the fighting seems so sweet
And you're the last thing that I need
So I lay a dozen roses
For the lover that I've lost
I stand by all my choices
Even though I paid the cost
I share them all with you
So I lay a dozen roses
You've been on my mind every single night
I can't visualize life without you
I've been tryin' to go a week without losing sleep
But there's something that I need to go through

When you're in California alone?
I won't lie to you
I could have given you more
But life got fast
Good things don't last anymore
Now and then you cross my mind
It takes me back to a sweeter time
But I let it go
I let you go
But I can't think of anyone else
Now my heart is broken and I'm crying on the floor
And every part of me hopes you walk through the door
And I can't love anyonе else

You can reach me by trail-way

You can reach me by caravan
Cross the desert like an Arab man
You can reach me by sailboat
Climb a tree and swing rope to rope
You can jump on a speedy colt
Cross the border in a blaze of hope
There are hills and mountains between us
Always something to get over
I need you closer
You can windsurf into my life
Take me up on a carpet ride
You can make it in a big balloon
But you better make it soon
You can reach me by caravan
Cross the desert like an Arab man
I had a dream in a panic you came running out
Too much of a good thing won't be good for long
Too much of a good thing won't be good anymore

I thought I wouldn't need to
I guess I read you wrong

It's time you realize
That in this world we've all been taught a lie
You think that women rule the world
All the things I've seen
This Ken has crossed the borderline
Six-pack and tight G-string
But I've been on that lay low
Strip clubs and dollar bills
Wall Street and dirty deals
Cars with dirty wheels

I choose me and I know that's selfish  love
You are a dream and I can't thank you enough
But I give another piece of me away
Every wakin' day that I'm with you
Am I a monster? What will your family think of me?
They brought me in  they helped me out with everything
But I give a little piece of me away
Every single day
So I pick up the pieces  I get on the midnight train
I got my reasons  but darlin'  I can't explain
I'll always love you
But tonight's the night I choose to walk away
Bah-bah  doo  bah-bah  doo
Bah-bah  doo  bah-bah  doo
Love you so much that I have to let you go
I'll miss your touch and the secrets we both know
But it would be wrong for me to stay
And I'll just give you hope
