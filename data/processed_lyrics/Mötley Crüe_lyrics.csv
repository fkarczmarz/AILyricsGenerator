"Do you want to bleed?
Do you
Do you want to live in pain?
(Pain)
(It's only life)
She's so afraid to kiss
And so afraid to laugh
Is she running from her past?
(It's only life)
She's so afraid of love
And so afraid of hate
What's she running from now?
Do you
Do you want to scream?
Do you want to face the strange?
Do you
Do you believe?
Are you
Are you afraid of change?
(Change)

She's so afraid of this
And so afraid to ask
She hides behind her mask
(It's only life)
But she's so afraid of pain
So afraid of blame
It's driving her
(Insane)
So insecure
There is no cure
She's so afraid of death
The drama in her head
Gettin' louder all the time
Gettin' louder all the time
Been so afraid of fame
It's drivin' her insane
Drivin' her insane
Drivin' her insane
(Drivin' her insane)
The reason that I can't sleep
You say illegal
I try like hell but I'm out of control
All in the name of  all in the name of rock and roll
All in the name of rock
All in the name of rock and roll
All in the name of rock
For sex and sex I'd sell my soul
All in the name of  all in the name of rock
Pretty  pretty so innocent
She says you ain't seen nothing yet
Brings me a dirty  dirty magazine
There she was for all the world to see  oh yeah
I try like hell but I'm out of control

Says to me  Daddy
Can I have some candy?
Want to be your nasty
Anytime you want
You know you can have me
All in the name of  all in the name of rock and roll
All in the name of rock
All in the name of rock and roll  all in the name of rock
I tattooed her and now she's mine
I'll make the toast  you raise the glass
Just a few words to kick the world in the ass
Round and round the town  the same old story is told
Better lock up your daughter when the Motley's hit the road
We're innocent in every way
Like apple pie and Chevrolet
Sweeter pies with different shapes
38  28  38
In and out of town  alibis fit like a glove
Tell your daddy not to thank us  honey  you're a labor of love
We do the bad boy boogie
Bad is bad
Bad boy boogie
Bad is bad
I got my finger in the pie  my hand in the cookie jar
It's just a lick and a promise in the back seat of my car
There's a method to the madness
We never kiss and tell
Have a drink on the boys
We'll entertain you in style

You're not gonna fuck with me
I've been waiting for this day so long
You run around and chase the clouds
I only want you to be yourself
As you can see
Your mother gave birth to you with love inside
She had candlelight and songs of life
I only want you to be yourself
We'll always be one
 custom pink  now pay the price
 well  damn she's hot
 well  she's cool and clean
 she's a leather tease
 well  she can't be stopped
 watch her suck you clean

 well  damn she's hot
 no
 oh-oh-oh  oh-oh

 ow!
My bones can't take this ache
If you dance with the devil
Your day will come to pay
Downtown
Fuel-injected dreams
Are busting at the seams
Am I in Persia
Or am I just insane?
One foot in the grave
Such a foolish child
For a date with death
Sign the dotted line
I've been through Hell
And I'm never going back

Romancin' the past

I engrave my veins with style

Walking the streets
Never looked back
So we took our dreams
Ran like hell
Lived our youth
From the wishing well
Me and the boys
Made a pact
To live or die
No turning back
Scarred for life
Then my best friend died
Lost my mind
Made me hate
I'm a wildcat
A shotgun blast
Madman
We're strong as steel
Overkill

My motorcycle and a switchblade knife
Handful of grease in my hair feels right
But what I need to make me tight are those
Long legs and burgundy lips
Dancing down on Sunset Strip
On Halloween and New Years Eve
But they're the best when they're off their feet
At the Dollhouse in Fort Lauderdale
Rocking in Atlanta at Tattletale
Raising hell at the Seventh Veil

Left all alone

But in time  the nations grew weak
And our cities fell to slums while evil stood strong
In the dusts of hell lurked the blackest of hates

Dressed in black on black
She's got a Filipino girlie
She claims is her friend
Now I used to call her Cindy
She changed her name to Sin
I guess that's the name of her game
It's got to be a sexual thing
Now all around the world

Introduced me to her lover
In a cellophane dress
Then they bid me a sweet farewell
Last time I saw them
They were kissing so softly
To the sound of wedding bells
