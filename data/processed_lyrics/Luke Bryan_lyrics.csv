lyrics
"My clothes thrown everywhere
Woke up in my rocking chair
Holding a beer in my hand
Sporting a neon tan
My stereo cranked up
I can't find my truck
How'd I get home from the club
Ain't got a clue what went down
So I started calling around
And all my friends say
I started shooting doubles
When you walked in
All my friends say
I went a little crazy
Seeing you with him
You know I don't remember a thing
But they say I sure was raising some cain
Getting over you comeback kid
Yay I must have did
What all my friends say

I found my billfold
I cried oh no no
Good time Charlie got me now I'm broke
But it was worth acting like a fool
Yeah girl I must have really showed you
Cause all my friends say
I started shooting doubles
When you walked in
All my friends say
I went a little crazy
Seeing you with him
You know I don't remember a thing
But they say I sure was raising some cain
Getting over you comeback kid
Yay I must have did
What all my friends say
I was Elvis rocking on the bar
Working the crowd pouring out my heart
And all my friends say
I started shooting doubles
When you walked in
All my friends say
I went a little crazy
Seeing you with him
You know I don't remember a thing
But they say I sure was raising some cain
Getting over you comeback kid
Yay I must have did
What all my friends say
 watching you walk away
 we tried it all
 we been a lot of things
 we ain't never been
 we ain't never been bad lovers
 we can laugh it off
 under covers
 we might not string all the good times together
 we ain't never been
 we ain't never been bad lovers
 baby
 ain't nothing like you
 I'll be kissing on your lips
 the rest is history
 we ain't never been
 we ain't never been bad lovers
 we can laugh it off
 under covers
 we might not string all the good times together
 we ain't never been
 we ain't never been bad lovers
 we ain't never been
 we ain't never been bad lovers
 we ain't never been
 we ain't never been bad lovers
 we can laugh it off
 under covers
 we ain't never been
 we ain't never been
 we ain't never been bad lovers
Full of wooden toys and trucks and painted trains
Of a kid beside a soldier smiling away
Could you build me a daddy?
Strong as Superman
Make him ten feet tall with a southern drawl
And a crooked smile if you can
'Cause I sure miss him
Maybe you could bring him back
If you could build me a daddy
He promised me he'd teach me how to aim
I know he'd never wanna miss a game
So here's a little money that I've saved
Could you build me a daddy?
Strong as Superman
Make him ten feet tall with a southern drawl
And a crooked smile if you can
I sure miss him
Maybe you could bring him back

You know you've got everybody lookin'
I got a little boom in my big truck
Gonna open up the doors and turn it up
Gonna stomp my boots in the Georgia mud
Gonna watch you make me fall in love
Get up on the hood of my daddy's tractor
To watch you do your thing
Shake it for the young bucks sittin' in the honky-tonks
For the rednecks rockin' 'til the break of dawn
The DJ spinnin' that country song
Shake it for the catfish swimmin' down deep in the creek
For the crickets and the critters and the squirrels

Somebody's sweet little farmer's child
With a gattle in her Bud to get a little wild
Pony tail and a pretty smile
Rope me in from a country mile
So come on over here and get in my arms

Tangle me up like grandma's yarn
Shake it for the young bucks sittin' in the honky-tonks
For the rednecks rockin' 'til the break of dawn

Now dance like a dandelion
Move like the river flows
Feel the kick drum down deep in your toes
All I wanna do is get to holdin' you and get to knowin' you
And get to showin' you and get to lovin' you 'fore the night is through

Hell  we can all go raise some hell on any other night
Your hair  is it pulled up or fallin' down?
Oh  I just have to see it now
You don't have to worry 'bout it  baby

Baby  you can crash my party anytime
Ain't a spot downtown that's rockin' the way that you rock me
Ain't a bar that can make me buzz the way that you do

And look down and see your face on my phone
And I'm gone so long  hang on

I could lean in to hold you
Or act like I don't even know you
Seems like you could care less either way
What happened to that girl I used to know?
I just want us back to the way we were before
Do I turn you on at all when I kiss you  baby?
Does the sight of me wantin' you drive you crazy?
Do I have your love? Am I still enough?
Give you everything that you ever wanted?

One fell out of the sky
We were sittin' in the light of the moon
I was watchin' it shine on you
Funny how time flies with a good girl
On a good night
We were down to 1 AM
Listenin' to one more song
Thinkin' I want more than just one night out here with you alone
Down to that last Bud Light
In the back of that two-tone half-ton
My heart was tellin' me that one more kiss and I'd be done
Down to one hand in mine
Down to one beautiful smile
I was done with the girl I want
Down to one
Said we'd leave in one more minute
'Cause you were lookin' like a dream I've been dreamin'
I was thinkin' 'bout anything but leavin'
Still feel that touch
You were in my arms
Soaking up that young love
Never been that far

I didn't know what to say
So I just hung up the phone
I took a walk to clear my head
This is where the walking lead
Can't believe you're really gone
Don't feel like going home
So I'm gonna sit right here
On the edge of this pier
Watch the sunset disappear
And drink a beer
Funny how the good ones go
Sometimes the greater plan
Is kinda hard to understand
Right now it don't make sense
I can't make it all make sense

Crunching on a pork rind when she pulled up
She had to be thinking this is where rednecks come from
She had Hollywood written on her license plate
She was lost and looking for the Interstate
Needing directions and I was the man for the job
I told her  Way up yonder past the caution lights
There's a little country store with an old coke sign
You gotta stop and ask Miss Bell
For some of her sweet tea
Then a left will take you to the Interstate
But a right will bring you right back here to me
I was sitting there  thinking about her pretty face
Kicking myself for not catching her name
I knew my old Ford couldn't run her down
She probably didn't like me anyhow
So I watched her disappear into a cloud of dust
I told her  Way up yonder past the caution lights
There's a little country store with an old coke sign

For some of her sweet tea
Momma gave her a big ole glass
And sent her right back here to me

So make it seven on seven
Do you want it on the rocks?

And we'll go shot for shot for shot

Ain’t gonna beg you to stay
Ain’t gotta ask you what’s wrong
Ain’t no reason running after something already gone
Take off your leavin' dress
Let’s do what we do best
I guess everybody’s got their way of moving on
Girl rest your head one more time in my bed
Love me like you loved me when you loved me
And you didn’t have to try
Let’s lay down tonight
And kiss tomorrow goodbye

These wheels need a two-lane

Boys like me need girls like you to kiss me
Fishin' in the Dark needs Nitty Gritty

Sweet tea needs that sugar stirrin'
Small town nights need both ends burnin'
Long weeks need a weekend
Cheap drinks need a-slingin'
That dance floor needs some me on you
And you on me tonight
Singalongs need to be sung
Tip bells need to be rung
Last calls need a call that cab
And backseats need I want you so bad

Not a word from you baby
It don’t leave my sight since we had that fight
Can’t remember but maybe
I blew you up
In the middle of the night again
You were drinking with your friends
You ignored it but you got it
I get so neurotic about it baby
‘Cause I know you’re reading your phone
I can’t help from going crazy
Thinking you might not be all alone
I feel the buzz in my truck
And I almost wreck it
I always got it on me
Just in case you want me
So  if you’re looking for my love
Then light it up
Every time I unlock my screen
I hope I see one of them red lipstick ‘I miss you’ pictures
I’m on your clock  you’re in control
You want me now baby go figure
My worlds at the tips of your fingers

He said  Son he's yours from now on
Bandit looked at me and he cocked his head
Slept at night on the foot of my bed
All that year  I can see him still
Chasing after me  nipping at my heels
Down to the bus stop  my new best friend
Still waiting right there when I got home again
And I thought we would be together
Go on and on just like that  forever
But I was young back then
I guess I just didn't know
Little boys grow up and dogs get old
He was my sidekick through thick and thin
And he'd bark at my fish when I'd reel 'em in
Summers came and went and we grew like weeds
And I don't know if I raised him or he raised me
And I thought we would be together

 I don't know about you
 get dirt on their hands
Packed a U-Haul cross a one-tree yard
To a tin roof shotgun house
Had a rocking little body with a yankee strut
With your long blonde hair all pulled up
Then you got in with some southern belles
Cut your jeans off with a rebel yell
Learned the talk of the Bible belt
It's like you've been waiting all week
Move like you do
All sexy and smooth
Like you love to
Legs and your hips

I leave my phone in the truck
I leave my truck at the road
My four-wheeler gets me where I wanna go
I leave the world behind
I pull my hat down low
I got an old Jon boat that I stowed down there
On them hot summer nights when I get a-wild hare
I got a moonshine stash in a cypress stump
And a catfish line going - bump bump
An old tractor tire where I sit by the fire
And drink to a sweet swamp song
When I dip my feet in that Muckalee Creek water
Daddy brought me down here when I was a kid
Taught me how to bait a craw fish basket
From the time I was old enough to walk
He had me running down squirrels and rabbits
I feel right at home in this neck of the woods
So let the stock market do what it's gonna do
Let the dollar go down and gas over the roof

It's a cutout picture of the 70's
When everything felt so free
It's yellow and a little bit of rust
Looking good for 42 years young
And it can still light up a backroad
It was built for a day like this
A clear blue sky and a white sand kiss
It's three on the tree and geared down for going slow

I was lookin' for her boyfriend
Tryin' to pour a little sugar in her Dixie cup
Talkin' over the speakers in the back of that truck
She jumped up and cut me off
I've been listenin' to the radio all night long
Sittin' 'round waitin' for it to come on and here it is
Spinnin' me around 'til it faded out
And she gave me a kiss
I'da gave that DJ my last dime
If he would have played it just one more time
But a little while later

Before I walked her to the door

That I picked from the side of Thomas Drive
On our way to the sand
We found an old wooden chair
Still warm from the sun
And I was done
And we spent that week wide open
Upside down beside the ocean
I didn't know where it was goin'
Just tryin' to keep my heart on the tracks
I should've known that kind of feelin'
Would last longer than that week did
Blown away and barely breathin'
Sunday came and it was over
Now she's got me twisted
Like an old beach roller coaster
The rest of those days
Turned into long crazy nights
When the music got loud
We'd sneak away from the crowd
Under the boardwalk lights
And with all the things we said
What I just can't get past
Is the way we let it end
Now I'm wonderin' where she is
Knowin' I can't get that goodbye back

Nothing will ever be easy as you and me
Tangled up with nowhere to be
I turned those shutters the color of your eyes
'Til the day turned into night

Running bird dogs through the Georgia pines
Step side cover down in peanut dust

Did it come from your daddy and mama?
Were you converted by an Alabama song on the radio?
That feels so right
Did you lock eyes with a little green-eyed girl from Jackson?

Silver Queen corn in a backyard dirt
Waiting for the fall to finally come along
So I can grab my gun and get my outside on
Step side cover down in peanut dust
Just be proud of what makes you country
Might be from a city or a little farm town
Whatever kind of square that you drove around
Do you wear it on your sleeve or keep it deep down?
You know you gotta let it out
I got my dirt road cred back when I was twelve
On a no cab tractor hauling them bales
Running bird dogs through them Georgia pines
Step side cover down in peanut dust
And just be proud of what makes you country
Whatever makes you country
You do your kind of country
They doing they kind of country
I do my kind of country
She snaps her fingers and a drink comes
She locks you down with just one look
She's got this whole club undone
If she's on the rebound  you ain't gonna know it
Coming off a heartbreak  she ain't gonna show it
She wants my hands on her body
She wants to burn like she's made of fire
Said she ain't going home 'til we
Drink every drop of Kentucky dry
Don't even know what she'll do when she does it
Palm of her hand  I'm hers in the blink of an eye
She don't take no and I love
She gets what she wants
And I get to be what she wants tonight
I get to be what she wants tonight
I get to catch all her secrets
Sequins bouncing off flashing lights
If she wants it  then we're leaving
I get to be where she goes when she's lonely
The last door of the night she's closing
