lyrics
"Fame - you're claiming is the top of the world
This stage - I'm claiming is the top of the world
And love - I'm feeling when you people connect
I'm making plenty of friends and many of foes
Stopping me now is kinda serious
No use in dreading what they call Armageddon
I think we made it through the slump
But who really cares where we're heading?
'Cause now you motherfuckers got a reason to jump!
Hate -  a feeling I don't really get
And hate - can get you in some serious shit 
Time - is something that may change me
I've been stumbling through these thoughts
And about the fact that I could be delirious
Stopping me now is kinda serious

No use in dreading what they call Armageddon
I think we made it through the slump
But who really cares where we're heading?
'Cause now you motherfuckers got a reason to jump!
We see good things change and good things go away
We see good things waste and we taste - the pain
What we need is a place to escape from today
Right!
What we need is a place to escape from today
RIGHT!
Yeah!
Bring it on!                         Bring it on!

You wanna be down with the G shock
MC's detest me wanna chest to chest me
But I ain't all about that
You gotta be down with the G shock

Don't stop!
It's 9 teen 90 nine
To be the bad man
To be the sad man
Behind blue eyes
And no one knows what it's like
To be hated
To be faded
To telling only lies
As my conscience seems to be
My love is vengeance
That's never free
No one knows what it's like
To feel these feelings
Like I do
And I blame you
No one bites back as hard
On their anger
None of my pain and woe
Can show through

Maybe I could use some help
You gotta do it yourself!
Maybe life is up and down
I crawled up your butt somehow

Hey man  wake up and smell the concrete
Strange to see you've changed  like the LB
Could be identity crisis  but I can't buy this
Reality bites but that's what life is
Pitiful you  your hideous behavior
Hate what God gave ya  fakin' all the flavor
Artificial minds seekin' out the new trends
Get in where you fit in
Quit thinkin' like a has-been diggin' in my culture
I'ma let me let your punks know I'm an old school soldier
With the funk flow  a damn shame wanna change yourself

Filed as a counterfeit goin' down in
History as nothin' but a copy cat
So if you're fakin' that you're phat  you need a ballbat
Right where your head is at
All your desperation causes separation
Now I grab the mic to intimidate
Your weakness screams from the limp on your siren
Phonies get the hint quick smacked with the funk-flick
Pain for the fakers fame can't maintain
Because you're sick of yourself  well I'm sick of you too!

You disregarded your life
You disrespected your friends
You've even stolen your appearance
From hangin' around with my family
But I should have never dropped my guard
So you could stab me in the back
But you were freakin' me out

You wanna re-arrange your lifestyle  live like the wild child
With the vibe alive  you could lie to try and be so fly
A lie but you deny you're a fake!

To fix you wannabes that ruined all the music
But never mind  those phonies never get it

I'm constantly dwelling on how you got the best of me
Wanna know something I can't believe?
The way you keep testing me and mentally molesting me
Would you think any less of me if I said that I'd be there?
Would you think any less of me if I said I really cared?
You don't feel nothing at all
You don't feel nothing at all
Maybe there's more to life than it seems
I'm constantly running from reality chasing dreams
Wanna know something I can't believe?
Just how much misery comes with humility
Do you think any less of me now that I'm gone?
I can't seem to do anything right
But I figured out why you don't let me inside because

Often called by my alias  Polar Bear
Brain tied like the S&M freak shit
Cold like the ice you're servin' up my drinks with
Stick shift  fuck the automatic
Rollin' up in third gear  guess it's just a habit
And all you freaky bitches reachin' out to grab it
Don't hesitate  'cause you can have it  I'ma stab it
Demolition came to crush the mission
Just in time for you maniacs to listen
And it 'ain't nothin'  'cause don't think it's serious
My flow is cold like the weather in Siberia
I keep your head bobbin'  like a novelty
And all them turkey emcees wanna gobble me
But I'm a shark in my underground fish tank
And I don't give a shit what those motherfuckers think
B-Boy with a taste for the metal
A taste for a fine rhyme and I ain't gonna settle
If you don't like it  you can scratch up on these nuts  bitch
Polar Bear ain't a cracker you should fuck with

Momma went and bought a kid a mic  now he's rhymin'
And now he's hated  'cause everybody played it
But they're just hatin' 'cause I motherfuckin' made it

And all my boys get the pick of the litter

I'm homegrown  just a cackalacky mofo
A redneck who never had a dollar

Everything was getting better  I guess I'm just a fool strung out
What to do  my life is through
Just wanna kill myself for you
I wonder just how sympathetic you'll be
You've come to take me under and I've forgotten all about me
What to do  my life is through
Just wanna kill myself for you
So tell me why you say goodbye
And tell me why you're fucking up my whole life
Yeah  fucking up my whole life?
So I'm on my way  I'll leave today
If I get away  it'll be okay
It'll be okay
I'm looking out a window into a world that's taken you from me
And I'm feeling so disgusted  how pathetic can I possibly be?
What to do  my life is through
Just wanna kill myself for you
So tell me why you say goodbye
And tell me why you're fucking up my whole life
Yeah  fucking up my whole life?

That when it comes to cash  I've been gettin' smoked
Lendin' out my money  now I'm broke
Somebody's gettin' choked  'cause now it's time to pay the piper
Bums are the type of shit that's in a diaper
Don't make me have to call a sniper
And wipe your brains off my windshield wiper
You dirty bug  as soon as I get paid they come in masses
There's someone givin' classes on kissin' people's asses
Unless you're livin' where the trash is
Don't even come around here askin' where my cash is
Me? I'm broke!
Me? I'm broke!
I ain't no joke  I'll say it once again
And if I get provoked  there'll be knuckles on your chin
Some people never learn – borrowin' from me? You might regret it
For one  I ain't no bank and you got shitty credit
As soon as I get paid  they're comin' out the woodwork
Unless you're livin' where the trash is
But you're not  so find another spot where the cash is

When I reminisce  ignorance was bliss
Back in the days where the magic exist
Never be the same as it was  'cause the way it was
Just another day in the maze of a myth
Had a lot of fun livin' life on the run
Never had chance to pause to get a better glance
Everything was free and everything was fast
Never even thought it wouldn't last
When you got the mind of a man in the middle
Life is just a big fat riddle  so figure it out
Always thinkin' that you know every little thing there is to know
But you don't really know  you know?
It's like love  some people get it
For some it's just a glove that just never fitted
For me  it's just a pain in the ass
But I'm addicted to the taste of hopin' it could last
Another day  another night inside a lonely world
Another game  another fight inside a lonely world
Another wrong  another right inside a lonely world

Maybe I'm a target for people that are bitter
At least I can say that I've never been a quitter
It was like prison with bullies always puttin' me down
Just a little skater-boy they could pick on
I learned to forgive 'em  now I got the balls they can lick on
I loved sneakin' out when my mom was asleep
With my Gothic girlfriend makin' love in the creek
With the mind of a man in the middle
It could be the end of the world as we know it
Still  I never want it all and I never want it now
How the times files  even with the blink of an eye
When you're young  you absorb like a sponge in disguise
Then you get a little older and gather your thoughts
It's was amazing what you learn when you've never been taught  you know?

Got lost in Boston  lookin' for the tea party
Met a child molester in Worcester
I need a Kleenex every time I'm leavin' Phoenix
I get silly when I play in Philly
Limp Bizkit committee down in Kansas City
Never know what I'm in for when I'm play in Denver
Hard Rock don't stop down in Vegas
In Cincinnati the girls call me Daddy
And I probably ain't leavin' the next time I'm in Cleveland
Found my lucky coin in Des Moines
And spit on a boy named Tina in Pasadena
We get to swing from New Orleans  Fort Worth  and Dallas
We toast when we're tippin' up the Challis
What can I say? I can't name 'em all
So somebody  anybody  everybody
