lyrics
"Alone against the wall
Girls like you give it all so cold
Talking cheap in a bathroom stall
And you look so smooth
You better tell me the truth
Would you trade me
Out for someone cool?
I know you better than you do
So put out your cigarette
And kiss me on
The lips tonight
Me and you
You and me
Let's go back
Let's go back
1983 is calling
I've been on my knees and crawling
Back to you
It's coming all back to me
1983
I've got something that I've kept inside
And the blood is on the blade
You're there sucking on your lollipop
Like you haven't aged a day
And it ain't so pretty when you're playing cute
When your body's up against some fool
Does he feel it?
‘Cause I feel it
You might also like
Me and you
You and me
Let's go back
Let's go back
1983 is calling
I've been on my knees and crawling
Back to you
It's coming all back to me
1983
The year I was born
I won't be ignored
So get your feet on the floor
I'm the only one
Are you afraid?
I still make you move
Me and you
You and me
Let's go back to 1983
Me and you
You and me
Let's go back to 1983
Me and you
You and me
Let's go back
Let's go back
1983 is calling
I've been on my knees and crawling
Back to you
It's coming all back to me
1983
Me and you
You and me
Let's go back
Let's go back
1983 is calling
I've been on my knees and crawling
Back to you
It's coming all back to me
1983
1983
I get my way because I talk a big game
Eat me I'm American
Cause she's all American
I think her talk is cheap until she gets paid
Kiss me I'm American
Don't count me out
Don't you count me out
I won't be somebody's hero
Don't count me out
Don't you count me out
We're all American zeroes
I'm your zero
I got nothing but I love you
Isn't that enough to fill you up?
She goes to parties for a drug that is new
Cause she's all American
She's barely breathing in her red white and blue
Classically American
I need a miracle to change up my mood
Cause I'm all American
I'm scared of pills and guns and cheap fast food
Kill me I'm American

Isn't that enough to fill you up?
Gimme something to believe in
Do you have a reason
Why you never look me in the eye?
Gimme something to believe in
My body's losin' feelin'
My body's losin' feelin'
My body's losin' feelin'
I won't be somebody's hero
Don't count me out
Don't you count me out
I won't be somebody's hero
Don't count me out
Don't you count me out
We're all American zeroes
I'm your zero
I got nothing but I love you
I kinda wanna be more than friends
So take it easy on me
I'm afraid you're never satisfied
Here we go again
You're just a cannibal
And I'm afraid I won't get out alive
Take a bite of my heart tonight
What are you waiting for?
Say goodbye to my heart tonight
Here we are again
I feel the chemicals kickin' in
It's getting heavy and I wanna run and hide
I wanna run and hide
I do it every time
You're killin' me now
And I won't be denied by you
The animal inside of you

Say goodbye to my heart tonight
What are you waiting for?
I wanna be close to you
All we need now is the dark
Dancing shadows move on to white walls
I wanna be close to you
Heavy eyes been watching me
Rhythms beats and melodies
They make me get close to you
Other guys will sell you tricks
Tell you lies to get their fix
Don't let them get close to you
It'll burn all your fear away
It'll burn all your fear away
It'll burn all your fear away
It'll burn all your fear away
I still got my eyes on you baby

Enough to get by
I couldn't keep up with it
Third glass of wine
Hell of a life
Can you be my comeback hit?
I know my internet friends
They don't make sense in the end
I can't even hold their hand
Went off and you got me blocked
I think I'm callin' the cops
I probably should throw my phone away
Smoking sour diesel used to be illegal

Damaged my brain
No one left to blame
Reach out and touch my faith
Sweet to the taste
You know the thrill's in the chase
We live in a dangerous place
To all my internet friends
You don't make sense in the end
I sign off then lay in bed
Break in and you'd call the cops
I probably should throw my phone away
Smoking sour diesel used to be illegal
Look to all the positives
I'm lookin' desperate 'cause I can't get through to you
Everything is killing me
Everything is killing me now
Smoking sour diesel used to be illegal
I've found something I lost
On a Holy Roller channel asking me what's the cost
On a couch in a cold room
Pouring salt in my wounds
I'm a mistake faking truth holding liars' balloons
You've been asleep for days now
Living inside your dreams
You know that ain't no way to live or to handle such things
I wanna shake up your system
I wanna rattle your bones
I wanna take you to the stars and then I'll leave you alone
Now I'm overcome with fear
Mama get me out of here
I've gone farther down than I ever wanna go
Burning up the horizon
To the city skyline
In a faded aspiration only left in our minds
Let us shake up the system
Let's go and rattle their frames
Let's take the highest road away and avoid these trappings

Now I'm overcome with fear
Mama get me out of here
I've gone farther down than I ever wanna go
We stood out in the cold
Beg me to come back down
They beg me to come back down
Then the ground ate my legs
So I looked up the sky and said
I don't want to go back down
Now I'm overcome with fear
Mama get me out of here
I grew up scared to death
I'd never quite fit in
I was drinking way too much
But what else is there to do when everything around you sucks
Everybody on your knees and testify
I was searching for the truth
I think they misunderstood
Then things got wet and weird
And I woke up all paralyzed
I was shaken
I was nervous
You can go your way and I'll go mine
But it's us you're gonna miss

Everybody on your knees and testify
I was searching for the truth
I think they misunderstood
A little depressed
Why do we make things so complicated?
A little depressed?
Everybody on your knees and testify
I was searching for the truth
I think they misunderstood
Everything you want in this world
First things first
Get what you deserve
It began when I was twenty-one years old
And my mom and dad were begging me to go
So I left a note and we went and hit the road
Me and Chris and all the stuff I own
I went out to find my soul
And left the only comfort that I know
It wasn't about a girl or even California bleeding
It was all about me choosing where to go
And I sing
You are never gonna get
Everything you want in this world
First things first
Get what you deserve
You are never gonna get
Everything you want in this world
First things first
Get what you deserve

There were years I felt like everything was new
Long before the troubles of my youth
There were days and nights I couldn't see the end
And I swear the music was my only friend
You learn to lie about forgiveness
When you choose to let down all your pride
I don't wanna be so famous
I just want to sing until I die
So sing it
You are never gonna get
Everything you want in this world
First things first
Get what you deserve
You are never gonna get
Everything you want in this world
First things first
Get what you deserve
When I wish upon a star
I'll tell it how I got this far
It began when I learn how to face myself
And I'm still deciding if I'm something else
I'm a million different people all the time
But there's only one of me to get it right
You are never gonna get
Everything you want in this world
First things first
Get what you deserve
You are never gonna get
Everything you want in this world
First things first
Get what you deserve
You are never gonna get
Everything you want in this world
First things first
Get what you deserve
You are never gonna get
Everything you want in this world
First things first
You were wasted
Like a teenager in love
I felt your touch
It was naked
And I could not give you up
Suddenly the room
Started spinning around
I couldn’t wait for an answer
Fireworks and strobes
Bring our knees to the ground
Lean in close
And don’t let go
Well you started out a stranger
Foolish behavior
Brought us together tonight
Could have ran away scared
But somewhere out there
Foolish behavior seems right
You might also likeI don’t know if it’s good
I’m misunderstood
Most of my whole damn life
Well you started out a stranger
Foolish behavior
Brought us together tonight
A night like this
Every minute
Is a prelude to the show
Face to face
Get lost in it
Your eyes can tell me where to go
Suddenly the room
Is a big black and white
Just like a scene from a movie
Everything’s in slow motion
Flashing with light
You know how to rule me
Lean in close
And don’t let go
Think of the moment
Everything’s on
Now set it in motion
Before it’s gone
Well you started out a stranger
Foolish behavior brought us together
Tonight
Could have ran away scared
But somewhere out there
Foolish behavior seems right tonight
Think of the moment
Everything’s on
Now set it in motion
Like we're undercover
Like we're in our freshmen year
Like all the girls and boys in school
Our anticipation
And our bad behaving
It's like we learned our lesson
But conveniently forgot the rules
Questions for questions
I've got a question
Would you ever dance with me like that?
Questions for questions
I've got a question
Would you ever dance with me like that?
I don't want your lover
Like my younger brother
He's patronized another
But I think it's serious this time
I don't want you fading
Acting like you hate me

That cut you in the coldest spots

I've been trapped in my own thoughts
I woke up and summer's gone
So where the hell are we goin'? (Oh)
I just always wanted you to be my lifesaver
I think I'm going through something
I'm not going home
But I know it's gonna kill me dead
I think I'm going through something
Think I'm going through something
We don't talk
We're just sweeping it all under the rug
I woke up and winter's done
So where the hell are we goin'?

But you don't mean these conversations get boring
You turn and ask me
My cool is melting away and I'm making a mess
You can't see me like this
What makes my wounded heart feel like this?
Leave me alone I know I'm not making sense

How long can we make that last
With all that's stacked against us?
You kept on makin' up the breakdown
Give me somethin' to wash the pain down
Got hooked and caught up in a new sound
I can't keep goin' through this (Oh)
Now I'm calling you my holy ghost
Disappearing when I need you most
And I let you overthink when we got too close (Oh)
Now I'm calling you my holy ghost
Where'd you go? (Oh)
There's parts of me I think you know
More than anyone at all

What ever went wrong
My tongue on your tongue
Makes me feel better
Our first kiss
A slap on the wrist
My heart is a fist
And you're left of center
Gimme gimme gimme your attention
Strange ways babe
I only wanna move like you move

Read my lips
I'll get my kicks
You get your fix and we'll go out dancing

Spinning on the airwaves
I am the DJ
And you are the record that I play

Keep dancing

And when I scratch the surface
Does it still make you nervous

Lovely and amazing and completely underwhelmed
Tell me why you switched to satellite
The records in your hands
Please play my song again
Every part of my memory
Lives inside the night

And when I scratch the surface
Does it still make you nervous

On a mirror at your sister's house
And kissed her on the mouth
But you don’t go that way
I thought you had a thing for fancy boys
Looks can be deceiving
I love you
But I hate your friends
They're all desperate
If you knew what I know
Would you be ready to go?
All this emptiness would end
Stop pretending
If you knew what I know
Would you be ready to go?
Would you be ready to go?
They never liked the music
They bitch about how cool it used to be
Somehow I can’t refuse it
I dig your blatant sexuality
Oh you say I’m not that easy

They’re always on to the next big thing
They wanna bite but they can barely sting
I never wanted you for just a fling
I hate it when you lie to me
But I just let you lie to me
I love you
But I hate your friends
They're all desperate
If you knew what I know
Would you be ready to go?
All this emptiness would end
Stop pretending
If you knew what I know
Would you be ready to go?
Would you be ready to go?
But I hate your friends
I am usually better when I lie
There I go  stuck inside a shell
And you're living on the other side  a lover's carousel
If you only knew
Oh  I lose control
When I hear your body move
Through the walls
In the next room
Oh  I lose control
When I hear your body move
And I'm dying to break through
To the next room
You make love to everything you touch
It's a natural reaction  it's a sexual attraction
You play me like I am made of strings
If you only knew
How hard it is to handle
How bad I want this scandal

I feel a rush come over me
A sharp panic panic
It's the things you say
That makes a rush come over me
It happens all the time
I never was too good at following rules (na na)
I'm better just pretending I was the fool
I got the lights in my eyes
And I'm falling for you
But that's never enough
And these are the lessons in love
I got the lights in my eyes
And I'm falling for you
I'm just having my fun
With the lessons in love
If I walk away
I feel a push inside of me
That won't let me leave

For you to feel what's inside of me
This happens all the time

I’m daydreaming like a little kid at school
I guess I’ve always been this way
It’s been hard for me to say
They’ve been telling me to come of age
I’ve been going through an awkward phase
They’ve been trying hard to wake me up
Saying stuff that never gets me off
Don’t mind me
I’m living in another world
Don’t mind me
I’m living in another world
TV’s telling me to be myself
I can’t trust what the neon psychic sells
So I found out how to trust myself
I found out I’m stronger than the pills

I bury you deep in my mind
Hookups are easy to find
Kissing on strangers in the dark
Living single
Is harder on my body than the drugs
Living single
Is harder when the chemicals wear off
Maybe I'm breaking the habit 'cause
Living single
It gets so hard on my heart
Gets so hard on my heart
Taking me out in the current
Texting you things that I shouldn't
But the heart wants what it wants
Is this me and you? One becomes two

It's the last thing I wanna hear
You've been killing me for days and days it seems
But the truth is the thing I fear
I just don't understand
Why my love isn't good enough
I just don't understand
Why my love isn't good enough for you
I want you to show me
Everybody's showing everybody up

I don’t believe that you mean a single word you said
Lines in the sand where we disagree

I don’t believe that a single word you say is true
I guess it’s love
In the 21st century
It’s tough
Broken heart technology
Your kisses taste so sweet
But then you click delete
Love in the 21st century
I'm in the 21st century
I don’t believe making out is a dead romance
I miss the days being kids simply holding hands
I’m sick of wondering if you would ever call me back

Nothing you could say
Could tear us two apart
We've got all the spark
To set this place on fire
We got making love
Right down to a fine art
Nothing you could do

We've got all the stuff to

To mess all of you up
Mad love

It’s given me time to hum new melodies
Like how you're so ice cold to me
You're so ice cold to me
I think I know how these things go
And tell me you’re busy working

Didn't hear me talkin' out loud
Baby's got me nervous
Something's got a hold of my feet

All of the dumb shit I've seen

I'm the house you held your kickback at
I'm the funnest times you've ever had
Is it Hell? Is it Heaven?

We had dreams that we could fly
We had friends that were invisible
And love that never died
And as we grew old I felt the pain
We always knew the truth
The love would heal if we stayed true
To the dreams of our youth
I've been walking around for hours
Holding onto stems of flowers
My chest is feeling all your pain
As it began to rain
And now the end has come to this
The little victories I'll miss
Of everything we'd overcome
And all that's said and done
I'm leaving our war behind
Life can go on without you

How's that for devotion baby?
Nobody here still believes in til death
And if we break through the night

Shake to the sin

I never wanted you to cry again
If we fight 'til the dawn

I've got these habits that I can't

I found life out on the weekdays
When we would drive to some new city
Would you love me still if I were to confess
That I had a little too much fun
Back when I was young?
I've got these habits that I cannot break
And as I'm older there is more at stake
Go ahead and call me fake
I break habits just to fall in love

Made me the boy that they wanted me to be

Since I lost her
There's a trap door hidden in my heart
I fell into a lover's hell
Deeper than I thought
I came crawling back to that motel
I don't recognize
Who I am tonight
I'm some kind of monster
Since I lost her
Now I'm rising wires
And starting fires
I burn this whole thing down
I'm some kind of monster
How bad do I want her
I don't sleep at night
I terrorize

That you once played for me
It had all the right chords
And a sweet melody
It was back when we started
When there was mystery
Now they've all been erased
On my music machine
And it's all because of you
I've got a list of songs I can't listen to
And it's all because we're through
I've got a list of songs I can't listen to

Or do you switch to the next one
Sing for somebody else?

I would still hear voices in the halls
I could feel the red rain on me
I can see you shaking when we kiss
You still hit me like a buzz
Seventeen and drunk enough to wish
And you really got your hooks on me
Maybe that's the punishment for love
I still stay up late at night
Trying to hear your voices in the halls
You could hear me late at night
Singing to the voices in the halls

Playing on your broken speakers

When the night is over
It feels like we've been here before
This déjà vu got me missing you (Missing you  yeah)
Yeah  when the night is over
The struggle that we always do
'Cause we need somebody (Somebody)
Yeah  we need somebody
(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
Don't you need somebody?
(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
You're gettin' lonely 'cause you need some
(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
You're gettin' lonely 'cause you need somebody
(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
Yeah  oh
You're gettin' lonely 'cause you need some
(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
You're gettin' lonely 'cause you need somebody
(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
Since the holidays began
I hear its cold out where you're living
But it ain't colder than I've been
I've been an animal since you left me
I need you wrapped under my tree
My Christmas cheer is here and ready
But where are you to set it free
I sit alone
By the fire inside our home
Outside the snow is falling
And I'm singing
Grant me this one small wish
On Christmas night
'Cause I don't need candy
Or the toys from my youth
I've had a candle burning
Hoping you'll come back to me
I think this may be more than anything
Mr. Santa Claus can bring
I was adorable when you left me
I'm on the naughty list this year
A lump of coal won't do it justice
It's all the loneliness I fear
You might also like
I sit alone
By the gifts in our own home
You're not a single one
And now I'm singing
Grant me this one small wish
On Christmas night
'Cause I don't need candy
Or the toys from my youth
I'm not Grinch
I'm not Mr. Scrooge
My heart just needs your light
The only thing I'm doing
Is crying in my room and singing
I wish my baby would be with me
Tonight
Oh oo oh oo oh oo oh
Oh I've been so lonely
Grant me this one small wish
On Christmas night
'Cause I don't need candy
Or the toys from my youth
Oh oh oh
Oh oo oh
To your skin
While you were sleeping
I taste the salt on your hands
I reached out
To touch you
The morning light disarms you
Won't you let me in?
How long 'til your surrender?
How long 'til your surrender?
It's a long way for heartbreak
Let your heart wait and bleed
How long 'til your surrender to me?
I've become your shadow
I'm always lost for words
You look like a thousand suns
I wanna be the only one
Left when your day is done
You might also like
How long 'til your surrender?
How long 'til your surrender?
It's a long way for heartbreak
Let your heart wait and bleed
How long 'til your surrender to me?
I can't have you close
So I become a ghost
And I watch you
I watch you
Maybe if you stay
We could die this way
I won't stop you
I won't stop you
How long 'til your surrender?
How long 'til your surrender?
How long 'til your surrender?
How long 'til your surrender?
It's a long way for heartbreak
Let your heart wait and bleed
How long 'til your surrender to me?
(How long 'til your surrender?)
To me
(How long 'til your surrender?)
It's a long way for heartbreak
Let your heart wait and bleed"
