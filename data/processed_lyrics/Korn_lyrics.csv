lyrics
"The walls I have built inside
They constantly fight and collide
I'd love to see a different world
A place where you can't find me
Your magic spell doesn't work anymore
This ain't the end (The end)
Why can't I relax and let it be true?
This world that I tried to hide
This place makes me feel alive
I'd love to see a different world
A place where you can't find me

Your magic spell doesn't work anymore
This ain't the end (The end)
It gets on top of you and forces your perspective
Your magic spell doesn't work anymore
That I'm dreamin' of somethin' I can never be
It doesn't matter to me
'Cause I will always be that pimp that I see in all of my fantasies
I don't know your fuckin' name
So what? Let's—
Screwing might be the only way
That I can truly be free from my fucked up reality
So I dream and stroke it harder
'Cause it's so fun to see my face starin' back at me
I don't know your fuckin' name
So what? Let's fuck
All day  I dream about sex
All day  I dream about fuckin'
All day  I dream about fuckin'
All day  I dream about sex
Yes  all day  I dream about sex
And all day  I dream about sex
Yes  all day  I dream about sex

Too bad  I got your beans in my bag
You stuck-up sucker  Korny motherfucker
Taking over flows is the Limp pimp
Need a Bizkit to save this crew from Jon Davis
I'm gonna drop a little east side skill
Ya best step back 'cause I'ma kill  I'ma kill
Doing all you can to look like Raggedy Ann
You look like one of those dancers from the Hanson video
You little faggot ho
Please give me some shit to work with
'Cause right now I'm all it  kid

Who the fuck you think you're talking to? (Me)
I'm known for eating little whiny chumps like you (Whatever)
All up in my face with that are you ready?
But halitosis is all you're rocking steady
You little fairy  smelling on your flowers
I hear ya tweetin' on them fag-pipes  clod
But you said it best  there's no place to hide
Fred Durst needs to rehearse  needs to reverse what he's saying
Wanna be Funkdoobiest when you're playing
Ripping up a bad counterfeit  faking
Plus your bills  I'm paying
You can't eat that shit every day  Fred
Lay off the bacon
Say what  say what?
You better watch your fucking mouth  Jon
So  you hate me
And I hate you
You know what  you know what?
It's all in the family (Yeah)
I hate you
And you hate me
You know what?
It's all in the family
Ya better run  run while ya can (Say what?)
Can never fuck me up  Bisc Limpkit (Say what?)
At least I got a P.H.A.T. original band
Who's hot  who's not? (You)
You best step back  Korn on the cob (Okay)
You need a new job (Ha)
Time to take them mic skills
Back to the dentist and buy yourself a new grill (Fuck you)
You pumpkin pie  I'll jack off in your eye
Climbing shoots and ladders  while your ego shatters
But you just can't get away (Get a-gay)
So  I hate you!
And you hate me
You know what  you know what?
I hate you
And you hate me
You know what  you know what?
It's all in the family (Yeah  yeah)
You call yourself a singer? (Yep)
You're more like Jerry Springer (Oh  cool)
Your favorite band is Winger (Winger?)
And all you eat is Zingers
You're like a Fruity Pebble
Your favorite flag is rebel (Yeehaw)
It's just too bad that you're a fag and on a lower level
So you're from Jacksonville  kicking it like Buffalo Bill
Getting butt-fucked by your uncle Chuck
While your sister's on her knees (Oh yeah?)
Waiting for your little peanut
Wait  where'd you get that little dance? (Over here)
Like them idiots in Waco  you're burning up in Bako
Where your father had your mother
Your mother had your brother (Nuh-uh)
It's just too bad your father's mad  your mother's now your lover
Come on  hillbilly
Can your horse do a fucking wheelie?
You love it down south and  boy
You sure do got a purdy mouth
I hate you
And you hate me
You know what  you know what? (Yeah)
It's all in the family (You got it  you got it)
And I hate you (Yeah)
And you hate me
You know what  you know what?
It's all in the family (You got it  you got it)
And I love you
And I want you
And I'll suck you
And I'll fuck you
And I'll butt-fuck you
And I'll eat you
And I'll lick your little dick  motherfucker
Been bleeding too long
I'll stop it somehow
I will make it go away
Can't be here no more
Seems this is the only way
I will soon be gone
These feelings will be gone
These feelings will be gone
Now I see the times they change
Leaving doesn't seem so strange
I am hoping I can find
Where to leave my hurt behind
All the shit I seem to take
All alone I seem to break
I have lived the best I can
Does this make me not a man?
Shut me off
I stand alone
Can't be on my own

Please give me some place to rage
I'm not trying to go there
So take me away

It's never a good trip for me
Every time I reach for love
It's taken away
There's nothing wrong wanting to be loved
Is there something wrong with me?

Do I walk away?
Or do l stand my ground
And accept my fate?
And there's the faceless cries
That twist my every dream
And almost every night
I hear the demon sing
Why are we going on this way?
Why do we play these games in vain?
Nothing's gonna break it down
And build us back again
So why did the path have to lead this way?
Black is the soul that's led astray

In the darkest ways
And as I search around

It sinks its teeth in one at a time
It loves to feed  it loves my past
It's always taunting but somehow out of grasp
Can you hear me? 'Cause I'm lost
And I may never come back again
And while my heart keeps holding on
I know I'll never be the same again

Hi  Geri
Uh  is it okay if I come over and take a look at your exhaust manifold on your Dodge Dart?
I've got a piece missing somewhere on mine  and I'm not sure what it is
I wanna see what you got on yours  ha-ha
Throttle lever strikes dash-pot rod  the rod must push diaphragm back
Before it can move back  air must be pushed up in
This causes the diaphragm to move slowly when the throttle valve is moved away
(Mhm  see this?)
I don't care what that-
(The rod  that they're talking about-)
I don't care what that looks like Geri  I'm telling you what the dash-pot is
Where's the dash-pot on here  Geri?
(I don't know)
Dash-pot is inside. Geri  where it's hooked up at
And that is not made-  that is not made to regulate the fuckin' choke goin' back and forth
(And that's not the end-loader?)
That's so you can get pure fuel in there
As soon as you start cranking it over  whoa
It sucks open and it cracks the choke like this
And that's how that works
(That is not what you just said)
This one here  as soon as you start turnin' over the engine
It's supposed to pull it back when the vacuum starts
(Why are you screaming?)
(You said  As the car gradually warms up...)
This has already done its job  the only thing its job is to do is when you're cranking the engine up
(Then you don't know what it's called)
The Choke Vacuum Diaphragm (okay)
I mean  it's right there in the book
(Sure it is)
(If it was right here in the book  I would have found it)
(What?)
You showed me the goddamn thing in the book what it was called  that's what I knew what it was
(Get out of here and quit yelling at me)
(I haven't seen that in there)
I haven't seen it  you stupid son of a bitch
(That vacuum thing? Yes)
(We don't know what the little business is.)
(It doesn't explain anything  I haven't read anything that explains that)
I just told you what it did
And you're sittin' there saying you never saw that before
And yet you're the one that fuckin' showed me it  Geri
(You stink like gas)
(I told you that fuckin' fuel filter was not on there)
(It's not that fuckin' orange business hanging across the goddamn business)
Let's try rebuilding the fucking carburetor first  Geri
Let me tell you something  Geri
Let me tell you a little secret  Geri
(Don't tell me any secrets  be quiet)
I tell you something and you fuckin' don't believe me
You show me something and you still don't fuckin' believe me
(I can't show you anything Michael  because your head is blank)
Well  you're sitting there telling me that motherfucker isn't that
Well  that's not how it works
(Who's talking about the truck? We're talking about-)

My time has gone today
You flirt with suicide
Sometimes that's okay
Do what others say
I'm here standing hollow
Falling away from me
Falling away from me
Day is here fading
That's when I'm insane
I flirt with suicide
Sometimes kill the pain
I can't always say
It's gonna be better tomorrow
Falling away from me
Falling away from me
Beating me down
Beating me  beating me
Down  down
Into the ground
Screaming so sound
Beating me  beating me

Of a twisted reality
And it never got a hold of me

Things keep ending up this way
Another notch is carved away
In the thoughts of mass decay
Funny how things end up this way
Beaten down
Dominated by its sound
Growing deep within my head
Eating me all up inside
This cancer finds everything I hide
Living my life horrified
Nothing will keep this pacified and out my life
Life
That's not right out insane
Satisfaction is delayed
Its motivation is displayed
Flaunting its misogyny
Funny how I thought it'd go away

Many nights  painful thoughts occur
Yell at me again  I'm numb
In denial  I tried to be your friend
I tried to be a good boy
All I see  a hate deep inside
Startle me  someone save me
Now  these memories fill my heart!
They bury me!

Looking back  I was never ever right
You were my step-mom
Who always wanted me out of your sight
I would come walking in  and I'd say hello
But you slap me
And you make some fucked up comment about my clothes
Then I tried to let it pass
But the visions in my head
Were with you
With a knife up your ass  laying dead
So I pop some more caps in your ass
Now your son is not so fun
Motherfucking bitch!
Never try to play me!
You made my life not so good

I want to see what you got on yours.
Throttle valve strikes dash-pot rod.
The rod must push diaphragm back before it can move back  air must be pushed up in.
This causes the diaphragm to move slowly when the throttle valve is moved away.
The stream will force diaphragm out the air must now vent the dash-pot is ready to work again.
Geri: Is this  to this?
Michael: I don't care what that…
Geri: The rod that they're talking about?
Michael: I don't care what that looks like Geri  I'm telling you what the dash-pot is. Where's the dash-pot on here  Geri?
Geri: I don't know.
Michael: Dash-pot is inside Geri where it's hooked up at.
Michael: And that's not made…
Michael: And that is not made to regulate the fuckin' choke goin' back & forth.
Geri: And that's not the end-loader?
See Korn LiveGet tickets as low as $20Michael: That's just so you can get pure fuel in there.
Geri: Mm-hmm.
Michael: As soon as you start crankin' it over  whoa!
Geri: Mm-hmm.
Michael: It sucks open and it cracks the choke like this.
And that's how that works.
Geri: That is not what you just said.
Michael: I said  no  Geri  the heating is the motherfuckin'… spring!
This one here  as soon as you start turnin' over the engine  it's supposed to pull it back when the vacuum starts.
When the vacuum starts  nothin' to do with fuckin' heat. Vacuum!
Geri: Why are you screaming?
Michael: Because the way you said  It's supposed to work off heat. No  Geri!
Geri: You said as the car gradually warms up.…
Michael: As it gradually warms up  this muthafucker with the coil  the spring opens it up.
This has already done it's job  the only thing it's job is to do is when you're cranking the engine up after it's been choked  all it does is pull back  then it cracks open just a pinch.
Geri: Then you don't know what it's called.
Michael: The Choke Vacuum Diaphragm.
Geri: Okay.
Michael: I mean  it's right there in the book.
Geri: Sure it is.
Michael: Oh God. You're a hard  hard woman to live with.
Geri: If it was right here in the book  I would've found it.
Michael: Oh you muthafucker  you asshole  you stupid son of a bitch  you showed it to me!
Geri: What  Mike?
Michael: You showed me the god damn thing in the book what it was called. That's what I knew what it was!
Geri: Get out of here and quit yelling at me!
Michael: No  Geri  you're fucked!
Geri: I haven't seen that in there.
Michael: I haven't seen it  you stupid son of a bitch.
Geri: That vacuum thing? Yes.
We don't know what the little business is.
It doesn't explain anything.
I haven't read anything that explains that.
Michael: I told you what it says.
Geri: Yeah  you did yes  yesterday.
Michael: I just told you what it did.
Geri: Mm-hmm?
Michael: And you're sittin' there saying you never saw that before  and yet you're the one that fuckin' showed me it  Geri.
Geri: You stink like gas.
I told you that fuckin' fuel filter was not on there.
It's not that fuckin' orange business hanging across the god damn business.
Michael: Let's try rebuilding the fuckin' carburetor first  Geri.
Let me tell you something  Geri.
Let me tell you a little secret  Geri.
Geri: Don't tell me any secrets  be quiet!
Michael: Oh  man  I quit! I am fed up! I mean  I tell you something and you fuckin' don't believe me.
You show me somethin'  and you still don't fuckin' believe me.
Geri: I can't show you anything  Michael  because your head is blank.
Michael: Well your sittin' there tellin' me that muthafucker isn't that.
Well that's not how it works.
Well  Geri  a mechanic told me that's how it works.

 down
 down
 I just feel the craving
Twist
Twist
Twist
Twist
Twist
Listening to your twisted transistor
Hold it between your legs
Turn it up  turn it up
Low end is coming through
Can't get enough
A lonely life where no one understands you
But don't give up because the music do
Music do  music do
Music do  music do
Music do  music do
Because the music do
And then it's reaching inside you
Forever preaching  Fuck you too
Your scream's a whisper
Hang on you  twisted transistor
Hey you  hey you  finally you get it
The world ain't fair  eat you if you let it
And as your tears fall on
Your breasts  your dress
Vibrations coming through
You're in a mess

Says who? Says who? Anesthetize this bitch
(Anesthetize this bitch  anesthetize)
Just let me be between you and me
Don't fit

Forever preaching  Fuck you too
Your scream's a whisper
Wicked!
Haha!
You know that I'm from the wicked crew
You act like you knew
But I got everybody jumping to the voodoo
While me and the mob gotta trunk full of nines
Drop  and I'll slay ya
Before I bust ya
Looking for the one that did it
You want my vote  no you're never gonna get it
'Cause I'm the one with the fat  mad skills
And I won't choke like the Buffalo Bills
Sittin' at the pad just chillin'
Larry Parker just got two million
Oh  what a fuckin' feelin'
That nigga done past me the peel
And I'll slam dunk ya like Shaquille O'Neal
Kick it  'cause I get…

Don't say nothin'  just listen
Got me a plan to break Tyson outta prison
You come my way  ya get served
Still got a deuce  that'll bunny hop the curb
Nappy head  nappy chest
Nappy chin  never seen with a happy grin
Gotta fat frown 'cause I'm down
So take a look around
All you see is big black boots
Step in  use my steel toe as a weapon
And it's awfully quiet  they want to label this nigga
Do with the sticker  but that's nasty
'Cause I gotta body count like Ice-T
From here to New York
I get them skins  and I ain't talking about pork

Yeah
The fuck out my cat  come on
People wanna know how come
I got a gat  and I'm sitting at the window like Malcolm
Ready to bring that noise
Kinda trigger-happy like the Geto Boys
April twenty-ninth was power to the people
Y'all might just see a sequel
'Cause police got equal pay
A horse is a pig that don't fly straight!
I'm doin' Darryl Gates  but is Willie Williams
Down with the pilgrims?
I'm through with the picket signs
So I think the job is dead  get out 'cause I get...

Got a weird thing to show ya  so tell all the boys and girls
Tell your brother  your sister and your mama too
We're about to go down  and you know just what to do
Wave your hands in the air like you don't care
Glide by the people as they start to look and stare
When you hear the call  you've got to get it on the way
Word up  it's the code word
No matter where you say it  you know that you'll be heard
Now all you sucker DJs who think you're fly
There's got to be a reason  and we know the reason why
You try to put on those airs and act real cool
But you got to realize that you're acting like fools
We don't have the time for psychological romance

Spun out inside my own head
Down the road to my own death
Watch it all fall down
So come give me the truth you hide
Take the pain inside
It feeds on the doubt in my heart
To fix what I tore all apart
Watch it all fall down
