"I came here to eat
I ain't with that starving shit
I'm in my zone now and I ain't gon fold up
They like Cardi all grown up yea bitch I glo'ed up
They ain't see the blizzard coming these niggas done froze up
They mad they been sleeping on me just be like you woke up
I don't make scenes I just make movies
Clip after clip after clip call it a uzi
They quick to judge a bitch just wish they knew me
I know a couple hittas done pulled a couple triggers
Violate me they gon come and get you
And I'm tired of y'all baby mamas y'all nothing but drama
Always worrying about the new bitch why you so foolish watching my moves you like how I do shit
I make you feel insecure but that's not my problem
Just worry about your kid and I'ma keep popping my collar
And for those who want to know I'm not your average hoe
Yeah I fucked a couple niggas pulled a couple tricks
Bust a couple splits sucked a couple dicks
But there is a story to everything and that's just real shit
My family had to eat and I had to pay the rent
If it's green I'ma get it please stay the fuck out my business
Bitch try me I promise you get it
Bitch try me there will be no winning
Gotta watch all these faces there's too many counterfeits
Sometimes when you hear them say I got you you can't even count on it
That's why I fuck with my bitches only my bitches
My day one bitches so please do not fuck with my bitches
That's a brick in your face and you gon need stitches
I see that you moving suspicious
That's word to my niece I'm not kidding

I'm livin' my best life
Made a couple M's  you know (IGH! Huh!)
Said I'm livin' my best life
Said I'm livin' my best life
Made a couple M's with my best friends
Turned all my L's into lessons
You see the whip pullin' up  it's like skrrt
Dreams pullin' up  I'm like skrrt
I'm livin' my best life
It's my birthday  at least that's what I'm dressed like
I'm like Big Pop' mixed with 2Pac  I'm like Makaveli (Yeah)
You need some  Little Caesar's pizza  I be hot and ready (Woo)
Nigga  you a pussy and a rat  you like Tom and Jerry
I was in the field  man  I slaved for this (Yeah)
Had to talk to God  dropped down  and prayed for this
I seen the car I wanted  then I went and paid for it  cash cash
Hit the Tay-K  I hit the race  hit the dash dash
That's when they came for me on Twitter with the backlash
#CardiBIsSoProblematic is the hashtag
I can't believe they wanna see me lose that bad
They talkin' junk and they stink  these hoes mad trash
I'm gigglin'  can't let the devil have the last laugh
Ain't no more beefin'  I'm just keepin' to myself
I'm my own competition  I'm competin' with myself (Brrr)

Better be careful with these women when you trickin'  send it fly (Sheesh)
She count money in her sleep and she don't ever spend the night
But she trappin' and she had to make it happen for her life
Don't be mad because she havin'  shit  you had it your whole life
We had baggage on our flight  we had badges on our asses
You got passes in your life  you had gadgets on your bike

'Fore I fixed my teeth  man  those comments used to kill me
But never did I change  never been ashamed
Never did I switch  story stayed the same
I did this on my own  I made this a lane
Y'all gotta bear with me  I been through some things
Went from small-ass apartments to walkin' red carpets
Pissy elevators  now every dress is tailored
This some real-life fairy tale Binderella shit
I got further than them hoes said I will ever get
And that only goes to show that only God knows
I took pictures with Beyoncé  I met Mama Knowles

Now how much times do I gotta prove these niggas wrong?
And how much times I gotta show these bitches I ain't soft?
How many shows I gotta sell out 'fore ya’ll get the cost?
Why they really tryna front like I ain't hit the charts?
All these labels  throwin' deals from left to right
But I ain't givin' in until they get them numbers right
All these people think that this shit happened overnight
All that flexin' they be doin'  shit is all a hype
No tolerance for a hatin' bitch talkin' shit
Only time I hold my tongue is when I'm suckin' dick
And don't be talkin' all that sorry shit  don't flip the script
They sleepin' on me just because I used to strip
But it's all good 'cause now they wanna get up in my VIP
Blowin' up my phone  sayin' everythin' I touch is lit
Actin' corn and wanna fuck me like they wasn't talkin' shit  whoa
I let 'em live  let the shady motherfuckers live
Give them the price then it's time to show them what it is
Don't got the bat? Well then  what you really tryna pitch?
Don't waste my time  I ain't never been no average bitch
Not to mention  I did my tour and that shit was winnin'
I thank the Lord for every blessing that he has given
I love the fans  they fill me up with that ammunition
I don't really talk shit but now I gotta off this
I don't know why bitches think we work in the same office
Corny bitches tryna keep up? Look exhausted
My ex told me I was never gon' be shit
I used to stare at magazines on the train
Lookin' at these models like  I gotta be this one day
Left the corny bitches in the grave  so they throwin' shade

Used to dance in a club right across from my school
I said dance not fuck  don't get it confused
Had to set the record straight 'cause bitches love to assume
Mama couldn't give it to me  had to get it at Sue's
Lord only knows how I got in those shoes
I was covered in dollars  now I'm drippin' in jewels
A bitch play with my money? Might as well spit in my food
Bitches hated my guts  now they swear we was cool
Went from makin' tuna sandwiches to makin' the news
I started speakin' my mind and tripled my views
Real bitch  only thing fake is the boobs
Never been a fraud in my mothafuckin' life
Stunting on these bitches out of mothafuckin' spite
Ain't no runnin' up on me  went from nothin' to glory
I ain't tellin' y'all to do it  I'm just tellin' my story
I don't hang with these bitches 'cause these bitches be corny
And I got enough bras  y'all ain't gotta support me
Only person in my fam to see six figures
The pressure on your shoulders feel like boulders
When you gotta make sure that everybody straight
Bitches stab you in your back while they smilin' in your face
Talking crazy on your name  trying not to catch a case
I waited my whole life just to shit on niggas
Climbed to the top floor so I can spit on niggas
Said I was just tryna chill and make bangers (Bangers)
Tell all these old bitches they in danger (Stop)
The thing on my hip whip bitches into shape (Brrrt)
That's what I call a fuckin' waist trainer
You gon' run up on who and do what? (Who?)
I think y'all got your story screwed up (Yeah)

I don't want your punk-ass man  I'm too tough (Facts)

So if it's all love  show me love then (Huh?)
'Cause you hatin' on a bitch  that's what it sounds like
Just 'cause I been on the road don't mean I been on the run
And you gon' have to learn to hold your tongue or hold the gun (Brrrt  woo)
And we all know you ain't that type (No)
I smack you and the bitch that you act like (Yeah)
I started gettin' money  bitches upset (Cash)
They remind me of my pussy  bitches mad tight
Co-come through shinin' with a Rollie bust face (Shine)
Ain't no bitch spittin' like this since '08
