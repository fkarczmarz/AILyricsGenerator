"I'm almost dead
Sick to my stomach
In a hospital bed
As long as you're here
Open my eyes
I'm lifting my head
She's curled in a ball
At the foot of my bed
As long as you're here
I'm feeling pathetic
It's given me good perspective
You were my medic
When shit got hectic
Now I'm resurrected
I won't forget this (I won't forget this)
(I won't)
You might also like
I'm paralyzed
I'm beyond dread
I can't remember
Anything that I said
As long as you're here
I'm feeling pathetic
It's given me good perspective
You were my medic
When shit got hectic
Now I'm resurrected
I won't forget this (I won't forget this)
(I won't) (I won't forget)
(I won't) (I won't forget you)
I'm feeling pathetic
It's given me good perspective
You were my medic
When shit got hectic
Now I'm resurrected
I won't forget this (I won't forget this)
I won't (I won't forget)
Shouldn't we both be in frame
For such a reconnecting gesture
To be voyeurs in exchange
We could say we didn't mean it
We could dig up all the names
We could brag about our future
Talk about our leaving day
We could have a small reunion
For all the people that we knew
We’ll all get drunk and celebrate
Here’s to me and here’s to you
Do we?
Savor all the little pieces
Picture rooms and empty seats
Imagine everybody leaving
Without the starving self-esteems
We could say we didn't mean it
We could dig up all the names
We could brag about our future
Talk about our leaving day
We could have a small reunion
For all the people that we knew
We’ll all get drunk and celebrate
Here’s to different shades of blue
Here's to faces of our memories
To reprimanded attitudes
To forgetting all the pretense
To all the people that we knew
We'll all get drunk and celebrate
Here's to me and here's to you
You might also like
We're alone but side by side
Nothing here is what it seems
There's an animal inside
There's a fear that won't subside
Of all the things I'll never do
Will I ever follow through?
There's an animal inside
There's an animal inside
Half awake and almost dead
Keeping empty beds elsewhere
All the time and energy
Could we try to reinvent
Feed the head with common sense
Through the streets and avenues
I'm climbing up the walls with you
Climbing up the walls with you
I'm climbing up the walls with you

Half awake and almost dead
Keeping empty beds elsewhere
All the time and energy
Strike spears of light
Inside my eyes
Over the fields
Where we believed
Our love had died
Roses of white
Blushing with life
Don’t pass me by
Whisper the needs
Quiet release
Fever in me
Head cases full
Rise out of you
Breaking in two
Let there be light
Golden inside
Dark was the night

Take a bow
Don't fret
It's over now
Overflow
Shake a fist
Howling at
The emptiness
Felt something
Starts to burn
Fades away
Ashes flow
Moon is glow
Run away
Forget the day
Down and out
Nothing's doubts
Let's get
The molting out
Make a space
Set it free
Tug or pull
They will see

Forget the day
The parts and frame
Maybe it's the same late morning?
The same no-show?
It's the same fucking habits…
I guess we don't know
All of this is tearing us apart
I don't know where us or this start
All of this is tearing us apart
I don't know where us or this start
If there's anyone near when we collide
We throw them in the middle
They can pick sides
As the plans turn into compromise
The promises all turn to lies
The spite builds up and I can't get through
But with a plan like this it's way too slow
In the time it took to get this bad
I could've made this work but all I had
Was the hope that pieces would take shape
And we could watch them all fall into place
Fall into place
Fall into place
Fall into place
Fall into place

We all get tongue tied
Keep your chin up  don't get accustomed
You're allowed to backslide
On the other side of love
Teenage story in its glory
God  it's never quite enough
My sun-dried baby  permanently limp
Quiet restraint takes such accomplishment
This airtight framing crutch analogy
Quiet restraint takes all the best in me
And you can tell them you're the girl
Who sold her magic for the world
And I'll be hers and we'll be fine
And I will turn those screams to rhymes
And I'll be cashing in each time

Just a little hollow
Who wants to fuck?
This is nothing
This is great
I am bored now
I can't wait
I like the bright lights
I like to shout
Don't need a reason
To get out
I like the bright lights
I like to pout
Don't need a reason
To get out
There's nothing better
Then to shake
I can't remember
Another black out
Let's hit the floor
It's less to deal with
Give me commotion
A little soap
Pour me an ocean
And i can float

Why you looking so down?
When you're so wired
Why go into town?
Come over to my house
Come on boy  just come round

I may be crazy but I am not too young
To love you
I won't be fooled again
Oh no

I think I'm going to lose control
Because I'm finding the will
Just a little bit more
Just a little bit an inch of it more
Because I'm beginning to tear

When the world looks temporary
Built to be repaired (Built to be repaired)
And we both like the idea of
A checkered kitchen floor (Checkered kitchen floor)

I have everything I need

It's just everything you make me feel
Everytime you leave I have to heal
Honey I don't know how to make leaving easy

Can you lean in when I fall out of love
When I don't want to lead
But I can follow
All I can do is promise you tomorrow
It's complicated
These feelings come in waves and
I can't contain them
Believe me when I say that
I'm not immune
To days of doubt
No guarantee that I won't ever let you down
Everybody knows you're my sickness and the cure
Everybody knows  everybody knows that I'm yours
Everybody knows you're my sickness and the cure
Everybody knows  everybody knows
Everybody knows  everybody knows
I feel the rush  be still my beating heart
And tell me how we go back to the start
When I don't want to lead
But I can follow
This side of me  a bitter pill to swallow

You and I we both agree
Better off without the tension
Take these stones
Now we’re falling
As it grows
We are soaring down
Better all this intervention
Then another perfect night
It’s not alright
We’re not alright
Take these stones
Now we’re falling
Dearest hopes
We are calling
Faces frozen in the mourning
As it grows
We are soaring down
See this now
As it dies
Take these words
As a sign
Take these stones
Now we’re falling
Dearest hopes
We are calling
Faces frozen in the mourning
As it grows
Take comfort in the fall
In everything I gave you
I never quite forgave you
*Fire away*
We're made in simple forms
Taking cover in the way through
Falling to the floor
And begging me to stay true
Loveless escape
*Silent restraint*
*Silent restraint*
How can I stay

Frayed
All over the place
Thought it was good
Everything where it should be
Around me
All that depends
On where it ends
It ends
Did you pretend?
Or maybe not comprehend?
Procrastination baby
Are you agitated lately?
Just a couple figures for the different uses
Here it comes: the sum of all excuses
Spread it thin
Make it bend
Just a couple figures for the different uses
Here it comes the sum of all excuses
In  20 minutes  everyone will remember you when you're gone
And your heart  is a stone  buried underneath your pretty clothes
Don't you know people write songs about girls like you? Like you
What will you do when something stops you?
What will you say to the world?
What will you be when it all comes crashing
Down on you little girl?
What would you do if you lost your beauty?
How would you deal with the light?
How would you feel if nobody chased you?
What if it happened tonight?
How would you cope it the world decided to
Make you suffer for all that you were?
How could you dance if no-one was watching
And you couldn't even care if they were?
What would you do if you couldn't even feel?
Not even pitiful pain
How would you deal with the empty decisions
Eating away at the days?

Am I your golden girl

Melt the edge of today
Am I your golden girl
But it seems I've made a mess
This wasn't meant to be special
Now its nagging me confess
Don’t talk to me
I could improvise solutions
I could try to re-frame
Until I’m left with your admission
That I’m not all there is to blame
I could lie to be gentle
We will never be the same
The more adamant I am that it’s the surface
The more the walls begin to flake
Don’t talk to me
Don’t talk to me
Keeping count
As if the hurt could balance
Don’t walk with me
Your dirty feet are obvious
And how could you brag confidence
A willing keen participant
In rolling waves of incidents

Like we understood
Made with adrenaline
Seeping out through the skin
Like only lovers could
Here's where we begin
Time is the medicine
To heal these needs that only raise our voices
Higher  higher
Tonight we raise the dead
Tonight we bury this in fire  fire
Under the shape of years
And the weight that brought us here
But we can separate
To form these hearts in stone
Rewrite this pain we own
Caught here in the wake
Nothing but genuine

Of fractured parts

The end of June came
And took you away
We were all crying
Felt like I was dying
Black dress & black shoes
Tied laces for you
The saddest of days
Why couldn’t we save you?
(You  you  you  you  you  you)
Why couldn't we save you
(You  you  you  you  you  you)
Inside my head
At the edge of the bed
Where somberness lay
In your children that day

From all of the games
I'm not hearing
Any other way
Shut my eyes
Head rests on my hands
Quietly
Hiding once again
Jilted lover
Sleeping in the unrest
How do we
Survive to make amends?
Fight the lies
Voices in my head
Multiply
And I'm gonna let you know
I'm gonna let you know
So clear and wide awake
I'm begging to let you know
Know that you can...
Take me home
I'm learning to live with ghosts
The limbs I miss the most
Take me home
I'm learning to live with ghosts
The skin I miss the most
Laid low by heart ache
I'm trying to stay afloat
Keeping the light down low
Let go of our restraint

Know that you can...

And lay the day to waste
Forsake these bones
Hopelessly abandoning our phones
To watch the clouds awake
Over the homes
Of people we won't ever know (ever know)
Cause nothing is bigger and brighter than this
That I should let you go
Can we stay alight
Reignite these embers
Just for one more night
Never to grow old
If we just frame it right
So much for foresight in this
That I should let this go

Vaccinated to my charms
Know that I will only waste
The next few months by saving grace
I saw you breathing as we woke
I felt the shake before it broke
I saw the future swallow all the love we've known
'Cause it's all just been one big joke
If we're going off your past
Nothing you can build will last
Rolling in the aftermath
We should move before these hearts
(Defuse in the love we are losing)
Ripen as the boredom starts
(Inside the sea of changes)
Twitching as the interest fades

Leave your bag of bones underneath your bed
Everything is as it should be
I'm leaving now as I should be
No way  no way
No  we're never gonna talk about it
No way  no way
No  we're never gonna speak again
No way  no way
No  we're never gonna talk about it

When the night descends  are you sleeping?

All that we can do is smile

I can't erase the loss for my father
I can't replace the loss with another
But I can regain myself and recover
(Ah ah ah)

When I feel my bones get heavy (Ah ah ah)
Sinking like a stone and heady (Ah ah ah)

Like rolling waves
Before we sleep to just escape
Take a piece  take a piece
Or just walk away
Given the time can we come alive?
We are swimming  we are swimming
No warning signs
Before we sleep can you just say
For the last time today
Take a piece or just walk away
Like rolling waves
Like rolling waves
These nine hours of delay
Like a lifetime  like a lifetime
It falls away
You swim from pulling tides
That swallow you at night
Let go  let go
Into these rolling waves

But I think I survived
There are specific things
That I have to do
Day to day just to keep it at bay
You wouldn't believe if you knew

Here's a little secret
Here's the best part
This is going to take me
Right back to the start
If I can't hear it
If it's out of mind
Wait until it settles
Comes round a second time
I don't remember the first time
But I think I survived

Right back to the start
If I can't hear it
If it's out of mind
Wait until it settles
Comes round a second time
I can feel it loom
Up into my head
It is in the room
Panicking in bed
I feel it coming on
Taking over view
Oh please not tonight
There’s nothing I can do
This is bigger than me
This is in my fear
This is pitiful
I just disappear
Swells up all around me
Swallowed up inside
Sell my senses if
It would make this subside
I can barely handle
I can pass the time
Staring through the curtains
Up into the sky
Where there is no
Depth perception
Keep preoccupied:
Self deception
Nobody recognizes
It doesn’t have a name
My brother is infected  he’s acting just the same
He just wants to stop it
He wants to end it all
I am just a child
I have nothing more
Than the basic function I am running from
I curl up and wallow
My distortion
Everything is disproportion
Suddenly I wake
All is back again
Everything is closer
Morning is the same
And I can’t hear it
It’s way out of mind
Burying the bones
You don't have to work
To make it feel like home
But you show me the bright side
Always got my eyes closed
You sit there with wide eyes
But you came at the right time
Follow you to roses
Show me to the sunshine
Sunseeker
You made me a believer
Sunseeker
Did you know I need ya?

Gentle impulsion
Shakes me  makes me lighter

For all the times I've let it pass
There’s nothing here but the mess
If you’d have shut up you’d have heard it
You could have put it to rest
I am swelling and eager
I am the raging sea
I have had it up to here now
I’m so tired of your needs
And how does it feel to be on the fault-line
And how do we heal now we’re on the decline
Cause it’s a hell of a long way to fall just to learn to get up
And I’m not gonna forgive you for all of the things that you’ve done
There’s nothing here but indifference
There’s nothing here but the stress
These walls are stained with your moments
Something you want to confess?
You at the point of attachment
And all the things you believe
There’s nothing left in this place but a reason to leave
And how does it feel to be on the fault line
And how do we heal now we’re on the decline
Cause it’s a hell of a long way to fall just to learn to get up

We survived under crystal skies
Grows just like a grape vine
We align weather-beaten spines
I am still clinging to
These signs that I hope to find
A heart no home can hold
The hole we left behind
I feel your body right here
It takes on any shape
This place that made me run
And gave me every reason to
Stay

Come back
The unavoidable sun weighs my head
And what the hell have I done
And you know
I don't remember a thing
I don't remember
A thing
So I'm done
Am I placating the notes?
Should I fault
Cut off my tongue
So you say
Apparently I'm digging it in
I can't feel

So I go bury my head
In the ground
Yet I won't lose what I said

Through every angle of your pain

But I will find a way (to be the)

We falter fade

We break the things we swore would never change us
Or undermine the promises we made

The waves to catch your fall

You walk in a mess
Looking for trouble
There’s a fox in the nest
Kick up your heels on the double
Put the mocking to rest
I am a fire if you hesitate
But you watch with the eyes
In the jaws of a boy
Who will never recognize his luck
I am a fire if you hesitate
Tie your laces up
But you watch with the eyes
In the jaws of a boy
Who is never gonna come unstuck
What you say undercover
In the belly of the beast
Blaze a trail at their pace
Jump up for the peak
As the words pile up
Like an accident
Its just semantics

All the chemicals reel

Can't Help myself but count the flaws
Claw my way out through these walls
One temporary escape
Feel it start to permeate
I fly a lot now
Though my parents used to have me up on lock down
And we never gon' stop now
Tell them haters not now
This is my moment and you're not gonna ruin it
If you ever hated you're one of my influences
Like tell me how you're running it though
A year ago I was getting 500 a show
Try to do good but only get stuck with evil
That's when I said I heat em up like Ramen noodles
Ya in three minutes we winning
And we never scared of changes
So never are we timid
She said baby you gotta keep killin'
And this is how I'm feelin'
LL cause my Momma said knock you out
They said the flow is universal like healthcare
You at the barbershop I'm killing shit elsewhere
All I had was cable and Fresh Prince of Bel-Aire
We set up and go and greats way mirror
The girls try to cover shit up mascara
I'm never focused on what one does
And lets toast for the Young Bloods
