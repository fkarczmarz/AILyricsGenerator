"Crush it casually
Without past I can't disappoint
My ancestry
Forever can I sleep inside
Your menagerie
(I won't let you know)
(I won't let you know)
(I won't let you know)
(I am dreaming of your kiss  I am dreaming)
(I am dream-dreaming of your kiss  I am dreaming)
Catch a moth  hold it in my hand
Crush it casually
Without past I can't disappoint
My ancestry
Forever can I sleep inside
Your menagerie
We drown in pneumonia not
Steelyringing imperthnthn thnthnthn
And gold flushed more
Blue bloom is on the gold pinnacled hair
Peep! Who's in the... peepofgold?
Tink cried to bronze in pity
Decoy. Soft word. But look! The bright stars fade. O rose! Notes chirruping
Answer. Castille. The morn is breaking
Jingle jingle jaunted jingling
Coin rang. Clock clacked
Avowal. Sonnez. I could. Rebound of garter. Not leave thee
Avowal. Warm
When love absorbs
War! War! The tympanum
A sail! A veil awave upon the waves
Horn. Hawhorn
When first he saw. Alas!
Full tup. Full throb
Martha! Come!
Clapclop. Clipclap. Clappyclap
Goodgod henev erheard inall
Deaf bald Pat brought pad knife took up
A moonlight nightcall: far: far
I feel so sad. P. S. So lonely blooming
Listen!
The spiked and winding cold seahorn
Have you the?
 soon
 it's dead
 they won't turn the birdy's head
 only stagger
 quite cryptic
Take a breath for the Father
The Chronicles are so misleading
This is your baptism
And you can't forgive 'em
This is your baptism
And you can't forgive 'em
Hold my head under water
Take a breath for the Father

Is a thousand spawn chewing at me
Turn to me and say it can't be true
There's no way I came out of you
Straight from my bones
Back in my hands
Straight from my blood
Back in my hands
Too old to be my daughter
Too young to be my friend
It's so wrong  I've seen it all before
There's two wounded cats waiting at the door
I'll give you your lobotomy
There's no way you came out of me
Straight from my bones
Back in my hands
Straight from my blood
Back in my hands
Too old to be my daughter
Too young to be my friend

Straight from my bones

Back in my hands

Back in my hands
Straight from my blood
And we're eating our young
Remain silent and still for modesty
When the splints have been broken
And they can't help you now
Do you pray with your eyes closed naturally?
Follow me into nowhere
Woven with the utmost care
If I'm lost please don't find me
If I drown let me sink
We descended from no one
With a wink
Do you pray with your eyes closed naturally?
Follow me into nowhere
Woven with the utmost care

Have they cleansed you with chloride?
And scrubbed behind the knees?
Has your body been hollowed by the breeze?
A century of your priceless time
To commit a victimless crime
Vow to caress your rashes
Vow to punish with lashes
You can hide inside my locket
Put a leash on when they walk you
Next year say you didn't want to
Do they chastise you when you stray
Sallow skin and they can't look away
Start a collection of brine
Because all you do is cry
Wood ticks whisper to console you
All you do is cry
All you do is cry
All you do is cry
All you do is cry
Ticks whisper to console
All you do is cry
All you do is cry
I'm afraid they're gonna find you
And there's nothing that I can do
A century of your priceless time
To commit a victimless crime
Vow to caress your rashes
Vow to punish with lashes
You can hide inside my locket
Put a leash on when they walk you
Next year say you didn't want to
Do they chastise you when you stray
Sallow skin and they can't look away
Start a collection of brine
Because all you do is cry
Wood ticks whisper to console you
And there's nothing that I can do
A century of your priceless time
To commit a victimless crime
Reduce them to strays
Clean their cuts and scrapes
Mercy we abstain
Hope you're entertained
Snow covers the stain
Forray forever
Forray forever
Forray forever
Forray forever
Taught them with solace
They know a soft caress
To lower your defense
Hide all that you could
Done for the greater good
It's later understood

The wounds that you hoard
Their chloroform
Conjuring remorse
Affiance you tore
Beset those unaware
Are you sad?

Saints that they portray
While they wear away
Their chloroform
Submit to the swarm
In singular form
Beset those unaware
Are you sad?
Beset those unaware
Are you sad?
Demands have been besieged
Safe passage for the meek
Refusal to accede
Deny the preconceived
For the preordained
We no longer grieve
For nothing is concrete
Laid on the sleet
Laid with the reeds
Lay the concrete
Continue the deceit
Pull them by their teeth
The excess is contained
Extracted from the maimed
Deny the preconceived
For the preordained
We no longer grieve

Make you participate
Eyes roll back around
Limbs fall to the ground
Seasoned to procreate
The first to interfere
Are culled before the deer
When they wander into the cage
Stuff their arms and thighs
Then they roll their cardboard eyes
Their skin will never age

If you are being used
You should remain confused
To keep them amused
Flourishing the fire with embers that won’t fade away
Inhale their chloroform

You claim to abhor
Against all progression
Become a possession

Scratch follicles so they don't grow
Expose your shame for all to see
Sell your bones as ivory
Perfume in my blood
Nails grow through the glove
Bruise my embryo
Lay them down lay them down in rows
I sleep for you when you're exhausted
Your first born will be accosted
Fill their lungs with tar and sage
Make the stem cells act their age
Perfume in my blood
Nails grow through the glove
Bruise my embryo
Lay them down lay them down in rows

Anatomically built
This half corpse can't guilt
It's hard to find your insect heart
Now my hand will start to give
How does your body retain blood?
You're my decomposing love
Now I have a hearse to get
Silent scream
Scissored seams
Open you up
Drown in kerosene
What the fuck is this?
When I cut deep you'll think of me
Until your lobotomy
Mutilate the human race
Mangled hearts stitched with leather
I've been waiting for so long
In an effort to uncover what has happened to their salad days?
We can pull a map out detailing the direct route
Young ones grow anxious to proclaim their advances to the fray
If we don't wake up and the truth never comes up
Oh no
Where do all the lovers meet with one another
In an effort to uncover what has happened to the silent days?
Hey!
Hey-oh!

Do they chastise you when you stray
An impression to embed
Born-Again before teething
Collect tears from their weeping
Oh hiding them under the sea foam
Package them like a cheap gift
You're nesting under the corridor
Place the ash on their foreheads

I'm just flesh to give away

They cut you from the stem
You're innocent at birth
Until you understand
Repeat every word that you say to me
They put you to use or put you to sleep
I can't tell you the difference between
An embryo or a planted seed
I know how to cut a wound that will not heal
Consistency of dirt
Insects that spun your silk

They wail for mother's milk

We're here to circumvent

Animals do not repent
Courtesy to intervene
Weathered down my selfish needs
I suffocate
And promise me you won't resuscitate
And if I change my mind it's far too late
I'm wasting my days as I've wasted my nights and I've wasted my youth
You're waiting for something
You've waited in vain because there's nothing for you
Suffocation
Humility yet to be seen
Models made of plasticine
Morality disgrace us now
Entertain and take a bow
I suffocate
And promise me you won't resuscitate
And if I change my mind it's far too late
I'm wasting my days as I've wasted my nights and I've wasted my youth
You're waiting for something
You've waited in vain because there's nothing for you
I know he'd never hurt me
Daddy watch me sleeping
I've been praying for you  silently
Daddy's love makes me whole
Without him  I'm insecure
The only girl he'd ever love
Their kindness is charade
It's used to sedate
They remain unashamed
If you are being used
You should remain confused
To keep them amused
Inhale their chloroform
What you’re longing for
You claim to abhor
Against all progression
Become a possession
Never learn your lesson
Feel complete after it's gone
Don't sleep by my side  sleep on the lawn
It's not too late  you wanted it gone
Through the hosiery
To the armory
To the nothing
How does it feel when you can't feel nothing?
Give that guilt  you shed a newborn
To your feet  it falls to the floor
Itching inside  you still want more
Stillborn fawn  throw it to the door
Through the hosiery
To the armory
To the nothing

Through preteen years of deficiency
Cuts on my hands  but you can't feel nothing

(Hverju sem dynu)
(Ég kyngi tári)
(Og anda hári)
(Illum látum)
(Í faðmi grátum)
(Þegar að við hittumst)
(Þegar að við kyssumst)

Bring it to us
Pleasure our insides
How can your love
Program the head?
We get so fed up with it
Nuts and bolts for granted
As your bodies fall apart
Robotic love
I'm programmed to rust
AIDS robot
Is grinding iron bolts
Robot hunks have one agenda
They wanna play with my placenta
Are we now deserving
When our cyborg parts are burning?
I know we're just diseased appliances
Where will you live?
What will you die for?
Sex is killing me
You might also like
Just because we don't feel flesh"
