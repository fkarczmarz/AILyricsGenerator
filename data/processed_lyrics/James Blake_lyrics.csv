"There's no ten years
Only this
There's no knife
'Cause there's no tension
Only this
Lucid dream of dream of dreams
All I can do is trust in her
Acid rain is a first for her
Are you even real?
Are you even real?
Are you even real?
Well maybe I should study my reflection
Best to know
I spend the day
Dreaming of connection
Just to feel

All I can do is trust in her
Acid rain is a first for her
Are you even real?
Are you even real?

Dream of connection
Tell me how you feel
Tell me how you feel
Are you even real?
Are you even real?
Then she ran
Then she ran
Then she ran her hands through my imagination
Then she ran
Then she ran
Then she ran her hands through my imagination
Dream of connection
Tell me how you feel
Tell me how you feel
Are you even real?
Do your best impression for me
I try my hardest for you
Are you in love?
Are you in love?
Are-are we as one?
Everything desperate leaves behind
Don't take away this one defense of mine
I reserve the right to disappear
I reserve a table for old time
Now what about mine?
Unless you can calm my mind for me
No idea of how many lied to me

Gone through the motions my whole life
I hope this is the first day
That I connect motion to feeling
We spin slowly  we spin slowly 'til morning
Appearance is nothing
Appearance is nothing
Now you're my lover  know that
I fell at your ways
Ashamed lover
When you touch me  I wonder what you would want with me
It feels like a thousand pounds of weight holding your body down in a pool of water  barely reaching your chin
I will assume form  I'll leave the ether
I will assume form  I'll be out of my head this time
I will be touchable by her  I will be reachable
I couldn't tell you where my head goes either

But it wanders 'til I'm high up
Where I'm not all here  and there's no karma
When you touch me  I wonder
I always wonder what you could want with me
I will assume form  I'll leave the ether
I will just fall and be beneath her
I will be touchable  I will be reachable
'Cause I can already see that this goes deeper
Now you can feel everything
Doesn't it seem more natural?
Doesn't it see you float?
Doesn't it feel connective?
Doesn't it see you crying?
Don't you know your best side shows when you're unaware?
Not thinking  just primal
Now you can feel everything
Doesn't it get much clearer?
Doesn't it seem connected?
Doesn't it get you started?
Doesn't it make you happier?
Doesn't it feel more natural?
Doesn't it see you float?
Doesn't it seem much warmer
Cuelando el brillo de Dios
Un rayo cayó en tus ojo'
Y me partió el corazón
Agujerito del cielo
Díctame por dónde ir
Para yo no equivocarme
Y así ver mi porvenir
When you're done with me
I see a negative space
What you've done for me
Who needs to hallucinate?
Who needs to pray? Who?
Who needs balance? I'll see you every day
Barefoot in the park
You start rubbing off on me
Barefoot in the park
You start rubbing off on me
Ya tengo to' lo que quiero
Ya no puedo pedir má'
Cuando te tengo a mi la'o
Lo pasa'o se queda atrá'
Si te apartan de mi vera
Y te tuviera que encontrar
Hasta allá te encontraría
Como el río va a la mar

Without our love and darkening at all
In my hair and in my thoughts
In my hair and in my thoughts
We spend the whole day sore
We're feeling more apart
And we know we can do more
(Mm) It's in your stare and at your core
I know this journey (Will end) soon
The colour of our lights
And our lives they can resume
If I give everything I'll lose everything
Everything is about me
I am the most important thing
And you really haven't thought all those cyclical thoughts for a while?
And as it keeps going
I could never be involved
I could never really see in real time
I could never be involved
And as it keeps on going
I could avoid real time
I could ignore my busy mind
I could avoid contact with eyes
I could avoid going outside
I could avoid wasting my life
I could avoid
I could avoid 20/20 sight
I could avoid standing in line
I could avoid the 405
I could avoid coming to life
I could say anything I like
I could switch off whenever I like
I could sleep whenever I like
But I'd miss it
Don't miss it
Don't miss it like I did

When you get to hang out with your favourite person every day
When the dull pain goes away

When you stop being a ghost in a shell
And everybody keeps saying you look well

Drowning in the sea
A red dawn
Caught up in the sea
All went in the sea
I always saw me love
I will be love befallen
I will lay my teeth
I'll wait for growing
And we both will know
And before you're all gone
Daring on the peak
I've been down to the open road
And we both end up alone (and if only we could have known)
I always saw me love (I will be love befallen)
I will lay my teeth

Conclusions in my ways I've come to take as law
Always you'd be the aftersight
Always you'd be the aftersight
If the car beside you moves ahead
As much as it feels as though you're dead

Behind all the furniture
Pointed toward her

To keep her in my life
I’d already be there
I'll already be there to meet her
She's no traitor
I've got no chaser
For a leg up
I've got no chaser
She's no traitor
For a joint account
She gave me everything that she had left

Anything for herself

Without tact to read
She'd take a shine to me
Beacon don't fly too high

For all your time
Playful crime in rain
Worth it being cold
Roofing for the lanes

With fees and favours gone
Cracks in savers pass
And a white that sometimes shone
Wanton borrowed gun

Kestrels breed

It was beauty and I knew
Sat in a violet room with some people I saw through
Gathered 'round the television's fire
Watching for the people I admired
Outside my words were frozen in my mouth
I couldn't let them out
When I see my willing heart
How will I know?

 everyone’s a writer
 I see the pictures of every life and the day they die
I took it with me
That when things are thrown away like they are daily
Time passes and the constants stay
So if that is how it is
I don’t wanna be a star
But a stone on the shore
A lone doorframe in a wall
When everything’s overgrown
But what she really really wanted was my rights and my wrongs
And I wouldn’t understand but I would try playing along
And I want you to know
I took it with me

And I've been ostracised like a comet

The seven Elohim (Take a fall for me)
Breathe a breath of life inside the human being
Turn this square dance into a passion hug
Tight as the grip of the squid
Gentle as the finger touch of a newborn kid
I wouldn't trade her smile for a million quid
I heard through the grapevine (Take a fall for me)
Candle light dinners of fish and chips with vinegar
(All of me)
With a glass of cold stout or wine or something similar
(All you will is)
Swim the English Channel to the Italian Peninsula
Her strong pheromones with cologne enhance the stench of her (Stay in time)
Don't throw the dice
Don't let them throw the rice
Don't throw my soul over to the poltergeist

Paint your palette blue and grey
Look out on a summer's day
With eyes that know the darkness in my soul
Shadows on the hills
Sketch the trees and the daffodils
Catch the breeze and the winter chills
In colors on the snowy linen land
Now I understand
What you tried to say to me
And how you suffered for your sanity
And how you tried to set them free
They would not listen  they did not know how
Perhaps they'll listen now
Starry  starry night
Flaming flowers that brightly blaze
Swirling clouds in a violet haze
Reflect in Vincent's eyes of china blue
Colors changing hue
Morning fields of amber grain
Weathered faces lined in pain
Are soothed beneath the artist's loving hand

But I could've told you  Vincent
This world was never meant for one as beautiful as you
Starry  starry night
Portraits hung in empty halls
Frameless heads on nameless walls
With eyes that watch the world and can't forget
Like the strangers that you've met
The ragged men in ragged clothes
The silver thorn on the bloody rose
Lie crushed and broken on the virgin snow
Now I think I know

And how you tried to set them free
