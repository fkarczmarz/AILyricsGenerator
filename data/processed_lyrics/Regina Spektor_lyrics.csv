lyrics
"They keep trying to row away
And the captains' worried faces
Stay contorted and staring at the waves
They'll keep hanging in their gold frames
All the rowboats in oil paintings
Hear them whispering French and German
But the most special are the most lonely
In glass coffins they keep coughing

Masterpieces serving maximum sentences
It's their own fault for being timeless
There's a price to pay and a consequence
They're just public mausoleums
The living dead fill every room
But the most special are the most lonely
In glass coffins they keep coughing
They will stay there in their gold frames
All the rowboats in oil paintings
Masterpieces serving maximum sentences
It's their own fault for being timeless
There's a price to pay and a consequence
They will stay there forever and a day
All the rowboats in oil paintings
All the rowboats in oil paintings
You can't break that which isn't yours
I must go on standing
After me comes the flood

After me comes the flood
I must go on standing
You can't break that which isn't yours
I must go on standing
Past all the bars and corner delis
When I heard God call out my name
And we didn't even have to pay
'Cause God is God and he's revered
I'm becoming all alone again
Let the ones who want it bad
Get all the things that make 'em better
Let the ones who don't care feel a thrill

Will you feel anything at all

I'll take two of that
I'm chasing a story I heard
When I was here last
At the back of the class
You pretended you never got lost
When they see you around
You look down at the ground
But when they walk away
You wish they'd stay
Never never mind your bleeding heart
Never never mind your bleeding heart
You can't help but stare
At everyone there
It's you versus everyone else
Your outfit's a crime
You feel their cold minds placing you under arrest
And you serve your time
Drinking all night long
Staring at the walls of your jail-like home
Listening to that song
'Cause it hurts just right
Till everything is gone tonight

And up will come back all the hurt

Find your fathers and your mothers
If you remember who they are
Can't we find something else to pretend?
Like nobody won and we're safe at the end
So let's leave it on
We'll be out in the street
Before anyone knows that we're gone
Just frame the halves and call them a whole
And chip at the bricks and fill up your pockets
With the pieces of the wall that you stole
Everyone's chasing a shot
Nobody wants it to stop
Just frame the halves and call them brothers
Find your fathers and your mothers
If you remember who they are
If I don't got my socks on right
They slide right off of my feet
Carbon monoxide
As I take you home
First time I get my socks on right
But I don't have a gas mask on
You home
Carbon monoxide
Soon we'll go to sleep
No one will notice we're gone
Cause we don't have a job to keep
They'll just say that we're being lazy
They'll just say we're living our whole life in bed

You have my eyes  you have your mother’s name
When you came into the world  you cried
And it broke my heart
I’m dedicating every day to you
Domestic life was never quite my style
When you smile
You knock me out  I fall apart
And I thought I was so smart
You will come of age with our young nation
We’ll bleed and fight for you  we’ll make it right for you
If we lay a strong enough foundation
We’ll pass it on to you  we’ll give the world to you
And you’ll blow us all away…

Others said it must have been the weather
The neighbors were trying to keep it quiet
But I swear that I could hear the laughter
So they jokingly nicknamed it the porridge
'Cause overnight that lake had turned as thick as butter
Saying that to them it doesn't matter
If you just hold in your breath 'til you've come back up in full
The genius next door was busing tables
Wiping clean the ketchup bottle labels
Getting high and mumbling German fables
Didn't care as long as he was able
To strip his clothes off by the dumpsters
At night while everyone was sleeping
And wade midway into that porridge
Just him and his secret he was keeping

Where all the bellhops smoke with the guards

Run to the old lake house where it begins
Under the floorboards there's a deep well
That leads to a spring that sprung up in hell
That's where old devils danced and kissed
And made their blood pacts in the ancient myths
And running through forest they screamed in chorus
While piercing fair maidens' chests with their horns
And then they lay in the grass 'til the dawn came
Sleeping away 'til the dawn came
Lay in the grass where now stands the Grand Hotel
The maître d' and a fancy chef

Born to him a thirty second time
Born to him with my hair still on
Born to him with two eyebrows on
And that's all I was wearing

But not at all a sex machine
Thought the world to be quite obscene
But she'd retire to her chambers
And we remain quite strangers

But the songs were remembered
And time just passed
You're around 'til you're not around
And that's all I need to know
Every time you decide to stay
Then the world will make you go
And that's all you need to know
Enjoy your youth
Sounds like a threat
Enjoy your youth
Sounds like a threat
It feels a little worse
Than when we drove our hearse
Right through that screaming crowd
While laughing up a storm
Until we were just bone
Until it got so warm
That none of us could sleep
And all the Styrofoam
Began to melt away
We tried to find some worms
To aid in the decay
But none of 'em were home
Inside their catacomb
A million ancient bees
Began to sting our knees
While we were on our knees
Praying that disease
Would leave the ones we love
And never come again

On the radio
We heard November Rain
That solo's really long
But it's a pretty song
We listened to it twice
'Cause the DJ was asleep
This is how it works
You're young until you're not
You love until you don't
You try until you can't
You laugh until you cry
You cry until you laugh
And everyone must breathe
Until their dying breath
You peer inside yourself
You take the things you like
Then try to love the things you took
And then you take that love you made
And stick it into some
Someone else's heart
Pumping someone else's blood
And walking arm in arm
You hope it don't get harmed
But even if it does
You'll just do it all again
On the radio
You'll hear November Rain
That solo's awful long
But it's a good refrain
You'll listen to it twice
'Cause the DJ is asleep
On the radio (oh)
On the radio
The helium balloon inside your room has come undone
And it's pushing up at the ceiling
And the flickering lights it cannot get beyond
Everyone takes turns
Now it's yours to play the part
And they're sitting all around you
Holding copies of your chart
And the misery inside their eyes is
Synchronized and reflecting it to yours
Hold on
One more time with feeling
Say it in your mind until you know that the words are right
This is why we fight
You thought by now you'd be
So much better than you are
You thought by now they'd see
That you had come so far
And the pride inside their eyes
Would synchronize into a love you've never known
So much more than you've been shown

 they're just old light
 I cut his hair myself one night
 the morning light
 we couldn't bring the columns down
 we couldn't destroy a single one
 not even once
Buy up old roses
They pull off dead petals
Like old heads of lettuce
And sell ’em as new ones
For cheaper and fairer
But they die by the morning
So who is the winner?
Not the roses
Not the buyers
Not the sellers
Maybe winter
Cause winter is coming
Soon after summer
Chasing off Autumn
We go from a warm sun to only a white sun
We go from a large sun to only a small one
When I was a small girl I walked through the market
At night there were roses lit up in glass boxes
The heat-lamps would keep them from freezing in winter

We never bought them but somebody must have
Maybe they made it or maybe they froze up
Before any person had put them in water
And hoped that they’d still be alive by the morning
Who’s the winner?
Not the roses

Not the sellers
Not the tellers
Of these stories
Not the fathers
Not their children
Not those waking
On a dark night
Through a memory
They’re forgetting
Who’s the winner? Who’s the winner?
Somebody steps on a light through a tunnel
They’re holding a piece of their mind in the rubble
Hold on I won’t let go
I want to know
But no one lives long enough
To see the outcome
To know any answers
To know what the point is
To know if the winter
Ever came closer
Than on that night
When I walked with my father
A small piece of ice
Lodged in my mind
Who’s the winner?
Not the roses
Not the buyers
Not the sellers
Not the tellers

All the poets in the alley coughing up blood
And their visions and their dreams are coming up red
They can either wake up or go deeper

And gave half of it to me
We sat there looking at the faces
Of the strangers in the pages
'Til we knew them mathematically
They were in our minds until forever
So we made our own computer
Out of macaroni pieces
And it did our thinking while we lived our lives
It counted up our feelings
And divided them up even
And it called our calculation perfect love
Didn't even know that love was bigger

We struck them hard against each other

No need to say goodbye
Just because everything's changing
Doesn't mean it's never been this way before
All you can do is try to know who your friends are
As you head off to the war
Pick a star on the dark horizon and follow the light
You'll come back when it's over
No need to say goodbye
You'll come back when it's over
