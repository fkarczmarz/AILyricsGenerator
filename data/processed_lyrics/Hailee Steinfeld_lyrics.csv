lyrics
"As the candle's burning low
Dress me in whatever you like
Why you play with me?
Every time your name  it leaves my lips
Burning still  like words left unsaid
Remind me I'm alive
Will you love me when my heartbeat stops?
When my heartbeat stops  will you stay mine? (Mine)
Will you promise me you'll search for us?
Will you find me after life? (Life)
Oh  for better or for worse
Will death be our last kiss  my love? (Love)
Will you promise me you'll search for us?
Will you find me after life? (Life)
My ear is buzzing
Immortality is bliss
You put me down  then put me on a pedestal
Now that I'm gone  you're gonna miss me

Every time your name  it leaves my lips
Burning still  like words left unsaid
Remind me I'm alive
Will you love me when my heartbeat stops?
When my heartbeat stops  will you stay mine? (Mine)
Will you promise me you'll search for us?
Will you find me after life? (Life)
Oh  for better or for worse
Will death be our last kiss  my love? (Love)
Will you promise me you'll search for us?
Will you find me after life? (Life)
Candle's burning
Will you find  will you find me after life?
Will you love (Will you love) in the afterlife?
Will you love (Will you love)  will you love me?
Will you love (Will you love) in the afterlife?
Will you love (Will you love)  will you love me?
Will you love me when my heartbeat stops?
When my heartbeat stops  will you stay mine?
Will you promise me you'll search for us?
Will you find me after life? (Life)
Oh  for better or for worse
Will death be our last kiss  my love? Oh-oh
When my heartbeat stops  will you stay mine?
Ooh  afterlife
Transcending us through space and time
It's holdin' up
It keeps you and me intertwined
What's a pipe dream if you ain't tryin' to do it?
What's a heartbreak if you ain't cryin' all through it?
What's a sunset if you ain't ridin' into it?
Let's drive into it
What's a pipe dream if you ain't tryin' to do it?
What's a heartbreak if you ain't cryin' all through it?
What's a sunset if you ain't ridin' into it?
Let's drive into it
'Cause I'm bringin' you back to life (Back)
And I know that you're gone but I swear that you're here
It's a feelin' that won't disappear
And you're bringin' me back to life (Back)
I was lookin' for somethin' that I couldn't find
It's a feeling you give me inside

Ayy-oh
Time gonna go  so never waste 
Champagne kids  but it ain't no smoke show
Ayy-oh
Time gonna go  so never waste 
I know what diamonds do  but don't let that hit you
It's you
You got control to let it all go
Crash and burn but it ain't my issue
It's you
'Cause I got the love
I wonder why we got the spark
If it's the vibe then don't deny
Keep goin' up (Uh)

Watch you and hide all of the time
Just 'cause they're blinded by the light

I can't help but really want to tell everybody
How you got away with words
You could put my heart in a hearse

أنا فقط أكره كل الأذى الذي أصابني به
وأنني ألوم نفسي على السماح لك بذلك
هل تعلم أني كنت أعرف بالفعل؟
لا يمكن حتى رؤيتك من خلال الدخان
أنظر إلى الوراء ، ربما كان علي أن أعرف
لكني أردت فقط أن أصدق أنك كنت تنام بمفردك في الخارج
أحببتني بأسوأ نواياك
لم أتوقف حتى عن السؤال
في كل مرة كنت تحرقني
لا أعرف كيف ؛ للحظة شعرت وكأنها الجنة
أحببتني بأسوأ نواياك
رسم لنا نهاية سعيدة
في كل مرة كنت تحرقني
لا أعرف كيف ؛ للحظة شعرت وكأنها الجنة
وهو أمر مؤلم للغاية
الوقوع في الاتجاه الخاطئ
على أطراف أصابع قدمي
لكن ما زلت لا أستطيع الوصول إلى غرورك
أعتقد أنني كنت مجنونًا لأعطيك جسدي وعقلي
لا أعرف ما كنت أفكر فيه حتى الآن
يعتقد الجميع أنك شخص آخر
حتى أنك أقنعت نفسك

Heartbeat as cold as a glacier
You told me I was your savior
We used to burn up like paper
So don't let this fire burn out yet
'Cause we've got a lot to burn
Don't let this fire burn out yet
So we don't have to say that at least we tried
How much does it take for a heart to break?

I know that it can get crazy
Love me and sometimes you hate me

Is speaking different languages
With that green prescription fog
Blowing out their faces
And they all look me up and down like I'm the fucking new kid
But I saw the sun rise on this town way before you did
And they're all skiing in the powder room
Making love to Jack and Jameson
But I'll stick with hell no's and headphones
Cause all of my friends are leaving soon
But I'll be here in this stranger's room
Just for now
Don't want another drink
I'm going home
Twenty-seven blocks ago
I didn't even say goodbye
People blowin' up my phone
Askin' me if I'm alright

Wide awake again  I'm prayin' I make it
I'm steppin' the twelve  but it's somewhere I've already been
Diamonds won't fool me 'cause I'm too far gone
Wish I could get back the air in my lungs
I've been so fucked up  it's bad for my heart
My heart
So  no more I love you's
It's too easy to say  yeah
No more I love you's
Until I'm okay  yeah

I blamed it on my eyes closed
I blamed it on the world like it owes me

And you're wondering what to do
Listen up
'Cause I have some advice for you
Let's try
Let's say you're building a tower
And you want to make it higher
But you run out of blocks
Don't you give up
Get inspired

Keep trying new ideas
An oatmeal container
A wooden bowl
A plastic water bottle
And a paper towel roll
It worked!
Let's try
Let's try
To seeing shows in evening clothes with you
From nervous touch and getting drunk
To staying up and waking up with you
Now we're sleeping near the edge
Holding something we don't need
All this delusion in our heads is gonna bring us to our knees
Just let it be
Everything that's broke
Leave it to the breeze
And I'll be me
From throwing clothes across the floor
To teeth and claws and slamming doors at you
If this is all we're living for

I used to recognize myself
It's funny how reflections change
When we're becoming something else
I think it's time to walk away
Just let it be
Everything that's broke
Leave it to the breeze
And I'll be me
Tryna fit your hand inside of mine
When we know it just don't belong
Tryna push this problem up the hill
When it's just too heavy to hold
I think now's the time to let it slide
Just let it be
Everything that's broke
Leave it to the breeze
Let the ashes fall
Forget about me
Just let it be
Acting like a fool  breaking all the rules
It's how it feels  to be young
Oh-oh-oh-oh  oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Take a chance  sing out of key
Dance under the stars  just being who we are
It’s how it feels  to be young
