"You are now rockin'
With 50 Cent
You gotta love it
I just wanna chill and twist the lye
Catch stunts in my 7-45
Need to see you and feel you next to me
Got some questions that I got to ask
Would you love me if I was down and out?
Would you still have love for me?
Would you love me if I was down and out?
Would you still have love for me?
If I got locked up and sentenced to a quarter century
Could I count on you to be there to support me mentally?
If I went back to a hooptie from a Benz
Would you poof and disappear like some of my friends?
I'm askin' questions to find out how you feel inside
If I ain't rap 'cause I flip burgers at Burger King
Would you be ashamed to tell your friends you're feelin' me?

Would you love me if I was down and out?
Would you still have love for me?
Would you love me if I was down and out?
Would you still have love for me?
Now would you leave me if your father found out I was thuggin'?
Are you mad 'cause I'm askin' you twenty-one questions?
Do you trust me enough to tell me your dreams?
If I was with some other chick and someone happened to see
And when you asked me about it I said it wasn't me
How deep is our bond if that's all it takes for you to be gone?
I love you like a fat kid love cake
Would you love me if I was down and out?
Would you still have love for me?
Would you love me if I was down and out?
Would you still have love for me?
Could you love me in a Bentley?
Could you love me on a bus?
I'll ask twenty-one questions and they all about us
Could you love me in a Bentley?
Could you love me on a bus?

I was innocent then  I ain’t do no wrong
Sunday morning I was so sharp  all did up
It was welfare or hustlin'  they killed her for that
The first shot  bullet wound in my back
Now I’m on my own  mommy gone
You need no new kicks  you need an O”
That touched me  it hit me in my heart
I am what I am  Sabrina’s only baby
Practicing in the mirror  pulling out my .380
Oh man  I fucked up nana gonna kill me
Whenever shit can go wrong it always will  see
Seven grams of cocaine  three grams of dope
Saint Mary medallion hanging from my rope
Try to punk me and my gun smoke
Give ‘em my description  I ain’t bullshittin'
My high school sweetheart love didn’t last long
Niggas start flashing that bread and she was gone
That hurt me like the bullet in my calf then
My next girl was a pain in the ass
I got two shots left  in case niggas try to get me
That’s nine shots  we just call it Fifty

I'm not that genie in a bottle  I'm in a bag
Take one hit and slide off to the Land of H  man
When we first met  I thought you'd never doubt me
Tie your arm up  put that lighter under that spoon
I'm back  bitch—don't ever try that again
All the shit I did for you  I made you feel good
We have a love thing  you treatin' this like it's just a fling
What we have is more sacred than a vow or a ring
If you give birth  I'll already be in love with your kids
Listen  I don't give a damn if your ass starts smokin'
But we have a bond that is not to be broken
But you need me  can you see you're addicted to me?
Fucking with me  you can be all you can be
We got a love thing  girl you tried to leave me
But you need me  can you see you're addicted to me?
Fucking with me  you can be all you can be

Heard she bisexual  she fuck with that girl
After that first night she fall in love  then chase the feelin
I hung out with Marvin when he wrote Sexual Healing
Kurt Cobain—we were good friends  Ozzy Osbourne  too
I be with rock stars—see  you lucky I'm fucking with you
I chilled with Frankie Lymon and Jimi Hendrix crew
I live the lavish life  listen  if the mood is right
I never steer you wrong  if you hyper  I make you calm
I'll be your incentive  a reason for you to move forward
Let's make a date  promise me you'll come to see me
Even if it means you have to sell your mama's TV
I love you—love me back  no one said loving me'd be easy
But you need me  can you see you're addicted to me?
Fucking with me  you can be all you can be
We got a love thing  girl you tried to leave me
But you need me  can you see you're addicted to me?
Fucking with me  you can be all you can be (I love you)
I got you barefooted on glass  chasing a dove
That monkey on your back symbolizes my love
Over and over you hurt me  my love is unconditional
They talk to you when you up  when you down  they got nothing to say
They set you up to let you down  they crowned you prom queen
They know 'bout me  behind your back  they call you a fucking fiend
Can we just be alone so I can kiss and hug you?
Push me inside you  no other man can love you like I do
I find pleasure in pleasing you like a real man should
It was written long before us  it was carved in a tree
There's more to life than laughter  what brought us together was fate
And we'll be hand in hand when you walk through those pearly gates
And to see to that  I'ma do whatever it takes
But you need me  can you see you're addicted to me?
Fucking with me  you can be all you can be
We got a love thing  girl you tried to leave me
But you need me  can you see you're addicted to me?

She know that it's right here for her
I wanna see her break it down (Yeah)
She doing her thing out on the floor
The way she shake it make you wanna hit it
Think she double-jointed from the way she split it
Got your head fucked up from the way she did it
She so much more than you used to
She know just how to move to seduce you
She gon' do the right thing and touch the right spots
And dance in your lap 'til you ready to pop

Watching her do her thing on all fours

When you puttin on your lotion I can help you with that
I sit and think of things to say that may make you smile
Or give you gifts from my heart to reflect my style
Or slang I use when we build may change how you talk
And if I'm focused while I'm strokin I could change how you walk
There's a swagger that you calm but when you come from New York
I'm a hustler I just hustle and the things that I bought
Now we can watch some TV or play a CD  baby that sexual healin'

I just come from the poorest part
This is where it goes down
I just happen to come up hard
I never took a straight path nowhere  life's full of twist and turns
I'm from that city full of yellow cabs and skyscrapers
It's hard to get a start in these parts without paper
That corner every 15 minutes they moving seven
Pure snow  bag it then watch it go
Occupational options  get some blow or some hoes
Shoot the ball or the strap  learn to rap or to jack
This my regal royal flow  my James Bond bounce
That 007  that 62 on my count
I'm a undercover liar  I lie under the covers
Look a bitch in the eyes and tell her ''baby  I love it''
You're my inspiration  you're my motivation
You're the reason that I'm moving it with no hesitation

I just come from the poorest part
This is where it goes down
I just happen to come up hard
I gotta hustle through the hustle and bust while I make a move
Manuever around the rats and wolves  I'm from the school
Graveyard  pick a block cause niggas want your spots
I'm trying to stack shit then I go legit
Hollow tip  stuff 'em in a clip case niggas trip
My cocaine endeavours give me corporate ties
I'm supposed to lose  watch me win against the odds
All I got is my word  balls and my instinct
I'm trying to make it  we already made it my friends think
We already on top  I got a bigger plan
No more controlled substances or hand to hand
White collar visions  game changing mission
Perfect position  watch me transition
From caterpillar to butterfly in the sky

Keep goin' until you hit the spot  woah
You could have it your way  how do you want it?
You gon' back that thing up or should I push up on it?
Dance floor jam-packed  hot as a tea kettle
If you be a nympho  I be a nympho
In the hotel or in the back of the rental
On the beach or in the park  it's whatever you into
Got the magic stick  I'm the love doctor
Have your friends teasin' you 'bout how sprung I got you
Wanna show me you could work it  baby? No problem
Get on top  then get to bounce around like a low rider
I'm a seasoned vet when it come to this shit
After you work up a sweat  you could play with the stick

Isn't it ironic  how erotic it is to watch her in thongs?
Had me thinkin' 'bout that ass after I'm gone
I touched the right spot at the right time
Lights on or lights off  she like it from behind
So seductive  you should see the way she whine
Her hips in slow-mo on the floor when we grind

Too young to understand the consequences of a man living a lie
Gotta watch my back around these niggas 'cause they funny
Smoking that bong 'cause I need it
Bogged in the dirt from shots flurried
Laying with bugs under my shirt
I sit back and wonder when them angels gon' call my number
Man these teenie boppers see me on these magazine covers
Like it's all fun and games 'til they shoot 'em up bang
And you see your brains hang and you see we ain't playing
Ain't saying we ain't laying down at night and ain't praying
I'ma start laying into these motherfucking cocksuckers (C'mon)
How would I look as a man bowing to his knees?

This ain't Batman  Robin  Cagney or Lacey
It's 50 Cent and Shady  the worst  baby

Put a hole through your front and your back  maybe
But go 'head  you try me
I'll have your ass hooked up to an IV
I leave no witnesses when I ride  B
You fuck with me  you'll see
I react like a animal and tear you apart
If a masterpiece was murder I'd major in art
Niggas know I was wrapped too tight from the start
But being a little off landed me on top of the charts (Woo!)
So you take the good with the bad  I guess
Level three Teflon plate on my chest
Hammer cocked back  hollow tip in the chamber  danger
Anger'll change ya  and make you aim that and squeeze

Gatman  if there's a problem I'ma solve it
A nigga movin' around with a big-ass revolver
And a Batman
What the fuck  are you retarded?
You touch Shady  I'll leave you dearly departed
Nigga  you get it twisted  you gon' get your wig splitted
I don't give a fuck  I don't care if police know I did it
Man I hustle  I get money in the sunshine or a blizzard
I go hard for that paper  homie  I just gotta get it
Got a money scheme  you plot it  you can count me in I'm with it
You cross me  you gon' make a cemetery visit
That's gangsta  you know me  I talk it 'cause I live it
Shell cases drop  when that chopper chop  way up the block
Get hit with copper tops  when the drama pop  the llama pop
And it won't stop  you can run call the cops
This ain't new  niggas know how I be on it
That shit you got  put my pistol to you  I want it
It's not a game  perfect aim
You feel the flame up against your brain
Man it's so hot  I'll make you wish it rained
I got a Gatman  if there's a problem I'ma solve it
A nigga movin' around with a big-ass revolver
And a Batman
What the fuck  are you retarded?
Now what y'all niggas know about the dirty South?
One time
Lord forgive me  for I've sinned
Over and over again just to stay on top
I recall memories  filled with sin
Over and over again  and again (And again and again)
Yo  when you hear talk of the Southside  you hear talk of the Team
See niggas feared Prince and respected 'Preme
For all you slow motherfuckers  I'ma break it down iller
See Preme was the business man and Prince was the killer
Remember  he used to push the bulletproof BM  uh-huh
His hair'll get you seasick  I sat back and peeped shit
They rolled with E-Z Wider then  they ain't get blunted
Had the whole projects working for 50 on 500
As a youth  all I ever did was sell crack  I used to idolize Cat
Hurt me to my heart to hear that nigga snitched on Pap
How he go out like that?
Rumors in the hood was Just was snitching
I ain't believe that  pa  he helped me cop my first GSXR
Had the 4-runner  the Z  the 5 and the 3
Used to drive his truck through the hood dragging jet skis
From Gerald Wallace to Baby Wise  don't be surprised
Of how freely I throw out names of guys who dealt with pies
Like L.A. and Wise  L got shot in the neck  then told his connect
Them niggas who shot them got 'em for ten bricks
Fucking Dominicans  turned around and gave 'em more bricks

Lord forgive me  for I've sinned
Over and over again just to stay on top
I recall memories  filled with sin
Over and over again  and again (And again and again)
That first verse is just a dose of the shit that I'm on
Consider this the first chapter in the ghetto's Qu'ran
I know a lot of niggas that get dough like Bimmy and Joe
And Prince and Righteous from Hillside with the mole on his nose
Throughout my struggles in the hood  I started learning
Life's a bitch with a pretty face  but she burning
Man  I'ma get cheese like Chaz then run through whips like Cigar
Gamble all the time like country-curly head Prince and Tah-Tah
Po-po under pressure too  they know what they facing
Go against crews like Bebo and killers like Pappy Mason
A lot of niggas I know been corrupted since birth
Types to rob nuns for fun  for everything they worth
I know some cats that held down whole complexes like Corley Wall
Together niggas stand and divided they fall
Round here  shook niggas they keep it in motion
Come around here with your Rollie  you can get robbed like Ocean
Lord knows  Tommy had Laurelton sold
Helicopters  Rolls Royces with Louis Vuitton interior
Might sound like I'm fantasizing  but  son  I'm dead serious
Montana was no dummy  brought business to wash the money
Had money out the ass  he politic like the Asians
Feds couldn't catch him dirty so settled for tax evasion
Lord forgive me  for I've sinned
Over and over again just to stay on top
I recall memories  filled with sin
Over and over again  and again (And again and again)
Yo  rest in peace to Rich and Ron  money what they was about  yo
The twins was from Queens but got crazy cream with Alpo
Throughout my time  I heard tales of Himey  Frenchy
Jamaican Pauly  Duckie Corley  Ronnie Bumps and Chick  shit
A lot of niggas flow the way I flow
But ain't been in the game all their life so don't know who I know
Writing rhymes is the best way I express how I feel
If I ain't rich by twenty-six  I'll be dead or in jail
Coming up  I heard sipping too much booze'll leave you confused
And if you watch the news  you see players in this game  they lose
I'm forgetting Lefty and Jazz  Pretty Tony and Lance
Head Luc  Mel son  Troy and E Money Bags
In a conversation over shrimp and lobster at Benihana's
Heard Chico stopped boxing  and started robbing diners
Shout out to Clarence and Clutch  Bob Dre  Black Will
If the flow don't kill you  the MAC will
Lord forgive me  for I've sinned
Over and over again just to stay on top
I recall memories  filled with sin
Uh-huh
Comin up I was confused  my mommy kissin a girl
Confusion occurs comin up in the cold world
Daddy ain't around  probably out commitin felonies
I wanna live good  so shit I sell dope
For a four finger ring  one of them gold ropes
Nana told me if I passed I'd get a sheepskin coat
If I can move a few packs I'd get the hat  now that'd be dope
Tossed and turned in my sleep that night
Woke up the next mornin  niggas had stole my bike
I'd run away from this bitch and never come back if I could
Hate it or love it  the underdog's on top
And I'm gon' shine homey until my heart stop
Go 'head envy me  I'm rap's M.V.P
And I ain't goin' nowhere  so you can get to know me

At my last show I threw away my N.W.A. gold
I had the whole crowd yellin Free Yayo!
So niggas better get up outta mine
For I creep and turn your projects into Columbine
And I'm rap's MVP
Don't make me remind y'all what happened in D.C
This nigga ain't Gotti  he pretend
Mad at us cause Ashanti got a new boyfriend

The cold world that we in  is full of pressure and pain
I thought it would change  it's stayin' the same
How many of them boys is witcha'
When you had that little TV you had to hit on to get a picture
I'm walking with a snub  cause niggas do a lot of slick talkin
In the club 'til they coughin on the rug
Ain't never had much but a Walkman and a bud
My role model is gone snortin up his drug
Bad enough they want me to choke
My boy just got poked in the throat
Now it's an RIP shirt in my coat
Now I'm speedin  reminiscin
Holdin my weed in  never listen
If I see him I'mma lift 'em
And maybe that'll even the score
But if not  it'll be me on the floor

I started out at 15  scared as hell
I took 30 off a pack and made them sales
As a youth  man I used to hustle for loot
With that lil deuce-deuce and my triple fat goose
Sippin Easy Jesus  rockin a leases
My momma whipped me when she found my pieces
I look back on life and thank God I'm blessed
We the best on the planet so forget the rest
You know I'm still nice with my cook game
Look man  it's a hood thang  that's why I'm loved in Brook-lyn
I handle mine just like a real nigga should
If I do some time homey  I'm still all good
Let me show you what a thug bout  born to die
I took the bullets outta 50 put 'em in my fo'-five
And I ain't even got my feet wet yet

I'll kill you  I ain't playin'
Keep thinking I'm candy 'til your fucking skull get popped
And your brain hop out the top like Jack-in-the-box (Yeah)
In the hood  summertime is the killing season
It's hot out this bitch  that's a good enough reason (Woo)
I've seen gangstas get religious when they start bleeding
Saying Lord  Jesus help me 'cause they ass leaking
When that window roll down and that AK come out
You can squeeze your little handgun 'til you run out
And you can run for your backup
But them machine gun shells gon' tear your back up
God's on your side? Shit  I'm aight with that

Locked up  I was in a box by myself
I done made myself a millionaire by myself
I done heard about the fifty grand you put in the hood
But your shooter finna get shot  it won't do him no good
With a pistol  I define the definition of pain
If you survive  your bones'll still fucking hurt when it rains

Man  my homies then wan' do whatever I wan' do

Now when it comes to bad bitches you know I got them
You know a nigga wanna see how Cali girls freak off
After that five hour flight from New York
Then we can go from fully dressed to just havin' no clothes
Then she can run and tell her best friend 'bout my sex game
In the jewelry store lookin' at shit you can't buy
In the dealership tryna get a test drive
 but that's okay
 I don't like y'all anyway
 my whip talk for me
 they wanna blow me
 I don't give a fuck now
 uh-huh)
 capsules come down
 I'm nowhere to be found
 they don't even stash tracks
 right there in they ass crack (Yeah)
 I don't pretend to
 the nigga that sold dope
 the thug that pop clips
 I make a blind man see (Woo)
 fuck around and leave you
 I don't believe you
 then slide off in the six
 so I spray random
 but my moms think I'm handsome
 she say shit
 drive by and tear your block up
 50 really shitted on 'em
 fuck around and leave you
 I don't believe you
 uh-huh)
 and they say they got a fast car
 truck with a crash bar
 pa
 I ain't lying
 keep my wrist lit up
 I get you hit up (Woo)
 you better watch what you say
 you could get shot and carried away
 you get killed like that
 you ain't built like that
 fuck around and leave you
 I don't believe you"
