"Just so I could feel this way
Out of control  irrational
Now that you're stuck on my brain
Something 'bout the way you're following my lead
Says you wanna leave the party with me
I've been hearin' love songs playin' in my dreams
I got your name written all over me
We're in this together  an infinite high
And we can keep on dancing all night
We don't need forever  but now it feels right
Yeah  we can keep on dancing all night
And we can keep on dancing all night
Yeah  we can keep on dancing all night
Where have you been? Been wondering
It's like I knew you from the start
Don't leave for long  but if you're gone
I'm still good when we're apart

I'll give my lifetime of devotion
A love like yours is hard to find
And I would drive out through the night
And I would fight a samurai
And I would run five hundred miles

With a little red dress looking for some love
She's out of luck
But if you ask her  What you're smiling for?

All she got is a soul

A little bit of jojo dancing
A little bit of thoughts of mine coming out the mind of this midnight rambler
I can't wait til these tunes of mine get me out of this local jam
Get up up on that big stage now
Show the world just who the heck I am
Ever think if it all goes right
You got something that could change your life
Use that moment just to show your life
Everything is gonna be alright....
I'm screaming til the stars collide
Takin back the way we are
Cause that's just the way we are

They say if you look around for something hard enough and you just might find it
And there's some around who wanna keep you down but Shawty don't be blinded
Time to turn this thing upside down
Show these people what you really mean
Everything that you could lose your mind
Could it be the big dream you'll find
No more waiting cuz it's almost time
Everything is gonna be alright....
I'm screaming til the stars collide
Takin back the way we are
Cause that's just the way we are
Hope I feel this forever
Or even if it's just tonight
I can see the end much clearer
Even when I close my eyes
Tryna keep myself from falling
Tryna get this thing right
I gotta do this more often
I'm screaming til the stars collide
Takin back the way we are
Cause that's just the way we are
Loading up a cannonball

Too stoned  don't know what I did last night
Hangin' with my niggas gettin' drunk
Smokin' weed and doin' what we want
We live our lives and ain't no one gon' bring us down
Staying out  sleeping when we can cause we don't stop
Going hard  wake up in the morning do it all again
Let's live for today  we might not be here tomorrow
And they say I'm too wild
They said I'm too fun
They say it's too much
But too much ain't enough
Cause we just want more  more
We just want more  more
Every time I hear the music
I go crazy
Floating there you take me away
Higher than we've ever been before
Take me to the clouds
Take me to the clouds
Take me to the clouds
Take me to the clouds

Standing on the couch  just showing love
Don't give a damn  don't give a fuck
Floating and take me away
High up in the clouds  never coming down
Somewhere out in space  never on the ground
Always turning up  never turning down
Another hundred grand  soon as I turn around
Take me up to where I wanna be
Tired as fuck  but we don't wanna sleep
Mary Jane and them paper planes
Pouring shots  you better take this drink
And they say I'm too wild
They say I'm too fun
They say it's too much
But too much ain't enough (Y'all already know what it is  man)
Cause we just want more  more (So let's get enough)
We just want more  more (We're tryina break the mirror)
They say I'm too wild
They say I'm too fun
They say it's too much
But too much ain't enough
Cause we just want more  more
We are unstoppable
All I see is love
I walk around with it all over my shoulders
For the both of us
I'm a traveling  traveling man
Love the universe  any way I can
I'll be gone  I'll be gone 'till November
Girl  I hope you understand
I'm a rolling  rolling stone
Where I lay my head is my home
I don't wanna see you cry no more
Just be who you are
When they tell you You don't matter
Tell them you're the only thing that matters
Wave your flag (Yeah yeah yeah)
Wave your flag (Yeah yeah yeah)
When the world gets cold and you feel alone  you're not alone
Now wave it

You could change the world by the way you speak
But every word you hear is every word you say
I could see the feelings written on your face
You don't believe in love
You don't believe it's true
You don't know where I go
You don't know what I do
If I could make you see the way it's supposed to be
Only love could set you free
We'll be ok (yoh oh)
Music will play (yoh oh)
We'll be ok (yoh oh)
We'll be ok (yoh oh)
Music will play (yoh oh)
We'll be ok (yoh oh)
A hundred years from now
Maybe we'll turn around and
See the flowers growing in the battle grounds
When we can build a world that's made of different shades
I still believe in love
I still believe it's true
I'm takin' where I've been and see what I can do
I'm tryna make you see the way it ought to be
Only love could set you free
