lyrics
"I've got to go away (But  baby  it's cold outside)
This evening has been (Been hoping that you'd drop in)
So very nice (I'll hold your hands  they're just like ice)
My mother will start to worry (Beautiful  what's your hurry?)
My father will be pacing the floor (Listen to the fireplace roar)
So really  I'd better scurry (Beautiful  please don't hurry)
But maybe just half a drink more (Put some records on while I pour)
The neighbors might think (Baby  it's bad out there)
Say  what's in this drink? (No cabs to be had out there)
I wish I knew how (Your eyes are like starlight now)
To break the spell (I'll take your hat  your hair looks well)
At least I'm gonna say that I tried (What's the sense in hurting my pride?)
I really can't stay (Baby  don't hold out)
Baby (Oh  but)
It's cold outside
You might also like
I simply must go (But  baby  it's cold outside)
The answer is no (But  baby  it's cold outside)
This welcome has been (How lucky that you dropped in)
So nice and warm (Look out the window at that storm)
My sister will be suspicious (Gosh  your lips look delicious)
My brother will be there at the door (Waves upon a tropical shore)
My maiden aunt's mind is vicious (Ooh  your lips are delicious)
But maybe just a cigarette more (Never such a blizzard before)
I've gotta get home (But  baby  you'd freeze out there)
Say  lend me your coat (It's up to your knees out there)
You've really been grand (I thrill when you touch my hair)
But don't you see (How can you do this thing to me?)
There's bound to be talk tomorrow (Think about a lifelong sorrow)
At least there will be plenty implied (If you caught pneumonia and died)
I really can't stay (Get over that hold out)
Ooh  baby (Oh  but)
Just put your paws up
'Cause you were born this way  baby
My mama told me when I was young
We are all born superstars
She rolled my hair and put my lipstick on
In the glass of her boudoir
There's nothing wrong with loving who you are
So hold your head up girl and you'll go far
Listen to me when I say...
I'm beautiful in my way
'Cause God makes no mistakes
Don't hide yourself in regret
Just love yourself and you're set
Oooh  there ain't no other way
Baby  I was born this way
Baby  I was born this way
Oooh  there ain't no other way
Baby  I was born this way

 it didn't mend my broken heart
 you don't know pain
 I did it)
 no
 babe
 hey
 hey
I only see gray
When everybody sees the rainbow
I'm stuck in the rain
You take a little piece of me
Every time you leave
I don't think that I'll
Ever find that silver lining
Or a reason to smile
You know I used to paint such vibrant dreams
When did my heart get so full
Did you know that you stole
The only thing I needed
Always black and white in my eyes
I'm colorblind
Ain't it funny that you managed
To just wash away
Even pictures that you're not in
Have started to fade
You might also likeI try to play my favorite songs
But I can't sing along
The words don't feel the same
You've taken all the best things from me
And thrown them away
You know I used to paint such vibrant dreams
When did my heart get so full
Did you know that you stole
The only thing I needed
Always black and white in my eyes
I'm colorblind
I'll wait
For roses to be red again
And I hate
That you took my blue from the ocean
Give me back green greens and goldens
How long will I be broken?
You know I used to paint such vibrant dreams
When did my heart get so full
Did you know that you stole
The only thing I needed
Only black and white in my eyes
I'm colorblind
It's only black and white in my eyes
 losin' my mind  losin' control
 they're staring at me  whoa oh
 I should have found by now
 come down
 coming up now  out of the blue oh
 they're looking for my heart
 I should have found by now
 oh
 losing my mind  losing control
 I should have found by now
 oh whoa
Something is not the same
I'm through with playing by the rules
Of someone else's game
Too late for second guessing
Too late to go back to sleep
It's time to trust my instincts
Close my eyes and leap
It's time to try defying gravity
I think I'll try defying gravity
And you won't bring me down
I'm through accepting limits
'Cause someone says they're so
Some things I cannot change

Too long I've been afraid of
It comes at much too high a cost

And you won't bring me down
Bring me down
Life's candy and the sun's a ball of butter
Don't bring around a cloud to rain on my parade
Don't tell me not to fly  I've simply got to
If someone takes a spill  it's me and not you
Who told you you're allowed to rain on my parade
I'll march my band out
I'll beat my drum
And if I'm fanned out
Your turn at bat  sir
At least I didn't fake it  hat sir
I guess I didn't make it
But whether I'm the rose of sheer perfection
A freckle on the nose of life's complexion
The cinder or the shiny apple of its eye
I've gotta fly once
I've gotta try once
Only can die once  right sir
Get ready for me love 'cause I'm a comer
I've simply gotta march  my hearts a drummer
Don't bring around a cloud to rain on my parade
You might also likeI'm gonna live and live now
Get what I want  I know how
One roll for the whole shebang
One throw that bell will go clang
Eye on the target and wham
One shot  one gunshot and bam!
Hey Mr. Arnstein  here I am
I'll march my band out
I'll beat my drum
And if I'm fanned out
Your turn at bat  sir
At least I didn't fake it  hat sir
Guess I didn't make it
Get ready for me love 'cause I'm a comer
I've simply gotta march  my hearts a drummer
She took the midnight train goin' anywhere
Just a city boy  born and raised in South Detroit
He took the midnight train goin' anywhere
A singer in a smoky room
A smell of wine and cheap perfume
For a smile they can share the night
It goes on and on and on and on
Strangers waiting  up and down the boulevard
Their shadows searching in the night
Streetlight people  living just to find emotion
Hiding  somewhere in the night
Workin' hard to get my fill
Everybody wants a thrill

Payin' anything to roll the dice
Just one more time
Some will win  some will lose
Some are born to sing the blues
And oh  the movie never ends
It goes on and on and on and on
Strangers waiting  up and down the boulevard
Their shadows searching in the night
Streetlight people  livin' just to find emotion
Hiding  somewhere in the night
Don't stop believin'
Hold on to that feelin'
Streetlight people
Don't stop believin'
Hold on to that feelin'
Streetlight people
 now I'm down in Tribeca
 they love me everywhere
 home of that boy Biggie
 I could trip a referee
 aha)
 jigga)
 with your skin out
 addicted to the limelight
 uh) (Mercedes: yeah)
 all lookin' pretty
 yeah
Into the midnight sun
Wheels go 'round and 'round
You're on my mind
Restless hearts
Sleep alone tonight
Sending all my love
Along the wire
And they say that the road ain't no place to start a family
Right down the line it's been you and me
And loving a music man ain't always what it's supposed to be
I'm forever yours
Faithfully
Circus life
Under the big top world

We all need the clowns
To make us smile
Oh!
Through space and time

Always another show
And being a part ain't easy on this love affair
Two strangers learn to fall in love again

I'm forever yours

Away from this ship goin' under
Now I feel the weight of the world is on my shoulders
What can you do when your good isn't good enough
And all that you touch tumbles down?
Cause my best intentions keep makin' a mess of things
I just wanna fix it somehow
But how many times will it take?
To get it right
Can I start again with my faith shaken?
'Cause I can't go back and undo this
I just have to stay and face my mistakes
What can you do when your good isn't good enough
And all that you touch tumbles down?
Cause my best intentions keep makin' a mess of things
I just wanna fix it somehow
But how many times will it take?
And accept the truth that sometimes life isn't fair
And finally someone will see how much I care
What can you do when your good isn't good enough
And all that you touch tumbles down?
I just wanna fix it somehow
But how many times will it take?
Pinnacle of life
Husband joined to wife
The heart leaps up to behold
This golden day
Today is for Emma
To cherish and to keep you
To honor you forever
Today is for Emma
My happily soon-to-be wife
Pardon me
Is everybody there?
Because if everybody's there
I want to thank you all for coming to the wedding
I'd appreciate your going even more
I mean you must have lots of better things to do
And not a word of this to Will
But I'm not
Because I wouldn't ruin anyone as wonderful as he is
But I thank you all
For the gifts and the flowers
Thank you all
Now it's back to the showers
Don't tell Will
But I'm not getting married today

Bless this day
Tragedy of life
Husband yoked to wife
The heart sinks down and feels dead
This dreadful day
They're on the dresser
Right next to my suicide note
I don't know what you're waiting for
It's a prehistoric ritual
Where everybody promises fidelity forever
Which is maybe the most horrifying word I ever heard of
Which is followed by a honeymoon
Where suddenly he'll realize
He's settled with a nut
But I'm not getting married
Go have lunch
'Cause I'm not getting married
You've been grand
But I'm not getting married
Don't just stand there
I'm not getting married
And don't tell Will
But I'm not getting married today
Why is nobody listening?
Goodbye
Go and cry
At another person's wake
If you're quick
For a kick
You could pick
Up a Christening
But please
On my knees
There's a human life at stake!
Listen everybody
I'm afraid you didn't hear
Or do you want to see a crazy lady fall apart in front of you
You know we'll both of us be losing our identities
I telephoned my analyst about it and he said to see him Monday
But by Monday I'll be floating in the Hudson with the other garbage
I'm not well
So I'm not getting married
You've been swell
But I'm not getting married
Clear the hall
'Cause I'm not getting married
Thank you all
But I'm not getting married
And don't tell Will
But I'm not getting married today
Bless this bride
Totally insane
Slipping down the drain
And bless this day in our hearts
As it starts to rain
Today is for Emma
I adore you all (I give you)
But why (The rest of)
Watch me die (My life)
Like Eliza on the ice? (To cherish)
I'll collapse
In the apse
Right before you all
So take (To honor you)
Back the cake (Forever)
Burn the shoes and boil the rice (Today is for Emma)
But I may be coming down with Hepatitis (Soon-to-be)
And I think I'm gonna faint (Wife)
So if you wanna see me faint
I'll do it happily (My adorable)
But wouldn't it be funnier to go and watch a funeral (Wife)
So thank you for the twenty-seven dinner plates
Thirty-seven butter knives
Forty-seven paperweights
Fifty-seven candle holders
One more thing
I am not getting married!
Amen!
Softly said
But I'm not getting married!
Amen!
With this ring
Still I'm not getting married!
Amen!
I thee wed
Amen!
Let us pray
That we are getting married (That I'm not getting married)
You told me you'd never fall in love
But now that I get you
I know fear is what it really was
When will you realize
Don't wanna break your heart
Wanna give your heart a break
Like you might make a mistake
There's just one life to live
And there's no time to wait
To waste
So let me give your heart a break

There were tears in your eyes
But you did not reply
The world is ours if we want it
We can take it
If you just take my hand
There's no turning back now
(No turning back)
Don't wanna break your heart
Wanna give your heart a break
Like you might make a mistake
There's just one life to live
And there's no time to wait
To waste
So let me give your heart a break
Give your heart a break
Let me give your heart a break
Your heart a break
There's just so much you can take
Give your heart a break
Let me give your heart a break
Your heart a break
When your lips are on my lips
And our hearts beat as one
But you slip out of my finger tips
Every time you run
Don't wanna break your heart
Wanna give your heart a break
Like you might make a mistake
There's just one life to live
And there's no time
To wait
To waste
So let me give your heart a break
'Cause you've been hurt before (Give your heart a break)
I can see it in your eyes (Your heart a break)
You try to smile it away (Your heart a break)
Some things you can't disguise
Don't wanna break your heart
So let me give your heart a break
Give your heart a break
Your heart a break
Your heart a break
There's just so much you can take
Give your heart a break
Remember those walls I built
They didn't even put up a fight
They didn't even make a sound
It's like I've been awakened
Every rule I had you breakin'
It's the risk that I'm takin'
I ain't never gonna shut you out
Everywhere I'm looking now
I'm surrounded by your embrace
Baby I can see your halo
You know you're my saving grace (I'm walking on sunshine)
You're everything I need and more (Whoa oh)
It's written all over your face (I'm walking on sunshine)
Baby I can feel your halo (Whoa oh! And don't it feel good!)
I can feel your halo (Halo) {Halo!}
I can see your halo (Halo) {Halo!}

I can feel your halo (Hey!) halo {Halo!} halo (Alright now!)
I can feel your halo (Hey!) halo halo {Halo-oo!}
I can see your halo (Hey!) halo halo (Halo-oo)
I can feel your halo halo
I can see your halo

 I've never loved one like you
 hot and heavy pumpkin pie

 I've never loved one like you

When hope was high and life worth living
I dreamed that love would never die
I dreamed that God would be forgiving
Then I was young and unafraid
And dreams were made and used and wasted
There was no ransom to be paid
But the tigers come at night
But the tigers come at night
With their voices soft as thunder
As they tear your hope apart
As they tear your hope apart
As they turn your dream

To shame...
And still I dream she'll come to me
That we will live the years together
But there are dreams that cannot be
And there are storms we cannot weather
I had a dream my life would be
So different from this hell I'm living
So different now from what it seemed
 too
 who's inside there?
 hey
 my insides are blue
 it's because of you
 but it's all the same
 so pretty
 hey
 my insides are blue
 it's because of you
 but it's all the same
 I have myself to blame
 so pretty
 so pretty (You can fix your nose if he says so)
 but if)
Lay me down on a bed of roses
Sink me in the river at dawn
Send me away with the words of a love song
Oh-oh  oh-ho
Lord make me a rainbow
I'll shine down on my mother
She'll know I'm safe with you
When she stands under my colors
Oh well  life ain't always
What you'd think it ought to be  no
Ain't even grey but she buries her baby
The sharp knife of a short life
Well  I've had just enough time
If I die young  bury me in satin
Lay me down on a bed of roses
Sink me in the river at dawn
Send me away with the words of a love song
The sharp knife of a short life
Well  I've had just enough time
You might also likeAnd I'll be wearing white
When I come into your kingdom
I'm as green as the ring
On my little cold finger
I've never known the lovin' of a man
But it sure felt nice
When he was holding my hand
There's a boy here in town
Says he'll love me forever
Who would have thought
Forever could be severed by
The sharp knife of a short life
Well  I've had just enough time
Ooh yeah  ooh woah
So put on your best boys
And I'll wear my pearls
What I never did is done
A penny for my thoughts
Oh no  I'll sell them for a dollar
They're worth so much more
After I'm a goner
And maybe then you'll hear
The words I've been singing
Funny when you're dead
How people start listenin'
Oh  if I die young
Bury me in satin
Lay me down on a bed of roses
Sink me in the river at dawn
Send me away with the words of a love song
Oh oh (Oh oh)
The ballad of a dove (Oh oh)
Go with peace and love
Gather up your tears
Keep 'em in your pocket
Save 'em for a time
When you're really gonna need them  oh
The sharp knife of a short life
Well I've had just enough time
So put on your best boys

I climbed a mountain and I turned around
And I saw my reflection in the snow-covered hills
Where the landslide brought me down

Can I sail through the changin' ocean tides?

But how do you expect me
To live alone with just me?
'Cause my world revolves around you
It's so hard for me to breathe
Tell me how I'm supposed to breathe with no air
Can't live  can't breathe with no air

Parking by the lake
And there was not another car in sight
And I never had a girl
Looking any better than you did
And all the kids at school
They were wishing they were me that night

It never felt so good  it never felt so right
And we're glowing like the metal on the edge of a knife

Here to relive your darkest moments
And all of the ghouls come out to play

Stop callin'  stop callin'
I don't wanna talk anymore
I left my head and my heart on the dancefloor
Stop callin'  stop callin'
I don't wanna think anymore
I left my head and my heart on the dancefloor
Stop callin'  stop callin'
I don't wanna talk anymore
I left my head and my heart on the dancefloor
Eh-eh-eh-eh-eh-eh-eh-eh-eh-eh-eh (Stop telephonin' me)
Eh-eh-eh-eh-eh-eh-eh-eh-eh-eh-eh (I'm busy)
Eh-eh-eh-eh-eh-eh-eh-eh-eh-eh-eh {Stop telephonin' me}
Eh-eh-eh-eh-eh-eh-eh-eh-eh-eh-eh
Can call all you want but there's no one home
And you're not gonna reach my telephone
'Cause I'm out in the club and I'm sipping that bubb
And you're not gonna reach my telephone
Call all you want  but there's no one home
And you're not gonna reach my telephone
'Cause I'm out in the club and I'm sipping that bubb
And you're not gonna reach my telephone
(My telephone)
(My-my-my telephone)
('Cause I'm out in the club and I'm sippin that bubb)
(And you're not gonna reach my telephone)
(My telephone)
(My-my-my telephone)
('Cause I'm out in the club and I'm sippin that bubb)
(And you're not gonna reach my telephone)

 I tried to hesitate

 the boy is mine (The boy is mine)
 oh)
 he's mine  he's mine)
 I won't allow
 oh)
 ooh)
 oh-oh)
Tell you I'm sorry
You don't know how lovely you are
I had to find you
Tell you I need you
Tell you I set you apart
Tell me your secrets
And ask me your questions
Runnin' in circles
Comin' up tails
Heads on the science apart
Nobody said it was easy
It’s such a shame for us to part
Nobody said it was easy
You might also like
No one ever said it would be this hard
I was just guessing
At numbers and figures
Pulling the puzzles apart
Questions of science
Science and progress
Do not speak as loud as my heart
(But) tell me you love me
Come back and haunt me
Runnin' in circles
Chasin' our tails
Comin' back as we are
(Nobody said it was easy)
(Nobody said it was easy)
No one ever said it would be so hard
Aa-aa-ah (I'm goin' back to the start)
Nobody said it was easy
Nobody said it was easy
Nobody said it was easy
Every name they show
These halls I've walked a thousand times
I look at everything I was
And everything I ever loved
And I can see how much I've grown
And though the mirror doesn't see it
I can make it on my own
I'm not afraid of moving on and letting go
This time no one's gonna say goodbye
I keep you in this heart of mine
This time I know it's never over
No matter who or what I am
I'll carry where we all began
This old familiar place is
Where every face is another part of me
I played a different game then
They called me a different name then
I think of all the things I did and how I wish I knew what I know now
You might also likeI see how far I've come and what I got right
When I was looking for that spotlight
I was looking for myself
Got over what I was afraid of
I showed 'em all that I was made of
More than trophies on a shelf
For all the battles that we lost or might have won
This time no one's gonna say goodbye
I keep you in this heart of mine
This time I know it's never over
No matter who or what I am
I'll carry where we all began
I'm looking out from the crossroads
I don't know how far away I will roam
Your voice will carry me home
I keep you in this heart of mine
This time I know it's never over
No matter who or what I am
I'll carry where we all began
Forever
Every now and then I get a little bit lonely
And you're never coming 'round
Turn around
Every now and then I get a little bit tired
Of listening to the sound of my tears
Turn around
Every now and then I get a little bit nervous
That the best of all the years have gone by
Every now and then I get a little bit terrified
And then I see the look in your eyes
Turn around bright eyes
You might also like
Every now and then I fall apart
Turn around bright eyes
Every now and then I fall apart
And I need you now tonight
And I need you more than ever
And if you only hold me tight
We'll be holding on forever
And we'll only be making it right
'Cause we'll never be wrong
Together we can take it to the end of the line
Your love is like a shadow on me all of the time
(All of the time)
We're living in a powder keg and giving off sparks
(I really need you tonight)
Forever's gonna start tonight
(Forever's gonna start tonight)
Once upon a time I was falling in love
Now I'm only falling apart
There's nothing I can do
Total eclipse of the heart
Once upon a time there was light in my life
Now there's only love in the dark
Nothing I can say
Total eclipse of the heart
Every now and then I fall apart
Every now and then I fall apart
And I need you now tonight
And I need you more than ever
And if you'll only hold me tight
We'll be holding on forever
And we'll only be making it right
'Cause we'll never be wrong
Together we can take it to the end of the line
Your love is like a shadow on me all of the time
(All of the time)
We're living in a powder keg and giving off sparks
I really need you tonight
Forever's gonna start tonight
(Forever's gonna start tonight)
Once upon a time I was falling in love
Now I'm only falling apart
There's nothing I can do
Total eclipse of the heart
Total eclipse of the heart
A total eclipse of the heart

My friends are in the bathroom getting higher than the Empire State
My lover  he is waiting for me just across the bar
My seat's been taken by some sunglasses asking 'bout a scar  and...
I know I gave it to you months ago
I know you're trying to forget
But between the drinks and subtle things  the holes in my apologies
You know  I'm trying hard to take it back
So if by the time the bar closes
And you feel like falling down
I'll carry you home...
Tonight  we are young
So let's set the world on fire
We can burn brighter than the sun
Tonight  we are young
So let's set the world on fire
We can burn brighter than the sun
You might also like
Now I know that I'm not
All that you got
I guess that I  I just thought
Maybe we could find new ways to fall apart
But our friends are back
So let's raise a cup
Cause I found someone to carry me home
Tonight  we are young
So let's set the world on fire
We can burn brighter than the sun
Whoa!
Tonight  we are young (We are young)
So let's set the world on fire (Fire)
We can burn brighter (Brighter)
Than the sun
Carry me home tonight (Na na na na na na na na)
Just carry me home tonight (Na na na na na na na na)
Carry me home tonight (Na na na na na na na na)
Just carry me home tonight (Na na na na na na na na)
The moon is on my side (Carry me home tonight)
I have no reason to run (Just carry me home tonight)
So will someone come and carry me home tonight?
The angels never arrived (Na na na na na na na na)
But I can hear the choir (Just carry me home tonight)
So will someone come and carry me home...?
Tonight  we are young
So let's set the world on fire
We can burn brighter than the sun
We are young  yeah
Tonight  we are young (We are young)
So let's set the world on fire (Fire)
We can burn brighter (Brighter)
Than the sun
So if by the time the bar closes
And you feel like falling down"
