lyrics
"All these songs when I was takin' away from you
But what they didn't know is to God I swore
You got four baby mamas
Four baby mamas
All these songs when I was takin' away from you
But what they didn't know is to God I swore
You got four baby mamas
But what I didn't know is to God I swore
After we made plans for a family?
And I won't let you back in my life so I'm takin'...
I wanna start with your mama  she should've whooped your ass
Know you ain't shit  but she don't care 'cause you lit
But she ain't never call you out 'cause she like the way that she live
But that some foul shit  she wasn't even around when you ain't have no money (Money)
That's why I find it funny (Funny)
I guess that guilt hit hard  bein' gonе for so long (Hard)
That's why she makes excusеs for all your wrongs
Now what's the point in keep on havin' kids
If she just gon' be raisin' them? That's just pure laziness
I don't get it  is you tryna keep up with Thug? Is you racin' him?
It really don't get no worse than you  ‘cause you ain't even got the nerve to stand up on your word
What was you tellin' them?
What was you tellin' me?
What was you tellin' them?
And what was you tellin' me?
Why would you do all that
Just to be sellin' dreams?
Ain't even pullin' through
You just be talkin'
You might also like
Damn  I ain't know niggas be out here tryna trap bitches
Never took me nowhere lavish 'til you seen Drake hop on the track with it
You ain't give a fuck about me  you was just tryna cash in (No)
Tryna get your likes up  know you a clout addict
Gotta let niggas know that you have it
Gotta let niggas know that you have it
And all you be doin' is braggin'
Tellin' people that I'm your queen
But all you mean is just of R&B
I know you ain't care 'cause you always gone
How could you make me spend my whole fucking pregnancy alone?
And where was you at? 'Cause you claim you at work
But them other niggas said they made the beats  so how that add up?
Probably was with your baby mamas  one through three
You claim that you had a ring for me  you was probably out fuckin' hoes
What was you tellin' them?
What was you tellin' me?
What was you tellin' them?
And what was you tellin' me?
Why would you do all that
Just to be sellin' dreams?
Ain't even pullin' through
You just be talkin'
Tell me  why did you do this to me
After we made plans for a family?
You want me here to stay (Stay)
But your situation tells me that it’s a waste of time
You know you don't have to play
I’m already on the way
You ain't gotta say shit
So he set the mood on some love shit
Might've kissed few times but never made a move on no cut shit
Just enjoyed the time that we had laid aside to be numb in
Your girl drivin' your ass insane
And you know my nigga don't play shit (Oh)
It's not the right time but
You say the timing is perfect
You want me to lie
We doin’ the most
Takin' pictures you know we can’t post
Can't post
Your girl drivin' your ass insane
You got my mind going crazy
Said my heart working overtime
 I got options
 you can give it somethin'
 I'm talkin' crazy
 but I

 'cause it's crazy
 I'm talkin' crazy
 but I

 sayin')
 alright
 alright
 done with that shit
You thought you'd have a great night (Oh)
You thought with your hot rod and your fast rides (Oh)
That I'll just fall in love with you and agree with you to take me home
But boy was you wrong
It's clear to me you think that we are all the same (Ooh)
That I'd be impressed by your house on The Hills
And the fame you claim (Ooh)
Telling me what I can't get out of you
Say you never been friendzoned before
Hopefully your ego will defuse poor child
You look so confused
'Cause you've got a reality check
'Cause I got my own check
Rid of all your fancy things that don't mean nothing to me
Do what you say
I don't wanna be sold another piece of your dream
I just don't know how I can take it
'Cause my heart is breakin'
I've been mistaken
You're not the man I thought you were
And they tried to warn me
But I should've listened
The first one was a fuck-up (Fuck-up)
Second one was a no one (No one)
Third one was tryna come up
And I believed you
You never left me like you did them
Fuck hoes on me like you did them
I built you up and I held you down

 keep you entertained
 let's get straight to the truth
 it's out of my control
Too many days that I've made this mistake and
Too many nights you and I've said goodbye
Too many texts to express how I hate it
Swear I'm almost done 'cause it's too many times
We can't undo what we keep on doin'
We can't un-try what we've tried so far
Hope to un-feel what we keep on feelin'
But you can't un-break my broken heart
Mess around and get closer to you
Don't you make me feel hungover
Why you gotta hang your love over my head like that?
Just tryna get closurе from you
You know I'm a month depressed
I'm the one that knows you best
Six up on new days
Still lookin' for new ways

I don't like being alone
Thinking bout ringing your line
I wish you would come home
But I'm just tryna balance my space
I'm just tryna protect my space (Oh)
I don't really need the pain
But I love to feel the pain
Maybe I could use a break
So we just might have to wait (Oh)
'Cause we're way too in love  just to fuck and let go
'Cause we're way too involved  just to cut and not call
Way too in deep (Deep)
Way too in deep
Way too in deep (Deep)
Way too in deep (Oh)
Wish I could call  wish I could call and go home
I'm open
Not the type to try and double back twice
Tell you to shut your ass up
Rushin' here real fast just to take it slower
We gotta get deeper now
Wonder how you give it to me so good (Good)
Guess I never had a real nigga from the hood
You tryna get deeper now
Feelings is deeper now
Hope you not wastin' my time

Said I wasn't cut right
Can't turn a ho into a housewife
I don't understand it
Takes me out of the categories of marriage
Is it 'cause I know what I want just like you?
'Cause I make my own money and my own moves?
Love who I want and fuck who I choose to
Don't take no shit and won't be used
But I guess that makes me undesirable
Life's unfair
 I'm tryin' to stay focused
 better swing my way
 I just need some love

Baby  I took that shit too far
I know I ain't ready to let go
Toxic  but you know I ain't goin' nowhere  'where
They all in our business

I hope it ain't true what they say 'bout you  I want this
Hesitant to post or flaunt this
Hopin' I don't get embarrassed by onе of these hoes
I don't think you doin' shit  but you nеver know
Funny how you never volunteer your phone
I wanna walk away  but what if I'm wrong?
Believin' you  needin' you  wantin' to see it through
Through
Know this shit might look wild to them
But it ain't for them to get
This for us and that's for them
They don't know what's goin' on
All up in our Kool-Aid
Maybe I took that shit too far
I know I ain't ready to let go
Toxic  but you know I ain't goin' nowhere  'where
They all in our business
I put my hands in her pants  not for the smell
To see is it wet or not (See is it wet enough)
Ain't got a key  she come to the room
I tell the front desk to let her up (Ooh)
She five away  I holla like I'm ready
I'm just gettin' up to freshen up (Ooh)
I told her my head hurt
She told me to get a BC and a 7-Up (Yeah)
Deleted my call log  I know that she thirsty
She say I'm a nigga  ain't nobody perfect
Keepin' my gun inside of her purse
Say I talk nasty in all of my verses  that's real
She asks do I know her  then I tell her  Just chill (Just chill)
She ask do I drink and I told her  Just pills (Just pills)
I said I flip houses  she said  Let's chill (Let's chill)
I'd rather have diamonds instead of veneers
I'm grabbin' her body  I'm pullin' her close
I'm lickin' her ear (I'm lickin' her ear)
When I go deep  she run up the sheets
I see tears (I see tears)
Why you so toxic?
After sex  she wearin' my boxers (Wearin' my boxers)
Don't get a groupie pic  get your phone and lock it
No (Yeah  yeah)
Drinkin' 'em straight with no regrets
Obviously I got a problem
I like the taste
Wanna get wasted with you
Tell me what’s good for me but I don't care
Wanna get wasted off you
I like the taste
I like the taste
I like the taste
Yeah
Gambled it all just to be lost
You live and you learn
I learned from my hurt
Show me what I have been missing
Crazy but I will not listen
No good for my health
Throw it back and I feel the burn
No good for my health

I'm honestly runnin' out of patience
Communication just don't seem to work
You've got it all figured out in your head
And you in denial 'bout all that shit that you be sayin'
I'm tryna help us if you just listen to what I need (I'm tryna help us)
We been through hella shit
We done it all and that's why it's sad that
You don't know me (Know me)
You don't know me (Know me)
You don't know me (Know me)
You don't know me
You don't know me
You don't know me
Like I know you
But you could take a minute
Just to pay attеntion to me for once
You should know my body by now
You should know my mind by now
And it don't seem to matter how many times I try
You should just commit once (Tired)
I shouldn't have to run
It should just be for fun like (You)
You should just know how (Know how)
Really know how to touch (How to touch)
