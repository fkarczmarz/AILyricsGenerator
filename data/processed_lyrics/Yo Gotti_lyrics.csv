" talkin' bout
 Gucci Mane got nine cars
 might even pay her rent
 I'm so super high
 see
 yeah all my bitches love me
 shorty that'll make you basic
 I been rich
 mane
 you a three-star
 no more auditions
It's amazin' what 365 days can do for you
This time last year niggas was like
Talkin' 'bout cuttin' budgets and shit
Nigga business partner with Jay-Z
Decisions
Gotta pick 'em wisely
Gotta choose 'em carefully
Got niggas I know that weren't there for me
Got bitches I know that don't care for me
Could've went on tour with your favorite rapper and declined
Why? I'm tryna break CMG
In New York with 3 bangers
Did Jimmy Fallon with Meaghan Trainor
I guess the sets won't taint him
Guess the money can't change him
Decisions
Homie on probation
Took him up to Roc Nation
Trying to tell him wait his turn

Biggest year of my career
Same time I can feel the feds
Decisions
Never want to be the biggest
I just want to be the realest

He got the city divided
I was too busy gettin' too many million
Like now the perfect timin'
Let them lil niggas in
They what they do to bitch
I don't be trippin' at all
9 times 9 is 81
I'm an 80's baby born in '81 (from the crib yeah)
9 times 9 is 81
I'm an 80's baby born in '81
CM9 strictly for the streets

I'm tryna be the first trap billionaire
Rest in peace Mac Dre
All I do is talk yay
In the club got them bottles on replay
Tryna break a record like a DJ
That's a hundred fifty bottles in one night
I give that bitch some act right
Money don't fold if it act right
Niggas playin' games you can act right
I'm goin' goin back back to the Bay
Rest in peace Mac Dre
I'm a street nigga all I do is talk yay
Want me in your city nigga know they gon' pay
Cuban link chain on my neck weigh a kilo
Nigga just violated pissed dirty to his P.O
On the real nigga scale one to ten you a zero

Make you bitch pass out straight hit the floor

Two things I gotta stay with: two pistols
Money don't fold if it act right
Niggas playin' games you can act right
Put my bitch up out the house 'cause all she do is argue
Put that bitch up out the whip 'cause all she do is argue

Load It  Cock It  Aim and Shoot
Living like we bulletproof
I say we load it  cock it  aim and shoot
Oh we load it  cock it  aim and shoot
Game fucked up  streets ain't got loyalty
Real dope boy  and I spit real nigga poetry
Niggas talkin' foul  loud  bout what they gon' do to me
Bought all my cars white so when you see me  bitch you know it's me
Know a Memphis nigga  but I'm cruisin' down college
With my pistol in my pocket  a lil' bad bitch from college
I'm getting head in my drophead  feeling like I'm bulletproof
Fo' my niggas catch a body  gon' and get yourself a coupe or two
Free that nigga Meech  and free my nigga Boosie too
Tonight I'm in the strip club  and do what BMF would do
I'm sick of rap niggas  where my strap  niggas?
Got an AK and a 38 in my trap  niggas
I'm feeling some kind of way  ready to leave here today
You cross that line with me pussy  I shoot you square in your face
I keep these niggas in line  I keep these hoes in they place
Breaking News: Look at Gotti  that boy just caught him a case
Million cash for the bond  I got that sac on the way
Don't need to talk to a lawyer  boy  I'm gettin out here today
You think I come here to play  then you out your rabid ass mind
I'm in the streets everyday  and I got a hell of a grind
I was lost in the money  these streets was dying of hunger
I put this rap shit on hold and went got my niggas a bundle
Niggas six feet and under  cuz they was playin' with the king
That last case I wasn't on the scene  I stood up for the team
Never rat on my homies  niggas know I'm big homie
 whoa (Yeah)
 Castro
 serve ya kinfolk

 and I say it out of kindness (Alright)

 on my neck look diamond (Diamond)

 building to the sky now
 but how you gon’ survive now?
 it’s cold blood in a nigga
 I'd show a image

 holmes numb
 all the hoes they had dissed him
 we build it to the sky now
 how you gon’ survive now?
 building to the sky now
 how you gon’ survive now?
 it’s cold blood in a nigga
 no love
 voice for the voiceless
 multiple choice to the choiceless
 a searchlight in the darkness for this young black carcass
 but it’s bucks that we worship now
 that root of evil gon’ forever rule the people
 what would momma think about me?
 plus he trigger happy
 burners packed just like a stadium
 blood is leaking at the ATM
 tears soak the handkerchief
 we build it to the sky now
 how you gon’ survive now?
 building to the sky now
 how you gon’ survive now?
 it’s cold blood in a nigga
 fo'real
 mom embarrassed so she don't want us to mention it
 she don’t need no help raising her kids
 and that make the monsters
 that’s some ill shit
 he was a lookout
 on the stove like it’s a cookout
 could put a book out
 he got took out (bang!)
 he wasn't focus so he died over nothing
 we build it to the sky now
 how you gon’ survive now?
 building to the sky now
 how you gon’ survive now?
 it’s cold blood in a nigga
 that’s the truth
 but homie rest in peace
 I hope one day you rescue me
 maybe we can fly someday

 but homie rest in peace
 I hope one day you rescue me
 maybe we can fly someday (fly)

Nigga hurting in the hood  trying to give em hope
Bitches tryna throw me pussy  I tell em no
I'm a million dollar nigga  it don't excite a nigga
Bitch if I go to jail today  would you write a nigga
Keep the game concealed
I'm tryna tell em how it is
Like Migos Bout my M&m’s
Don't give no money to no hoes
Won't put money on yo books
I told Epic I'm bout money  I don't give a fuck about no looks
I don't give a fuck about no bitches  and they feelings
Fuck about no niggas  talkin I'm not real cuz I'm winning
Give a fuck about no penitentiary no consequence
Pussy niggas  I'm diving in it
All this and that  and back and fourth
All this social gangsta you won
Give a fuck about no bodies  or no murders or no guns
Give a fuck about no stripper bitches  even though I throw ones

Man  what happened to the real niggas
Man  what happened to my real niggas
I wrote this hear for all my real niggas
Man  what happened to the real niggas
You a real nigga  what happened homie
Heard you running with the enemy  you tripping homie
You wasn’t raised like that  that ain’t your background
You got a little money with niggas  that's how you act now?
Streets a motherfucker
Not to mention  niggas treat you like my blood brother
But once you cross that line  you gotta stay there
And if you playing both sides  know you got to lay there
Hundred bands and guns  that's what I call warfare
Ain't nobody safe  any nigga get it
Once upon a time you was a real nigga
But now you disloyal  you just a field nigga
What type of nigga your nigga brought from the other side
We don't shake hands with the enemies  we do homicides
It's Ridgecrest mafia for life  and fuck the other side
You never see me say a word  you just see gun fire
Cause gangsters don't talk  and drama don't slide
One thing I hate the most  a nigga playing both sides
Just know you don't slide  get his ass from both sides
I'm on my fuck the world  don't really fuck with me
Old ass niggas better sit down
Pussy ass niggas better get down
I need a ?  C.M.G. the motherfucking squad
Any nigga round me best sound hard
This a family nigga  and you must play your part
Now they say I'm crazy cause I go to war with the whole city
But fuck nigga  I give these hoes the business
And I put that on me  I ain't never give no statement
I ain't never copped no plea
I let money fight my cases  I get money and I go hard
I let haters do the hating
When you pussies ready to face me  I be right here just waiting
Matter fact I'm getting patient
Sipping on that hen' getting wasted
Imma' catch a murder one and I can taste it
How you get so far  then go back to the basis
I built up Gucci and Boosie  some of this shit you just can't shake it
Some of this shit  you gotta embrace it
Some of these problems  you gotta erase it
So I keep ?  fuck their bitches till I run these niggas crazy
Niggas ain't real anyway
This mixtape here
It's strictly for the fans (yogottimusic.com)
Trust me!
I want my album to drop more than you
Call the fucking label and ask them what happening
Truly yours!
King
Verse 1:
I'm on my grown man flow band up flow
Nigga I just brought a phantom off the showroom floor
He's a pussy and I expose this nigga I said a ho
In the streets niggas look up to Gotti and I understand why
(ay let the beat sing to em)
Little rappers playing with me
I'm trying to stop from clicking out
Baby momma left a nigga and now it hard to see the kids
Ross hit a nigga up try to put me on Maybach
Tip hit a nigga up trying to give me Grand Hustle
All these niggas are my niggas and I respect the hustlers
Some of these niggas like my brothers
They've been real since day one
And a nigga keep saying I'm one song away
That mean I got that mother fuck'n sack bro
Nigga I make M's nigga
You know what I'm talking about
I show these niggas how to do this shit I'm the blue print nigga
And I ain't drop shit but a nigga bitch off
You know what I'm talking about
You might also likeVerse 2:
I'm in a two door coupe
With a see through roof
And the a dope boy roll and a Glock 9 too
Ain't on that criss cross shit
I'm trying to stay in my lane
I'm strapped 24/7 I got to stay on my aim
They say Keep it real Gotti I say I been doing that
I'm on my li-li-liter shit niggas following the kid
But I ain't fucked up with it
The streets know what it is
(I'm on my li-li-liter shit niggas following the kid)
(but I ain't fucked up with it)
(the streets know what it is)
Verse 3:
My little homies keep telling me to smash on em
Met a bad bitch and I spend a little cash on her
Cope a new whip so I left the paper tags on it
Got a couple checks but I really hate to brag on it
Zilla up next and I bet the pad on em
Soon as he said the name CMG drop the bag on em
Verse 4:
I mean you know shit crazy
Cause like the other night a nigga was in Atlanta
We fucking around on the internet
And we see a motherfucking iTunes ad
Like Yo Gotti January 10th
I mean shit counted thru me for a loop
Cause I didn't know nothing about it
And its like December 23
Verse 5:
Bad blood in the camp and nigga feel neglected
I try to work it out before it get all hecked
And if you talking foul I hope its ain't in my direction homie
I say if you talking foul I hope its ain't in my direction homie
Interlude:
Ay see
I believe nigga got a problem they handle it
If its all good its all good
Know what I'm talking about
Verse 6:
I'm from the city of the murders
Were industry niggas ain't never heard of us
I'm damn near 30 and a nigga ain't done shit to me
Put your hands on a real nigga then its 1st degree
Get it (pow)
Hit it (pow)
Split it
Thats all my niggas do is murk some
I'm trying to hurt some
I'm give that bitch back to you cause she worst-some
I'm out
C-M-G
Ay you know
They say its a man's job to respect a woman
But me personally
I feel like a woman 'posed to give a man something to respect
Now it ain't wrong for thinking that is it
So I ain't wrong for thinking this
Want me to buy you a bag but is you worth it
Now I ain't perfect
And I just followed you on Instagram
Are you really into women and you get around  no I ain't judging
I'm just asking if that's fair to say
But either way it's my opinion  you know  give or take
I told this model chick
Little girls look up to you and the things you do
Every nigga you work with  you're screwin'
So you know when she grow up  you know what she gon' do
She like  you don't know me  you don't pay my bills
You don't know my struggle
I'm like  that shit real but it is what it is but I know you lying
I know what's real  I know your worth
I know that purse  ten bands shawty  you can't pay your bills
You one of them?

If I called you my bitch when I'm with my partners
See it as a badge of honor
Or just be like no Wale  don't call me out on my momma's given
Namesake but she whispers mine when I'm in her thighs
And I leave her in her feelings 'cuz I never leave her dry
Some ill advice  lying to her is ill advised
She know these Jones from a Jone but I still give her time
I try to follow her  everybody want her
Ain't worry about nothing  she gon' work that body
And I unfollow though my eyes
Still on her knowing I'm still caught up
I call her thirst trap shorty

See this a very important law
Law 2: if a man show a flaw that mean that flaw really exist
Never take it for granted never
Rule #3: make sure you never break it never sleep where the sack at
I'm the hustler's constitution
Feds giving back time for retribution you snitching that shit excuses
Bang! that's execution and that's my only solution I got from stopping these rat niggas from moving
My life a movie not a short film
A word to the wise watch your guys niggas snakes in disguise
Meeting bitches off the gram know they living and lying
Cold heart never cried if I did it was blood
Little nigga big pride murder that's what it was and that's law
See if a nigga
See when you got that motherfuckin' chip on your shoulder and that big ass pistol and a nigga come playing
You gotta show a nigga you mean business you know what I'm saying
I'm the same still running with the gang
Still down to kill a nigga about something petty like a chain
You a million-dollar nigga got to get that in your brain
We savages we all live the same
What if I sell a million records will that change the code
Will my niggas try to betray me 'cause I know they vultures
Create me a better way to put my people on
Will my baby mama finally quit texting my phone
Kiss my daughter and my son tell 'em I'm coming home
Tell my niggas put the pistols down I'm in the zone
I been dropping nothing but gangsta shit on every song
This that shit they been waiting for forever long
They gave my patna 30 years for talking on the phone
I had to watch his mama cry and tell her let's be strong
Ima hold him down he won't do all that time alone
What if I wasn't a rapper the streets would get annoyed
Cause don't nobody tell it how I tell it and you know it
What if they say I changed cause I went outside the box
What's good I kept my plug number so I can get some blocks
18 wheeler full of cocaine I'm talking lots of dope
Not believing Mexican plugs fuck a horoscope
If you a star where your telescope
These niggas high they on hella dope
Your favorite rapper hella broke
Cars leases they got hella notes
Houses rented got eviction notes and everybody already know
You fabricated and I'm factionated
You sold a million records I got millions of dollars

Truth be told when I was hustlin' I ain't fuck with 'em (Fuck 'em)
Same nigga still owe me on a pack
Think a nigga forgot because I'm rappin'? (Nah)
When I get off the road  I shoot back to my town
Own family hating  niggas looking mad
Guess it be little better if a nigga was doing bad
But momma got a smile
Brother still wild
I gotta get this money  I just had another child
They say I'm getting fat  guess I'm eating good
Sometimes I think back  I could've went fed

It's 64 a show and 750 for an O
And all my niggas hittas  they gon' let that pain go
Pull up in that Wraith  I gotta let that money show
My niggas in NY  they be fuckin' with the snow
My niggas in New Jersey  they know all about the blow
The page is touchdown and my niggas goin' long
If you ain't gettin' money then you know your trap wrong
Old school flip  we call that shit a trap phone

I never thought I'd be makin' this song
I don’t even know where to start but
Then I introduced you to this Cocaine Muzik
And every other day you expressed your love for Ray
And your love for 'Ye then we used to debate
'Bout how your partners in the industry thought I still sold yay
We were both geeked up by doin' the deal with Jay
I got my first number one and you was on the run with me
Never want to leave the country if I can't take my gun with me
You weren't with the gangsta shit but yet you still hung with me
It’s like I knew your whole lifetime
We accomplished so much shit
We talked about so much shit
I’m just movin' how I'm movin' and like
You were always just the nigga to get through to me
Like with the whole shit about
They were tryna get me to go for years and years
I weren’t movin' like that 'cause
All my niggas convicted felons
I couldn’t get the straps across the motherfuckin' customs
And I remember like Sylvia Rhone callin' me late at night like
Be on the biggest record in Europe right now”

You remember we sat down in the room with Jay?
And that nigga was just chattin' some real shit to us
We were holdin' out the pose on some G shit though
Niggas that grew up together and built an empire together
And I was really motivated by that
That day I told you that was how I wanted me and my brothers to be and me and my niggas to be
I remember you pulled me to the side
You were tellin' me like you felt like an artist
The other night it wouldn’t have been about no CM9
I would have let you know I value your participation
I would have thanked you for your patience and your conversations
But we were supposed to get rich and gon' retire together

Sun out  no rain drops  posting the same spot
Right here in North  North Memphis where I came from
Hundred on the neck  I ain't never had shit
That the streets gave me family  Barry White cut the check
Ain't no secret in the streets  niggas know I got neck
Got the swagger through the roof  I was born just to flex
Zip code on my wrist  phone number in the bank
In my ten 'til six with my 305 paint
I got my 3-5-7 and my 501's
In a Lear 55 wit my Air Force Ones
No lie!
Women lie  men lie  women lie  men lie
Women lie  men lie  numbers don't lie (Aye  it's your boy  Yo Gotti!)
Women lie  men lie  women lie  men lie"
