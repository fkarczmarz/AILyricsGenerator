lyrics
"How we'd follow the path of the hero
Boast about the day when the rivers overrun
How we rise to the height of our halo
Listen to the tales as we all rationalize
Our way into the arms of the savior
Feigning all the trials and the tribulations
None of us have actually been there
Not like you
Ignorant siblings at the congregation
Gather around spewing sympathy
Spare me
None of them can even hold a candle up to you
But enough about the collective Judas
Who could deny you were the one who
Illuminated your little piece of the divine?
I'm gonna let it shine to guide you safely on your way
Your way home
Without you to guide them all to Zion?
What are they gonna do when the rivers overrun
Other than tremble incessantly?
You were the light and the way they'll only read about
I only pray Heaven knows when to lift you out
Ten thousand days in the fire is long enough
You're going home

You're the only one who can hold your head up high
I have come home now
Tell them their pillar of faith has ascended
Give me my
Give me my
Give me my
Give me my
Give me my
Give me my wings
You are the light and way that they will only read about
Set as I am in my ways and my arrogance
Burden of proof tossed upon non-believers
Daylight dims leaving cold fluorescence
Difficult to see you in this light
Please forgive this bold suggestion
Should you see your maker's face tonight
Get up  get up now
Get up  get up now
Get up  get up now
And free yourself from yourself
Free yourself from yourself
Locked up inside you
Like the calm beneath castles
Is a cavern of treasures that
No one has been to
Let's go digging
Let's go digging
Bring it out and then take it back in
You won't do what you'd like to do
Lay back and let me show you another way
I'll kill what you want me to
Take what's left and eat it
Take all or nothing
Just too short to push it away
Take it all

And I sprang from my slumber drenched in sweat like the tears of one million terrified brothers and roared  Hear me now  I have seen the light!

We'll miss him
He had a lot to say
He had a lot of nothing to say  we'll miss him
We'll miss him
We're gonna miss him
We're gonna miss him
So long
We wish you well
You told us how you weren't afraid to die
Well  so long
Don't cry
Or feel too down
Not all martyrs see divinity
But at least you tried
Standing above the crowd
He had a voice that was strong and loud  we'll miss him
We'll miss him
Ranting and pointing his finger
At everything but his heart  we'll miss him
We'll miss him
We're gonna miss him
We're gonna miss him
To recall
What it was that you had said to me
Like I care at all
But it was so loud
And you sure could yell
You took a stand on every little thing
And it was so loud
You could be the one who saves me from my own existence
Warn while some child might chill  nine-one-two
I'm too smart when you're invisible by the bone symbol on you
So he bashes his skull through the window while looking out to the sea
Like torment of my ego
And we're amused by this
Yeah  standing above the crowd
He had a voice that was strong and loud and I
Swallowed his facade 'cause I'm so
Eager to identify with
Someone above the ground
Someone who seemed to feel the same
Someone prepared to lead the way  and
Someone who would die for me
Will you?
Will you now?
Would you die for me?
Don't you fuckin' lie
Don't you step out of line
Don't you step out of line
Don't you step out of line
Don't you fuckin' lie
You've claimed all this time that you would die for me
Why then are you so surprised when you hear your own eulogy?
He had a lot to say
He had a lot of nothing to say
He had a lot to say
He had a lot of nothing to say
Come down
Get off your fuckin' cross
We need the fuckin' space
To nail the next fool martyr
To ascend you must die
You must be crucified
For our sins and our lies

As full and bright as I am
This light is not my own and
A million light reflections pass over me
The source is bright and endless
She resuscitates the hopeless
Without her  we are lifeless satellites drifting
And as I pull my head out  I am without one doubt
Don't want to be down here soothing my narcissism  I
Must crucify the ego before it's far too late

They chose me
And I didn't even graduate from fuckin' high school
You'd better
You'd better
You'd better
You'd better listen
Then he looked right through me
With somniferous almond eyes
Don't even know what that means
Must remember to write it down
This is so real
Like the time Dave floated away
See  my heart is pounding
'Cause this shit never happens to me
I can't breathe right now
It was so real
Like I woke up in Wonderland
All sorta terrifying
I don't wanna be all alone
While I tell this story
And can anyone tell me why
You all sound like Peanuts parents?
Will I ever be coming down?
This is so real
Finally  it's my lucky day
See  my heart is racing
'Cause this shit never happens to me
I can't breathe right now
You believe me  don't you?
Please believe what I've just said
See the Dead ain't touring
And this wasn't all in my head
See  they took me by the hand
And invited me right in
Then they showed me something
I don't even know where to begin
Strapped down to my bed
Feet cold and eyes red
I'm out of my head
Am I alive? Am I dead?
Can't remember what they said
God damn  shit the bed
Overwhelmed as one would be  placed in my position
Such a heavy burden now to be the one
Born to bear and bring to all the details of our ending
To write it down for all the world to see
But I forgot my pen
Shit the bed again
Typical
Strapped down to my bed
Feet cold and eyes red
I'm out of my head
Am I alive? Am I dead?
Sunkist and Sudafed
Gyroscopes and infrared
Won't help  I'm brain dead
Can't remember what they said
God damn  shit the bed
I can't remember what they said to me
Can't remember what they said to make me out to be the hero
Can't remember what they said

'Cause I watched them fall away
Mildewed and smoldering
Fundamental differing
Pure intention juxtaposed
Will set two lovers' souls in motion
Disintegrating as it goes
Testing our communication
The light that fueled our fire then
Has burned a hole between us so
We cannot seem to reach an end
Crippling our communication
I know the pieces fit
'Cause I watched them tumble down
It doesn't mean I don't desire
Watch the temple topple over
To bring the pieces back together
Rediscover communication

The poetry that comes from
The squaring off between
And the circling is worth it
Finding beauty in the dissonance
There was a time that the pieces fit
But I watched them fall away
Mildewed and smoldering
Strangled by our coveting
I've done the math enough to know
The dangers of our second-guessing
Doomed to crumble unless we grow
And strengthen our communication
Cold silence has a tendency to
Atrophy any sense of compassion
Between supposed lovers

Today a young man on acid realized that all matter is merely energy condensed to a slow vibration. That we are all one consciousness experiencing itself subjectively. There is no such thing as death  life is only a dream  and we are the imagination of ourselves. Here's Tom with the weather.
It's not a war on drugs  it's a war on personal freedom  that's what it is  okay? Keep that in mind at all times  thank you.
Dreaming of that face again
It's bright and blue and shimmering
Grinning wide
And comforting me with its three warm and wild eyes
On my back and tumbling
Down that hole and back again (And back again)
Rising up
And wiping the webs and the dew from my withered eye
In  out  in  out  in  out
A child's rhyme stuck in my head
It said that life is but a dream
I've spent so many years in question
To find I've known this all along

Black as holes within a memory
And blue as our new second sun
I stick my hand into the shadow
To pull the pieces from the sand
Which I attempt to reassemble
To see just who I might have been
I do not recognize the vessel
But the eyes seem so familiar
Like phosphorescent desert buttons
Singing one familiar song
So good to see you

Speaks from deep beneath peerless water that's
Twice as clear as heaven
Twice as loud as reason
Deep and rich like silt on a riverbed
Just as never ending
Current's mouth below me
Opens up around me
Suggests and beckons all while swallowing
Surrounds and drowns and wipes me away
You're saturating me
How could I let this bring me
Back to my knees?

Drowned by the ocean
Shot by his own son

Then kissed him goodbye

Stare like a zombie while the mother holds her child
