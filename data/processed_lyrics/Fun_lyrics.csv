lyrics
"I bought it downtown as I was on my way to meet you
She sounds like the songs you used to sing to put me to sleep but
And I feel so all alone
No one's gonna fix me when I'm broke
How do you cry with inanimate eyes?
You're never gonna smile with the way that you're wired
And I feel so all alone
I gave her to you (I don't need a toy)
I thought you might appreciate (I don't like the way that it moves)
The way that she dances
The painted look upon her face (Someone must've thrown this away)
She must have come from the sun (I got too much stuff)
I want to take her through the park
Where she'd tell me I'm all that she wants
(Speaking of which)
If she could even talk (I think we need to talk)
I feel so all alone
No one's gonna fix me when I'm broke
How do you cry with inanimate eyes?
You're never gonna smile with the way that you're wired
And I feel so all alone
I feel so all alone
You might also like
As she sits on my shelf
It makes me think of you
The way she carries the things that remind me of who
We used to be before we became antiques
She's a lot like you
She just takes some glue to stay
And I feel so all alone
No one's gonna fix me when I'm broke
How do you cry with inanimate eyes?
You're never gonna smile with the way that you're wired
And I feel so all alone
I feel so all alone
I got nothing left inside of my chest
But it's all alright
I guess it's all alright
I got nothing left inside of my chest
But it's all alright
Well I got the call soon as the day hit night
As soon as the headlights lit up the Westside
I stopped the car and came outside
Cause I know that tone
I remember the first time
We wished upon parallel lines
Waiting for a friend to call
And say they're still alive
I've given everyone I know
A good reason to go
I was surprised you stuck around
Long enough to figure out
That it's all alright
I guess it's all alright
I got nothing left inside of my chest
But it's all alright
I guess it's all alright
I got nothing left inside of my chest
But it's all alright
And now all my loves that come back to haunt me
My regrets and texts sent to taunt me
I never claimed to be more than a one-night stand at all
I've given everyone I know
A good reason to go
But I came back with the belief
That everyone I love is gonna leave me
And it's all alright
I guess it's all alright
I got nothing left inside of my chest
But it's all alright
And it's all alright
I guess it's all alright
I got nothing left inside of my chest
But it's all all
You've fallen from the sun
Crashing through the clouds
I see you burning out
That I put up a front
Believe me just this once
Let me keep this one
Yeah it's all alright
I guess it's all alright
I got nothing left inside of my chest
But it's all alright
And it's all alright
I guess it's all alright
I got nothing left inside of my chest
But it's all alright
I guess it's all alright
I got nothing left inside of my chest
But it's all alright
And it's all alright
I guess it's all alright
I got nothing left inside of my chest
I got nothing left inside of my chest but it's all alright
I got nothing left inside of my chest but it's all alright
And I got the call soon as the day hit night
As soon as the headlights lit up the Westside
I stopped the car and came outside
'Cause I know that tone
I remember the first time we wished upon parallel lines
Waiting for a friend to call and say they're still alive
I've given everyone I know a good reason to go
I was surprised you stuck around long enough to figure out
That it's all alright  I guess it's all alright
I got nothing left inside of my chest but it's all alright
I got nothing left inside of my chest but it's all alright
And now all my loves that come back to haunt me
My regrets and texts sent to taunt me

So it's gonna have to be two passes
The pretty—)
All the pretty girls on a Saturday night
So I call your name
Cross my fingers  uncross the others
With nothing to prove
I don't wanna say I'm leaving
I'll stay until the weekend
You can take all the things
The boxes and rings and get going
'Cause I've been waiting for
All the pretty girls on a Saturday night
Let it be and come to me with the look in your eyes
Well you break and take all the words from my mouth
I wish all the pretty girls were shaking me down
So I call (I call) you out (Out baby)
Just to feel a little bit better about myself (He does)
I do (You do)  baby
Until their lips start to move and their friends talk music
I'll say  I've never heard the tune
But I have  I just hate the band
'Cause they remind me of you
Every single night ends up the same
I don't say much at all but I bring up your name
(Over and over and over)
I think it's striking me out

Let it be and come to me with the look in your eyes
Well you break and take all the words from my mouth
I wish all the pretty girls were shaking me down
But not you  you still wear boots and your hair is too long
And then this one doesn't wanna admit she's falling in love
When all the pretty girls can't measure to you?
I don't understand your reasons
Please just stay over the weekend
You can't take all those things  they define you and me
Everything we've become
You're all that I need
Please don't make me face my generation alone
All the pretty girls on a Saturday night
Let it be and come to me with the look in your eyes
And you break and take all the words from my mouth
I wish all the pretty girls were shaking me down
But not you  I feel your faith is destroying the world
And then this one  never really understood
The eighties is over and done
When all the pretty girls can't measure to you?
Say all the pretty girls on a Saturday night
All the pretty girls on a Saturday night
All the pretty girls on a Saturday night
Turns out I saw them a couple of days ago
They were laughing and drinking and smoking and singing on
At least I'm not as sad as I used to be
You should've seen me a couple of years ago
I was laughing and drinking and smoking and singing on
It's such a gas when you bring up the past
At least I'm not as sad as I used to be
At least I'm not as sad as I used to be

Just get it out
At least I'm not as sad as I used to be
Had you stuck around or come out to a show
But you was taken over by rock and roll
While we were laughing and drinking and smoking and singing
Have I seen eyes as empty as
These streets of my city on a Saturday night
But the green of your eyes say go
Leave it all behind
But I don't need to be reminded a change is gonna come
I can feel it on the tip of your tongue
We met up once we settled the sun
Between the heat and the work week
The fear is we could use some sleep
But sleep to the superfluous man means better use for beds
And I'll bet I'm coming home alone tonight
I don't need to be reminded that this is how it was
Now all the barlights are blinking in time
To Mexican music it's taunting the pavement
I feel alive

And one of us does nothing at all

Well I'm the Little Bo Peep of the bunch
And he swears he's gotta take this call
I'm scared he's gonna leave us too soon
So we settled for the center of town
Where all the rich white kids is out looking for a fight
Got the blonde one staring me down
And I really wanna take a swing
I can't help but remember James Dean
See we are part of the few who agree
(I feel alive)
I think I'm gonna live forever
(I feel alive)
I know I'm gonna live forever
Now all the barlights are blinking in time
I feel alive
Now all the barlights are blinking in time
I feel alive
Now all the barlights
To Mexican music
Hayal gücümü kullanmayı geri aldım
Daha iyisi için veya daha kötüsü için  henüz bilmiyorum
Ama  beni anlıyabilen biri olduğunu hep biliyordum
Bu yüzden her şeyin yerine oturmasının uzun zaman alıcağını   tahmin ediyorum
Aniden kayboldum
Sokağımda
Bloğumda
Oh neden oh neden
Oh  neden benim için burada değilsin ?
Göremiyor musun   bu sefer aklımı kaybediyorum ?
Bu sefer  gerçek olduğunu düşünüyorum   görebiliyorum
Bütün ağaç tepeleri kırmızıya dönüyor
Bodegaların yakınındaki dilenciler bana sırıtıyor
Bence onlar  bir şey istiyor
Gözlerimi kapatıyorum  kendime nefes almayı anlatıyorum
Ve sakin ol
Sakin ol
Yıkılıyor gibi hissettiğini biliyorum
Oh bazen bunun  çok zor olduğunu  biliyorum
Sakin ol

Herkesin  beni yakalamak için dışarıda olmasından korkuyordum
Bu günlerde  benimle konuşmadan önce duraklıyorsun
Seni hep camdan dışarı bakıyorken görüyorum
Şimdi her bir çatlak   geçtiğim her bir kuruş
Ayrılmam ya da toparlanmam gerektiğini söylüyor
Ama  yaptığım her  bir basit sıçrayışta
Gelen  kötü şansıda sırtıma yüklüyorum
Vaftiz edildiğim an
Ya da bir gün ölüceğimi fark ettiğim an
Keşke hayatımda insanlarımı  veya yerimi bulabilseydim
Ve bir 'carolin' e geldiklerinde
Bize bir koroda liderlik edecek
Tamamı ile sevindiğimiz ve şöyle bir şarkı söyleyeceğimiz  yerde:
Oh sakin ol
Sakin ol
Yıkılıyor gibi hissettiğini biliyorum
Oh bazen bunun  çok zor olduğunu  biliyorum
Sakin ol
Onu benden al  ben bin kere burada bulundum
Nabzından nefret ediyorsun çünkü   hala canlı olduğunu düşündürüyor
Ve her şey yanlış
Bazen sadece çok zor olabilir
Sakin ol
O geceyi çok fazla hatırlamıyorum
Sadece yürüyordum   ve seni sevgiyle düşünüyordum
En kötüsünün nasıl olacağını düşünüyordum
Bu sokaktan bir melodi sesi geldiğinde
Ve adamı hatırlamıyorum
Dilenciyi veya melodisini
Kelimeler devir ettiğim her farklılık kadar değişti
Oh sakin ol
Sakin ol
Yıkılıyor gibi hissettiğini biliyorum
Oh bazen bunun  çok zor olduğunu  biliyorum
Sakin ol
Onu benden al  ben bin kere burada bulundum
Nabzından nefret ediyorsun çünkü   hala canlı olduğunu düşündürüyor
Ve her şey yanlış
Bazen sadece çok zor olabilir
Sakin ol

 I can see

I was naughty in high school  but now i'm trying to be nice
Even Santa he is thankful for the little things
(Like what kind of stuff Santa?)
Thanks to the reindeer that pull me on my sleigh
Thanks for the moonlight that guides me on my way
And I won't be greedy  I don't ask for much these days
I just need one thing  please believe in me
Well  Christmas comes just once a year
I was hoping for snow shoes  or maybe a bike
But when I asked them for fun  they bought me Aim and Ignite
Even Santa he is thankful for the little things (Sweet Santa)
Thanks to the reindeer that pull me on my sleigh
Thanks for the moonlight that guides me on my way
Thanks for the memories 'cause they keep us safe and remind me that it's okay to be lonely
Please believe in me
Um  I actually just got her a Bowflex
Shut Up! I was gonna get her a Bowflex
Well  do you want to go shopping for something else?
When do you come out to play?
'Cause if the Lord is gonna find me
He'd better start looking today
Last week my baby hit the slopes
While I spent the weekend setting traps in the road
I should have been cutting out my eyelids
You'll never guess what baby did when she got home
Now at least the birds are singing to me
But what they're trying to say
I don't know
(You're beautiful) I think they come from the cold
(For all your big mistakes) I think they come from the cold
(You stayed the same) To the city that doesn't snow
So I drove until we both broke down
I was stranded in a border town
Believing the motel TV would bring me to safety
But between MTV and Mr. O'Reilly
Took one last look at the gold as it shattered on a mountaintop

'Cause if the Lord is gonna find me
He'd better start looking today
So I can rise with the river
We all float before we sink
I pray that it can climb mountains to me!
I say goodbye to the canyon
I will set sail to the streets
Where I don't care to be forgiven
I want to be forgotten
(You're beautiful) They think I'm beautiful
(For all your big mistakes) They think I'm beautiful
(You're beautiful) For all my big mistakes
For all my big mistakes
And I found you with a bottle of wine
Your head in the curtains and heart like the fourth of July
You swore and said we are not
We are not shining stars
This I know
I never said we are
Though I've never been through hell like that
I've closed enough windows to know you can never look back
If you're lost and alone
Or you're sinking like a stone
Carry on
May your past be the sound of your feet upon the ground
Carry on
So I met up with some friends in the edge of the night
At a bar off seventy five
And we talked and talked about how our parents will die
All our neighbors and wives
But I like to think
I can cheat it all
And it's nice to know
When I was left for dead
I was found and now I don't roam these streets
I am not the ghost you want of me
If you're lost and alone or you're sinking like a stone
Carry on
May your past be the sound of your feet upon the ground and
Carry on
Woah my head is on fire
But my legs are fine
After all they are mine
Lay your clothes down on the floor
Close the door
Hold the phone
Show me how
No one's ever gonna stop us now
'Cause we are
We are shining stars
We are invincible
We are who we are
On our darkest day
When we're miles away
If you're lost and alone
Or you're sinking like a stone
Carry on
May your past be the sound of your feet upon the ground and
Carry on
(No one's ever gonna stop us now)
The cars were cutting like knives in a fist fight
And I found you with a bottle of wine
Your head in the curtains
And heart like the fourth of July
You swore and said
We are not
We are not shining stars
This I know
I never said we are
Though I've never been through hell like that
I've closed enough windows
To know you can never look back
If you're lost and alone
Or you're sinking like a stone
Carry on
May your past be the sound
Of your feet upon the ground
Carry on
Carry on  carry on
So I met up with some friends
At the edge of the night
At a bar off 75
And we talked and talked
About how our parents will die
All our neighbors and wives
But I'd like to think
I can cheat it all
To make up for the times I've been cheated on
And it's nice to know
When I was left for dead
I was found and now I don't roam these streets
I am not the ghost you are to me

We will find our way home
If you're lost and alone
Or you're sinking like a stone
Carry on
May your past be the sound
Of your feet upon the ground and
Carry on
Playing with his chains
Talking about a blood moon
Asking how I found this place
My eyes are drained
From the one that got away
In walks lady long boots
Looking for a date
I would make the first move
But I'm too drunk to enunciate
They're moving on
Don't wanna hear about someone's day
And it's so hard just to breathe
There's such a fine line 'tween the things you want and the
And the things that you need
So I'm not going to sleep
Slipping into midnight
Under harsh lights
And nothing gets me down
Running into old friends
I don't need anymore
Tonight I'm gonna show them
We all got scars
We all got scars
We all got scars
We all got scars
So
I'm slipping into midnight
Under harsh lights
And nothing here is bringing me down

We fall asleep to revolution
And wake up to another sad excuse
How we got it our way
And it's so hard not to scream
There is such a fine line 'tween the things you are and the
And the things that you've been
Slipping into midnight
Under harsh lights
And nothing gets me down
Up above the past loves
I don't need anymore
Tonight I'm gonna show them
We all got scars
We all got scars
We all got scars
We all got scars
So
I'm slipping into midnight
Under harsh lights
And nothing here is bringing me down
I'm scared that I'm becoming a satellite
On the sadder side of the moon
Convinced that anyone stood by my side
Now you're on the other side of the room
But I get this funny feeling
That tonight is gonna end
Much better than it's been
I thought I'd have to keep my eyes open
Until the light shines in
And it's so hard just to be
There's such a fine line
There's such a fine line
Such a fine line
But I'm not sleeping tonight
Slipping into midnight
Under harsh lights
And nothing gets me down
Running into old friends
I don't need anymore
Tonight I'm gonna show them
We all got scars
We all got scars
We all got scars
We all got scars
So
I'm slipping into midnight
Under harsh lights
And Nothing here is bringing me down
Nothing here is bringing me down
All my biggest mistakes or the way that I made it out
All the muscles in my mouth never smiled or said profound things
Until the day she handed you to me
Now for all the steps you'll take and all you've overcome
I wanna be the one to put it in a song
Take every single tear for all the world to hear
I wanna be the one to put it in a song
Cigarettes are raining hard on the Upper East Side
And I know that it's been sang before but you're my human holiday
I put my hands to the table and dare say the love of my life
And your brother with his best friend shares the name of an inebriate
It couldn't bring me down
Now for everything you lost and all you've overcome
I wanna be the one to put it in a song
Take every single tear for all the world to hear
I wanna be the one to put it in a song

What have we done  oh my god
This is really happening
You never looked so bored
Can you feel my fingernails?
They've never been so short
It's hard to lay a golden egg with everyone around
It's hard to stay inside my head when words keep pouring out
Like starlight crashing through the room  we'll lose our feathers
Yes  I know it hurts at first but it gets better
It gets better  it gets better
It gets better  we'll get better
It gets better  it gets better
It gets better  we'll get better
I can taste your summer sweat
It's never been so warm
So can we kick the covers off?
They're always on
It's never been so warm

It gets better  we'll get better
It gets better  it gets better
It gets better  we'll get better
There's a fire in sky
Some snow on the ground
Not quite enough cigarettes
To calm me down
What have we done  oh my god
What have we done  oh my god
It gets better  it gets better
It gets better  we'll get better
It gets better  it gets better
It gets better  we'll get better  (This is really happening)
It gets better  it gets better
It gets better  we'll get better  (This is really happening)
It gets better  it gets better
And though you say these days are happy  why's the power off and I'm fucked up?
And Mom  I know made dad proud
I started jumping the shark
I started jumping the shark
I started jumping the shark
I want a new life
I started jumping the shark
I started jumping the shark
I started jumping the shark
I want a new life
One as an adult
And if the plane goes down or if the crew can't wake me up
And even if there's songs to sing or grandchildren you'll never meet
'Cause I put more faith in TV shows than I ever have some holy ghost
You know you've played a part but after everything went dark
I started  I started...

Just spend an evening with me
Just a lazy evening  then you could be leaving
Or we could stay and talk until three
I will think it's magic and I'll hope you'll agree  so...
Light a roman candle with me
Just a roman candle
Just a perfect apple
If we were honest and both wrote a sonnet together
A sandwich with everything on it
At least we would know that the sparks didn't glow
But we owe it to ourselves to try
So we aim and ignite!
So often I call and I plead with you:
Give me a chance!
It's not often that I understand
The ins and the outs of what's wrong and what's right
So don't think of tomorrow tonight
You look for a legend
I'm looking for common ground
Your heart isn't breaking
And mine isn't making a sound
Light a roman candle with me
Just a roman candle
Just a perfect apple

I can't help but love thinking that everyone doesn't get it
To my left there's a window (Where did I go?)
My reflection just blends in to rows of clothes
I put one foot in front of the other one
I put one foot in front of the other one
I happen to stumble upon a chapel last night
And I can't help but back up when I think of what happens inside
But what you're calling a sin isn't up to them
I put one foot in front of the other one
I put one foot in front of the other one
I put one foot in front of the other one

Then may his soul live on forever in my song
I put one foot in front of the other one
I put one foot in front of the other one
I put one foot in front of the other one
In front of the other one
In front of the other one
Cause I know I'll never take the time
To unpack my missteps and call all of our friends
I figure they would take your side
Your name comes up a lot
When I talk to my ma
I was out on the town
So I came to your window last night
I tried not to throw stones
But I wanted to come inside
Now I'm causing a scene
Thinking you need a reason to smile
There's no one to keep me warm
So maybe I should put up a fight
I'll call them back and borrow a box knife
So I can learn to live
With all the stupid shit I've been doing since '99
And I know I could be more clever
And I know I could be more strong
But I'm waiting for the day you come back and say
I drink a lot
I'm not sure if that's new
But these days when I wake up from a night I forgot
I just wish that it never came true

But I wanted to come inside
Now I'm causing a scene
Thinking you need a reason to smile
Your head aches just to feel what it knows
Please leave a light on when you go
How can you fix something
That you can't touch without hurting?
The lesson you've learned is leaving you dumb
Please leave a light on when it's done
Standing high above the flood line
Watching all your belongings go by
How can you see the ending
If you're lost at the beginning?
The day hides all that the night left behind
Just some scars from a life that used to trouble me
I used to run at first sight of the sun
Now I lay here waiting for you to wake up
The city outside still sounds like it’s on fire
You put on new sheets  the white flag of a Saturday night
I know we stayed up talking in circles
But I like to think the symmetry will keep me close to you
For everyone I’m out to prove wrong  you keep the light on
The only one  you know me better than the truth
That we can move on
'Cause thus far you are the best thing that
This life has yet to lose and
For once  there is nothing up my sleeve

For once  there is nothing up my sleeve
Just some scars from a life that used to trouble me
I used to run at first sight of the sun
Now I lay here waiting for you to wake up
I lay here waiting for you to wake up
Do you remember when we stayed up
'Til the sun stretched through the room?
I used to blame it on the queens walkin' down 7th Avenue
It’s been years now since we moved
I've gotten good with an excuse
You know I try not to speak superlatives
But it’s impossible with you
The city outside is nothin' but a flicker now
You see your friends to bed  you turn out the lights
I start to think you’ll make a beautiful mother  I
 it's lovely weather
 Yoo hoo

Some nights  I call it a draw
Some nights  I wish that my lips could build a castle
Some nights  I wish they'd just fall off
But I still wake up  I still see your ghost
Oh Lord  I'm still not sure what I stand for
What do I stand for? What do I stand for?
Most nights  I don't know anymore...
What do I stand for? What do I stand for?
Most nights  I don't know
Why don't we break the rules already?
I was never one to believe the hype - save that for the black and white
I try twice as hard and I'm half as liked  but here they come again to jack my style
And that's alright 
I found a martyr in my bed tonight  she stops my bones from wondering
Oh  who am I? Mhm
Some nights  I stay up cashing in my bad luck 
Some nights  I call it a draw
Some nights  I wish that my lips could build a castle
Some nights  I wish they'd just fall off
But I still wake up  I still see your ghost
Oh Lord  I'm still not sure what I stand for
What do I stand for? What do I stand for?
Most nights  I don't know anymore...
 I say fuck it all and stare at the calendar
 imagining they'd scare me
 pushing you to hold me
 never let me see the world
 I live in horror of people on the radio
 I've never been so bitter
 why you wanna stay?
 I've been going crazy...
 why you wanna stay?
 I've been fucking crazy...
 try not to look upward
 I'm just trying to get some sleep...
Some nights  I call it a draw
Some nights  I wish that my lips could build a castle
Some nights  I wish they'd just fall off
But I still wake up  I still see your ghost
(Oh-ooh-woah) What do I stand for?

Most nights  I don't know
(Oh  come on) So this is it?
I sold my soul for this?
Washed my hands of that for this?
I miss my mom and dad for this?
When I see stars  that's all they are
When I hear songs  they sound like a swan
Oh  come on
(Oh-woah  oh-ooh-woah-oh)
Five minutes in  and I'm bored again
(Oh-ooh-woah-oh  oh-oh)
Ten years of this  I'm not sure if anybody understands
This one is not for the folks at home
(Oh-woah  oh-ooh-woah-oh)
(Oh-ooh-woah-oh  oh-oh)
Who the fuck wants to die alone
All dried up in the desert sun?
My heart is breaking for my sister
And the con that she called love
And then I look into my nephew's eyes
Man  you wouldn't believe
The most amazing things
That can come from
Some terrible nights
Oh-woah  oh-ooh-woah-oh
Oh-ooh-woah-oh  oh-oh
The other night  you wouldn't believe

I'd called you up  but we both agreed

This growing old is getting old
I often find myself here thinking
About the birds  the boats  and past loves
That flew away or started sinking
And it's crazy here without you
I used to think this all was ours
We'd stay up late  debate on how we'd find our way
Say it's all up in the stars
Some nights I rule the world
With bar lights and pretty girls
But most nights
I stay straight and think about my mom
Oh god  I miss her so much
And there are people on the street
They're coming up to me
They're telling me that they like what I do now
And so I tried my best when I took the fall
To get right back up  back in your arms
If you're out here why do I miss you so much
I feel like I had it all
Back before I lost it all
Now I just wait for you to talk to me
But you won't even look at me  baby

So don't you ever kiss me
Don't you wish on me
Why can't you see that no one's gonna save us?
Oh  come on girl
I just need a helping hand
I close my eyes and think about tomorrow
It never came true  it came true
It never came true
Oh  and you
You're always holding onto stars
You're always holding onto stars
Cause no one is gonna save us
Oh  and you
You're always holding onto stars
I think they're better from afar
Because no one is gonna save us
Oh  and me

So don't you ever kiss me
Don't you wish on me
Why can't you see that
No one's gonna save us?
No one's gonna save us

It's how we do it! Our heads in our hands
It's how we do it! I'm not looking for a reason to go
You put the keys in the car and drive

I know we can do it if we do it all night
You put the keys in the car and drive

You put the keys in the car and drive

If you love somebody
You'd better let them know
Oh we got fifty good years left to spend out in the garden
Until we die
We were barely eighteen when we crossed collective hearts
It was cold but it got warm when you barely crossed my eye
I knew nothing of romance but it was love at second sight
It's the love we used to know inside and out
I don't wanna go too far if I just can't go on
I got your love I understand what I have done
So we moved to Arizona to save our only son

Crossed my mind when I crossed the bridge
You wanted better love when it was sleeping in your bedroom

And you feel like fallin' down
One night  you were out
I was inside feeling sorry for myself
I drank from any bottle I could find
I broke into your room
I tried on all your clothes
And I read every note
So what the fuck happened to us?
What the fuck happened to us?
We used to be something - I can't remember just what
We were born into the chandeliers like troubadours and saints
I wanna take it back to all the days when we would stay in bed
I'd lay my head upon your lap  I hope you never take it back
I stand corrected and relieved  drunk and uncomfortable in heels
I suppose that it makes sense you'd never run and tell your friend
Oh  that you left too soon
Found me dolled up in your room - I know just what you'd say

If I could name just one thing that's gonna haunt me
That's gonna bleed me dry  that's gonna bruise
It'd have to be the look upon your face when Nattie came to pick you up  take you away
And you just stood there in the hall waiting for me to call it off
What kind of selfish piece of shit would base a life on no regret?
Would let the only one who ever understood me walk alone?
And I closed the door
I made it halfway down your hall
Something caught my eye and I fell apart
Well  there's a picture on your dresser drawer
And it doesn't even look like me
But I swear to God  when the bulbs went off
I wish we could have shined forever
I was there in a suit you made
You were beautiful  it was your birthday
And only for a night  we believed in magic
Well do you remember when I woke you up to tell you I love you?
Said do you remember when I woke you up to tell you I love you?
And I still do
So what the fuck happened to us?
What the fuck happened to us?
What the fuck happened to us?
What the fuck happened to us?
That when she pulls me by the hair
She hasn't much to hold onto
That I been sleeping on my side
I finished kissing my death
So now I head back up the steps
Thinking about where I've been -
I mean the sun was never like this
I wanna feel with the season
I guess it makes sense
Cause my life's become as vapid as
A night out in Los Angeles
And I just want to stay in bed
And hold you like I used to
You know that I am home
So darling if you love me
Would you let me know?
If you were thinking that the worst is yet to come
Why am I the one always packing up my stuff?
I get the feeling that I'm right where I belong
Why am I the one always packing up my stuff?
You might also like
She got enough on her mind
That she feel no sorrow
I let my fate fill the air
So now she rollin down the window
Never been one to hold on
But I need a last breath
So I ask if she remembers when
We were fools to think that nothing could go wrong
If you were thinking that the worst is yet to come
Why am I the one always packing up my stuff?
I get the feeling that I'm right where I belong
Why am I the one always packing up my stuff?
I think I kinda like it
But I might have had too much
I'll move back down to this western town
When they find me out make no mistake about it
I'll move back down to this western town
When they find me out make no mistake about it
I'll move back down to this western town
If you were thinking that the worst is yet to come
Why am I the one always packing up my stuff?
If you were thinking that the worst is yet to come
Why am I the one always packing up my stuff?
I get the feeling that I'm right where I belong
Why am I the one always packing up my stuff?
I think I kinda like it but I might have had too much
I'll move back down
When I hear a song
When I hear a song
I knew she was gonna meet her connection
At her feet was her foot-loose man
You can't always get what you want
You can't always get what you want
You can't always get what you want
But if you try sometime
You might find you get what you need!
And I went down to the demonstration to get my fair share of abuse
If we don't we'll blow a fifty amp fuse (sing it to me)
You can't always get what you want
You can't always get what you want
You can't always get what you want
But if you try sometimes
I was standing in line with Mr. Jimmy
We decided that we would have a soda
I sung my song to Mr. Jimmy
And he said one word to me and that was dead
I said to him
You can't always get what you want (tell me baby)
You can't always get what you want (no)
But if you try sometimes
You just might find you get what you need!
You get what you need! (yeah! aw baby aw yeah)
I saw her today at the reception
In her glass was a bleeding man
She was practised at the art of deception
You can't always get what you want
You can't always get what you want
You can't always get what you want
But if you try sometime
You can't always get what you want
You can't always get what you want
But if you try sometime"
