lyrics
"I'm underground  I fell down
Yeah  I fell down
I'm freakin' out  where am I now?
Upside down and I can't stop it now
It can't stop me now  oh
I  I'll get by
I  I'll survive
When the world's crashin' down
When I fall and hit the ground
I will turn myself around
Don't you try to stop me
I  I won't cry
I found myself (myself) in Wonderland
Get back on (back on) my feet again
Is this real? (This real?) Is it pretend?
I'll take a stand (a stand) until the end
I  I'll get by
I  I'll survive
When the world's crashin' down
When I fall and hit the ground
I will turn myself around
Don't you try to stop me
I  I won't cry

I  I'll get by
I  I'll survive
When the world's crashin' down
When I fall and hit the ground
I will turn myself around
Don't you try to stop me
I even freak myself out
I laugh myself to sleep
It's my lullaby
Sometimes I drive so fast
Just to feel the danger
Is it enough to love?
Is it enough to breathe?
Somebody rip my heart out
And leave me here to bleed
Is it enough to die?
Somebody save my life
To walk within the lines
Would make my life so boring
I want to know that I have been to the extreme
Anything to make me feel alive

 you know I hate it
 my body's achin'
 but I don't feel alright on the inside
 my world's getting colder
 I don't feel alright on the inside
 my blood is rushin'
 I'm quick to change the subject

I've been to all the parties and it wasn't there
Screamed at the top of my lungs and no one cared
I've run around the whole damn world to get back here
Now let me feel high when I'm sober
Let me feel young when I'm older
Let me feel proud when it's over
It was in me
I took the time to listen and I found it here (Ahh)
I stopped to see the vision and it was clear (Ahh)

'Cause I can't seem to find a trace
Guess it must've got erased somehow
Probably 'cause I always forget
Every time someone tells me their name
It's always gotta be the same (In my world)
Never wore cover-up
Always beat the boys up
Grew up in a five thousand population town
Made my money by cutting grass
Got fired by a fried chicken ass
You know I always stay up without sleepin'
And think to myself
Where do I belong forever?
Can't help it if I space in a daze
My eyes tune out the other way
I may switch off and go in a daydream
But sometimes I can't even speak
Would someone be and not pretend?
I'm off again in my world

When you're all alone in the lands of forever

If I could say what I wanna see
I wanna see you go down on one knee
Marry me today
Guess I'm wishing my life away (Uh)
With these things I'll never say
(What is wrong with) What's wrong with my tongue?
These words keep slippin' away
(Stutter) I stutter (Stutter)  I stumble
Like I've got nothin' to say
'Cause I'm feelin' nervous
Tryna be so perfect
'Cause I know you're worth it  you're worth it  yeah

I wanna see you go down on one knee
Marry me today
Guess I'm wishing my life away
With these things I'll never say
When you tell me that it'll be okay
But I don't
When you say that it's gonna be
It always turns out to be a different way
I try to believe you
Tomorrow (Tomorrow)
Tomorrow is a different day
(Tomorrow)
It's always been up to you
I'm gonna do what I have to do
Just don't
Gimme a little time
Leave me alone a little while
Maybe it's not too late

I'm not ready

And I wanna believe you
When you tell me that it'll be okay
That's how it went
I had a smile on my face and I sat up straight
I wanted to know you  I wanted to show you
You don't know me  don't ignore me
You don't want me there  you just shut me out
You don't know me  don't ignore me
If you had your way  you'd just shut me up
Make me go away
(That I'm so unwanted)
No  I just don't understand why you won't talk to me
It hurts that I'm so unwanted for nothing
Don't talk words against me
I wanted to know you  I wanted to show you
You don't know me  don't ignore me
You don't want me there  you just shut me out
You don't know me  don't ignore me

I'm not rattled 'cause I shattered all of this before (This before)
Steadier than steel 'cause I'm ready with my shield and sword (Shield and sword)
Back on the saddle 'cause I gathered all my strength for more (Strength for more)

I never thought I'd need you there when I cried
And the days feel like years when I'm alone
And the bed where you lie is made up on your side
When you walk away
I count the steps that you take
Do you see how much I need you right now?
When you're gone
The pieces of my heart are missin' you
When you're gone
The face I came to know is missin' too
To always get me through the day
And make it okay
I miss you
I've never felt this way before
Everything that I do reminds me of you
And they smell just like you
I love the things that you do

Will always get me through the day

But with you  it's not like that at all
There's a girl that gives a shit behind this wall
You just walk through it
And I remember all those crazy things you said
You left them runnin' through my head
You're always there  you're everywhere
But right now  I wish you were here
All those crazy things we did
Didn't think about it  just went with it
You're always there  you're everywhere
But right now  I wish you were here
I wish you were here
I wish you were here
I love the way you are
It's who I am  don't have to try hard
We always say  say it like it is
And the truth is that I really miss
