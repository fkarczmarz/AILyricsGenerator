"For what I can give
She knows what I am but
She won’t believe me
Is it all okay?
Will I come off the lightest?
I can’t believe it
It’s always like this
Kept it at bay
Yes  you kept your words
There on your mouth
But it’s not what I heard
If I follow the light
That I deem the brightest
I won’t believe that
It’s always like this
I’m not whole
I’m not whole
You waste it all
I’m not whole
I'm not whole
You waste it all
I’m not whole
I’m not whole
You waste it all
I’m not whole
I’m not whole
You waste it all
But I'm not gone

Oh  you can wait
For what I can give
You know what I am
So you know how I live
Try to look proud
But you’re not in the slightest
It's happening now
And it’s always been like this
I’m not whole
I’m not whole
You waste it all
I’m not whole
I’m not whole
You waste it all
I’m not whole
I’m not whole
You waste it all
I’m not whole
I’m not whole
You waste it all
I’m not whole
I’m not whole
You waste it all
I’m not whole
I’m not whole
You waste it all
I’m not whole
I’m not whole
You waste it all
I’m not whole
I’m not whole
You waste it all
There's never time
To say what I really had in mind
It's all the same
A different life behind every face
But I can't change
I've seen a different page
It's in my head
And I can't turn my back
And every word I try to say to you
I never say at the right time
In the right way
And every feeling waiting to escape
And suffocate
Every night and every day
It's all the same
A different life behind every face
Well I can't change
I've seen a different pain
It's in my head
 just keep them there
 cancel on me again
 cancel on me again
 I'm dreaming of you rushing
I'm try'n to keep the options near
The last you saw across the track
The rest are never coming back
If anybody wants to know
Our love's getting old
Light in the cracks in the road

Our love's getting old
Light in the cracks in the road
I'm kneeling down to get closer to the sign
And you're breaking my back every time
It's hard to see it for all the rust
But I saw it fading and I have some faith in us
Don't need to tell me
You know this ain't nothing new
Of course I love you
Of course I do
But to outplay is not to love
And yet I keep on coming back to call your bluff
It's hard to see it for all the rust
But I saw it fading and I have some faith in us
Come to

Your evening eyes
The rain outside
The way I know
No fear that I'll
Be fading out alone
It's hard to see it for all the rust
Sun will light up  it’s all to come
I got no words  I’ll follow you
We got your back  you’re coming too
The weight is lifting off my mind
And everyone is running wild
The Earth has split beneath our toes
And everybody knows
Roll the past away from me
Run along and dip my feet
Hold our breath and we can go down
Hope you see the best in me
Diving under next to me
Hold our breath and we can go down
Wonder how our lives could be
Say it’s warm  just promise me
Hold our breath and we can go down

And everyone around me knows
Roll the past away from me

Your shadow days are gone
Hanging on a lonely thread
Going where the last one led
All the cracks around your head

It's the debt you owe
It's that subtle way

I await your crown

Bow your head and let your eyelids close on down
Where we're going you won't need to bring your frown
You will find that all the things that I have said
Will come true when you are lying in your bed
I have made you all that I want
I know you're keeping to your own sound
You're running out of sight when the light goes down
Said you'll be waiting 'till the night's done but there's no one

I can feel you already there
And I can see you with my eyes shut

Said you'll be waiting for the next one

Our love was long so long
And then forgotten like an old song
You said your life went on
But I always knew I always knew you'd come
Begging to understand
Life of a selfless man
Cause out of all the flaws I've stumbled on
It's the hardest one to focus on
It's the hardest one to focus on
Why are you calling up?
Isn't one enough?
Giving up all she's got
Always assured but I like it when we pretend
You should be around  they should just say when
You should make time  you should make time for them
My ever-changing ghost
I think he loves them the most
He always shows you where and how and when you went wrong
Always planned but never get things done
I walk in the room and see you waltzing around
The love that you give is such a familiar sound
You just fly straight up and calm the fuck down
You see a house fall because you built it on the wrong ground
My ever-changing ghost
I think he loves them the most
The most
Of all the faces on the screen
The melting ice caps in my drink
Made me stop and think about
Think about time running out

I could be home by now
When the whistle blows
And we pull out slow
This is where I build my home
And I wait for you so patiently
Letting you find your own
If you wanna try  you can come out and see me
I could be home by now
But anywhere I am  tell me you're waiting for me
I could be home by now
When I am old  let the tension flee
I was born crying out and it's come back to me
When everyone else is setting up to fall
I'll just think back on it all
I'll remember long drives  sitting in the back
Looking out and endless snow  waiting in the silence
If you won't spill your heart  I'll chase you for the words you owe
Is it late enough? Is it late enough?
There's a story in which my eyes shut

It's my reality
Then I curl up  it won't take much
To stand in front and see
I got that ego  what do I know?
It don't mean much to me
Fall away now  on my way down

Staring out to sea

Waking sitting upright
Can't explain the sunlight
Wondering why you're not home
Girl I go beside you
Left before you tried to
Work out all the unknowns
Blame it all on me when
I forget to defend
Everything that we worked out
Something in her wording
I cannot help searching
For what memory found
Thought it stopped just as it start
But that is not what you are
You're a layer on my clothes
Made of ivy and gold
Meet me in the hallway
Bite your lip when I say
Never have you left my mind
Stop and think it over
Smiling moving closer
Oh what delicate time!
Blame it all on me when
I forget to defend
Everything that we put down
Something in her wording
I guess she was just searching
For some laudatory sound
The moment you were deified
You turn as if your mind replies
If your devout is insurmountable
These scattered flashes are divine
They can't help but sway your mind
Never really put me right
The words we said by dim lamplight
Bodies cold and intertwined
These scattered flashes are divine
They can't help but sway your mind
These scattered flashes are divine
They can't help but sway your mind
These scattered flashes are divine
Come in you know what's been made up
Reading the signs that just seep out
You've gotta leave it
You've gotta leave it
Don't you go evade me now
Come see what you've done
Each of your reasons has broken
Call it off once you have spoken
Fill to the top then split open
Repeating over and over
Now you have to leave it
You've gotta leave it

Set fire to my forest
And you let it burn
Sang off-key in my chorus

Set fire to my purpose

My head was numb

Oh and you had it
Caught like a rabbit
Told you to wait
But it's too late
You got your man
Rinsing him down
Turning your head
To mine instead
Gave me the eyes
Pleading you to stay  come alive
Say you mean it  seal it up
Say you want to try
Say you haven't had enough
Say you want to
Once you get the feeling  it
Wants you back for more
Says it's going to heal it  but
You won't make the call
One step back  you're leaving it
Now it's moving on
Why won't you believe in it
Until it's gone?
Fading at the light
Softly say
Get it out my mind anyway
Say you mean it  seal it up
Say you want to try
Say you haven't had enough
Say you want to

All I know

Keep going round and round and round
Keep going round and round and round
Keep going round and round and round
And round and round and round and round
But I love you
But late one night you threw them down
Simple promises you said you'd never break
But now you have
All throughout the morning though
I'm begging no
Your lips they stay perfectly still
Still... still... 
Did he fill the empty spaces
Was he everything I'm not?
There's no force behind my mouth
But in just three words
He brings you down
There's a movement
Out the door
I swear but no
Your lips they stay perfectly still
Down with your bones so white
And watch while the freight trains pound
How I would love to gnaw
To gnaw on your bones so white
And watch while the freight trains pour
How I d-twain
Once is better than a whole long side
When you catch in the humble life
He can get it in the after
He can hold it in the molar while
When the back of her gets so damn worked over
Where's the lightning? Where's the lightning?
Where's the lightning now?
Wear your fingers now
He can taste it now
Come and get it now
Once is better than a lifetime
Once is better than a whole long side
When you catch it in the humble life
He can get it in the after
He can hold it in the molar while
When the back of her gets so damn worked over

Thinking what he'll ask her then
Oh this misery come when
Sitting on a silver throne
Waiting up but you're not home
Where's the lightning? Where's the lightning?
Where's the lightning now?
Wear your fingers now
He can taste it now
So we go out to the hill and we lie down
All but one sits in the corner
Trying to find a way
And alright let's go outside
And we're crying
We're all falling out
I want to go back to old times
And looking back  looking out at different things
We flew too high  let the Sun burn our wings
We never thought it would be us
Let it all come fast  turn to dust
And alright let's go outside
And we're crying
We're all falling out
I want to go back to old times

I don't care where or how
I know I said begone
Well I'm searching for you now
A firm hold on the ground
Your eyes are burning up
And I need to calm you down
I don't want you to the bone
I just need to lay down with soft skin close to my own
The rattled stones had found
I stumbled to the ground
The houses up above
And the way you pin me down
Let me be my true love's man
I'll pack her up and run
To a quiet seaside town
I don't want you to the bone
I just need to lay down with soft skin close to my own

You come down to take it on  but
You already know it’s gone  and
It's oh  been this way for long and
If I gotta ride like you want
Eating up whatever you got
Keeping my lies up  you know
Oh you force it all  oh you need it all
Trying to keep a face up tonight
Even when the guy's got you right
Coming off the wrong side  you know
Oh you force it all
You start it right  you tread so light
You tease this love  you care enough

You tease this love  you care enough
You start it right  you tread so light
The way you come alive when you are all alone
I'll be the night fly looking for a sin
You be the bright light drawing me in
But for how long?
But for how long?
And I can't say no
Not until I reap the seeds I've sown
Not until I take that long walk home
And stare you down
Words that appeased you
Promising someday
Whispered to you so desperately all night
Trick me to thinking that you could be all mine

To be here alone tonight
To be here alone tonight
The way you hold it all
 her face went red again
 another silent weekend
There's something else I'm dreaming of
Shut my eyes pretend it's there
I would promise all I could
Think about it afterward
Humour me just think it through
It's all I ever asked of you
Coming back
Coming back
Coming back
Coming back
You come out and say the word
Quick how all the tables turned
Hate that there's a space to fill
Always have and always will
I'm there when your fingers snap
It's not where we left it at
I can see the love we trapped
