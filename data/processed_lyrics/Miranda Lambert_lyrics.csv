lyrics
"Billy Bob Texas picking out new exes  actin' up
If you really wanna want me  I'll be riding on my pony
Just a singing 'Mony Mony' 'cause I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm actin' up
Even Tiger Woods couldn't swing it this good  I'm actin' up
My McQueen Mustang  hundred dollars in the tank  gassin' up
I'm out in the Mojave  call me Ricky  call me Bobby
Call me hotter than wasabi 'cause I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm actin' up
I want a sunset ride  a velvet rodeo
A Colorado high  a California glow
I wanna see the desert from a painted Palomino
Señorita need to have a little fun
I'm actin' up  I'm actin' up
Lookin' for that lightning  when I find it then I rhyme it  actin' up
Little Lone Star Elvis gonna gеt a little selfish  shackin' up
With my microphone monеy  bought my own milk and honey
Got my own kind of country  kinda funky  turn it up
I want a sunset ride  a velvet rodeo
A Colorado high  a California glow
I wanna see the desert from a painted Palomino
Señorita need to have a little fun
I'm actin' up

I got a heart on fire  boy
Don't you wanna hold it?
I'm a really good trip
Don't you wanna go on it?
I want a sunset ride  a velvet rodeo
A Colorado high  a California glow
I wanna see the desert from a painted Palomino
Señorita need to have a little fun
I'm actin' up
I'm actin' up
I'm actin' up
Horatio the human cannonball
A wedding 'neath the big top tent with barkers clowns and elephants
Sideshow family oddities and all
The dog-faced boy howled out with joy
As the tattooed lady was crying
Ever since the beginning to keep the world spinning
It takes all kinds of kinds
Thomas was a congressman with closets full of skeletons
And dresses that he wore on Friday nights
Concocted to suppress her appetite
When the children were fiddling she'd slip 'em some Ritalin
And wait for Thomasina to arrive
'Cause ever since the beginning to keep the world spinning
It takes all kinds of kinds
All kinds of kinds
When I play this old guitar from children's shows to smoky bars
I take a break and think about the past
When I stood up in geometry and everybody stared at me
And I tossed my test into the trash
I scratched off my number while hitching out under
That bush league population sign

All kinds of kinds

Drying laundry on the line
Watching Sun Tea in the window
Pocket watch tellin time
Seems like only yesterday I'd get a blank cassette
Record the country countdown cause I couldn't buy it yet
If we drove all the way to Dallas just to buy an Easter dress
God knows that shifting gears ain't what it used to be
Doing it all by hand
Cause when everything is handed to you
It's only worth as much as the time put in
It all just seemed so good the way we had it
Back before everything became automatic
If you had something to say
You'd write it on a piece of paper
Then you'd put a stamp on it
And they'd get it three days later
Boys would call the girls
And girls would turn them down
Staying married was the only way to work your problems out

Ooh 
I turn pages all the time
Don't like where I'm at
I keep digging down for the deep
Like  the records I'm playing
They might keep you waiting
But you know I'm only playing for keeps
And if the house just keeps on winning
I  got a wildcard up my sleeve
And if love keeps giving me lemons
I'll just mix 'em in my drink
And if the whole wide world stops singing
And all the stars go dark
I'll keep a light on in my soul
Keep a bluebird in my heart

I got a wildcard up my sleeve

How you holding up?
Through the winter cold
Up there all alone
February's been hard on a heart
But we're near the end
And it's almost March
Though the sky's been grey
And in our way I still see your light
And you grow the roses
And you dry the tears
And you freckle noses
Our little world
Revolves around you
Coming up and going down
Dear old sun
Let's call it a day
And I watch you set
I'll let you rest
But I'll wait for you
Like morning’s dew
'Til I see your light

It used to be when I'd see a girl that I liked

Slamming hearts right in the ceilings

For the little pilot lights waiting to ignite
Like fireflies in the rain
Keeper of the flame

Waiting for a wind

I'll never let it die

And they say only time can tell
You already know me well
If it has to end in tears
I hope it's in 60 years
Sometimes love acts out of spite
And good things happen over night
Can't take it slow 'cause you and I are pushin' time
But I'm gonna go there anyway
I hate Sunday mornings
'Cause they always seem to start this way
I'm looking for a lighter
I already bought the cigarettes
Guess I picked me up a habit
On my way out of Lafayette
Eastbound and down
I turn it up 'cause that's sure how I feel
My mind is racing through the pines
My hands are shaky on the steering wheel
I'm going North on 59 but I know good and well
I'm headed South
'Cause me and Birmingham
Don't have a history of working out
What I lost in Louisiana
I found back in Alabama
But nobody ever taught me how to stay
It ain't love that I'm chasing
But I'm running just in case
I ain't unpacked my suitcase
Since the day that I turned twenty one
It's been a long ten years since then
It's getting kinda cumbersome
The first one and the last one
And the one that's got my name in ink
The smoker and the fighter
And the one in every song I sing

I looked for in all the rest
But I guess no one ever taught me how to stay
It ain't love that I'm chasing
But I'm running just in case
I carry them around with me
I don't mind having scars
Happiness ain't prison
Should I look for rainbows or wait for the rain?
Is happiness on the highway? Or is it parked in the driveway?
Am I looking for comfort? Am I looking for an escape?
Am I looking for you? Am I looking the other way?
I'm a wild child and a homing pigeon
Caravan and an empty kitchen
Bare feet on the tile with my head up in the clouds
One heart goin' both directions
One love and a couple of questions
Am I settlin' up or settlin' down?
Am I settlin' up or settlin' down?
I could plant a pretty garden or just send myself flowers
Be a jet-set Friday or a Sunday hometown girl
I could stay a little lonely or let you get to know me

Caravan and an empty kitchen
Bare feet on the tile with my head up in the clouds
I'm one heart goin' both directions

'Til I picked up a quarter from 1979
Stuck it in the back pocket of these jeans
Worn in boyfriend button-down Levis
Threw the quarter in an old street case
Six degrees of separation
You're all over this damn nation
But I'm out of your reach geographically
But you still find a way to get a hold on me
And it's six degrees of separation
Hailed a cab up in NYC
Saw an ad for a litigation lawyer on a bus stop bench
Sitting waiting for the red light to turn green
Smoke-breakers flirting on the steps of Merrill Lynch
Got a funny feeling as I put my key in the door
Never seen the likes of these city lofts

Thought that I was safe down in New Orleans
And a deeper pocket with money to burn
I want a man who knows his status
And he makes a habit of loving me 'til it hurts
He might be heavy on the pedal
But he knows how to take it slow
He might be quite continental
But he's sure gonna take me home
I want a man with a smoking jacket
And a car that's classic living bourgeoisie
I want a man whose heart is tragic
But he makes his magic every night on me
We go together just like nicotine and Chanel
And when he lights up I'm his Lucky Strike
Waiting for him to exhale

Got a real good feeling somethin' bad about to happen
Pulled up to the church but I got so nervous
Had to back it on up  couldn't make it to the service
Grabbed all the cash underneath my mattress
Got a real good feeling somethin' bad about to happen
Ran into a girl in a pretty white dress
Rolled down a window
Where you headed to next?
Said I'm heading to the bar with my money out of the mattress
Got a real good feeling somethin' bad about to happen
Stand on the bar  stomp your feet  start clapping

He came up from Juárez
Lookin' for a hell of a time
With a blonde señorita
And a tall margarita
We danced on the tables all night
Casamigos is taking me home tonight
’Cause he don't love me like tequila does
Nobody can
He don't give me that border town buzz

A cowboy tonight
To get me back in the saddle

Drink domestic beer

I just had to come back one last time
Ma'am  I know you don't know me from Adam
But these hand prints on the front steps are mine
Up those stairs  in that little back bedroom
Is where I did my homework and I learned to play guitar
And I bet you didn't know under that live oak
My favorite dog is buried in the yard
I thought if I could touch this place or feel it
This brokenness inside me might start healing
Out here it’s like I'm someone else
I thought that maybe I could find myself
If I could just come in  I swear I'll leave
Won't take nothing but a memory
From the house that built me
Mama cut out pictures of houses for years
From 'Better Homes and Garden' magazine
Plans were drawn and concrete poured
Nail by nail and board by board
Daddy gave life to Mama's dream

Drawn to the delicate like it's a magnet
Perfume bottles on a mirror tray
Tempered glass on a window pane
Timeless face on a pocket watch
Time is ticking
I leave it all in ruins
'Cause I don't know what I'm doing
I'm hard on things that matter
Hold a heart so tight it shatters
So I stay away from things that break
Can't make a man a promise
With the best of intentions
Drive two hundred miles on a rundown engine
Put a blanket underneath a hollow tree
When the wind blows hard it will fall on me
Stick around long enough and you will see

You'd never want a heart
Hey there  Mr. Tin Man

It didn't get me very far
You ain't missing nothing
'Cause love is so damn hard
Take it from me  darling

Hey there  Mr. Tin Man
I'm glad we talked this out
You can take mine if you want it
It's in pieces now
By the way there  Mr. Tin Man
If you don't mind the scars
You give me your armor
And see her at her worst
Dance with her when she's drinking
Hold her when she hurts
To love her is to learn her
Some things you just can't learn
You'll know how much she's worth
You'll have Thanksgiving dinners
And Sunday morning church
You'll be true and you'll be tried
But the tables always turn
To love her is to learn her
Some things you just can't learn
You don't know everything
If you take her you might hate her
And be left with just a ring
To love her is to lose her
To love her is to learn her
Some things you just can't learn
Never needs a dress to make her pretty
She's a killjoy  such a letdown
Daddy tried to raise a southern belle
Well  he got a tomboy
Tomboy in between
Dirt in her nails and holes in her jeans
She'll destroy all your dreams
And ride out like a rodeo queen
Know what I mean
She's a tomboy
Tangled hair and bruises on her knees
She wears her scars outside her sleeves
Always has a way of saying no way
Some people don't get her but that's okay
Move along  boy
She's a tomboy
Barfly  bad betty
Band of brothers that got her back
She's unladylike  like a scout fire
Got her own constellation in the zodiac
Well  who can say that?

It's been a while since I been off the stuff
I really hate to say I'm turning into a cliché
I'm hoping that nobody brings it up
I left my car behind the bar again last Sunday night
I did the Monday morning drive of shame
But I don't know how I got home
But I do know my head'll hurt all day
But I still go and stay too late
And be the girl bartenders hate
The one that doesn't need another one
When the Romeos and Juliets
Have bummed all of my cigarettes
The last kiss in the parking lot is done
I'll be sitting here alone
When the ugly lights come on
It's easy hiding in the dark
In a crowded room with pockets full of rings
I sit and watch the whiskey pour
The beginning of another matchbook fling
And I don't try to justify
The reason I'm not living right
I wear my sadness like a souvenir
I drink too much to fall apart
That's how I fight this broken heart
So what if I feel comfortable in here?

Sweet salvation on a dining room table

It's gone before it ever melts the ice
