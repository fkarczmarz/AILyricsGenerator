"Forty feet beneath my feet
The coldest calm falls through the molten veins
Salt scales upon my drying arms
Burn my back beneath the sun
But I am cold beneath the burning rays
 bang! Shoot me  Gavrilo
 bang! The first six are for you
 bang! The seventh is for me
 bang! Gavrilo Princip
 bang! Europe's gonna weep
 all for you  all for you (Sophia)
 all for you  all for you (Sophia)
 all for you  all for you (Sophia)
 all for you  all for you
 bang! History's complete
 bang! Shoot me  Gavrilo
 bang! The first six are for you
 bang! The seventh is for me
 bang! Gavrilo Princip
 bang! Shoot me  Gavrilo
 all for you  all for you (Sophia)
 all for you  all for you (Sophia)
 all for you  all for you (Sophia)
 all for you  all for you
 take the Appel Quay
 bang! Gavrilo Princip
 bang! Shoot me  Gavrilo
 bang! The first six are for you
 bang! The seventh is for me
 bang! Gavrilo Princip
Put your ladder down  put your ladder down)
Don’t be concerned
It’s just the way that gravity works 'round here
All slowly rising  falling patiently
Feel no  feel no fear
Cirrus caress you  cumulus kiss you
Raindrops of crystal whisper  We’ll miss you
But go
Let go
Always and always and always ascending
The opening line leaves an uncertain ending
Always and always and always ascending
The chords seem to pause  but ahh–
Never gonna resolve (Never going to resolve)
Never gonna resolve (Never going to resolve)
Never gonna resolve (Never going to resolve)
Never gonna resolve (Never going to resolve)
Ah  talk to me (Talk to me)
C'mon  talk to me (Talk to me)
Yeah  talk to me (Talk to me)
Ahh  oh
Yeah  wake me up
C'mon wake me up

Waking up dry  waking up dusty
Feeling remorse  feeling thirsty
Bring me a cup  bring me water
We can ascend from this arrangement
We can see fate as entertainment
Bring me a cup  bring me water
Bring me water
Always and always and always ascending
The Shepard misleads so you think you’re transcending
Always and always and always ascending
Pause the progression  but ahh–
Never gonna resolve (Never going to resolve)
Never gonna resolve (Never going to resolve)
Never gonna resolve (Never going to resolve)
Never gonna resolve (Never going to resolve)
Ah  talk to me (Talk to me)
C'mon  talk to me (Talk to me)
Yeah  talk to me (Talk to me)
Ahh  oh

C'mon wake me up
Waking up dry  waking up dusty

Bring me a cup  bring me water

Knowing never will I rise again
You see her  and you still hear her
You don't know the pseudonyms I assume

Are you happier now that the gods are dying?
Or do you dream of Heston with omniscient beard?
You should be happier now with no one to pray to
Or would you love to break your knees while begging and praying?

Kick the heels into the Brooklyn dirt
I know it isn't dignified to run
But if you run  you can run to the Coney Island roller coaster
Ride to the highest point and leap across the filthy water
Leap until the Gulf Stream's brought you down
Mm-hmm
I could be there when you land
I could be there when you land
Towards the hidden sun
You know you are so elegant when you run
And let the jet stream set you down
Mm-hmm
I could be there when you land

That black velvet cap
Well  this is that long-due occasion you can wear it at
Don't send this invite back
Kill me quicker if you can  I cannot take it slow
Don't kill me slow
When you showed your executioner's cap to me
You put it on for me  said that I would see
You'd kill whatever sapped your love from me
Kill me quicker if you can  I cannot take it slow
Don't kill me

How can I tell you I was wrong?
When I am the proudest man ever born
I stand on the horizon
I want to step across it with you
But when the sun's this low
Everything's cold on the line of the horizon
How can I tell you I was wrong?

I want to step across it with you

Everything's gold on the line of the horizon
