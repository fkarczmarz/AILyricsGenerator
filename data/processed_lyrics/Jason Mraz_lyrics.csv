lyrics
"Number one: I cry my eyes out and dry up my heart
Not until I do this will my new life start
So that’s the first thing that I do when my life falls apart
Well the second thing I do is I close both of my eyes
And sing my thank yous to each and every moment of my life
I go where I know the love is and let it fill me up inside
Gathering new strength from sorrow
I’m glad to be alive
And things are looking up
I know above the clouds the sun is shining
Things are looking up
Love is still the answer I'm relying on
Three little things
Things are looking up
Well the third thing that I do now when my world caves in
And I let the chapter end
I design my future bright
Not by where my life has been

Things are looking up
I know beyond the dark the sun is rising
Things are looking up
And I know above the clouds the sun is shining
Things are looking up
Three little things
'Cause here it comes it's a light  a beautiful light  over the horizon into our eyes
Oh  my my how beautiful  oh my beautiful mother
She told me  Son in life you're gonna go far  if you do it right you'll love where you are
Just know  wherever you go  you can always come home
Ohh  ohh  ohh
Ohh  ohh  ohh
240 thousand miles from the Moon  we've come a long way to belong here
To share this view of the night  a glorious night  over the horizon is another bright sky
Oh  my my how beautiful  oh my irrefutable father
He told me  Son sometimes it may seem dark  but the absence of the light is a necessary part
Just know  you're never alone  you can always come back home
Ohh  ohh  ohh
Ohh  ohh  ohh
You can always come back  back
Every road is a slippery slope
There is always a hand that you can hold on to
Looking deeper through the telescope
You can see that your home's inside of you

93 million miles from the Sun  people get ready  get ready
You're the kind of girl who can take down a man
And lift him back up again
You are strong but you're needy
Humble but you're greedy
And based on your body language
And shoddy cursive I've been reading
Your style is quite selective
Though your mind is rather reckless
Well I guess it just suggests
That this is just what happiness is
It's like picking up trash in dresses
Well it kind of hurts when the kind of words you write
Kind of turn themselves into knives
And don't mind my nerve you could call it fiction
Although you are biased I love your advice
Your comebacks ‒ they're quick
And probably have to do with your insecurities
There's no shame in being crazy
Depending on how you take these
Words i'm paraphrasing this relationship we're staging

It's like picking up trash in dresses
Well it kind of hurts when the kind of words you say
Kind of turn themselves into blades
And kind and courteous is a life I've heard
But it's nice to say that we played in the dirt
Here we are
Here we are
Here we are
Here we are
Here we are
Here we are
Here we are
We're still here
What a beautiful mess this is
It's like taking a guess when the only answer is Yes
Through timeless words and priceless pictures
We'll fly like birds not of this earth
And tides ‒ they turn ‒ and hearts disfigure
But that's no concern when we're wounded together
And we tore our dresses and stained our shirts
You can make yourself available to anybody
Cause every living' person knows you are a prize
Whichever way you go I'll be easy to find
I don't ask for much  just be honest  with me
I don't ask for much
Think of this song as a promise  you can do what you want
If you decide you wanna move into a new stage
Deleting me from pages in your mission statement
My love is unconditional  make no mistake
I don't ask for much  just be honest  with me
I don't ask for much  just be honest  with me
Who we are  when love is what it wants to be
We are free  and we are  having the best day ever by far
Being treated to the life  like a superstar
I can hold space while you see what your heart has to say about me
There's no dotted line to sign away your freedom
I acknowledge you for what you do to keep strong
I'll always stand beside you  don't get me wrong
I don't ask for much  just be honest  with me

Who we are  when love is what it wants to be
We are free  and we are having the best day ever by far
A hole in the sky
A supernatural nightlight
So full but often right
A chosen child of golden sun
A marble dog that chases cars to farthest reaches of the beach
And far beyond into the swimming sea of stars
A cosmic fish they love to kiss
They're giving birth to constellation
If they should fall you get a wish or dedication
May I suggest you get the best
For nothing less than you and I
Let's take a chance as this romance is rising over before we lose
The lighting
Bella you beautiful luna
Oh bella do what you do
Do do do do do
You are an illuminating anchor
Of leagues to infinite number
Crashing waves and breaking thunder
Tiding the ebb and flows of hunger
You're dancing naked there for me
You expose all memory
You make the most of boundary
You're the ghost of royalty imposing love
You are the queen and king combining everything
Intertwining like a ring around the finger of a girl
All I can bring ya
Is the language of a lover

 kiss me with your eyelashes tonight
 you don't fade
 especially me
 you've got it all

 I need to see you pull your knee socks up
 child
 well you landed on my mind
 you landed on my ear and then you crawled inside
 and I don't wanna lie to you
 'cause I can't recall a better day
 it's you who's got it all
 let me get paid while I make you breakfast
 you make the call
 you've got it all
Some days are riddled with regret
And even when you think it's over
You ain't seen nothin' yet
No we can't hold out on love
No we can't hold out on love
Because it's up to us
To make sure there's enough
We can't hold out on love
Some nights it feels my bones are empty
Some things are too hard to explain
Sometimes I look at you with envy
And then I see we're both the same

I wake and I'm dialin' and my mind's runnin' to you
No wonder I'm a one woman man
She keeps my heart in a jar on her nightstand
I should tell her that she couldn't be more
Opposite than a foot in a door
There's no one else I would rather go out with
It's hell when I see them standing there
We talk about deep freely cause we crushin'
And when the coyotes they sing in the park
That's when the city life starts falling for the sea
Winding roads are winding down and the flying men'll hit the ground
Every notion is closer to touchin'
The coyotes sing when they call on your lovin'
(Hello?)

You know why we're comin' for you

I wish the wind would blow me through
Another opportunity to approach you
Another telepathic rendezvous
I wish you well with your weapon of jargon
You've got a double-sided lexicon
I got to try to keep your attention
Gotta write using less emoticons
Gotta figure out the snooze alarm
I wanna lay in your place till dawn
Let me see your other upper echelon
And when the coyotes escape to New York
Then the city life has crumbled to the sea
And the girls all fall to the lost and found
The flying men'll hit the ground
Every notion is closer to touching
I'm a coyote and I got a taste for your lovin'
Comin' back for more
You know why we're comin' for you
Not today or tomorrow
We're comin' back for more
You know why we're comin' for you

(Can you get a little closer to the mic?)
And I’m waiting for my rocket to come
I’m just a curbside prophet with my hand in my pocket
When I stole my first rhyme from the mic
At a west end avenue at 63
With a guitar picked up in the mix
I committed to the licks like a nickel bag of tricks
Look at me now
I'm just a curbside prophet with my hand in my pocket
And I'm waiting for my rocket to come
I'm just a curbside prophet with my hand in my pocket
And I have no regrets that I bet my whole checking account
Because it all amounts to nothing up in the end
We’ll soon be on the radio dial
And I have been paying close attention to the Willie Nelson style
Like a band of gypsies on the highway while
I’m one man pushing’ on the California skyline drive
Up the coast I brag and I boast
I'm picking up my pace and makin' time like space ghost
Raising a toast to the highway patrol with the most
Put my cruise control's on coast
'Cause I'm touring' around the nation on extended vacation see
I got Elsa the dog who exceeds my limitation
You need a ride?

The backstage betties taking more than they can get
They changed my traffic sign to a brighter yellow
Curbside prophet now
Curbside
 I don’t know…
When things get rough  I like to walk with you
Or when it's night  I like to be the light that's missing
And remind you every minute of the future isn't written
Not yet
When there is love  or when the heart feels heavy
We can lighten it up  if you've had enough
Well you can empty your glass and we can fill it back up
You know it's up to us to make it all up
So what you making up? I can make it up back
You could be loved no matter what
And know the only time is right now  it's right well where you are
You don't need a vacation when there's nothing to escape from
Singing
La la la la
Let's all sing
Hallelujah
Everything is sound
Whether it's your birthday  or your dying day
It's a celebration too
Rejoice to use your voice  and give wings to any your choice
Whatever you're choosing right now  it's right well where you are
You don't need a vacation when there's nothing to escape from
Set your vibration and undulation to the hightest it can go
And trust me  hear me
If it makes you wanna sing
Just sing it

So what? I've got a short attention span
A coke in my hand
Because I'd rather have the afternoon  relax and understand
My hip hop and flip-flops   well it don't stop with the light rock
My shot to mock you kinda puts me in a tight spot
The hype is nothing more than hoo-ha
So I'm developing a language  and I'm callin' it my own
So take a peek into the speaker  and you'll see what I mean
That on the other side the grass is greener

It takes two floors to make a story
It takes an egg to make a hen
It takes a hen to make an egg
There is no end to what I'm saying
It takes a thought to make a word
And it takes some words to make an action
And t takes some work to make it work
It takes some good to make it hurt
It takes some bad for satisfaction
Ah la la la la
It takes a night to make it dawn
And it takes some old to make you young
It takes some cold to know the sun
It takes the one to have the other
And it takes no time to fall in love
But it takes you years to know what love is
And it takes some fears to make you trust
It takes those tears to make it rust

Ah la la la la la la life is wonderful

Life is so... (Life is so)
It takes some silence to make sound
It takes a loss before you found it
And it takes a road to go nowhere
It takes a toll to make you care
It takes a hole to make a mountain
It is so meaningful
It is so wonderful
It is meaningful

It goes full circle
Wonderful
Meaningful
Full circle
Through a looking glass
And see her as a carbon atom
See her eyes and stare back at them
See that girl
As her own new world
Are we all here standing naked
Taking guesses at the actual date and time
Is an absolutely insane resolution to live by
Live high
Live mighty
Live righteously
Taking it easy
Live high

Live righteously
Try to picture the man
To always have an open hand
And see him as a giving tree
See him as matter
Matter fact he's not a beast
No not the devil either
Always a good deed doer
And it's laughter that we're making after all

Why do we lay all these traps?
We put them right in our path
When we just wanna be free
I will not waste my days
Making up all kinds of ways
To worry 'bout all the things
That will not happen to me
So I just let go of what I know I don't know
And I know I'll only do this by
Living in the moment
Living my life

There's a party getting started in the yard
There's a couple getting steamy in the car parked in the drive
Was I too young to see this with my eyes?
The chemicals weren't mixed properly
You hit your head and then forgot your name
And then you woke up at the bottom by the drain
And now your altitude and memory's a shame
What about taking this empty cup and filling it up
With a little bit more of innocence
It's okay to be easily ignored
I like to believe it was all about love for a child
And when the house was left in shambles
Who was there to handle all the broken bits of glass
Was it mom who put my dad out on his ass or the other way around
Well I'm far too old to care about that now

So shine the light on all of your friends
When it all amounts to nothing in the end
I  I won't worry my life away
I won't worry my life away
When I fall in love (I fall in love)  I take my time
There's no need to hurry when I'm making up my mind
You can turn off the sun (Turn off the sun)  but I'm still gonna shine
And then I'll tell you why
Because the remedy is the experience
This is a dangerous liaison
I says the comedy is that it's serious
This is a strange enough new play on words
I say the tragedy is how you're gonna spend
The rest of your nights with the light on
So shine the light on all of your friends
When it all amounts to nothing in the end
I ('Cause I won't)
I won't worry my life away
I won't worry my life away
(I won't worry my life)
I (I won't)
I won't worry my life away  no
Won't worry my life away
I won't worry my life away
 you annoy me sometimes too with your voice
 I got you
 Yeah
 Yeah I'm gonna love you
And we could be homies
Once you get to know me
I could be your one and only
I could make you Unlonely
Or we could take it slowly
And we could keep it low key
I could be your one and only
I could make you Unlonely
I've been chasing summer around
Searching for the sunshine
Looking for a good time
Following the good vibes
Listening to intuition as it's happening
Diggin' into life cuz at times it can be saddening
A little rain suddenly turns heavy
But a whole lotta love can make the clouds go away
Maybe the time for us is now
When the table's set for two
And there's nobody with you
Seeing movies by yourself
Let me be your someone else

It could be love
And we could be homies
Once you get to know me
I could be your one and only
I could make you Unlonely
Or we could take it slowly
And we could keep it low key
I could be your one and only
I could make you Unlonely
I give you my word although I'm making words up
Unlonely ain't a word but I don't give a FRUCK
Cause I'm fresh from the farm where critics can't bother me
Living is tricky as it is so that ain't stopping me
You and me we both agree that no one needs the scrutiny
All we want is peace and love and honestly you ruined me
With your beautiful smile and your style continuity
I'd be a fool not to take the opportunity to say
I think we could be bigger than cheese and macaroni
We could keep it sweet like Chachi and Joanie
Or maybe just be ourselves: Never Phony
Never second guessing the freindship connection
Of your individual personal expression
Together we're just a much better reflection of Love
And we could be homies
Once you get to know me
I could be your one and only
I could make you Unlonely
Or we could take it slowly
And we could keep it low key
I could be your one and only
I could make you Unlonely
When the table's set for two
And there's nobody with you
Seeing movies by yourself
Let me be your someone else
If you're spending time alone
If it's just you and your phone
Taking pictures of yourself
It could be love
And we could be homies
Once you get to know me
I could be your one and only
I could make you Unlonely
Or we could take it slowly
And we could keep it low key
I could be your one and only
I could make you Unlonely
It could be love
I could be your one and only
But it doesn't really matter in this generation
The sophomore slump is an uphill battle
And someone said that ain't my scene
'Cause they need a new song like a new religion
Music for the television
I can't do the long division
Someone do the math
For the record label puts me on the shelf up in the freezer
Gotta find another way to live the life of leisure
So I drop my top
Mix and I mingle
Is everybody ready for the single? And it goes...
Ha la la la la la
Now listen closer to the verse I lay
(Ha la la la la la)
It's all about the wordplay
Ha la la la  love
The wonderful thing it does
Because  because
I am the wizard of ooh's and ah's and fa-la-la's
Yeah  the Mister A to Z
They say I'm all about the wordplay

When it's time to get ill  I got your remedy
For those who don't remember me
Well  let me introduce you to my style
I try to keep a jumble and the lyrics never mumble
When the music's makin' people tongue-tied
You want a new song like a new religion
Music for the television
I can't do the long division
Someone do the math
For the people write me off like I'm a one-hit wonder
Gotta find another way to keep from going under
Pull out the stops
Got your attention
I guess it's time again for me to mention the wordplay
Ha la la la la la
Now listen closer to the verse I lay
(Ha la la la la la)
It's all about the wordplay
Ha la la la  love
The wonderful thing it does
Because  because
I am the wizard of ooh's and ah's and fa-la-la's
Yeah  the Mister A to Z
They say I'm all about the wordplay
I built a bridge across the stream my consciousness
It always seems to be a flowin'
But I don't know which way my brain is going
Oh  the rhyming and the timing keeps the melodies inside me
And they're coming till I'm running out of air
Are you prepared to take a dive into the deep end of my head?
Are you listening to a single word I've said?
Ha la la la la la
Now listen closer to the words I say
(Ha la la la la la)
I'm stickin' to the wordplay
Ha la la la  love
The wonderful thing it does
Because  because
I am the wizard of ooh's and ah's and fa-la-la's

Ha la la la  love
I love the wonderful thing it does
Because  because
Of the ooh's and ah's and the fa-la-la's I'm back in love
Yeah  the Mister A to Z
Things would happen but not to me?
And balancing the whole thing
And the bright light turns to night
Another day to sing about the magic that was you and me
'Cause you and I both loved
What you and I spoke of
And others just read of
(Da da da da)
More words than I had ever heard and I feel so alive
'Cause you and I both loved
What you and I spoke of
And others just read of
And if you could see me now

And with this silence brings a moral story
More importantly evolving is the glory of a boy
'Cause you and I both loved
What you and I spoke of
And others just read of
And if you could see me now
I'm finally out of
Finally de de de de de
And it's okay if you have to go away
But if I never ever hear them ring
Have finally found you someone else and that's okay
'Cause I'll remember everything you sang
'Cause you and I both loved
What you and I spoke of
And others just read of
And if you could see me now
You really did it yeah
You really did it
You really did it
:
All those who are hanging round the water cooler
Will never believe how you tackled the thousand puzzle pieces
And you could see it before we completed it
Before we made it whole
How you put it all together with a blindfold
You're like a long game token that keeps the game going
But your claim to fame is how you like to lay low
Out of the lime light
Which can hurt your eyes
If you're not careful you'll become another devil in disguise
But you watch your back
You watch your back
You're growing eyes in the back of your head
To prevent another sneak attack
Sneak attack
You must be keeping secret weapons in your fanny pack
You're like Lance on a mountain in the Tour de France
You got a wing span spanning the globe
You got gold
And you're teaching us to let go
You're a wise old owl when you're the cats meow
If this were twelfth grade you would be my cap and gown
If this were India then you would be a sacred cow
And I'd bow down to you
So grateful to the Gods for making you

You'll be standing up for equal rights of the American people
And you'll be meeting all the influential seekers with a similar dream
You've got a front seat saved that's emblazoned with your name
And a super hero cape on
You see the future as a sky full of possibility
With a spryness of mind and a psychic ability
You probably won't die at the hands of an enemy
And not in a den of inequity
And any time you get stopped you try another way
Could we settle for a kiss without a cease and desist
If they ask we won't tell because we're activists
I am that I am and you are that you are
And we're all that is
How p-e-r-f-e-c-t your a-t-t-i-t-u-d-e be
When you circumnavigating the turntable call and attracts
Like you be jumping in the water you be making a splash
You be keeping your heart beat going
And you be keeping the harmony going
Well there's an awful lot of musical styles you could play
Well there's an awful lot of tastes
An awful lot of dates you could be on
You be keeping your back bone strong
And you be keeping the trombone blowing
Well every friend of mine will give each other high-fives
When your beautiful mind is to your own devices
You do what you like and you always like what you try
You touch me like an iPhone application
Move me like a smooth jazz music station
Do what you do in the way that you choose to do them
Oh my God
You got a magical handshake for saving the earth
You are a generous man
You are so awesome it hurts
You are a-w-e-s-o-m-e
You are a-w-e-s-o-m-e
You are a-w-e-s-o-m-e
You are a-w-e-s-o-m-e
You are a-w-e-s-o-m-e
You are a-w-e-s-o-"
