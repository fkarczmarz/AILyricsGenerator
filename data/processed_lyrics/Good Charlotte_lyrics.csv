lyrics
"Roger was working around the clock to make a living
On the weekends
He'd load the car up with his kids and they'd go fishing
It was a good good year
The kids were alright
Highway to Hell beat up Staying Alive
The Clash was on the radio
And mom and dad were still in love in 1979
It was a good good year
In the morning
Robin always woke up early in the kitchen
He'd say maybe
She'd slave away all day until dinner was ready
And they would dance so slow to Just the Way You Are

Highway to Hell beat up Staying Alive

And mom and dad were still in love in 1979
It was a good good year
All the decades and the years have passed
Not every family is built to last
No time can take away these memories
The kids were alright
Highway to Hell beat up Staying Alive
The Clash was on the radio
And mom and dad were still in love in 1979
It was a good good year
Disco couldn't survive
With the Dream Police and Rock & Roll High
Blondie put out Heart of Glass
And mom and dad bought their first house in 1979
It was a good good year
 but I wasn’t dreaming
 it’s so confusing
 last night I had a 40 ounce
 last night I had a 40 ounce dream
 last night I had a 40 ounce
 last night I had a 40 ounce dream
 na na na na na na
 na na na na na na
 last night I had a 40 ounce
 last night I had a 40 ounce
 last night I had a 40 ounce
Deep inside my heart
Should I even love you anymore?
I don't wanna find out why
I'm too scared to look behind that door
I put my trust in all my faith
In every word between us spoken
Why do I believe the things you say
When my heart's already broken?
All this pain I feel
That's tearing me apart
Is what makes you real
Deep inside my heart
I can only count the ways
Every time I see your face
I know my hopes no longer showing
I don't need a reason to believe
If my faith's already broken
How could I let love lead the way
When I don't know where I'm going?

Deep inside my heart
Should I even love you anymore?
I don't wanna find out why
Take a look at my clothes  all black
Like Johnny Cash  all black
Like The Rolling Stones want to paint it black
Like the night that we met  all black
Like the colour of your dress  all black
Like the seats in my Cadillac
I used to see red  now it's just all black
As long as I could remember
I dreamed in black and white
As I grew up and the sun went down
I never felt more alright
My mother she used to tell me
Son  you better get to church!
It's a dark  dark world and there's evil out there
And you know it's only getting worse...
Yeah  I've never been much for weddings
Or anniversaries
But I'll go to a funeral if I'm invited
Any day of the week
Some people say that I sound strange
Some say that I'm not right
But I find beauty in this world
Every single night

I used to see red  now it's just all black
I sat down at her table
At the end of the night
She was having black coffee and a cigarette
She wasn't wearing white
She said  people tell me that I'm strange
They say that I'm not right
She said  The only time I feel alive is in the dead of night
I think I found the one for me
Take a look at my life  all black

You know I love it when you do that
Helps me get through this without you
Bother me  tell me awful things
You know I love it when you do that
Helps me get through this without you
Bother me  tell me awful things
You know I love it when you move that on me
Love it when you do that on me
You like attention  I find it obvious
She makes it obvious for me
She feels the tension
It's just the two of us  it's just the two of us tonight
Burn me down 'til I'm nothin' but memories
I get it  girl
Burn me down 'til I'm nothin' but memories
I'm not the one

Carry me away  carry me away
Burn me down 'til there's nothing left
I will scream your name with my last breath
Take off your favorite dress
Lay your head on my chest
Diamonds  rubies and gems
You can have all of them
Bother me  tell me awful things
You know I love it when you do that
Helps me get through this without you
Bother me  tell me awful things
You know I love it when you do that
Helps me get through this without you
Bother me  tell me awful things
You know I love it when you move that on me
They are children who cannot love or accept love
Who could hurt or even kill without remorse
Could a great deal of this be demons?
We both know that there's a season
A time and place to believe in
To give this up right now
And there's no easy way to say that we've both changed
I'm just holding on to my better demons
And I really need them not to fail me now
I'm on my own right now
Do the angels sing if you can't hear them?

I get really scared
Where are you in the nightmare? What happens in the dream?
I'm in my house upstairs
And then what happens next?
When you write  she doesn't answer
You go out  you see him with her
She told you she was sick at home
The ring you gave her
Thrown away with all the letters
And when you see him with her
He doesn't even care at all
And she follows him around like you follow her around
And he doesn't even care and you figure it out
The only way you're going to keep somebody around
Well  I'm about to let you know
There's something I don't want to understand
The only way a woman's going to want a man
The only way you'll ever keep her in your hands
Is breaking apart her heart
Don't tell her she's the reason that you live
Don't give her everything that you've got to give
If you want to keep the girl for as long as you live
Just break it apart  her heart
Can't you see the way she's crying
Well  that's what keeps her trying
She knew that she could have you
And he don't give her what she wants
There's truth about this
You say you want to be noticed
Well  if you want to be noticed
You got to learn to break some hearts

I don't understand this cruelty
I don't understand  it's just not me
I don't understand this cruelty
 how special you are
 you're under the stars
 she's always there waiting for you
 don't forget to take it easy
 yeah
 I will always love you
Everything you are and everything you're not
When happiness dies and the pain  it will come
I wonder when I get that call  is there really any way of knowing?
If I did this right 'cause I'm just not sure if I'm ready for it
And should I even try at all if I don't know where I'm going?
Are you looking out? Are you looking in?
Where does this start? And where does it end?
The night can get so dark in this dream we're living in
Where does this start? Tell me  where does it end?
The universe is wild sometimes
She's like an angry mother
Baby  life can be so hard sometimes
We gotta hold on to each other
Are you looking out? Are you looking in?
Where does this start? And where does it end?
The night can get so dark in this dream we're living in
Where does this start? Tell me  where does it end?

Everything you are and everything you're not
When happiness dies and the pain  it will come
Not to tell you that I still hate you
Just to ask you how you feel
And how we fell apart  how this fell apart
Are you happy out there in this great wide world?
Do you think about your sons? Do you miss your little girl?
When you lay your head down  how do you sleep at night?
Do you even wonder if we're alright?
If we're alright
We're alright
It's been a long hard road without you by my side
Why weren't you there all the nights that we cried?
You broke my mother's heart  you broke your children for life
It's not okay  but we're alright

But those are just a long lost memory of mine

 hey!

This world is cold
But you don't
You don't have to go
And no one seems to care
Your mother's gone and your father hits you
This pain you cannot bear
But we all bleed the same way as you do
And we all have the same things to go through
Your days
You say they're way too long

All that time he was taking her for granted
He doesn't want her out there and alone now
He was always giving her attention
Working hard to find the things she mentioned
She calls him up  she's trippin' on the phone now
He had to get out and he ain't comin' home now
He's trying to forget her  that's how he got with her

Now you know what to do
So I know when people are
Freaking me out these days
It's getting hectic everywhere that I go
I'm paranoid of all the people I meet
Why are they talking to me? And why can't anyone see
I just wanna live?
Don't really care about the things that they say

Let the record play
Let the record play
The way that you stare at me across the room
I got brass knuckles hanging from my neck in my chain
And the record keeps playing the same old song
The hipster mean mugging on me all night long
But the record keeps playing the same old song
Now she sweating my friends and my hurricane shoes
But she can't say What's up? So what does she do?

And the record keeps playing the same old song

Left in a dark room to figure it out
In the mausoleums were written inscriptions
We'd run through the graveyard  seeking salvation
Father  locked out
You gave me your demons  you weren't around
Mother  you were too late somehow
You gave me your voices  and you said to make you proud
Thrown to the vultures  fighting it out
Licking each other's wounds  but we'd never cry out loud
Don't follow the leader  the leader was headless
Maybe it's obvious we were born to be in hell
Father  locked out
You gave me your demons  you weren't around
Mother  you were too late somehow
You gave me your voices  and you said to make you proud
You could never treat these wounds  how long they've been open
You could never mend these bones  how long they've been broken
You're trying to save a soul  you never had hope in
Maybe it's all my fault  but all I know is

One life that we’re living

I just want to see you laugh again
Life can’t get much better
Let’s just stay together
These scars are tokens of promises broken
Life can’t get much better
Let’s just stay forever
We’ve got to hold on we’ve waited so long
If I knew we’d end up this way
Do you really think I wouldn’t have tried
If I knew it would break us down
Do you really think I would’ve lied

Or read in the magazines
Celebrities who want sympathy
All they do is piss and moan
Inside the Rolling Stone
Talking about how hard life can be
I'd like to see them spend a week living life out on the street
I don't think they would survive
If they could spend a day or two walking in someone else's shoes
Lifestyles of the rich and the famous
If money is such a problem
Kill your wife? And there's no such thing as 25 to life
As long as you've got the cash to pay for Cochran
And did you know if you were caught and you were
You could always just run for mayor of D.C.​

The ones where you don't know me
If I could get this right
If I could get away from the old me
But I'll survive
Right now I'm dying just to breathe in
Just to be alive
Just to get away from the old me
So we makeshift love tonight
There’s a triage in my living room
She checks my vital signs
Then opens up my wounds
Like I'm dying tonight
And the whole world is laughing
Like everyone I love is gone away
Whoaaa

See that you are the only real face in the room
No one here has a clue what you're feeling
Don't feel bad  keep your sadness alive
Look at all these happy people  living their lives
Look at all these plastic people  there's nothing inside
Look at all these shallow people  telling their lies
Look at all these empty people  people
Don't you know that misery loves company
Yeah  I heard that misery was looking for me
Happiness is a face that don't look good on me
Yeah  I heard that misery comes looking for me
Whoa  misery's my company
The hands are up now  everybody's singing

Live to see 25  or will I just fall?

And on and on! Faith! Pride! Love! Lust!

I'll wash my bloody hands and we'll start a new life
I ripped out his throat
And called you on the telephone
To take off my disguise
Just in time to hear you cry when you
You mourn the death of your bloody valentine
The night he died
You mourn the death of your bloody valentine
One last time  singing
Oh  my love  please don't cry
I'll wash my bloody hands and we'll start a new life
I don't know much at all  I don't know wrong from right
All I know is that I love you tonight
There was police and flashing lights
The rain came down so hard that night
And the headlines read  A lover died...
No tell-tale heart was left to find when you
