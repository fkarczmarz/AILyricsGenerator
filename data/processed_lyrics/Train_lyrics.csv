lyrics
"My head was oversized
I'll take the high road like I should
You said it's meant to be
You're leaving now for my own good
She went down in an airplane
Fried getting suntanned
Fell in a cement mixer full of quicksand
She met a shark under water
Fell and no one caught her
I returned everything I ever bought her
And ways to say you died
My pride still feels the sting
You were my everything
Some day I'll find a love like yours (a love like yours)
She'll think I'm Superman
Not super minivan
How could you leave on Yom Kippur?

She was caught in a mudslide
Eaten by a lion
Got run over by a crappy purple Scion
She dried up in the desert
Drowned in a hot tub
Danced to death at an east side night club
And ways to say you died
I wanna live a thousand lives with you
I wanna be the one you're dying to love
But you don't want to
She went down in an airplane
Fried getting suntanned
Fell in a cement mixer full of quicksand
She met a shark under water
Fell and no one caught her
I returned everything I ever bought her
She was caught in a mudslide
Eaten by a lion
Got run over by a crappy purple Scion
She dried up in the desert
Drowned in a hot tub
Danced to death at an east side night club
She don't love you no more
They don't love you
Then you love yourself and turn around
If he don't love you no more
She don't love you no more
They don't love you
Then you love yourself and turn around
You're best case scenario
Love don't come in stereo
AM gold
You don't need them no more
You got me keeping score
Get yourself on the floor
Ain't that what friends are for?
Where we're going there ain't no ceiling

Or time to find out anything
I loved her just the same
And though I rode a different road
And sang a different song
I’ll love her 'til my last breath's gone
Like a river made of silver
Everyone came running to the scene
I was shot down in cold blood
By an angel in blue jeans
Late that night she got away
I chased her to the turnpike
Then lost her where the music never plays
And though I rolled upon the stones
And fell into the water
I’ll love her till my judgment day
Like a sunrise made of white lies
Everything was nothing as it seems
I was shot down in cold blood
By an angel in blue jeans

I hear voices calling all around
I keep falling down
I think my heart could pound right out of me
I see a million different ways
To never leave this maze alive
I woke up in somebody’s arms
Strange and so familiar
Where nothing could go wrong
Barely alive or nearly dead
Somehow awake in my own bed
And there you are
Like a highway headed my way
Life is but a dream
I was shot down by your love
Good to see you're still beautiful
Gravity hasn't started to pull
One that's five and one that's three
Been two years since he left me
Good to know that you got free
That town I know was keeping you down on your knees
These bruises make for better conversation
Loses the vibe that separates
It's good to let you in again
You're not alone in how you've been
We all got bruises
Have you seen him? Not in years
She's in Queens with the man of her dreams
Funny back then she said that about you
Remember Johnny B?
Can't believe how time flies by
Leaving you makes me wanna cry

We all got bruises

'Cause I tear so easily
Am I made of vapor?
Because I disappear
Do I have to have a reason
For anything I feel?
Am I real?
Are you made of lead paint?
A bulletproof Picasso
All the virgin saints
Put you here to care for me
I don't need a reason
For anything I feel
Just be glad I say what I mean
I mean what I say to you
We don't need a reason

Into a million pieces?
Or stay awake
With someone who was dying?
You don't need to tell me

Will you remember
Tonight for very long?
You don't need to sell me

Waited for this change
Seems like my entire life
If only the good die young
We'll outlast everyone

2012 is a brand new year
Cleaning house  singing songs
Shedding light and righting wrongs
Ding dong  the witch ain't dead
She's still trying to take my bread
Four more years 'til my girls all grown
Then the bitch gonna have to leave me alone
It's all good  'cause I'm as happy as a flea
On a mountain of dogs  you see
A little music cured all the hurt
And put hate in six feet of dirt
I was looking for some heaven
There's no need to look no more
California 37
Took me right to heaven's door
Knock knock  woah-oh
Rock and roll
California 37
Took me right to heaven's door
Here's to those who didn't think
Train could ever roll again
You were the fuel that I used when
Inspiration hit a dead end
San Francisco got it done  415 took the 911
Thank you all for believing in
We won't let you down again
Truth is  it was attitude
Replaced greed with gratitude
Then replaced a pretty key dude
It's all truth  not being rude
Making love now  not mistakes
Working hard instead of looking for breaks
Came all the way from the eighth great lake
And found 37 reasons to stay

But when I roll up with her  everybody calls me sir
No matter how long I stay  they never ever know my name
But when I walk in with her  everybody calls me sir
Northern California  same old Friday night
Tend to be invisible underneath these city lights
Then I met my baby  felt like I struck gold
Now they treat me like royalty everywhere I go
Oh-oh-oh-oh

I ain't goin' nowhere unless he's there with me

Every time we hit the streets it's like a world premier
She makes me feel like Sia swinging from that chandelier (Wait for 'em)
Went from marginally famous to the top of the A-list
And just for future reference  here's a tip  Mr. Belvedere:
Never judge a book by it's cover (No)
And never judge an ugly duckling by his mother (Uh-uh)
The frog prince got kissed  her lips granted his wish
I prolly wouldn't have a clue without you
But one thing's for sure: when I pull up with her
Call me sir
What would I ever do without you?

All of these lines are being crossed over the atmosphere
I need to know that things are gonna look up
'Cause I feel us drowning in a sea spilled from a cup
When there is no place safe
And no safe place to put my head
When you can feel the world shake

And I'm calling all angels

I won't give up if you don't give up
I won't give up if you don't give up

11:47 when the stars aligned
Someone's gonna fall in love tonight
If you let me take you to my special place
I can make sure everybody knows your name
Don't regret the things you do or things you say
Even if you did it for the fame
'Cause things like this don't happen to us every day
So take this moment and put it in a glass

Wrapped up in a blanket of the brightest stars
Hoping either one of us will go too far

I guess that's déjà vu
But I thought this can't be true

Was more than just right
I didn't leave you 'cause I was all through

With drops of Jupiter in her hair
She acts like summer and walks like rain
Reminds me that there's time to change  hey-hey
Since the return of her stay on the moon
She listens like spring and she talks like June  hey-hey
Hey-hey  yeah
But tell me  did you sail across the sun?
Did you make it to the Milky Way to see the lights all faded
And that Heaven is overrated?
Tell me  did you fall for a shooting star?
One without a permanent scar?
And did you miss me while you were looking for yourself out there?
Now  that she's back from that soul vacation
Tracin' her way through the constellation  hey-hey (Mmm)

Take a roller coaster that comes in sideways
Just get to me - yeah
Go on hitch a ride on the back
Of a butterfly
There's no better way to fly
To get to me
I look around at what I got
Maybe you could pollinate over the
Golden Gate
Take a left hand turn at the corner
Of Haight
And then a sharp right
At the first street light
And get yourself on a motor bike
And if you think you'll get stuck in a
Traffic jam
It doesn't matter how you get to me
Just get to me

Looking back at my life
Remembering the highlights
Thinking how the time flies
I'll be watching sunsets
And I won't have one regret
It's hard to see it at the moment
But in the end I know that
I'll be sippin'
Mai-Tais sippin' in the middle of the afternoon
Looks like we made it and we ain't even through
It ain't even two and nothing compares to you
Making memories and some we might recall
Swaying on a hammock and if we fall
We fall
I'll be sippin' Mai-Tais

I'll be sippin' red wine

To feel like I've had long enough with you
But there's one thing left to do
Now that the weight has lifted
Love has surely shifted my way
Marry me
Today and every day

Together can never be close enough for me
To feel like I am close enough to you
You wear white and I'll wear out the words I love you
And you're beautiful

Love has finally shown her my way

To an island so remote
Only Johnny Depp has ever been to it before
Stayed there 'til the air was clear

I offered you my coat
Thank Goddess love can float

Love on the Puget Sound
My treasure map was on your skin

Bet you're made of gold
I think I wanna tell you everything
I think I wanna give you all tonight

On the east coast people of Rico
On the west coast Mary Jane is legal
I had to tell myself the tide was on a turn
I had to sell myself to people who burn me

Maybe I am crazy
Maybe I should fall
Maybe I am perfect for you
Baby I'm sold

Try to understand

But I won't give up on you
I will run with your changes
And I'm always on your side
And there's not a word that I've ever heard
That will make me change my mind
Don't let them break you
Or stop your world from turning
When words keep you from feeling good
Use them as firewood and let 'em burn
Like stones in your pocket
People try to wear you down
Someone always wants to take the love you've found
So let's run with these changes
And I want you by my side
And there's not a word that I've ever heard
That could make me change my mind
Don't let them break you
Or stop your world from turning
When words keep you from feeling good
Use them as firewood and let 'em burn

Underneath every word
Somebody's heart's been broken
With or without words
We try to forgive
Don't let them break us
Or stop our world from turning
When words keep you from feeling good
Use them as firewood and let 'em burn
Don't let them break you
When words keep you from feeling good
Use them as firewood and let 'em burn
Let them burn

And I could walk you down your road
There's just one thing you gotta know
Like my father said to me
And you'll be just fine
They say that nothing lasts forever
They say that good times fade away
But I know you'll be okay
One day I'll see you in the future
You have a family of your own
Like my father said to me
And you'll be just fine
