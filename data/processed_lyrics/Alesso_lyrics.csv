" it's plain to see
 her destiny
 do me wrong
 you should know that I'll be okay
 I don't wanna die young
 I don't need to run
 been a long night in the city
 even in the face of danger
 I got all I need to own
 do me wrong
 you should know that I'll be okay
 I don't wanna die young
 I don't need to run
I'll tell you  I'll tell you  I'll tell you
I'll tell you  I'll tell you  I'll tell you
I'll tell you  I'll tell you  I'll tell you
I'll tell you  I'll tell you  I'll tell you
I'll tell you everything you wanna know  wanna know
I'll tell you everything you wanna know  wanna know
I'll tell you everything you wanna know  wanna know
California dreams
Looked up through the bright lights
No stars that I see
It's all yours when you smile
It's only you (You)
Loves me like you do (Do)
Trying to keep it cool (Cool)
But I can't keep cool about it
Acted like a fool (Fool)
Wanna scream it from the roof (Roof)
I'm trying to keep it cool (Cool)
But I can't keep cool about it ('Bout it)
Can't keep cool about it ('Bout it)
Can't keep cool about it ('Bout it)
Drifting at sea
You were the beacon I followed home
You were the one that rescued me

Got a secret side in plain sight
Where the streets are empty  that's where we run
Everyday people do everyday things but I
Can't be one of them

I'm so high and there's no controlling
In the light of the moon you're all I see
Smoky air in your skin is glossy
Cloudy minds acting like we've lost it
I'm possessed like a drug you're all I need
Cause you are burning  burning this heart of mine
You're burning  right through my veins tonight
You're in my blood
You're in my blood
You're in my blood
Shaky hands and the blood is rushing
Skin to skin and our lips are touching
As we move like a dance  just flawlessly
And your breath makes it sound like music
Round and round as the walls are moving
You become what I am  you're what I bleed
Cause you are burning  burning this heart of mine
You're burning  right through my veins tonight

I see you when you're all alone
It's like a person I've not known
The moment ends though I feel winds
Blowing differently than ever before
And they're pushing me further from shore
A frothy cap the steady slap
Of lines against the rail
A biting rain take in the main
Up the rigging take in sail mind the skipper we'll not fail
He'll bring out wine all will be fine just hear the order watch the sail
Sometimes I need to breathe in
Won't you come and save me now  save me now?
Ooh  got me numb on this feeling
Sometimes I need to breathe in
Won't you come and save me now  save me now?
Ooh  got me numb on this feeling
Sometimes I need to breathe in

I'm stuck between the Hell I'm in and where we lay
You say that this could kill you  your words cut like a knife
We are the beautiful mistake that I can't find
I think that we are chemicals  I think the dark is light
And I know each and every wrong you right
You say that this could kill you  your words cut like a knife
And we are the beautiful mistake that I can't find
My intuition says I should run away
But now I'm running to you  a sweet escape

You don't have to say what you need
I'm ready for anything  anything
Said your bed is getting colder
Begged me to come over
You just want somebody to use
And my heart's still getting sober
Destined for some closure

 our apologies made
Years
The sun hits like a bullet of faith
And then suddenly I’m wide awake
Fake bliss or apologies made
Was an enemy with no escape
My hands were tied
But now they're mine
To grab on to desire and run away
These will be the years 
Lights will all appear
These will be the years
And then suddenly I'm wide awake
Was an enemy with no escape
My hands were tied

Years

Years
Grey dust now sparkling gold and the best is yet to unfold
White heat found in comfort and cold and a heart was found in her soul
Her hands were tied
But now they're mine
So grab on and wherever you go I'll go
