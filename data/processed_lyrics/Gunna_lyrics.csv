Besides the tint  the curtain in the way

Copped the new Lam' and put it on land

When you ever fall down and your back hit the ground  better pray to the Gods you don't need 'em
If you don't fuck with me  don't do what I do
Think he the one  but he really the two
Better get low when I hit at your crew

Get rich my only decision
