"Painting shadows on the wall
Like teenage sleaze and comic book cheese
With your heart on your sleeve
Do not stand in the shadow
Do not stand in the shadow
Do not stand in the shadow
Watching people on my wall
In the dark without a light
Forget ill luck if you believe

Do not stand in the shadow
Do not stand in the shadow
Do not stand in the shadow
Do not stand in the shadow
To the sound of false alarm
You're alive and you're living with me
Do not stand in the shadow
Do not stand in the shadow
Do not stand in the shadow
Do not stand in the shadow
Do not stand in the shadow
All you have to do is move your body
In whatever way feels comfortable for you
Just let yourself sink into the groove
And move
Fix your eyes on a spot
It doesn't matter where
Just fix your eyes on one spot
Begin to relax
Feel your mind and body
Beginning to wind down
If you have any thoughts
Just let them drift through your mind
Like beautiful clouds
Across a clear blue sky
Just through your mind and away from you
Through your mind and away
As you relax
Just let go of stress and tension
Let go of worry and doubt
And relax
Imagine a staircase standing in front of you
Down to peace and contentment
Down towards the happiness that you deserve

Take one step with each number
One step down
That's it... just let go and relax
You see the shape of things to come
Why give up our lives
To the brutes and fools?
You see the shape of things to come
Will we kill each other?
Like Adam in chains
I want revenge
Like Adam in chains
I want revenge
Adam in chains
They've broken your heart
Why make up a lie
And believe it's true?
I know the shape of things to come
Adam in chains
I want revenge
Like Adam in chains
I want revenge
Like Adam in chains
I want revenge
Want revenge
In the mind of a madman
There are colour explosions
An eclipse of emotion
Why tear our world apart?
Why tear it all apart?
On my tongue
The many holes
The damage done
It's bittersweet
Black on gold
And talk is cheap
Or so I'm told
I'm gonna ride this bike to the edge of town
Roll to the bridge with my eyes shut and spit at the stars
And scream in the dark
There's nothing I can do to change it now
You can read all my scars
Read all my scars
There's a million ways to die
Should've left me way back
Should've left me way back by the roadsidе
I was staring in the dеvil's eyes (Staring in the devil's eyes)
Should've left me way back
Should've left me way back by the roadside
It's a bitter taste

Jagged stain
On my skin
Broken leg
Born again
Wide glide
Upside down
Twisted frame
My new crown
I'm gonna ride this bike till the break of day
Rollin' through the garden like the fountain won't take it away
I'm not gonna change
Will lift me to the sun so I can burn up in the flames
Again and again
There's a million ways to die
Should've left me way back
Should've left me way back by the roadside
I was staring in the devil's eyes (Staring in the devil's eyes)
Should've left me way back

Brain fry Day-Glo

Walking through desolation alley
Boarded up our ambitions
Flooded out all the engines
I've been fighting with my demons so long they've become my friends
The zombies at the window say it's finally the end
So I'm kicking down my door and never closing it again
Get me out of my cage
Drive you straight out the city
You can live in a ghost town with me
We can dig in the gold mine
Look for treasure we won't find
I can tell you all my feelings when I'm staring into space
And the road is an illusion I just keep to pass the days
I'm counting down the seconds 'til I'm making my escape

Mega-corporations are the new governments
Computer-generated info domains are the new frontiers
Though there is better living through science and chemistry
We are all becoming slavebots
The computer is the new cool tool
Information is power and currency of the virtual world we inhabit
So we must trust authority
Cyberpunks are the true rebels
Cyber-culture is coming in under the radar
An ordinary society  an unholy alliance with the tech world and the world of organized dissent

Age of oblivion
Age of destruction
Age of oblivion
Discovered love in the rancid days of ruin
My body's sweatin' toxins of my own demise
Only from space can you see how much earth is burning
Smokin' out the innocence inside the child
It's the age of destruction
In a world of corruption
It's the age of destruction
And they hand us oblivion
Man who wallows in his insatiable greed
More is the answer that sweats from desperate palms
Or be smothered by the red hot core

Ridin' on the dashboard
Of my car
Through my trials
And tribulations
And my travels
Through the nation
With my plastic Jesus
I'll go far
Ridin' down the thoroughfare
With a nose up in the air
A wreck may be ahead
But he don't mind
Trouble comin'
He don't see
He just keeps his eye on me
And any other thing that lies behind

With my plastic Jesus
Goodbye and I'll go far

It's a nice day to start again

You stare at me  am I'm holding on?
My eyes are dim  my breath is weak
And tears stain my cheek
Up there so high
Where the air is so thin
You look for signs  am I giving in?
All for me you bring crashing down
And still you condemn me
Oh no  no shame
All my life
I'll not betray
I'll not shed one tear
All my life
Forever more  forever more

His heart is breaking
Recorded in sound  (O-o-ow!)
We need a miracle joy

A rock 'n' roll toy
A rock 'n' roll joy
A rock 'n' roll boy
