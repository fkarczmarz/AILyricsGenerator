"Pour myself a cup of ambition
Yawn and stretch and try to come to life
Jump in the shower and the blood starts pumping
Out on the streets  the traffic starts jumping
With folks like me on the job from nine to five
Working nine to five  what a way to make a living
Barely getting by  it's all taking and no giving
They just use your mind and they never give you credit
It's enough to drive you crazy if you let it
Working five to nine  you've got passion and a vision
'Cause it's hustlin' time  a whole new way to makе a livin'
Gonna change your life  do something that givеs it meaning
With a website that is worthy of your dreaming
Well  you've got dreams and you know they matter
Be your own boss  climb your own ladder
That moment's getting closer by the day
And you're in the same boat with a lotta your friends
Launching ideas you all believe in
The tide's gonna turn and it's all gonna roll your way

Working five to nine  makin' something of your own now
And it feels so fine to build a business from your know-how
Gonna move ahead  and there's nothin' that you can't do
When you listen to that little voice inside you  yeah
Five to nine  you've got passion and a vision
'Cause it's hustlin' time  a whole new way to make a livin'
Gonna change your life  do something that gives it meaning
With a website that is worthy of your dreaming
Five to nine
You keep workin' workin' workin'
Workin' five to nine
'Til your dreams come true
Workin' five to nine
You keep dreamin' dreamin' dreamin'
Five to nine  five to nine
Pour myself a cup of ambition
And yawn and stretch and try to come to life
Jump in the shower and the blood starts pumpin'
With folks like me on the job from nine to five
They just use your mind and they never give you credit
It's enough to drive you crazy if you let it
You would think that I would deserve a fair promotion
Want to move ahead but the boss won't seem to let me
I swear sometimes that man is out to get me
Mmmm
They let you dream just to watch 'em shatter
You're just a step on the bossman's ladder
But you've got dreams he'll never take away
In the same boat with a lot of your friends
Waitin' for the day your ship'll come in
And the tide's gonna turn an' it's all gonna roll your way

They just use your mind and you never get the credit
It's enough to drive you crazy if you let it
There's a better life and you think about it don't you
It's a rich man's game no matter what they call it
And you spend your life puttin' money in his wallet
They just use your mind and they never give you credit
It's enough to drive you crazy if you let it
There's a better life and you think about it don't you
It's a rich man's game no matter what they call it
Ain't nothing much to see
It's just a piddly squatting old time country place
Ain't nothing to hide at all
Just lots of good will and maybe one small thrill
But there's nothing dirty going on
Nothing dirty going on
You know they don't understand a thing about a proper business day
Now what's the point in opening up the store if you give the goods away

And don't hang around the town cafe and say hi on the street
Because every girl that lives here knows my special no-no rules
Yeah every girl that lives here knows Miss Mona's no-no rules
Beds are not to be wallowed in
That's the kind of thing that big fat lazy hogs do
And it don't make money!
Beatrice!
I won't tolerate no tying up my telephone with other people's business
Eloise honey!
And please don't show us no tattoos
No hearts and flowers on your thigh
It's downright tacky
Do you catch my drift?
I pay the food and the rent and the utilities
You keep your mind on your work responsibilities
Don't let your mouth overload your capabilities
And we can get along
Dawn!
Tatty Joe!
I can't stand no chewing gum it looks just like a cow
Lindy Lue!
Any one taking sick leave oughta be real sure they're sick
And every time you hear that bell
You better get here double quick
And as for pimps
Pimps are something you don't need
To get your daily business done
Are you listening good?
Keep them leeches and blood suckers off the back roads
I know how to use a gun
And nobody messes with my girls
And any questions you might have about the way I run this place
Don't gripe and whine behind my back
She pays the food and the rent and the utilities
We keep our mind on our work responsibilities
Don't let your mouth overload your capabilities
And we can get along
Just lots of good will and maybe one small thrill
Just lots of good will and maybe one small thrill
Just lots of good will and maybe one small thrill
But there's nothing dirty going on
I wanted to be pretty more than anything in the world
Like Barbie or the models in the Fredricks catalog
From rags to wishes in my dreams I could have it all
Don't be fooled by thinking that the goods are not all there
Don't let these false eyelashes lead you to believe that
I'm as shallow as I look cause I run true and deep
I've always been misunderstood because of how I look
Don't judge me by the cover cause I'm a real good book
So read into it what you will  but see me as I am
The way I look is just a country girl's idea of glam
I'm just a Backwoods Barbie in a push-up bra and heels
I might look artificial  but where it counts I'm real
And I'm all dolled up and hoping for a chance to prove my worth
And even Backwoods Barbie's get their feelings hurt
You might also like
Don't be fooled by thinking that the goods are not all there
Yes  I can see where I could be misjudged upon first glance
But even Backwoods Barbie's deserve a second chance
I'm just a Backwoods Barbie just asking for a chance
Then I wish you both the best
It's your happiness that matters most of all
But if she ever breaks your heart
If the teardrops ever start
I'll be there before the next teardrop falls
Though it hurts to let you go
Darling I want you to know
I'll run to you if ever you should call
And if I should ever hear
That she's made you shed a tear
I'll be there before the next teardrop falls
I'll be there anytime you need me by your side
To dry away each teardrop you've cried
If she ever leaves you blue
Just remember I love you
And I'll be there
Before the next teardrop falls
Alli Estare Candor me necesites a tu lado
Para borrar cadda lagrima que haya llorado
If he ever leaves you blue
Just remember I love you
And I'll be there
Before the next teardrop falls

 so I must leave you all alone
 I love you

 I love you
Back to the seasons of my youth
I recall a box of rags that someone gave us
And how my mama put the rags to use
And I didn't have a coat and it was way down in the fall
Mama sewed the rags together sewing every piece with love
She made my coat of many colors that I was so proud of
About a coat of many colors Joseph wore and then she said
Perhaps this coat will bring you good luck and happiness
And I just couldn't wait to wear it and momma blessed it with a kiss
My coat of many colors that my mama made for me
Made only from rags but I wore it so proudly
Although we had no money I was rich as I could be
In my coat of many colors my mama made for me
So with patches on my britches and holes in both my shoes
In my coat of many colors I hurried off to school
Just to find the others laughing and making fun of me
In my coat of many colors my mama made for me

But they didn't understand it for I felt I was rich
And I told them of the love my mama sewed in every stitch
And I told them all the story mama told me while she sewed
And how my coat of many colors was worth more than all their clothes
But they didn't understand it and I tried to make them see
That one is only poor only if they choose to be
Now I know we had no money but I was rich as I could be
In my coat of many colors my mama made for me
He had a spot around one eye that looked just like a patch
His legs were way too long and he was awkward as could be
He wasn't much to look at but he looked alright to me
I found him by the river bank just wandering about
He was cold and hungry and his ribs were sticking out
I was just a kid and Cracker Jack was just a pup
I took him home and fed him 'til he couldn't eat no more
I took him to my room and put a blanket on the floor
After that beside my bed is where he'd always sleep
Each night in my prayers I'd pray the lord his soul to keep
Cracker Jack
The best friend that I ever had was Cracker Jack
But he was more than that
A playmate  a companion
He was love and understanding
That was Cracker Jack
The best friend that I ever had was Cracker Jack
But he was more than that
Everything a kid could want I had in Cracker Jack
Cracker Jack would run to meet me after school each day
He'd jump and wag his tail and look at me as if to say
I love you and I've missed you and I'm glad you're home again
I knew just how he felt 'cause me and Cracker Jack was friends
Through the woods and fields we would often roam about
And when we got in trouble we would help each other out
I could run almost as fast as Cracker Jack could run
We had a lot in common and we had a lot of fun
He was always with me when I was growing up
We shared each other's good times and we shared each other's love
He only lives in memories now but often I think back
To the days of childhood  the days of Cracker Jack

But he was more then that
Long ago in the sweet used to be
And the flowers still grow  but they don't smell as sweet
As they did when you picked them for me
And when I think of you and the love we once knew
How I wish we could go back in time
Do you ever think back on old memories like that
Or do I ever cross your mind?
Do you ever wake up lonely in the middle of the night because you miss me
Do you  darling?
Oh  and do your memories ever take
You back into another place in time?
Oh  and do you ever miss the feelings and the love we shared when you were with me
Do you  darling?
I just wonder  do I cross your mind?
Oh  how often I wish that again I could kiss your sweet lips like I did long ago
And how often I long for those two lovin' arms that once held me so gentle and close
And when I think of you and the love we once knew  how I wish we could go back in time
Do you ever recall these old memories at all  or do I ever cross your mind?

He was standing on a mountain top
And in my dream I heard him say
Don't make me have to come down there
Don't make me have to come down there
I've told you time and time again
You can't disobey and hope to win
Don't make me have to come down there
You've always been my cross to bear
I've let you try my patience as all good fathers do

Go to your room and pray 'til you can learn to play fair
Don't make me have to come down there (Come down there)
I should take my Bible belt and whip you into shape
Don't make me have to come down there (Don't make me)
Clean up this mess and put on something decent to wear
Don't make me have to come down there (Don't make me have to come down there)
Don't make me have to come down there
Why can't you learn to listen and learn to love and share?
Don't make me have to come down there

When he left he promised me that he'd be back
By the time it was revealing
The sun behind a cloud just casts the crawling shadow
Over the fields of clover
And time is running out for me I wish
That he would hurry down from Dover
He's been gone so long
When he left the snow was deep upon the ground
And I have seen a spring and summer pass
And now the leaves are turning brown
And any time a tiny face will show itself
Because waiting's almost over
But I won't have a name to give
It if he doesn't hurry down from Dover
My folks weren't understanding when they found out
They sent me from the home place
My daddy said if folks found out
He'd be ashamed to ever show his face
My mamma said I was a fool
And she did not believe it when I told her
That everything would be all right
Because soon he would be coming down from Dover
You might also likeI found a place to stay out
On a farm takin' care of that old lady
She never asked me nuthin'
So I never talked to her about my baby
I sent a message to my mom
With a name and address of Ms. ol' Grover
And to make sure he got that information
When he came down from Dover
I loved him more than anything
And I could not refuse him when he needed me
He was the only one I'd loved
And I just can't believe that he was using me
He couldn't leave me here like this
He wouldn't make me go through this alone
Oh he'll be coming down from Dover
My body aches the time is here
It's lonely in this place where I'm lying
Our baby has been born but something's wrong
It's much too still I hear no crying
I guess in some strange way she knew
She'd never have a father's arms to hold her
And dying was her way of telling me
Don't try to lie or I'll catch you in it
Don't try to make me feel sorry for you
Just because I'm blonde
Don't think I'm dumb
'Cause this dumb blonde ain't nobody's fool
When you left you thought I'd sit
And you thought I'd wait
And you thought I'd cry
You called me a dumb blonde (Dumb blonde)
And you know if there's one thing this blonde has learned
Blondes have more fun
You flew too high up off the ground
It's stormy weather and had to come back down
But I've found new thread for my old spool
Just because I'm blonde
Don't think I'm dumb
'Cause this dumb blonde ain't nobody's fool

And you thought I'd wait
And you thought I'd cry
You called me a dumb blonde

She has seen and done it all
She's a woman
She knows how to dish it out or take it all
Her heart's as soft as feathers
Still she weathers stormy skies
And she's a sparrow when she's broken
But she's an eagle when she flies
A kaleidoscope of colors
You can toss her round and round
You can keep her in your vision
But you'll never keep her down
She's a lover  she's a mother
She's a friend and she's a wife
And she's a sparrow when she's broken
But she's an eagle when she flies
Gentle as the sweet magnolia
Strong as steel  her faith and pride
She's an everlasting shoulder
She's the leaning post of life
She hurts deep and when she weeps
She's just as fragile as a child
And she's a sparrow when she's broken
But she's an eagle when she flies

For they know not what they do
When it's family  you accept them
'Cause you have no choice but to
When it's family  they're a mirror
Of the worst and best in you
And they always put you to the test
And you always try to do your best
And just pray for God to do the rest
When it's family
Some are preachers  some are gay
But not a one is turned away when it's family
Some are lucky  others ain't
Some are fighters  others faint
It's all family
And when it's family  you trust them
And your heart's an open door
When it's family
You tolerate what you'd kill others for
When it's family  you love and hate and take
Then give some more
Somehow you justify mistakes
Try to find some better way
To solve the problems day to day
In the family

You take the trouble as it comes
And love 'em more than anyone
Good or bad or indifferent  it's still family

You pick your friends
But not the family that you're in  no

'Cause it's family
When it's family  you forgive them
For they know not what they do
When it's family
They're a mirror of the worst and best in you
When it's family
When it's family
How much and how far would I go to prove
The depth and the breadth of my love for you?
From here to the moon and back
Who else in this world will love you like that?
From here to the moon and back
From here to the moon and back
I want you to know you can always depend
On promises made and love without end
No need to wonder how faithful I'll be
Now and on into eternity
From here to the moon and back
Who else in this world will love you like that?
From here to the moon and back
From here to the moon and back
I would blow you a kiss from the star where I sat
I would call out your name to echo through the vast
From here to the moon and back
And I'll spend forever just proving that fact
Velvet-cushioned seats and soft armrests
Best seat in my favorite movie house
Start my dreaming as the lights go out
Up on the silver screen  I picture me
Living out my passions  hopes  and fantasies
I want to be the girl in the movies
The one with the glint in her eyes
The girl that seldom loses
Beautiful  with grace and style
Acting out her story
Standing in her glory
Happy ever after
I want to be the girl in the movies
Wish I had a nickel for each dime I've spent
Watching others live their lives with confidence
Here's a preview of some things to come
It's not too late for me to be someone
I can't keep living in their make-believe
Coming attractions will be starring me

Can you hear me  are you listening anymore?
Hello God  if we're still on speaking terms
Can you help me like before?
I have questioned your existence
My resistance leaves me cold
Can you help me go the distance?
This old world has gone to pieces
Can we fix it  is there time?
Hate and violence just increases
We're so selfish  cruel and blind

I had to have this talk with you
My happiness depends on you
And whatever you decide to do  Jolene
Jolene  Jolene  Jolene  Jolene
I'm begging of you  please don't take my man
Jolene  Jolene  Jolene  Jolene
Please don't take him even though you can
Well  a good ways down the railroad track
There was this little old rundown shack
And in it lived a man I'd never seen
Folks said he was a mean and a vicious man
And you better not set foot on his land
But I didn't think nobody could be that mean
So I took me out walkin' down the railroad track
I was a-gonna go down to that little old shack
And just find out if all them things I'd heard was true
There was a big black dog layin' out in the yard
And it growled at me and I swallowed hard
Oh  and there he stood in the door of that shack
And his beard and his hair was long and black
And he was the biggest man I'd ever seen
When he spoke  his voice was low and deep
But he just didn't frighten me
'Cause somehow I just knew he wasn't mean
He said  What you doin' snoopin' around my place?
And I saw a smile come across his face
So I smiled back and I told him who I was
He said  Come on in and pull you up a chair
You might as well since you're already here
And he said  You can call me Joshua

Joshua  Joshua
What you doin' livin' here all alone?
Joshua  Joshua
Ain't you got nobody to call your own?
We talked 'til the sun was clean out of sight
And we still talkin' when it come daylight
There was just so much we had to say  hey
I'd spent my life in an orphan's home
And just like him  I was all alone
So I said yeah when he asked if I'd stay
Oh  we grew closer as time went on
And that little old shack  it was a happy home
And we just couldn't help but fall in love
That big black dog and that little old shack
Sittin' down by the railroad track
It's plenty good enough for me and Joshua
Joshua  Joshua
Why  you're just what I've been lookin' for
Joshua  Joshua
You ain't gonna be lonesome anymore
No  no
Me and Joshua
Me and Joshua
By the way you look at me
And I'm sorry that I'm not
The woman you thought I'd be
But listen and understand
My mistakes are no worse than yours
Just because I'm a woman
So when you look at me
Don't feel sorry for yourself
Just think of all the shame
You might have brought somebody else
Just let me tell you this
Then we'll both know where we stand
My mistakes are no worse than yours
Just because I'm a woman
Now a man will take a good girl
And he'll ruin her reputation
But when he wants to marry
You might also like
He'll just walk off and leave her
To do the best she can
While he looks for an angel
To wear his wedding band
Now I know that I'm no angel
If that's what you thought you'd found
I was just the victim of
A man that lets me down
It's been a long hard fight
But I see a brand new day dawning
I've been looking for the sunshine
You know I ain't seen it in so long
But everything's gonna work out just fine
And everything's gonna be all right
That's been all wrong
'Cause I can see the light of a clear blue morning
I can see the light of a brand new day
I can see the light of a clear blue morning
Oh and everything's gonna be all right
It's gonna be okay
It's been a long long time
Since I've known the taste of freedom
And those clinging vines
I've been like a captured eagle
You know an eagle is born to fly
Now that I have won my freedom
'Cause I can see the light of a clear blue morning
I can see the light of a brand new day
I can see the light of a clear blue morning
Oh and everything's gonna be all right
It's gonna be okay

Precious fragile little thing
Little sparrow  little sparrow
Flies so high and feels no pain
All ye maidens  heed my warning
Never trust the hearts of men
They will crush you like a sparrow
Leaving you to never mend
They will vow to always love you
Swear no love but yours will do
Then they'll leave you for another
Break your little heart in two
Little sparrow  little sparrow
Precious fragile little thing
Little sparrow  little sparrow
Flies so high and feels no pain
If I were a little sparrow
Over these mountains I would fly
I would find him  I would find him
Look into his lying eyes
I would flutter all around him
On my little sparrow wings
I would ask him  I would ask him
Why he let me love in vain
I am not a little sparrow
I am just the broken dream
Of a cold false-hearted lover
And his evil cunning scheme

I looked into the mirror at a strange face
And then I felt the lonely coming down
I walked across the room to the empty bed
Saw the imprint on the pillow where you laid your head
The presence of you still lingered all around
And once again I felt the lonely coming down
Then I felt the lonely dripping down my face
As I realized no one could take your place
I wondered where the love had gone that we had found
And then again I felt the lonely coming down
I wondered where the love had gone that we had found
The multicolored moods of love are like its satin wings
Love makes your heart feel strange inside  it flutters like soft wings in flight
Love is like a butterfly  a rare and gentle thing
I feel it when you're with me  it happens when you kiss me
That rare and gentle feeling that I feel inside
Your touch is soft and gentle  your kiss is warm and tender
Whenever I am with you I think of butterflies
Love is like a butterfly  as soft and gentle as a sigh
The multicolored moods of love are like its satin wings
Love makes your heart feel strange inside  it flutters like soft wings in flight
Love is like a butterfly  a rare and gentle thing
Your laughter brings me sunshine  every day is springtime
And I am only happy when you are by my side
Together we belong like daffodils and butterflies

The multicolored moods of love are like its satin wings
Love makes your heart feel strange inside  it flutters like soft wings in flight
Love is like a butterfly  a rare and gentle thing

Then I thought I heard somebody at my door a-knockin'
I wondered who could be outside in such an awful storm
And then I saw a little girl with a puppy in her arms
Standing in the bitter cold in just a ragged dress
Then I asked her to come in and this is what she said
Ain't ya got no gingerbread? Ain't ya got no candy?
Ain't you got an extra bed for me and little Andy?
And we was all alone and didn't know what else to do
I wonder if you'll let us stay with you?
Can we stay all night?
I promise we won't cry
London Bridge is falling down
My daddy's drunk again in town
And we was all alone and didn't know what we could do
We wondered if you'd let us stay with you?

 leaned against the wall
 an eagle spreads its wings
 you might steal a kiss or two
 holding hands
Someone who I use to take comfort from long before I met you
I caught a spark from his eyes of forgotten desire
Old flames can't hold a candle to you
No one can light up the night like you do
Old flames can't hold a candle to you
Sometimes at night I think of old lovers I've known
I remember how holding them helped me not feel so alone
Then I feel you beside me and even their memories are gone
Like stars in the night lost in the sweet light of dawn
Old flames can't hold a candle to you
No one can light up the night like you do
I was absolutely wild
'Bout some red shoes that my aunt Lucy wore
She would let me stomp around
In those high heels up and down
'Round the house and 'round the wraparound porch
And from that moment on
I've had a pair of my own
They make me feel at home and brand new
They build my confidence
As if they've been heaven sent
From the wishbook order me
Through the years I've thought about
Aunt Lucy's love and think of how
Such little things in life can make or break a kid
I believe that every child
Needs to feel a sense of pride
And someone to love and guide and see them through
So many miles I've traveled
Many times they've come unraveled
On the road both smooth or gravel

If I ever get to heaven
And Lord I hope I do
I will walk the streets of glory
I will walk the streets of glory
I will tell my Lucy story
And I'll fulfill all your fantasies

There's gotta be a little rain some time
When you take you gotta give so live and let live
Or let go oh-whoa-whoa-whoa
I beg your pardon
I never promised you a rose garden
I could promise you things like big diamond rings
But you don't find roses growin' on stalks of clover
So you better think it over
Well if sweet-talkin' you could make it come true
I would give you the world right now on a silver platter
But what would it matter
So smile for a while and let's be jolly
Love shouldn't be so melancholy

His clothes were torn and tattered with sandals on his feet
And I stopped to help him and lend him a hand
Silver and gold might buy you a home
But things of this world  they won't last you long
And time has a way of turning us old
And time can't be bought back with silver and gold
And he said to me  let's rest for awhile
For I have some good news to share with you  child
He said  you can't change this old world
The people need to know that a dear savior died here
A long  long time ago
And silver and gold might buy you a home
But things of this world  they won't last you long
And time has a way of turning us old
And time can't be bought back with silver and gold

The bridge  so tall
Here is where it started
On the bridge
The moon is big and yellow
And the stars are all a' glow
From the bridge  I see reflections
In the waters far below
You kissed me for the first time here
An' held me awfully tight
And the bridge became our favorite place
We came here often in the night
And one night while standing on the bridge
Desire swept through us both
Passion took us by the hand
And showed us where to go
From the bridge we saw a meadow
So we ran together there
Where we found love together
Our emotions filled the air

Closer to the edge
