lyrics
"Somethin' never comes  never leads to nothin'
Nothin' satisfies  but I'm gettin' close
Closer to the prize at the end of the rope
All night long  I dream of the day
When it comes around  then it's taken away
Leaves me with the feelin' that I feel the most
Feel it come to life when I see your ghost
Come down  don't you resist
You've such a delicate wrist
And if I give it a twist
Somethin' to hold when I lose my grip
Will I find somethin' in there?
To give me just what I need
Another reason to bleed
One by one  hidden up my sleeve
One by one  hidden up my sleeve
Hey  don't let it go to waste
I love it  but I hate the taste
Weight keepin' me down
Hey  don't let it go to waste
I love it  but I hate the taste
Weight keepin' me down

Will I find a believer?
Another one who believes?
Another one to deceive?
Over and over  down on my knees
If I get any closer
And if you open up wide
And if you let me inside
On and on  I got nothin' to hide
On and on  I got nothin' to hide
Hey  don't let it go to waste
I love it  but I hate the taste
Weight keepin' me down
Hey  don't let it go to waste
I love it  but I hate the taste
Weight keepin' me down
All my life  I've been searchin' for somethin'
Somethin' never comes  never leads to nothin'
Nothin' satisfies  but I'm gettin' close
Closer to the prize at the end of the rope
All night long  I dream of the day
When it comes around  then it's taken away
Leaves me with the feelin' that I feel the most
Feel it come to life when I see your ghost
Hey  don't let it go to waste
I love it  but I hate the taste
Weight keepin' me down
Hey  don't let it go to waste
I love it  but I hate the taste
Weight keepin' me down
A simple round of conversation
Became a shameful equation
I flipped you station to station
Hey
Don't go and turn the other way
Don't say there's nothin' more to say
You used to say I couldn't save you enough
And when you said I couldn't give you enough
Chase
All of those memories away
Save them all for another day
Don't you remember it was rain that drowned you
Wait
I wanna see if you can shake
I wanna keep all I can take
I feel much better now

Dancin' through life on the front lines
Years passed her by waitin' to rise
She had arrows in her eyes  fear where her heart should be
War in her mind
Arrows in her eyes  fear where her heart should be
War in her mind  shame in her cries
Arrows in her eyes  tears in her arteries
War in her mind  shame as she cries
Fire away
Under a silent light  screamin' biology
Queen Gemini  the world in her sights
I want a new life forming inside of me
Blessed and born into this fire

And it's on and on and on and on and on
I just kinda died for you
You just kinda stared at me
We will always have that chance
We can do this one more time
All this time
Take me now
We can spin the sun around
And the stars will all come out
Then we'll turn and come back down
Turn and come back down

Where it's easier than this

I'm your fool
Everyone's got their chains to break
Holdin' you
Were you born to resist
Or be abused?
Is someone getting the best

Are you gone and on to someone new?
I needed somewhere to hang my head
Without your noose
You gave me something that I didn't have
But had no use
I was too weak to give in
Too strong to lose
My heart is under arrest again
But I break loose
My head is giving me life or death
But I can't choose
I swear I'll never give in
I refuse

What little time we spent  a penny on the floor
My desperation  a spinnin' top
Revolvin' on and on  a world that never stops
Is it all mine? How could I know?
We threw the rind away  swallowed all the core
Tried levitation  you're not alone
The stars are holdin' open a door we'll never close
I have an engine made of gold
Somethin' so beautiful  the world will never know
Our roots are stronger than you know
Up through the concrete they will grow
Is it all mine? I can't let go
What little time we spent  a penny on the floor
My desperation  is this a curse?
'Til death do us part  for better or for worse

Nothing you could say is gonna change my mind
Waited and I waited the longest night
Nothing like the taste of sweet decline
I was down  and I fell  I fell so fast
Droppin' like the grains in an hourglass
Never say forever 'cause nothing lasts
Dancin' with the bones of my buried past
Never mind  there's nothing I could do
Bet your life there's something killin' you
It's a shame we have to die my dear
No one's gettin' out of here alive
This time
What a way to go  but have no fear
No one's gettin' out of here alive

Made you come clean in a dirty dress

To raise another in its place
A heavy cross you bear
A stubborn heart remains unchanged
No stranger singin' in your name
Maybe the season
The colors change in the valley skies

Runnin' through Hell  heaven can wait
Long road to ruin there in your eyes
Under the cold streetlights
No tomorrow  no dead end in sight

Open the streets and raise the gates

I know a field without a name
Head on without a care

Another splinter under the skin
Another season of loneliness

Walk in circles back to square one
Made it through yesterday
Wrote you a melody
Need not say anything to me
I'll take care of everything
From now on
Where are you now?
Who will show me how?

Wait for the sun
You watched the hummingbirds
Naming evеry one
Do you have a minute for mе?

 I came from nothing
 you can't make me change my name

I'm finally somewhere in between
I'm impressed  what a beautiful chest
I never meant to make a big scene
Will you resign to the latest design?
You look so messy when you dress up in dreams
One more for hire  a wonderful liar
I think it's time we all should come clean
Stack dead actors  stacked to the rafters
Line up the bastards  all I want is the truth
Can you make it look like we won?
And we cry when they all die blonde
God bless  what a sensitive mess
Yeah  but things aren't always what they seem
Your teary eyes  your famous disguise
Never knowin' who to believe
When you're just another agin' drag queen

Pretend there's nothing wrong
You can sing along with me
And I don't wanna be queen
Just tryin' to keep my t-shirt clean
There's one thing that I have learned
And you get what you deserve

All this time it still feels just like yesterday
That I walked a million miles with you
But there's no getting over it
