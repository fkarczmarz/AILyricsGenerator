lyrics
"No I don't wanna work in a building downtown
I don't know what I'm gonna do
'Cause the planes keep crashing always two by two
I don't wanna work in a building downtown
No I don't wanna see when the planes hit the ground
I don't wanna work in a building downtown
I don't wanna work in a building downtown
Parking their cars in the underground
And the trouble makers riding on the back of the bus
That you gotta work hard and you gotta get paid
You know that I'm a God-fearing man
You know that I'm a God-fearing man
To seat my daughters there by your right hand

Now I'm overcome
By the light of day
My lips are near but my heart is far away
Tell me what to say
I'll be your mouthpiece!
Into the light of a bridge that burns
As I drive from the city with the money that I earned
Into the dark of a starless sky
I'm staring into nothing and I'm asking you why:
So the world can see who you really are?
The men are gonna come while you're fast asleep
So you better just stay close and hold on to me
If my little mocking bird don't sing
'Cause I wanna put it up on the TV screen
So the world can see what your true word means
'Cause I just gotta know if I'm wasting my time!
Now I'm overcome
By the light of day
Now the war is won
How come nothing tastes good?
You're such a sensitive child!
Oh! you're such a sensitive child!
I just need you to sing for me tonight
You're gonna have your day in the sun 
You know God loves the sensitive ones
Oh! my little bird in a cage!
Oh! my little bird in a cage!
And show the men that you're old for your age
Now ain't the time for fear
Oh! My little mocking bird sing!
Oh! My little mocking bird sing!
And show the men it's not about the money
Wanna hold a mirror up to the world
So that they can see themselves inside my little girl!
Do you know where I was at your age?
Any idea where I was at your age?
I was working downtown for the minimum wage
And I'm not gonna let you just throw it all away!
And led him to the lonesome hill
While his daughter hid and watched
She dared not breathe she was so still
Just as the angel cried for the slaughter
Abraham's daughter raised her voice
Then the angel asked her what her
Name was she said I have none
Then he asked how can this be
My father never gave me one
Abraham's daughter raised her bow
How darest you child defy your father
After all the breath  and the dirt  and the fires are burnt
And after all this time  and after all the ambulances go
And after all the hangers-on are done hanging on to the dead light
Of the afterglow
I've gotta know
Can we work it out?
We scream and shout ‘til we work it out
Can we just work it out?
Scream and shout ‘til we work it out?
‘Til we work it out  ‘til we work it out
‘Til we work it out  ‘tilwe work it out
Afterlife  I think I saw what happens next
Oh  it was just a glimpse of you  like looking through a window
Or a shallow sea
Could you see me?
And after all this time
It's like nothing else we used to know
And after all the hangers-on are done hanging on to the dead light
Of the afterglow
I've gotta know

Is this the afterlife?
It's just an afterlife with you
It's just an afterlife (Just an afterlife)
It's just an afterlife with you
(It’s just an afterlife)
And I doubt we’ll figure it out
Is it you or is it me?
The age of anxiety
(Are you talking to me?)
Fight the fever with TV
In the age where nobody sleeps
And the pills do nothing for me
In the age of anxiety
See what you want me to
What I want you to see
It's a maze (It's a maze) of mirrors (Of mirrors)
It’s a hologram of a ghost
And you can't quite touch it
Which is how it hurts us the most
And hide it deep in a drawer
Say your prayers tonight
Someone finds it after the war

It's all about you
It’s not about you
It's all about you
It's not about you
It's all about you
In a little town
Before the awful sound
Started coming down
You came home from school
And knew you had to run
Please stop running now
Just let me be the one
For you
But I know you can see
Things that we can't see
But when I say I love you
Your silence covers me
It's an awful sound
I was so disappointed
You didn't want me
Eurydice?
I was standing beside you
By a frozen sea
Will you ever get free?
Just take all your pain
Just put it on me
So that you can breathe
When you fly away
Will you hit the ground?
It's an awful sound

There's so much inside you
That you won't let me see

When you hit the ground
I know there's a way we can make 'em pay
But I know that there's a way we can leave today
Think it over...
We know there's a price to pay
For love in the reflective age
I met you up upon a stage
Our love in a reflective age
After waking from a nightmare
Shot by a security camera
You can't watch your own image
And also look yourself in the eye
I know when the time is coming
All the words will lose their meaning
Please show me something that isn’t mine
But mine is the only kind that I relate to
Le miroir casse
The mirror casts mon reflet partout
Black mirror knows no reflection
It knows not pride or vanity
It cares not about your dreams
It cares not for your pyramid schemes
Their names are never spoken
The curse is never broken
The curse is never broken

I waited for your letter
I have no feeling for you now
Now that I know you better
I wish that I could have loved you then
Before our age was through
And before a world war does with us
Whatever it will do
I dreamt I drove home to Houston
On a highway that was underground
There was no light that we could see
As we listened to the sound of the engine failing
I feel like I’ve been living in
A city with no children in it
A garden left for ruin by a millionaire inside
Of a private prison
You never trust a millionaire
Quoting the Sermon on the Mount
I used to think I was not like them
When you’re hiding underground
The rain can’t get you wet
But do you think your righteousness
Can pay the interest on your debt? I have my doubts about it

Love was made to forget it
I carved your name across my eyelids
The crown of love has fallen from me
Because the spark is not within me
I snuffed it out before my mom walked
In my bedroom

And you won't give me a straight answer

Only word that I can say
In my place and time
And here in my own skin
I can finally begin
Let the century pass me by
Standing under a night sky
Tomorrow means nothing
I
Was only a child then
Feeling barely alive when
I heard the song from the speaker of a passing car
Been praying to a dying star
The memory's fading
I can almost remember singing
La la-la la-la la-la
La-la la-la la-la la-la
We
Watched the end of the century
Compressed on a tiny screen
A dead star collapsing and we could see
Something was ending
Are you through pretending
We saw the signs in the suburbs?

Guns can’t kill what soldiers can’t see
In the forest we are hiding
Unmarked graves where flowers grow
Hear the soldiers angry yelling
In the river we will go
Tous les morts-nés forment une armée
Soon we will reclaim the earth
All the tears and all the bodies
Bring about our second birth
Haïti  never free

We were too young
Now that night’s closing in
Lock us up safe
And hide the key
But the night tears us loose
Strange how the half light
Can make a place new
You can’t recognize me
And I can’t recognize you
We run through these streets
That we know so well
And the houses hide so much
But in the half light
None of us can tell
They hide the ocean in a shell
The ocean in a shell
Our heads are just houses
Without enough windows
You say you hear human voices
But they’re only echoes
They’re only echoes
They’re only echoes
Only echoes

We've already lost
But they're afraid to pay the cost
For what we've lost
Pay the cost
For what we've lost

I will never raise my voice
All the diamonds you have here
In this home which has no life

To melt the street beneath your feet

Just wanna hear you cry
Who's gonna throw the very first stone?

So I wait in line  I'm a modern man
And the people behind me  they can't understand
Makes me feel like
Something don't feel right
Like a record that's skipping  I'm a modern man
And the clock keeps ticking  I'm a modern man
Makes me feel like
Makes me feel like
In my dream  I was almost there
Then they pulled me aside and said  You're going nowhere
They say we are the chosen few  but we waste it
And that's why we're still waiting
On a number from the modern man
Maybe when you're older you will understand
Why you don't feel right
Why you can't sleep at night now

My neighborhood
And if my parents are crying
Then I'll dig a tunnel from my window to yours
You climb out the chimney and meet me in the middle
The middle of the town
And forget all we used to know
Then our skin gets thicker from living out in the snow
Then we tried to name our babies but we forgot all the names that
The names we used to know
But sometimes we remember our bedrooms and our parents' bedrooms
And the bedrooms of our friends

Ice has covered up my parents' hands

I went out to find some light
Kids are swinging from the power lines
I woke up on the darkest night
Neighbors all were shouting that they found the light

Shadows jumping all over my walls

I went out to pick a fight with anyone
Light a candle for the kids

All the neighbors are starting up a fire
My eyes are covered by the hands of my unborn kids
But my heart keeps watching through the skin of my eyelids
They say a watched pot won't ever boil
Well I closed my eyes and nothing changed
Just some water getting hotter in the flames
It's not a lover I want no more
And it's not heaven I'm pining for
But there's some spirit I used to know
That's been drowned out by the radio!
They say a watched pot won't ever boil
You can't raise a baby on motor oil
In the light  they both looked the same
Poured them out on into the world
On every boy and every girl

If that's all they can do
But I'd lose my heart
If I turned away from you
Oh  Daddy don't turn away
You know that I'm so scared
But will you watch me drown?
You know we're going nowhere
We know that we're young
And no shit we're confused
But will you watch us drown?
What are you so afraid to lose?
Down on my knees  begging us please
Praying that we don't exist
You're down on your knees  begging us please
Praying that we don't exist
But we exist  we exist
Down on your knees  begging us please
Praying that we don't exist
You're down on your knees  begging us please
Praying that we don't exist
But we exist  we exist
We exist  we exist
Maybe if you hang together
You can make the changes in our hearts
And if you hang together  you can change us
Just where should you start?
 I used to sign my name
 the times had already changed
 I never wrote it down
 standing in the wilderness downtown
 we used to wait
 we used to wait
 we used to wait
 we used to wait)
 we used to wait)
 I'm gonna sign my name
 gonna move through the pain
 we used to wait
 we used to wait
 we used to wait
 we used to wait)
 we used to wait)

Sometimes it moves so fast
Sometimes it moves so fast
If you stop to ask
It's already passed
So how can you move so slow?
How can you move so slow?
You miss it if you don't
You miss it if you
Don't already know
Already know
Already know
Already know
Already know
When your love is right
When your love is right
You can't sleep at night
You've been sleeping just fine
But when your love is bad
When your love is bad
I don't know why you're so sad
But it's time to go
