lyrics
"Where the islands go
Million dollar renovations to a happy home
My ex says she gave me the best years of her life
Checkin' MediaTakeOut
Pictures of me drunk walkin' out with a bitch
But it's blurry enough to get the fake out
You had me drivin' far enough to switch the time zone
But I still drove thirty hours
You might also like
I remember rappin' for Jay and Cam
Young producer just trying to get his flows off
I remember being nervous to do Victoria's Secret
'Til I pictured everybody with they clothes off
Expedition was Eddie Bauer edition
I'm drivin' with no winter tires in December
I used the Western Union for you like it's no prob'
'Cause you was in college complainin' 'bout it's no jobs
But you were suckin' a nigga dick the whole time
Where the main ties onto the sail
Better on sighting
Thirty hours
Thirty hours
Thirty hours
Now a nigga mad
Now I'm 'bout to drive ninety miles like Matt Barnes to kill
Thirty hours
Just to kill
Just to
Just to
I'm about to drive ninety
Ninety miles like Matt Barnes just to whoop a nigga ass
It was my idea and now a nigga (Thirty hours)
A stunna
Whoop him after school just to show I got class
Duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh
You know what I'm sayin'? Drop some shit like that
Whoop him after school just to
Thirty hours
Whoop him after school just to show I got class
Thirty hours
Thirty hours
My favorite albums used to have like bonus joints like this
That's why they kick it off like this
Thirty hours
The pyramids shall rise
Thirty hours
Look at these ultralight beams flowin'
Let's rock out for 'bout
Thirty hours
Thirty hours
Remember when the whole block'd get shout out?
This my version of a shout-out track
Thirty hours
Thirty hours
To my family: thank you for holding me down
The media be acting like
Thirty hours
That's Gabe calling
I'm just doing a— I'm just doing an adlib track right now
What's up?

Uh  Chi-Town  stand up!
Oh  when it all  it all falls down
Southside  Southside
We gon' set this party off right
I'm tellin' you all  it all falls down
Westside  Westside
We gon' set this party off right
Oh  when it all
Man  I promise  she's so self-conscious
She has no idea what she doin' in college
That major that she majored in don't make no money
But she won't drop out  her parents'll look at her funny
Now  tell me that ain't insecurr
The concept of school seems so securr
Sophomore  three yurrs  ain't picked a carurr
She like  Fuck it  I'll just stay down hurr and do hair
'Cause that's enough money to buy her a few pairs
Of new Airs  'cause her baby daddy don't really care
She's so precious with the peer pressure
Couldn't afford a car  so she named her daughter Alexis
She had hair so long that it looked like weave
Then she cut it all off  now she look like Eve
And she be dealin' with some issues that you can't believe
Single black female addicted to retail  and well

Oh  when it all  it all falls down
And when it falls down  who you gon' call now?
I'm tellin' you all  it all falls down
C'mon  c'mon  and when it all falls down
Oh  when it all
Man  I promise  I'm so self-conscious
That's why you always see me with at least one of my watches
Rollies and Pashas done drove me crazy
I can't even pronounce nothing  pass that Ver-say-see!
Then I spent four hundred bucks on this
Just to be like  Nigga  you ain't up on this
And I can't even go to the grocery store
Without some 1s that's clean and a shirt with a team
It seem we livin' the American Dream
But the people highest up got the lowest self-esteem
The prettiest people do the ugliest things
For the road to riches and diamond rings
We shine because they hate us  floss 'cause they degrade us
We tryna buy back our 40 acres
And for that paper  look how low we'll stoop
Even if you in a Benz  you still a nigga in a coupe
Oh  when it all  it all falls down
Come on  come on
I'm tellin' you all  it all falls down
And when it falls down  who you gon' call now?
Oh  when it all  it all falls down
Come on  come on
I'm tellin' you all  it all falls down
And when it all falls down
I say  Fuck the police  that's how I treat 'em
We buy our way out of jail  but we can't buy freedom
We'll buy a lot of clothes  but we don't really need 'em
Things we buy to cover up what's inside
'Cause they made us hate ourself and love they wealth
That's why shorty's hollerin'  Where the ballers at?
Drug dealer buy Jordan  crackhead buy crack
And the white man get paid off of all of that
But I ain't even gon' act holier than thou'
'Cause fuck it  I went to Jacob with 25 thou'
Before I had a house and I'd do it again
‘Cause I wanna be on 106 & Park  pushin' a Benz
I want to act ballerific like it's all terrific
I got a couple past-due bills  I won't get specific
I got a problem with spendin' before I get it
We all self-conscious  I'm just the first to admit it
Oh  when it all  it all falls down
C'mon  c'mon
And when it falls down  who you gon' call now?
I'm tellin' you all  it all falls down
C'mon  c'mon  and when it falls down
Oh  when it all  it all falls down
Southside  Southside
We gon' set this party off right
I'm tellin' you all  it all falls down
Westside  Westside
We gon' set this party off right
Oh  when it all  it all falls down
Chi-Town  Chi-Town
We gon' show 'em how we get down
I'm tellin' you all  it all falls down
C'mon
Oh  when it all  it all falls down
I'm tellin' you all  it all falls down
*Applause*
I can't keep workin' like this
This grave shifts is like a slave ship
Damn  that ass bustin' out the bottom
I'ma lose my mind in it
Crazy  that medulla oblongata
Get to rubbin' on my lamp
Get the genie out the bottle
Fuck it up  fuck it up
Pussy good  go 'n back it up
Pipe her up  I'ma pipe her up
Make her mine  I done fell in love
Juicy thing  make that pussy sing
Make it cry  come boohoo this shit
Yeah  you supermodel thick
Damn  that ass bustin' out the bottom
I'ma lose my mind in it
Crazy  that medulla oblongata
Get to rubbin' on my lamp
Get the genie out the bottle
If I pull up with a Kerry Washington
That's gon' be an enormous scandal
I could have Naomi Campbell
And still might want me a Stormy Daniels
Sometimes you gotta bag the boss up
I call that takin' Corey Gambles
Find yourself up in the food court
You might have to enjoy a sample
All these thots on Christian Mingle
Almost what got Tristan single
If you don't ball like him or Kobe
Guarantee that bitch gonna leave you
Ayy  time is extremely valuable
And I prefer to waste it on girls that's basic
That's just some Ye shit
Right now  let's do what we want

I can focus on two things at once

Ayy  if you drivin' 'round in some Dri-Fit

Yeah  you supermodel thick
Damn  that ass bustin' out the bottom

It's been racin' since the summertime
Now I'm holdin' down the summer now
And all I want is what I can't buy now
'Cause I ain't got the money on me right now
And I told you to wait
So I'ma need a little more time now
'Cause I ain't got the money on me right now
And I thought you could wait
These bitches surroundin' me (Black bodies)

Running naked down the lobby
And you were screamin' that you love me
Before the limelight tore ya
Before the limelight stole ya
Remember we were so young
When I would hold you
Before the blood on the leaves
I know there ain't wrong with me
Something strange is happenin'
You could've been somebody
Or was it on the first party
When we tried our first molly
And came out of our body
And came out of our body
Before they call lawyers
Before you tried to destroy us
How you gon' lie to the lawyer?
It's like I don't even know ya
I gotta bring it back to the 'nolia
Fuck them other niggas 'cause I'm down with my niggas
Fuck them other niggas 'cause I'm down with my niggas

I don't give a damn if you used to talk to JAY-Z
She Instagram herself like #BadBitchAlert
He Instagram his watch like #MadRichAlert
He only wanna see that ass in reverse
Two-thousand-dollar bag with no cash in your purse
Then you gotta go into your girl and report that
Main reason 'cause your pastor said you can't abort that
Unholy matrimony
No waiting for the summer rose and (Breeze)

What you doin' in the club on a Thursday?
She say she only here for her girl birthday
They ordered champagne but still look thirsty
I know I got a bad reputation
Walk-around-always-mad reputation
Leave-a-pretty-girl-sad reputation
I turnt the nightclub out of the basement
How you gon' be mad on vacation?

Wait 'til I get my money right
I had a dream I could buy my way to Heaven
When I awoke  I spent that on a necklace
I told God I'd be back in a second
Man  it's so hard not to act reckless
To whom much is given  much is tested
Get arrested  guess until he get the message
I feel the pressure  under more scrutiny
And what I do? Act more stupidly
Bought more jewelry  more Louis V
My mama couldn't get through to me
The drama  people suing me
I'm on TV talking like it's just you and me
I'm just saying how I feel  man
I ain't one of the Cosbys  I ain't go to Hillman
I guess the money should've changed him
I guess I should've forgot where I came from
La  la  la-la (Ayy!)
Wait 'til I get my money right
La  la  la-la (Yeah!)
Then you can't tell me nothing  right?
Excuse me  was you saying something?
Uh-uh  you can't tell me nothing (Yeah! Haha!)

But homie  this is my day
Class started two hours ago  oh  am I late?
No  I already graduated
And you can live through anything if Magic made it
They say I talk with so much emphasis
Ooh  they so sensitive
Don't ever fix your lips like collagen
And say something when you gon' end up apolog'ing
Let me know if it's a problem then
La  la  la-la
Wait 'til I get my money right

Let the champagne splash  let that man get cash
Let that man get past
He don't even stop to get gas
If he can move through the rumors
He can drive off of fumes 'cause
How he move in a room full of no's?
How he stay faithful in a room full of hoes?
Must be the pharaohs  he in tune with his soul
So when he buried in a tomb full of gold
Treasure  what's your pleasure?
Life is a–uh–depending how you dress her
So if the Devil wear Prada  Adam Eve wear nada
I'm in between  but way more fresher
With way less effort
'Cause when you try hard  that's when you die hard
Your homies looking like  Why  God?
When they reminisce over you  my God

Wait 'til I get my money right

So I can't jeopardize that for one of these hoes
I been livin' without limits
As far as my business
I'm the only one that's in control
I been feeling all I've given
For my children
I will die for those I love
To make this my mission
Give up the women
Before I lose half of what I own
I been thinking
'Bout my vision
Pour out my feelings
Revealing the layers to my soul
My soul
The layers to my soul
Revealing the layers to my soul

Can't let them get to me

Everyday I'm livin' high  I'm smokin' marijuana
I've been tryin' to make you love me
But everything I try just takes you further from me
Someday we gon' set it off
Someday we gon' get this off
Baby  don't you bet it all
On a pack of fentanyl
You might think they wrote you off
They gon' have to rope me off
Someday the drama'll be gone
And they'll play this song on and on
Sometimes I take all the shine
Talk like I drank all the wine
Years ahead but way behind
No half-truths  just naked minds
Caught between space and time

Penitentiary chances  the devil dances
And eventually answers to the call of autumn
All them fallin' for the love of ballin'
Got caught with thirty rocks  the cop look like Alec Baldwin
Inter-century anthems based off inner-city tantrums
Based off the way we was branded
Face it  Jerome get more time than Brandon
And at the airport  they check all through my bag
And tell me that it's random
But we stay winning
This week has been a bad massage  I need a happy ending
And a new beginning and a new fitted
And some job opportunities that's lucrative
They done stole your dreams  you don't know who did it

She told the director she tryna get in a school
He said  Take them glasses off and get in the pool
It's been a while since I watched the tube
'Cause like a Crip set  I got way too many blues for any more bad news
I was looking at my resume  feeling real fresh today
They rewrite history  I don't believe in yesterday
And what's a Black Beatle anyway  a fuckin' roach?
I guess that's why they got me sitting in fuckin' coach
My guy said I need a different approach
'Cause people is looking at me like I'm sniffin' coke
It's not funny anymore  try different jokes
Tell 'em hug and kiss my ass  X and O
And kiss the ring while they at it  do my thing while I got it
Play strings for the dramatic ending of that wack shit
Act like I ain't had a belt in two classes
I ain't got it  I'm coming after whoever who has it
I'm coming after whoever  who has it?
I don't really give a fuck about it at all
'Cause the same people that tried to blackball me
Forgot about two things  my Black balls
Ain't no question if I want it  I need it
I can feel it slowly drifting away from me
I'm on the edge  so why you playing? I'm saying
Ayy  yo

Nigga hat game was special
It matched every black pair of Nikes  throwing dice for decimals
Make sure he right in the field  not a soldier dead
That meant code red  bent off the black skunk
The black Dutch  back of the old shed
Keep it real or keep it moving  keep grinding
Learn from others like your brothers Rae and Kanye
I can feel it slowly drifting away from me

The most beautiful thoughts are always besides the darkest
Today  I seriously thought about killing you
I contemplated  premeditated murder
And I think about killing myself
And I love myself way more than I love you  so…
Today  I thought about killing you  premeditated murder
You'd only care enough to kill somebody you love
The most beautiful thoughts are always besides the darkest
(Mhm—mhm—mhm—mhm—mhmm)
Just say it out loud to see how it feels
People say don't say this  don't say that
Just say it out loud  just to see how it feels
Weigh all the options  nothing's off the table
Today  I thought about killing you  premeditated murder
I think about killing myself
And I  I love myself way more than I love you
The most beautiful thoughts are always besides the darkest
(Mhm—mhm—mhm—mhm—mhm—mhm—mhm—mhm—mhmm)
I think this is the part where I'm supposed to say somethin' good to compensate it so it doesn't come off bad
But sometimes I think really bad things
Really  really  really bad things
And I love myself way more than I love you
See  if I was tryin' to relate it to more people
I'd probably say I'm struggling with loving myself
Because that seems like a common theme
But that's not the case here
I love myself way more than I love you
And I think about killing myself
So  best believe  I thought about killing you today
Premeditated murder

And not like your mommy's
Just bein' salty  but niggas is nuts
And I am a nigga  I know what they want
I pray that you don't get it all at once
Curves under your dress  I know it's pervs all on the net
All in the comments  you wanna vomit
That's your baby  you love her to death
Now she cuttin' class and hangin' with friends
You break a glass and say it again
She can't comprehend the danger she in
If you whoop her ass  she move in with him
Then he whoop her ass  you go through it again
But how you the devil rebukin' the sin?
Let's pray we can put this behind us
I swear that these times is the wildest
She got the scars  they serve as reminders
Blood still on her pajamas
But yesterday is dead  yeah  moment of silence
Next  she'll be off to college and then at the altar
'Cause she know that niggas is savage  niggas is monsters
Niggas is pimps  niggas is players  'til niggas have daughters
Niggas is pimps  niggas is players  'til niggas have daughters
