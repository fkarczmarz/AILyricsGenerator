"10 000 cats
10 000 cats for me
Seasonal change  stars rearrange
Kissing my grave
Why are you bothering me?
10 000 rats
10 000 rats to meet
Standing in line
One at a time  for me
Sparkling night
Sharpening knives
Parallel lines
Taking up all of my time
Wishing away
Robbing my stones
Kissing my grave
Summertime is a whirlwind away
And I know that the lights won't invade
16 years of mechanical joy
And I know that the lines show the way
Burn a candle for magical days
Now I know that the rest is okay
It's shooting light and I'm feeling again
Is this love that I'm feeling again
16 years of mechanical joy
And I know that the lines show the way
Burn a candle for magical days
Now I know that the rest is okay
It's shooting light and I'm feeling again
In the morning light
Realize my love is gone
Can you show me a sign without your body?
Can't feel my love anymore
Can't feel my love anymore
I'm still running
Last night I had a dream
That the sky would part
And you'd come for me
Can you keep me waiting 'til the sun goes down?
I am dying here without my body

I'm not afraid of the concrete
Bad dreams never affect me
I'm not afraid of the concrete
I’m not doing this all in fun
I just gotta go
I’m not doing this all in fun
Just say goodbye
Baby you’ve got soul
To changing me
(And I believe this happened once before)
To changing me
(And I predict the world will be all gone)
To changing me
(And I can see the same things that you see)
To changing me
(‘Cause I predict the world)
Bad things never neglect me
I’m just a scene in a movie
Bad thoughts never arrest me
I’m just a flash in a memory

Millions of years go by
Memories of peace and love
Killing to reconstruct
And what will the label do?
Hurt people hurt people too
I'm sorry for what I've done
Head on the bathroom floor
Talking in your demon voice
Millions of years go by
Memories of peace and love
Talking to the barking dog
Never mind the barking dog

Am I wanted inside?
Burning star

Am I lonely?
Cause it feels right
Wave goodbye to your family and friends
Those lost ants
And your eyes bleed when you see
Cause nothing works inside
Burning star
I will leave your face out of my mind
You should save your eyes
A thousand voices howling in my head
Speak in tongues
I don't even recognize your face
Mirror on the wall
Tell me all the ways to stay away
Away-ay ya
Away-ay ya
And stay away-ay ya
Away-ay ya
Away-ay ya
Dig a hole
Fireworks exploding in my hands
If I could paint the sky
Would all the stars then shine a bloody red?

Let's go somewhere private and talk open-minded
Though my speech slurred and my sight's all blinded
And be on something with you like Egyptians with the pyramids
Stare right in the mirror not even no one was feelin it
I think I might got 'em addicted
Tryna kick it cause emotions are evicted
I think that you should listen cause you know that I could fix it
No way you got time to play so
I think it's safe to say you should just stay away (stay away)

And I'm tired of love
Someday I'm gonna miss you
Blood on my palms
Wide eyes and holes
Someday I'll pull my teeth out
I'll see you later in the night time
Where all the colors are dark or glowing
We don't really get along
I'll see you later in the moonlight
Where all the colors are softly fading
We don't really wanna die
Blood on my palms
Wide eyes and holes
 pick it up  pick it  oh
 keep goin' now
 keep goin' now
 keep goin' now
 keep goin' now
 keep goin' now
 keep goin' now
And all the time I waste on celebrating nothing
How many times can I blow it all
How many times will I burn it down
Give me a reason to stay alive
I've got the feeling we're gonna die
I hide behind my eyes and lies and broken mirrors
And every day I say this time around my vision's getting clearer
How many times can I blow it all
How many times will I burn it down

Give me a reason to stay alive
Faded  fade in
Fade out
It's my favorite daydream
Where everybody knows me
Hang back  hang back
Get past
So  be good
Just have fun
Hold me  I'm a miracle
Hold me  I'm a miracle
Falling in a swimming pool
Naked in the neon moon
Hang back  hang back
Just laugh
Animate my lonely
Solo ceremony
Insomniac
'Cause darling you're dragging me down
I wish I could say that I'm sorry
I used to see beauty in people
But now I see muscle and bones
You know I never wanted to hurt you
So I'm saying my goodbyes
Goodbye to my good side
It only ever got me hurt
And I finally learned
Erase you from my mind
So I'm saying my goodbyes
Goodbye to my good side
It only ever got me hurt

You picture buildings burning to the ground
From the basement to the streetlight
I'm not your drinking problem
A hole is in the sky

Just the feeling like you're gonna die
All you know how to do is
Shake shake

Shake shake shake
I'm not your paranoia
When someone's at the door
Virgin fires calling out the throat of a body rising through the floor

Uncomfortable too

And i've got new ways
Of turning into stone
Cause it's a new day
And i've got new ways
Of turning into stone
Oh mister hyde
I'm bringing you to life
And rolling back my eyes
Unconscious mind
Take me for a ride
Destroying the man inside
I should belong
It's just a line
That's splitting me apart
It's just a line
It's just a line
It's just a line
That's splitting me apart
It's just a line
It's just a line
It's just a line

Cause I can't live without you
When a song is about you
Then you know you've got problems
That you can choose
There's a hole in my conscience
There's a hole in my country
Like a nose that keeps runnin'
Like a hose that won't stop flowin'
And I know that it's comin'
It's coming
It's coming
It's coming soon
Here's why
Cause you are the ocean
And I'm good at drownin'
You should be lookin' out
The mornin' will follow
And I won't remember
You should be lookin' out
It feels like I've been here
I've been here forever
You should be lookin' out
You should be lookin' out

In the fall I get lonely
In the winter I'm still lonely
Come the knives of the springtime
In the summer I go crazy
Cause you are the ocean
And I'm good at drownin'
You should be lookin' out
The mornin' will follow
And I won't remember
You should be lookin' out
It feels like I've been here
I've been here forever
You should be lookin' out
When the moon is bleeding red
Woke up stoned in the backseat
From a dream where my teeth fell out of my head
Everybody's on something here
My godsend chemical best friend
Skeleton whispering in my ear
Walk with me to the end
Stare with me into the abyss
Do you feel like letting go?
I wonder how far down it is
Nothing is fun
Not like before
You don't get me high anymore
Used to take one
Now it takes four
You don't get me high anymore
Runnin' through emergency rooms
Spinning wheels and ceiling fans
Mannequin fakin' it the best I can
No hands on the steering wheel
I'm crashing this save-a-ho puppet show
UFO obliterate the way I feel

I used to be a rifle  yeah I had my distance
Whistlin' like a bullet in the sky-y-y-y
I used to be a psycho  yeah I had my demons
Crawling like a spider up my spi-i-i-ne
I spotted you the second I walked in the buildin'
I knew that you would let me get you hi-i-iigh
I wanna hear the things you say when no one's listenin'
But that don't matter anyway  'cause you're mine
'Cause you're mine
