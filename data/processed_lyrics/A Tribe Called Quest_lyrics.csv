"Once again  Tip
You on point  Phife?
Once again  Tip
You on point  Phife?
Once again  Tip
Word  watch me bust they shit
Okay
I swear you do it to me every time
Cause you stay crazy on my mind
Yo  you got it goin' on (Say word)
On and on and on
On and on and on
This is the year that I come in and just devastate
My style is great  ask your peoples can I dominate?
My rhymes are harder than last night's erection
Don't play me close  I'll have this mic up in your mid-section
My shit is lovely  simply meaning that my joint is tight
Amping up the mic  making sure production's tight
Sometimes I might catch a severe case of writer's block
But by the end of the day  you'll be on my jock
My name's Malik  my hobby's putting MCs to the test
And if you front  I'll put my foot up in your freaking chest
Freestyle fanatic and never will it ever stop
Your crew is his'  you might just want to call the cops
You might also like
Make sure my verse jump up and spread out like the raper
The only tip I got for a waiter
Is watch the doorknob hit me where the dirty dog should've bit me
That was my train of thought  but for so long I fought
Now I'm at a level supreme to the devil
So turn up the bass and lay low on the treble
We be the real MCs and you dead  bring a shovel
Revitalize  the vital Tribe nigga (WHAT?)
The ladies sweat the style like the squirrel sweat the nuts
You know a fella's good for the moola
I swear you do it to me every time
'Cause you stay crazy on my mind
Yo  you got it goin' on
On and on and on
On and on and on (Yeah  yeah)
Yeah  yeah-yeah
Sometimes Shaitan got me by the pressure points
But I can break a fella down like sex
You eat Wheat Chex but still light in the ass and can't flex
If one nigga front  I'ma make more pay
'Cause tonight  we gettin off like O.J
Yo  I got a crew with the beats and the smarts and—
I fought my shit up on Linden in the one-nine-two
Hoping to battle  but most MCs ain't ready yet
But if they utter one word then it's as good as set
You have MCs dropping bombs that's incredible
Some of the brothers  their styles are just despicable
Try to deny me of my props then I'll be seeing you
Most of you suckers wanna be down for the tag-along
The freaking fame  someone tell 'em that this shit ain't games
You gots to do this from your heart  meaning your inner soul
And if it's real  only then will you be on a roll
I try to stay on top my game  there ain't no time to lose
Four albums deep as a Quester but still we payin' dues
So hear me out one time  you gots to be yourself
'Cause if you ain't yourself  you end up by your freaking self
I'm coming rugged with the Linden Boule type of slang
You on point  Tip?
You on point  Tip?
You on point  Tip?
I swear you do it to me every time  yeahhh
'Cause you stay crazy on my mind  ohhhh
On and on and on  yeah
This honey ripped me off for all my loot cakes
Somebody broke into my ride and cold macked it
But I'm gonna stay strong 'cause I ain't buyin' it
You know I gots to look dipped in the fresh new gear
Will someone tell me what did I do to deserve this?
I think I'll pull out my suit for Sunday service
Where the hell can Nicki be? I'm gonna smack her up
I got the tickets for the Knicks and she cold stood me up
Stressed out more than anyone could ever be
Forever tryin' to clear the samples for my new LP
Everybody knows I go to Georgia often
Got on the flight and I ended up in Boston

Now I'm station bound for the Thai sticks
Coach sat me down from the ball team (Uh)
Some niggas 'cross town was tryin' to stick me
Picked up this girl in the hoopty
Simply turned that ass away quick like Chuckii Booker
Sometimes you gotta put the hoes in their friggin' place
Just move from in front me with your batty face
Yeah

Tribe Called Quest
Shaheed and Tip
This is how we flip
Really need ya to help me out now
Goin' each and every place with the mic in their hand (Right  true)
(Right  true)
We on a world tour with Muhammad  my man (Right  true)
Goin' each and every place with the mic in their hand (Right  true)
(Right)
People  give your ears  so I be sublime
It's enjoyable to know you and the concubines
Sit down Indian style as we recite these hymns
See  lyrically I'm Mario Andretti on the MOMO
Ludicrously speedy or infectious with the slow-mo
Heard me in the '80s  J.B.s on The Promo
In my never-endin' quest to get the paper on the caper
But now  let me take it to the Queens side
I'm takin' it to Brooklyn side
All the residential Questers who invade the air
Hold up a second  son  'cause we almost there
You can be a Black man and lose all your soul
You can be white and groove  but don't crap the roll
See my shit is universal if you got knowledge of dolo
Or delf or self  see there's no one else
Who can drop it on the angle  acute at that
I'm buggin' out  but let me get back  'cause I'm wettin' niggas
So run and tell the others  'cause we are the brothers
I learned how to build mics in my workshop class
So give me this award and let's not make it the last

Back in '89  I simply slid into place
Buddy  buddy  buddy all up in your face
A lot of kids was bustin' rhymes  but they had no taste
Some said Quest was wack  but now is that the case?
I have a quest to have a mic in my hand
Without that  it's like Kryptonite and Superman
So  Shaheed  come in with the sugar cuts
Phife Dawg's my name  but on stage call me Dynomutt
When was the last time you heard the Phifer sloppy?
Lyrics anonymous  you'll never hear me copy
Top notch  baby  never comin' less
Sky's the limit  you gots to believe up in Quest
Sit back  relax  get up out the path
If not that  here's a dance floor  come move that ass
Non-believers  you can check the stats
I roll with Shaheed and the brother Abstract
Niggas know the time when Quest is in the jam
I never let a statue tell me how nice I am
Comin' with more hits than the Braves and the Yankees
Livin' mad phat like an oversized mampi
The wackest crews try to diss  it makes me laugh
When my track record's longer than a DC-20 aircraft
So next time that you think you want somethin' here
Make somethin' def or take that garbage to St. Elsewhere
We on a world tour with Muhammad  my man (Right  true)
Goin' each and every place with the mic in their hand (Right  true)

Seven times out of ten  we listen to our music at night
Thus spawned the title of this program
The word maraud means to loot
 Phife  you ready?
 you got that part  right? A'ight
 no doubt my niggas is boss
 y’all pissin’ me off
 yo  no matter the cost)
 you biters not innovators
 I honors my gift
 plus I’m freestyle equipped
 speak my name  it’s curtains
 my crew’s back to workin'
 pussy kill the chirping
 sit down  shit can only get worse
 boy  that flow ain’t workin'
 them vex and cursin'
 motherfuckers dispersin'
 woman  and children
 Busta Bus' then we kill them
 let me explain
 tarot cards  and Ouija games
 keep reppin’ Queens
 man
 you better change your plan
 but nigga you still got the work to do
 I’m watching from my heaven view
 make sure that they anoint me
 the best of show  five-foot-three
 bionic people who cause the world to twirl
 look right dead in they face
 Tip  there’s truly life after death
 call me shorty
Do I lust for you?
Am I a sinner because I do the two?
Can you let me know?
Bonita Applebum
Bonita Applebum—you gotta put me on
Bonita Applebum—you gotta put me on
Bonita Applebum—you gotta put me on
Bonita Applebum—you gotta put me on

If only you could see through your elaborate eyes
Bonita Applebum—you gotta put me on
Bonita Applebum—you gotta put me on
Bonita Applebum—you gotta put me on
Bonita Applebum—you gotta put me on
And they ask me
Can I kick it? Word (Yes you can!)
The five foot assassin with the roughneck business
I float like gravity  never had a cavity
Got more rhymes than the Winans got family
No need to sweat Arsenio to gain some type of fame
No shame in my game cause I'll always be the same
Styles upon styles upon styles is what I have
You wanna diss the Phifer but you still don't know the half
I sport New Balance sneakers to avoid a narrow path
Mess around with this you catch a size eight up your ass
I never half-step cause I'm not a half-stepper
Drink a lot of soda so they call me Dr. Pepper
Refuse to compete with BS competition
Your name ain't Special Ed
So won't you seckle with the mission
I never walk the street thinking it's all about me
Even though deep in my heart  it really could be
I just try my best to like go all out
Some might even say yo shorty black you're buggin' out
Zulu Nation  brothers' last creation
Minds get flooded  ejaculation
Right on the two-inch tape
The Abstract poet incognito  runs the cape
Not the best not the worst and occasionally I curse
To get my point across  so bust  the floss
As I go in between  the grit and the dirt
Listen to the mission listen Miss as I do work  umm
As I crack the  monotone
Children of the jazz so  get your own
Smokin R&B 'cause they try to do me
Or the best of the pack but they can't do rap
For it's Abstract  original
You can't get your own and that's  pitiful
I know I'd be the man if I cold yanked the plug
On R&B  but I can't and that's bugged

Yo when you bug out  you usually have a reason for the action
Sometimes you don't it's just for mere satisfaction
People be hounding  always surrounding
Pulsing  just like a migraine pounding
You don't really fret  you stay in your sense
Camouflage your feeling  of absolute tense
You soar off to another world  deep in your mind
But people seem to take that  as being unkind
Oh yo he's acting stank  really on a regal?
A man of the fame not a man of the people
Believe that if you wanna but I tell you this much
Riding on the train with no dough  sucks
Once again a case of your feet in my Nike's
If a crowd is in my realm I'm saying -- mic please
Hip-hop is living  can't yank the plug
If you do the result  will end up kind of bugged
Yo  I am not an invalid although
I used to smoke the weed out
Ali Shaheed Muhammad used to say I had to be out
Scheming on the cookies with the crazy booming back buns
Pushing on them real hard just so we can have the big fun
When I left for road  see  I was Boulevard status
Battling an MC was when Tip was at his maddest
It was one MC after one MC
What the world could they be wanting see from little old me
Do I have the formula to save the world?
Or was it just because I used to
Swipe the women and all the girls
I'm the type of brother with the crazy extended hand  kid
Dissed by all my brothers I was all up what my man did
Supposed to be my man
But now I wonder cause you're feeble
I go out with the strongies and I separate the evils
It's your brain against my mind  for those about to boot out
All you nasty critters even though you see I bug out
Buggin' out  buggin' out  buggin' out  you're buggin' out
Buggin' out  buggin' out  buggin' out  you're buggin' out
Buggin' out  buggin' out  buggin' out  you're buggin' out
Buggin' out  buggin' out  buggin' out  you're buggin' out
Buggin' out  buggin' out  buggin' out  you're buggin' out
Buggin' out  buggin' out  buggin' out  you're buggin' out
Buggin' out  buggin' out  buggin' out  you're buggin' out
1988 senior year at Garvey High
Where all the guys were corny but the girls were mad fly
Scoping out the honeys—they know who they are
Fly girl getting but never was I sweating
'Cause when it came to honeys I would go on a stroll
Until I met my match—her name was Flo
All the troopers 'round the way used to call her a ho
But deep down in my heart I knew that Flo was good to go
'Cause I thought it was me like Bell Biv Devoe
But little did I know that she was playing with my mind
The only thing I learned is good girls are hard to find
Not someone whose mind is blank and tryna juice me for my banks
Swinging with my main man Lucky behind my back
Well here comes Flo with the crazy whip appeal
And I'm all true man like Alexander O'Neal
After all this time trying to be a super ho

I remember when girls were goodie two shoes but now they turned to freaks
Slum village gold still dangling in your ear
You barely have a neck but still sporting a rope
Four-finger ring just so Phifer can scope
Yesterday your eyes were brown but today they are blue
Your whole appearance is a lie and it could never be true
And if you really liked yourself then you would try and be you
If you can't extend it then you might as well suspend it
If I wanted someone like you I would've swung with Jaime Sommers
Can I kick it? (Yes  you can!)
Can I kick it? (Yes  you can!)
Can I kick it? (Yes  you can!)
Can I kick it? (Yes  you can!)
Can I kick it? (Yes  you can!)
Can I kick it? (Yes  you can!)
Well  I'm gone (Go on then!)
Can I kick it? To all the people who can Quest like A Tribe does
Before this  did you really know what live was?
Comprehend to the track  for it's why cuz
Gettin measures on the tip of the vibe buzz
Rock and roll to the beat of the funk fuzz
Wipe your feet really good on the rhythm rug
If you feel the urge to freak  do the jitterbug
Come and spread your arms if you really need a hug
Afrocentric living is a big shrug
A life filled with fun that's what I love
A lower plateau is what we're above
If you diss us  we won't even think of
Will Nipper the doggy give a big shove?
This rhythm really fits like a snug glove
Like a box of positives it's a plus  love
As the Tribe flies high like a dove

Can I kick it? To my Tribe that flows in layers
Right now  Phife is a poem sayer
At times  I'm a studio conveyor
Mr. Dinkins  would you please be my mayor?
You'll be doing us a really big favor
Boy this track really has a lot of flavor
When it comes to rhythms  Quest is your savior
Follow us for the funky behavior
Make a note on the rhythm we gave ya
Do you like the garments that we wear?
I instruct you to be the obeyer
A rhythm recipe that you'll savor
Doesn't matter if you're minor or major
Yes  the Tribe of the game we're the player
As you inhale like a breath of fresh air
Uh  uh  uh  check the rhyme
Back in the days on the boulevard of Linden
We used to kick routines and the presence was fittin'
It was I  The Abstract
And me  the Five Footer
I kicks the mad style so step off the frankfurter
Yo  Phife  you remember that routine
That we used to make spiffy like Mr. Clean?
Um... um... a tidbit  um... a smidgen
I don't get the message so you gots to run the pigeon
You on point  Phife? All the time  Tip
You on point  Phife? All the time  Tip
Well  then grab the microphone and let your words rip
Now here's a funky introduction of how nice I am
Tell your mother  tell your father  send a telegram
I'm like an energizer 'cause  you see  I last long
My crew is never ever wack because we stand strong
Now if you say my style is wack  that's where you're dead wrong
I slayed that Buddy in El Segundo then Push it Along
You'd be a fool to reply that Phife is not the man
'Cause you know and I know that you know who I am
A special shout of peace goes out to all my pals  you see
And a middle finger goes for all you punk MC's
'Cause I love it when you wack MC's despise me
They get vexed  I roll next  can't none contest me
I'm just a fly MC who's five foot three and very brave
On top remaining  no home training 'cause I misbehave
I come correct in full effect have all my hoes in check
And before I get the butt  the Jim must be erect
You see  my aura's positive  I don't promote no junk
See  I'm far from a bully and I ain't a punk
Extremity in rhythm  yeah  that's what you heard
So just clean out your ears and just check the word

Back in the days on the boulevard of Linden
We used to kick routines and the presence was fittin'
It was I  the Phifer And me  the Abstract
The rhymes were so rumpin' that the brothers rode the 'zack
Aiyo Tip  do you recall when we used to rock What?
Those fly routines on your cousin's block?
Um  let me see... damn  I can't remember
I receive the message and you will play the sender
You on point Tip? All the time  Phife
You on point Tip? Yeah  all the time  Phife
You on point Tip? Yo  all the time  Phife
So play the resurrector and give the dead some life
Okay  if knowledge is the key  then just show me the lock
Got the scrawny legs but I move just like Lou Brock
With speed  I'm agile plus I'm worth your while
One hundred percent intelligent Black child
My optic presentation sizzles the retina
How far must you go to gain respect? Umm
Well  it's kinda simple  just remain your own
Or you'll be crazy  sad and alone
Industry rule number four-thousand-and-eighty
Record company people are shady
So kids  watch your back 'cause I think they smoke crack
I don't doubt it  look at how they act
Well  off to better things like a hip-hop forum
Pass me the rock and I'll score 'em with decorum
And proper  what you say  Hammer? Proper
Rap is not pop  if you call it that  then stop
NC  y'all check the rhyme y'all
SC  y'all check it out y'all
Virginia  check the rhyme y'all
Check it out  check it out
Just done mash a show  Dawg is off on sabbatical
Rather watch the Nixon shit than politicians politic
CNN and all this shit  gwaan yo  move with the fuckery
Trump and the SNL hilarity
Troublesome times kid  no times for comedy
Blood clot  you doing  bullshit you spewing
As if this country ain't already ruined
In lieu of these mumbling  fumbling
Swearing they're the greatest
Online they debate us  if we different  then we're haters
We ended our hiatus  the dogs looking for food
The nucleus is here now (ooo)
Toleration for devastation  got a hunger for sin
Every nation Obama nation  let the coroner in
Crooked faces  red and blue laces for the color of men
Just embrace it and die alone  song of Revelation
Reverends and cattles racing
Devils and demons and Deuteronomy
Fumigate our economy  'lluminate broken dreams
And manifest all insanity  look around

Status  Chris Paul and John Wall in the league
Grabbin' mics till the knuckles would bleed
('Cause I believe
The potent that I'm quoting will have you geeked like speed)
If rationale is naturale or a weave
It's all edges and peas
Settin' press  we on a permanent steeze
I'm in a world where my princess is Leia
And she's feeling my Vader
And my lure grows greater and greater
Chem trails  droppin' poisonous vapors
Have you shaking like Gator
Kappo Masa with a G to my waiter
You generational elitists
Have your chi in virtual think pieces
(See  these written words are poetical science
They're a major appliance)Leave a dent when drop with the flyness  fluent giant
Cool with some buyers
(Never no tattletales  only I don't knowers)
We a show me generation  show us what you gon' show us
Mouthpiece like Goines  with a jubilant noise
Dudes rude and as useless as coins  shoot 'em boys

Ego  ego skippin'  trippin' in my mind
Ego  ego
I got one  you got one  and now we equal
Sometimes it makes you trip out on your people
Sometimes it has connotations of evil
Sometimes niggas call on it when they need to
It's called the ego
Ay  it's hard to really make the subject positively stated
Some may hate it and some may overrate it
It's a top story and you rarely see a trend
So all you psychoanalysts  pull out your pad and pen
It's called the ego
Come up with an idea  and no one seems to get it
Then every time you mention it
They stare like you're two-headed
But one day  in your cubicle  your idea really comes to view
Your boss is walking by  he sees it too and he takes it from you
She put you on the aces of all the stripper places
And has the kinda clientele where niggas trick off very well
You beg her and you plead her and you tuck away your ego
She knows you need the chicken
And you know that she's your people
They call you fat and lazy  your commentary crazy
They photoshop your face on a box of McCormick gravy
And now that inner voice  that ego  making you get wavy
Change your diet  hit the gym
And say  What were you saying to me?
The ego makes you do it  it makes you face the music
Or run away from life so fast that you'll outsprint Carl Lewis
It has you think your deceptive ways of being are the truest
Had the prettiest brown eyes but you change them shits to the bluest
It's the ego

You need it when you're balling  equally when you're falling

Something that can make you feel stronger when people hate ya
Ego make you violent or govern like a tyrant
Or switch a dictionary's word from vibrant to vivrant
Fool the thirsty people  selling tap water in bottles
Fooled a girl with NYU scholarship and now she models
Ego has no ending  has people pretending
Religious zealots get jealous 'cause guys want their defending

Honey  check it out  you got me mesmerized

Street poetry is my everyday
But yo  I gotta stop when you trot my way
If I was workin' at the club  you would not pay
Ayo  my man Phife Diggy  he got somethin' to say
I like 'em brown  yellow  Puerto Rican or Haitian (Uh)
Name is Phife Dawg from the Zulu Nation
Told you in the jam that we can get down
Now let's knock the boots like the group H-Town
You got BBD all on your bedroom wall
But I'm above the rim and this is how I ball
A gritty little somethin' on the New York street
This is how I represent over this here beat
Talkin' 'bout you  yo  I took you out
But sex was on my mind for the whole damn route
My mind was in a frenzy and a horny state

Starin' at your dome-piece  very strong
Stronger than pride  stronger than Teflon
Take you on the Ave and you buy me links
Now I wanna pound the poontang until it stinks
You can be my mama and I'll be your boy
Original rude boy  never am I coy
You can be a shorty in my ill convoy
Not to come across as a thug or a hood (What?)
But hun  you got the goods like Madelyne Woods
By the way  my name's Malik  the Five-Foot Freak
Let's say we get together by the end of the week?
She simply said  No  labeled me a ho
I said  How you figure? My friends told me so
I hate when silly groupies wanna run they yap
Word to God  hun  I don't get down like that
I'll have you weak in the knees that you could hardly speak
Or we could do like Uncle L and swing an ep' in my Jeep
Keep it on the down  yo  we keep it discreet
See  I'm not the type of kid to have my biz in the streets
If my mom don't approve  then I'll just elope
Let me save the little man from inside the boat
Let me hit it from the back  girl  I won't catch a hernia
Bust off on your couch  now you got Seaman's Furniture
Shaheed  Phife  and the Extra P
Stacy Beadle  PJ  and my man LG
They know the Abstract is really soul on ice
The character is of men  never ever of mice
Shorty  let me tell you 'bout my only vice
It has to do with lots of lovin' and it ain't nothin' nice
Relax yourself  girl  please settle down (It ain't nothin' nice)
Relax yourself  girl  please settle down (It ain't nothin' nice)

Acknowledge that I got it and you love it when I bring it

Before I had status and before I had a pager
You could find the Abstract listenin' to hip-hop
Way that Bobby Brown is just amping like Michael
Still got room on the truckload of black boom
Delivering each year an LP filled with street goods
You can find it on your rack in your record store
If you diss—it gets drastic
Only if you are noted as my man
'Cause we gotta strive for longevity

Until it can be recharted for its own destiny
Time is an inanimate object paying and paying and paying for no justification for belief
We gotta be a winner all the time
Can't fall prey to a hip-hop crime
With the dope raps and dope tracks we move blocks
From the fly girlies to the hardest of the rocks
We on these excursions so you must realize
So what can you do in the times which exist
You can't fake moves on your brother or your sis
Leave 'em both alone and continue with your work
Whatever it may be in today's society
You must be honest and true to the next
Don't be phony and expect one not to flex
So listen to the knowledge being dropped over beats
They could get you hooked like a crackhead junkie
What you gotta do is know the Tribe is in the sphere
We gotta make moves
We gotta make moves
We gotta make moves
We gotta make moves

Listen up money or should I say honey
But some try to make it look like Adam and Steve
I couldn't believe when I found out he was funny
You know fierce with just his right ear pierced
Walking in the ville with them long dreadlocks
Oh my God how gross can one be
Used to be down with the crew and had the girls that were def
So Lord J being that you go next
Pull the rest of his card cause I'm vexed
My man George got a germ that's ill
Suffering from terminal scag
But never ever getting caught walking like a fag
That's not his bag cause the plague was afraid to parade in drag
Cause honey's on his dick but money won't swell
He'd rather call Manuel for a little duel
Have a swordfight with tools
He's wounded and I can't understand
Why a man would want to be a weak cipher man
I thought the plan was to be hard as a rock

My man George I thought he was on base
Find out later that he was a closet case
George was down with the titty titty bang bang
Even fooled around with his mom's lingerie
Even wore a dress and on his face he had swine
Couldn't wait for gay parade so you can drag it
George better get a grip
Now Georgie used to run with the ill brothers
That he always kept tucked and filled with the slugs
Now watch how money bugs
Weight fell it's hard to tell but believe me George has slid
Coming out the closet was the dress that he hid
From the boys when we was over there I seen it out the corner of my eye
I said damn Georgie George signify
The whole crew seen it now the whole block knows
That George gets his kicks from wearing Wisdom's clothes
Now Georgie Porgie pudding pie
Won't play basketball cause your nails ain't dry
Call me homophobic but I know it and you know it
You're filthy and funny to the utmost exponent
So run and hide your salami
Yes it's the Abstract the info provider

There's a million MCs that claim they want some
But see  I create sounds that make your ears go numb
Peace to Sayres Ave  yeah  you know how we go
My best friend Steven at the Home Depot
Laurelton is in the house  I can't forget Southside
Walk past MCs like that girl did to Pharcyde
I'm labeled as the cat's meow  the MC with the know-how
Act like you know  not now  but right now
Beast of the East  on MCs  I have a feast
I'd eat that ass like quiche  crack a smile like Shanice
Straight out Jamaica  seen? Jamaica  Queens
But you could find me out in Georgia or anywhere in between
Now  if my partners don't look good  Malik won't look good
If Malik don't look good  the Quest won't look good
If the Quest don't look good  then Queens won't look good
But since the sounds are universal  New York won't look good
Picture Phife losin' a battle  come on  get off it
Put down the microphone  son  surrender  forfeit
Did I hear somethin' 'bout a crew? What they wanna do?
You better call Mr. Babyface  so he can bring out the cool in you
Or it'll be a sad love song bein' sung by Toni Braxton
And I'll dissect you like a fraction
Oh  you wannabe top cat MCs? I'll pop you like a zit
You wanna be the champ? You're more like Chief Some-shit
Big up myself every time when it comes to this
MCs be runnin' scared as if they watchin' The Exorcist
I kick more game than a crackhead from Hempstead
My styles are milk  man  you'd think that I was breast-fed
You know the steelo when the diggy-Dawg is on the scene
I dedicate this to all the MCs outta Queens
That goes for Onyx  LL  Run DMC
Akinyele  Nasty Nas  and the Extra P
You peep the chart straight up and down  man  there ain't no other
'Nough respect to all my peeps that made the album cover
Yo  Tip  don't worry none  you know I get the party jumpin'

So recognize me  kids  memorize me
Every day  I be scroungin'  rarely  I be loungin'
I play the down-low  very  very incognito
Aries is my sign  I know that I can rhyme
Sometimes  I rhyme in riddles  plus I make the honeys wiggle
Intellect is the major  some heads like to wager
The skills on the hill  overlookin' dollar bills
Man  you're crazy  thinkin' you can phase me
The Ab' doesn't study mere nonsense  money
Life seems to need me  MCs seem too cheesy
With they doody-ass renditions of defeatin' competition
I rock to the roll  man  yes  I'm a soul man
Bet your bottom dollar Vinia will make ya holla
As you stand at attention  did I forget to mention?
MCs will give me twenty if I sense that they act funny
Lyrics are abundant  right there  I sound redundant
Just mentionin' the fact that the area is phat
I dwell in the under  so honey  it's no wonder
That I get plenty of tail  well  I even get white
I'ma bet hittin' head crack  there  money  take that
Breakin' niggas off  cut the bank  then I'm off
While my Nikes match my Lo hat  beat joint is mad phat
Got the cutter of the box if a kid think he's ox

If you step to this then the plot just thickens

My mother went away for a month-long trip
Her and some friends on an ocean liner ship
She made a big mistake by leaving me home
I had to roam so I picked up the phone
Dialed Ali up to see what was going down
Told him I pick him up so we could drive around
My mother left a yard but I needed one more
Shaheed had me covered with a hundred greenbacks
So we left Brooklyn and we made big tracks
Ali laid in the back so he can get rest
Drove down the road for two-days-and-a-half
The sun had just risen on a dusty path
Just then a figure had caught my eye
A man with a sombrero who was 4 feet high
I pulled over to ask where we was at
His index finger he tipped up his hat
He said a mile south there's a fast food station

Anyway a gas station we passed
We got gas and went on to get grub
It was a nice little pub in the middle of nowhere
Anywhere would have been better
I ordered enchiladas and I ate 'em
Ali had the fruit punch
When we finished we thought for ways to get back
I had a hunch
Pulled out the wallet and I saw this wicked beautiful lady
She was a waitress there
Put the wallet down and stared and stared
I checked for keys and started to step
I feel bad but he makes me feel badder
Jetting on down at the speed of sound
Three days coming and three more going
We get back and there was no slack
Hopped in the car and torped' to the shack
'Cause I left my wallet in El Segundo
I left my wallet in El Segundo
I left my wallet in El Segundo

We got the jazz  we got the jazz
We got the jazz  we got the jazz
We got the jazz  we got the jazz
Stern firm and young with a laid-back tongue
The aim is to succeed and achieve at 21
Just like Ringling Brothers  I'll daze and astound
Captivate the mass 'cause the prose was profound
Do it for the strong  we do it for the meek
The rave of the town to your foes and your friends
Don't deserve the gong  don't deserve the praise
The tranquility will make you unball your fist
For we put Hip Hop on a brand new twist
A brand new twist with a whole heap of mystic
So low-key that you probably missed it
And yet it's so loud that it stands in the crowd
When the guy takes the beat  they bowed
So raise up squire  adjust your attire
We have no time to wallow in the mire
If you're on a foreign path  then let me do the lead
Join in the essence of the cool-out breed
Then cool out to the music 'cause it makes you feel serene
With the birds and the bees and all those groovy things
Like getting stomach aches when you gotta go to work
Or staring into space when you're feeling berserk
I don't really mind if it's over your head
'Cause the job of resurrectors is to wake up the dead
So pay attention  it's not hard to decipher
And after the horns  you can check out the Phifer

How's about that  it seems like it's my turn again
All through the years my mic has been my best friend
I know some brothers wonder  can Phife really kick it?
Some even wanna diss me  but why sweat it?
I'm all into my music cos it's how I make papes
Try to make hits  like Kid Capri makes tapes
Me sweat another? I do my own thing
Strictly hardcore tracks  not a new jack swing
I grew up as a Christian so to Jah I give thanks
Collect my banks  listen to Shabba Ranks
It's 1991 and I refuse to come wack
I take off my hat to other crews that tend to rock
But The Low End Theory's here  it's time to wreck shop
I got Tip and Shah (huh)  so whom shall I fear? (Word)
Stop look and listen  but please don't stare (uh)
So jet to the store  and buy the LP (yeah)
On Jive/RCA  cassettes and CD's
Produced and arranged by the four-man crew
Make sure you have a system with some fat house speakers (Yeah)
So the new shit can rock (Uh)  from Bronx to Massapequa (Uh)
'Cause where I come from quality is job one
And everybody up on Linden know we get the job done
So peace to that crew (Yeah)  and peace to this crew (Yeah)
Bring on the tour  we'll see you at a theater nearest you
Please let the Abstract embellish on the cut
Back and forth just like a Cameo song
If you dig this joint then please come dance along
To the music 'cause it's done just for the mind
Now I gotta scat and get mine  underline
The jazz  the what? The jazz can move that ass
For the Tribe originates that feeling of pizzazz
It's the universal sound  bless the brothers on the ground
And the ones six below  you didn't have to go
Some say that I'm eccentric 'cause I once had an orgy
And sometimes for breakfast I eat grits and porgies
(What's  wrong?) Now check it out
All my peoples in Queens ya don't stop
Now all my peoples in Brooklyn ya don't stop
And all my peoples uptown ya don't stop
That includes the Bronx and Harlem ya don't stop

I said because Ladies First ya don't stop
And to the JB's  ya don't stop
And De La Soul  ya don't stop
To my Brand Nubians ya don't stop
And to my Leaders of the New ya don't stop
To my man Large Professor ya don't stop
Pete Rock for the beat ya don't stop
Everybody in the place ya don't stop
And last but not least on the sure shot
Yo  that's the sound when MCs get mopped
Don't come around town without the hip in ya hop
'Cause when the shit hits the fan  that ass'll get dropped
MCs wanna attack me  but them punks can't cope
I'll have you left without a job like Isaac from The Love Boat
Battlin' MCs from JFK to Russia
Do a US tour for three months  and then I chill
Styles be phat like Jackie Gleason  the rest be Art Carney
People love the Dawg like the kids love Barney
I love you  you love me
The shorty Phife Dawg is your favorite MC
The Tribe is good for your health like a can of Nutrament
MCs don't have no wins  MCs don't have no bitches
I flip shit crazier than a busload full of Jerry's Kids
Your crew don't want it  and your crew don't want it

I'm up in the gulley  that's when I am her buddy
Filled up the hole like spackle or I mean putty
When we over joints like this  we never cruddy
Check it out  'cause my conception is immaculate
A bachelor lookin' for a bachelorette
Back to you MCs  this is what you gonna get
A first-degree burn from my man Ken's cigarette
I hope you like Marlboro
Paul  you know we thorough like Denver
The beat feels like a never-ender
But all things good must  so I won't sweat it
Drop the seeds for the youthful crew  I hope you get it
As I stand  grip this mic inside my hand
Boy  I'll smack you up like I was your old gran
Once again  the Ab' is who you think of
On the country once again  here to win
I'm Uptown chillin'  takin' in this Grandmaster Vic blend
From the projects  the PJs
Fuck them two DJ's
Self mission  I had her in the ill position
As I proceed with what you need like Akinyele
A whip looks complete when the tires say Pirelli
There's eight million stories in the city  it's a pity
Don't fuck with the skins if she's tryin' to act shitty
Big shout to the Guru  Primo and Zulu Nation
Was on a vacation in the ghetto
Rapper Nas on top  it seems we gonna rock it
Just forgot to call you back  simple as that
I ain't no almanac  so lick my dictionary
I might just call a cab 'cause I dig canary
Yellow accents on a dark bitch
I met her back when she kept all her carpet
I'm well aware all that shit is fantasy
I double dare y'all to fuck your plan B
That's demeanor  momma's mannerisms
Hoes in this bitch like a box of donuts
It's cold out in this bitch  standing on the corner

I pour out some liquor on a cop's grave
Mmm  digital church bells

To have visions of getting chicken while my friends get jel
And I dream of when I'm sixteen  I'm out my home

Feel like I'm hungry now again
And I can't do nothing about it because my teeth are all rotted
And my mom and my pop  they just grin
And empathize with me 'cause they were little like Pygmies
But too bad they can't get back they 'member whens
Them grown-up stories don't work
In the court of the kiddies'  the judgement is in
And while y'all doing all y'all your bids  y'all reminisce as kids
They stood on the corner
Like you once upon a  time
And probably felt like a loner
And smelled like a stoner  and snuck to Daytona
So when they questioning you 'bout who or who you ain't boning
Complaining that you always moaning
Never saying good morning
Storming out my house
And slamming doors like you paying bills
They been through it too  though
They were kids like you  though
But what if they knew though
And hit you with the cheat code
To a game you just start playing  no extra man
Leave you reckless on the court
With no high percentage shot
Yeah  it look a little different on a yacht
But ain't gon' lie  I miss kayaking
Like a bunch of retired tired thespians  a bit too salty
They don't play no more  probably

Now  in the time when niggas wasn’t supposed to be born
Best of us are left for dead in cities that looks war-torn
Vietnam going wrong  heroin going strong
Neighbors would whoop that bad ass
Just for running through their lawn
Walt met Cheryl  Cheryl met Walt
Trinidadian love sprouting through the asphalt
Love was consummated and the angels registrated
Two were to be born but only one of 'em made it
Inside a cloud of sorrow  a silver lining and joy
It’s a bouncing baby boy  a king’s name they would employ
And before he even squeaks  it’s decided it’s Malik
Now give him hope  give him care
Raise him while his grandma there
Watch out momma  if you stare
Light brown eyes'll keep you there
Let’s progress the story just a little bit
Malik  I would treat you like little brother that would give you fits
Sometimes overbearing though I thought it was for your benefit
Despite all the spats and shits cinematically documented
Rhymes we would write it out  hard times fight it out
Gave grace face to face  made it right

Heart of a largest lion trapped inside the little dude
Took me quick to granny house  now we eat the curry food
Brand new pair of Nike Airs  avenue of sairs
Mailbox mayors  all our rhymes was written there
A nigga wanna battle  you know Phifey didn’t care
Jarobi with the beat  into new ass we tear
I’mma flash forward well  took a trip to ATL
Cooking in the kitchen making sure my nigga eating well
Wedding in Tobago  you know exactly where I’m at
Standing on the side of black Malik Izaak
Have you ever loved somebody?
Way before you got to dream?
No more crying  he’s in sunshine
He’s alright now  see his wings

Listen very close 'cause I don't like to boast
Instead  I'll tell the tale of a French who prevailed
Through the Mr. Crazy Rabbits who were always on his tail
We ain't on sale  your rumor starts to wail
Get caught with stolen goods and you will go to jail
If you go to jail  then who will pay the bail?
Deport you back to France on a ship with a sail
Escargot  Lucien  you eat snails
(Hey yo Tip  what's wrong with snails?)
From the Zulu nation  from a town called Paris
Came to America to find liberty
Instead of finding pleasure  all you found was misery
But listen  Lucien  you have a friend in me
Oh  luck-luck will drive your butt batty
Next time you get some wheels  make it a Caddy
In terms of doing good  I know you wish you really could
But listen  brother man  I really think you can
Succeed with the breed of the brothers on your back
It's the creme de la creme  and you can vouch for that
It'll take a minute  rice  so take my advice
Trust in us  and thus you trust in your life
Lucien  Lucien  Lucien  Lucien
You should know!

- What? Oh Tip  man  why you do that to me  man?

Oh  why you do that to me?
I wouldn't do it like this

Yo  it's  it to my

Voulez-vous? (vous)
Rendez-vous (vous)
Coucou (cou)
Les poupous (pou)
Watch that lass  gonna backlash fast
Can you get a grip on the crackhead dip?
Sold you a paper bag  guess he saw you comin'
VCR from a neck-bone bummin'
$10 brother  he was hummin' and strummin'
Only had 20  he was livin' like ya slummin'
Gave him the money  well  I thought that was somethin'
Lookin' like a kid who was lost in crumbin'
Don't worry about a thing  I won't get specific
This is a song that is long and prolific
Think of the stuff that I said if you can
Figure it out  compute  understand
No problemo  I'll help you with your demo
If you go to the store for me
Lucien  I'm just kiddin'
You should know!
- Hey  yo  wassup' man? What's your name?
- What kind of accent is that?
- It's a french accent  you know  I'm french  I'm from France  don't you think it's sexy?
- No  it's not a sexy accent
You gotta get a grip on the missions you'll be takin'
Not so much the mission  but you got crazy ignition
Sure  the sugar-babies wanna give you a chance
With the French savoir faire and the sexy glance
But is she really fly  or is she a guy?
I won't ask why  'cause I know that you try
You try too hard  is that the answer to the riddle?
Instead of doin' so much  why don't you do just a little?
Boy  what a cad  I guess we shouldn't treat him bad
In fact  it would be nice if we understood him  right?
A case of positionin' the feet in the shoes
Sympathetic reason in the case of the blues
Lucien is blue  even though he's really brown
I had to make the sound  his life is too profound
On the up-and-up  he's somethin' like a little pup
Young and naive  it's hard to believe
As long as you're strong  you can quest with the Questers
Jolly like a jumping bean or a jester
Lucien  Lucien  Lucien  Lucien
You should know!
Oh Tip  everything  you gonna be alright  man
Thank you  I should listen to you  man
I think I'll going home  man
Bye-bye  I'll see you tonight
And every brother ain't a brother but (they don't know)
Pop melatonin like they Swedish Fish (they don't know)
To give her everything's my dying wish (they don't know)
Get rid of this tense and makes life make sense
As I come off the fence and break through defense
Anxiety is on the ropes and it's gettin' intense
Population gettin' tired now (they don't know)
Everybody wants inspired now (they don't know)
Racist emails fire out (they don't know)
The world is crazy and I cannot sleep but (they don't know)

The sun'll still shine
But the night is on my mind
So parlay while I drop this rhyme
There's activities a-plenty in the nighttime (Nighttime)
Shorty see the action and then start to mimic
Scared money don't make none
Hits the local bodega to wolf down a gyro
Son is on a midnight run like De Niro
Spots a shorty rock standin' on his block
Conversation that he kicked to the shorty was a sly one
About mind upliftment and bein' positive
He yawned and he sighed 'til 1:05
Then he finally realized the honey wasn't live
At least he didn't plan on buildin' for the evening
Came out on the scene as he told her to beep him
Saw his man Stan with the blunt in his hand
Brothers gettin' lost in the weed satisfaction
You would swear Redman was inside the truck
They interrupt your cipher and crush your blunt
Why in the hell does 10-4 keep frontin'?
You push to the park even though it's still dark

The flavas on the top with the rugged beat to back it
The night makes the aura and the jake can't hack it
The way the moon dangles in the midnight sky
Serenity and silence of the sounds and emotions
In the concrete jungle when the sun don't bungle
I think it's hard to find the words on how I feel
I paid about a deuce-twenty for the Ampex steel
The night is on my mind
The night is on my mind
The night is on my mind

Dream about Bugattis and other four-wheels

Is how my lawyer got me to avoid a raw deal
And now it's more real than it is for any other star
And that's enough to have you tearing up the mini-bar
I should probably get awards where the Emmys are
For how I deal with the pap like Remy Ma

But critics still continue to plaster
My name and discredit my fame
All that shit is game and I don't really give a damn
Eat from the tree of life and throw away the verbal ham

Don't be alarmed  the rhyme was condensed in
A matter of minutes so it must be told
All that glitters not gold
Everybody wants a deal  help me make a demo
See my name in bright lights  ride around in a limo
My moms keeps beefin' (Boy  get a job)
But I wanna make jams  damn  I know I'll slam

You gotta get a label that's willing and able
To market and promote  and you better hope

Is urging me to be myself  but never follow someone else
Because opinions are like voices  we all have a different kind
So just clean out all of your ears  these are my views and you will find
That we revolutionize over the kick and the snare
The ghetto vocalist is on a statewide tear (Tear)
Soon to be the continent and then the freaking globe
There's room for it all (All) as we mingle at the ball (Ball)
We welcome competition 'cause it doesn't make one lazy or worn
We gotta work hard  you know the damn card (Card)
Try to be the phattest is the level that we strive

Hey  sucka nigga  whoever you are (Including my vocals)

What ya figure? Rhyme-wise  I do the figure-eight so concisely
Musically  we are the herb  so sit back and light me
Inhale
My style is kinda phat  reminiscent of a whale
Young girls' desires  older females' dreams
I be the Abstract Poetic representin' from Queens
If you came to the jam  well  I'm glad you came
See  nigga first was used back in the Deep South
Fallin' out between the dome of the white man's mouth
It means that we will never grow  you know the word  dummy
Upper niggas in the community think it's crummy
But I don't  neither does the youth 'cause we em-
​​brace adversity  it goes right with the race
And bein' that we use it as a term of endearment
Niggas start to bug  to the dome is where the fear went
Now the little shorties say it all of the time
And a whole bunch of niggas throw the word in they rhyme
Yo  I start to flinch as I try not to say it
But my lips is like a oowop as I start to spray it
My lips is like a oowop as I start to spray it

I respect that crazily
This ain't a joint to disrespect you
'Cause L7 squares always making my shit list
Spring is in the air and all the flowers are blooming
The powers that be wanna devour the movement
Tears disappear when they fall on the summer rain
Bleedin' through this mic  but they call it entertainment
Running across stages is a drug
Is like a blunt that we crumble in raw papers
Call it the lord’s name 'cause we taking it in our veins
Like the feeding us intravenous
It’s war and we fighting for inches and millimeters
They try to stall the progress by killing off all the leaders
If we don’t give them martyrs no more  they can’t defeat us

Or they're dormant for the moment
Helps us actualize the actual greatness held within
Been on the wrong team so much  can’t recognize a win
Seems like my only crime is having melanin
Connection to the sun so strong the relationship is lusted for
Causes men to suffocate  I can’t breathe no more

All about a kid  who couldn't rap and didn't run
Stands on the side when the mic is getting dumb
Resorts to bagging Billy  asking could he have some
No never ever  go back and try again man
If you come back  I'll be the first to shake your hand
Competition's good  it brings out the vital parts

Dark skinned  walk with a bot portrayed villain
