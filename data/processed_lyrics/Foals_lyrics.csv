lyrics
"With my wings all bound and twisted into one
When I fall like a diamond  I'm coal again
Drip through the sky into the infrared
When I fall like a leaf from an autumn tree
Dancing at 10 000 feet  come and catch me
When I fall through the fire  into the void again
Ooh  I'll burn all the liars  burn all the liars
Cold black water rushing in
Fall on the fire just to start again
Cool green water  come and mend
Burning star about to come again
Ooh  when I burn with a fever into the quiet ether
Come and mend me  come in quiet  come in care
When I'm cut like a diamond  I'm coal again
Turn me into a wedding ring that you can wear
When I fall like a leaf from an autumn tree
Come and dance at 10 000 feet with me
Cold black diamond  shine again
Fall on the fire just to start again
Burning star about to come again
Cool green water  come and mend

Lost in the sugar rush  violet sky
Beachside candy cane  blue tongues in summer rain
Oh my God!
Brighton rock!
Oh  now the sun is up  eyes like the sky
Lost in a sugar rush  violet high
No need for novocaine  blue tongues in summer rain
Oh my God!
Brighton rock!
I've been waiting all day inside
Waiting for a summer sky
When we run wild  we'll come up for air and go under again

I've been waiting all day inside (Inside)
Waiting for the summer sky
Forever below and when we go under we'll come up for air
I've been waiting all day inside (Inside)
Waiting for that summer sky
When we run wild  we'll come up for air and go under again
But I can't sleep alone again
And it's 2am again
But I can't sleep alone again
That I can't reignite again
I know that it's all over when we go
When we go our way
But I hoped that we'd be stronger
But I sleep alone again
But I never knew when to end
But now you'vе gone again
And it's 2am again

Wе know that it's all over when we go

But I hoped that we'd be stronger
It's the nights
When I keep you in my mind
That I hoped that I'd be fine
But I've started showing signs
Of another late night
Of another night time
When I keep you in my mind
But I've started showing signs
Of another late night
Of another night time
Would you be my guide? Take me by my side
The things I said then
 but we'll be just fine
 it'll come but we'll be just fine
 be well spoken
 the future is colder
 I'll be just fine
 but we'll outrun it
 what came of the things we once believed?
 all lost to the depths of a hungry sea
 what came of the things we once believed?
 all lost to the depths of a hungry sea
 but it's just a token
 please pause the future
 but we'll outrun it
 what came of the things we once believed?
 all lost to the depths of a hungry sea
 what came of the things I once believed?
 all lost to the depths of a hungry sea
 but I'll be just fine
 what came of the things we once believed?
 all lost to the depths of a hungry sea
 all lost to the depths of a hungry sea
 all that's left
 long gone
 all that is left
Around your neck
You got a hundred broken lightbulbs above your head
They said that you had it coming but I wouldn't bet
Cause you got a slowly ticking time bomb and then you see red
Sunblind
Sunblind
You got an albatross around your neck
Around your neck
You got a pile of broken wishbones under your bed
And you got a hungry green eyed monster that you keep fed
And it keeps on coming over it wants you dead
Sunblind
Sunblind
You burnt the lungs
That your ancestors created
You sat by the banks
Of the river and you waited
Till time rolled back
And the water had abated
You drank your share
But you still could not be sated
Quicksands of the mind
And the sinkholes you may find
When you look through
The twisting of the vines
(The twisting of the vines)

Time comes round again
It's etching at your bones
Chill wind comes round
It's blowing through your home
Quicksands of the mind
And the sinkholes you may find

You burnt the lungs
That your ancestors created
You sat by the banks
Of the river and you waited
Till time rolled back
And the water had abated
You drank your share
But you still could not be sated
You said you're scared
Of the clocks that keep ticking over
We'll find a way
For a life that's worth living over
Again and again
For a life that's worth living over
Again and again
For a life that's worth living over
Again and again
Again and again and again
Again again
You've fallen again
The way I fell before
'Cause I'm a bad loser
When you get your way
And I know that I'm chained
I'm chained again
And you've lost your way
Bed that I once made
'Cause I'm a bad habit
One you cannot shake
And I hope that I change
Don't follow me
Don't follow me
'Cause if I go
Where the flowers grow
Into the deep below
Still small
Small voice of calm
It's the blame into my arms

Wash the stains away
'Cause I made my mistakes
And I feel something's changed
And I know what's at stake
Wash the stains away
'Cause if I go
Where the flowers grow
Into the deep below
And if I could
Take the pain away
Wash the stains away
I made my mistakes
And I feel something's changed
Wash the stains away
I left a long time ago
And we lost touch
Grew apart my friend
My heart's an old pole dancer
It's a subway chancer
A question with no answer
Come meet me by the river
See how time it flows
I'll meet you by the river
See how time it flows
And when we age
Shed our skin and grow
We shed our layers
Spread our wings and go
My heart's an old black panther
It's a troubled romancer
A question with no answer

I got two nights in a row
With a black bull in tow
I’m in that holy ghost zone
I got a trunk full of gold
Don't look at me like that
Don't look at me like this
Ooh
Can you remember my name?
I swear you’re all just the same
In a foreshortened future
I saw you drinking kombucha
And it really don't suit ya
And I'm not the waiter
Ooh
We not playing around
I got a black bull in town

Who me? I'm not aloof

And I'm a world away
’Cause I’m a man of today
He not playing around
The black bull's in town
The black bull’s in town
Top of the world  bottom of the ocean
They built you up then broke you down again (then broke you down again)
So now you hope to be pacific
'Cause the future is not what you've seen
It's not where you've been to at all
The future is not what you've seen
It's not where you've been to at all
The future is not what it used to be  used to be
The future is not what it used to be  used to be
Top of the world  bottom of the ocean
Top of the world  bottom of the ocean
They lit you up and found the ground again (and found the ground again)
So now you know to be pacific
'Cause the future is not what you've seen
It's not where you've been to at all
The future is not what you've seen
It's not where you've been to at all

Now that spring is finally here
Your hollow heart  your hollow heart
Drive through the forest and into the night
Away from the city  away from the light
And we're worlds apart

They gouge you out  they dug you in
They took the name right out of your mouth
Worlds apart

I think it's my own
We can go down to the streets
And follow the shoals
Of all the people
We could be two
But I bite my nails to the quick
And run back home
You got blue blood on your hands
I know it's my own
You came at me in the midnight
To show me my soul
Of all the people
I hoped it'd be you
And show me my home
Where I was born
Where I belong
You got blue blood on your hands

Show me my way back home
To where I was born

And I ride white horses on hills
I long for you
All through bleeding June
Will I reach silent seas?
I wait on the white hills
In ropes that unwind
So what (So what?) does life loan you again?
A long time
Salt-eyed starless nights
 these daydreams  these daydreams  okay
 an accident  Cassius  an accident

 it's over  Cassius  away

Broken records  slightly out of reach
Are you dreaming  dreaming about the spires
Back then before there were crossed wires?
Are you longing  hands up in the air?
Broken flowers twisting in your hair
Are you dreaming  dreaming about the time
Way back when before you crossed the line?
You cut and run
You cut and run
You cut and run
I am the one
Empty rooms  dancing on your own
Broken flowers from a broken home
Are you dreaming  dreaming about the time
Way back when before you crossed the line?
Thought I saw ya  dancing with tired feet
Longing hours  records on repeat
Are you dreaming  dreaming about the spires
Back then before there were crossed wires?

So you don't come back around this town
Always causing trouble or just fooling 'round
'Cause there's always something in the way
Your final call
An empty morgue with gurning hearts
Hollowed crowns
And all I see is marching bands
Is marching bands
In broken stands
Butcher birds with useless throats
With useless throats
We're not safe of dying kings
With plastic knives
It's just another hospital
It's just another hospital
It's just another hospital
It's just another hospital
It's just another hospital
Captains made with metal tags
Flags brought down of hollowed crowns
It's everything without a time

Laid to rest in broken stands
Butcher birds will fly away
This is not a warning call
Your final shot
All I see is butcher birds
It's just another hospital
It's just another hospital
But they say it's a lie
There's no birds left to fly
We'll hide out
Houses underground
The flowers upside down
In our dreams
In the eye of the storm
The land where you were born
Try to make no sound
We hide out
'Cause they watch us in sleep
The language that we speak
And the secrets that we keep
I said I'm so sorry
To have kept you waiting around
I wish I could've come up
I could've shouted out loud
They got exits covered
All the exits underground
I wish I could figure it out
But the world's upside down
In a world upside down

In the islands of the mind
The places they can't find
We'll hide out
And the black sky came down
And the cities underground
The flowers upside down

To pass you on the stairs

In my dreams
'Cause they watch us in sleep
And the language that we speak
And the secrets that we keep
I said I'm so sorry
To have kept you waiting around
I wish I could've come up
I could've shouted out loud
They got exits covered
All the exits underground
I wish I could figure it out
But the world's upside down
I said I'm so sorry
That the world has fallen down
I wish I could do something more
I could shout it out loud
They got exits covered
All the exits underground
I wish I could figure it out
But the world's upside down
In a world upside down

We share all of our dreams into the screen but not with each other
We share all of our dreams into the screen but not with each other
Give me the red light turning green
Give me the words but not the page
Give me it all
Give me the time but not an age
Give me a look but not the rage
Give me the feel for where I'll go
Give me it all
Give me the way it could have been
Give me the ghost that's on the screen
Give me the way but not the means
Give me it all
Give me something I haven't seen
Give me the red light turning green
Give me the words but not the page
Give me it all
I called you up three times last night
You caught the bus and I caught the train
All that remains are words in the rain

Give me the shade of a thunder cloud
Give me a good-bye said out loud
Give me the day with no memory

I know you could be here with me
By the rain and the palm of the valley
But you're there by the tube stop in the freezing rain
You caught the bus and I caught the train
I see you there
You fall like a fifty weight
The time goes
I'll be right there
Oh-woah-woah
I lose you in degrees
See you through the glass doors
I’ve looked all up and down now
I lose you in degrees
Come back around my way again
See me if you please
I'm tongue tied in silence
My words lost on the breeze
Caught up in your orbit still
Release me if you please
I lose you in degrees
Don't leave me on my knees
I lose you in degrees
Don’t leave me on my knees
I lose you in degrees
Don't leave me on my knees
I lose you in degrees
Don't leave me on my knees
I saw the black rain pouring
A lost love on display
Bit by bit and day by day
I know we've lost our way
And I hear your final footsteps
I've lost you by degrees
Pressed up to the glass door
I couldn't watch you leave

Around again
I waste my days

You're make-believe
It's lock 'n' load
It's a dead end road
For you and me
And I'm rusted gold
I'm stripped and sold
I'm make believe
And I'm up for rent
My head is spent
I guarantee
So can you not go away
If just for one day?

How do you feel now in a war?
War sends out for you

The hedges are on fire in the country lanes
And all I want to do is get out of the rain
My daughter's asleep in the garden
The leaves are on fire in the country lanes
And all I want to do is get out of the rain
I’m done with the world and it’s done with me
All I wanna do is get up and leave
Sun falls into the garden
Someone I could count
To pull me to my feet again
When I was in doubt
Oh now Mama  do you hear me?
Calling out your name
Oh now Mama  do you hear me?
Calling out your name

Now I'm the last cowboy in this town
Empty veins and my plastic broken crown

They said I once was lost but now I'm truly found

Oh now Mama  do you hear my fear?

How 'bout you?
I've been in the air for hours
Meteor showers by the pool
So one last drink for summer
Come back to London thunder
The sound has sorrowed in my room
Ye-yeah
I look for something else to hold on to
There's no way to realign
Lost my mind in San Francisco
Worn out disco when tempers cooled
There's no water
There is no sound
Will you come around?
Will you come around?
There is no space
There is no time
Where to draw the line?

It's a new day
Why must it be the same?
Will I see you? I got lost in foreign lands
It's a new year

You're my compass and my sea
And I know you're still with me
You're my compass and my sea
Oh  I hope you can hear me
All those million miles away  you'd stay
'Cause I'd love you dearly
All those billion miles away
'Cause I've been around two times
And found that you're the only thing I need

Green broken glass ocean
No map and no message
It's the deepest green I know (Oh  oh)
But I know you're still with me
You're my compass and my sea (Oh  oh)

Black dogs running through the fields  they're dripping red
The world is quiet and there's nothing left unsaid
A million image  million caption  million dead
And all the birds fall out of the sky in two by twos
And my teeth fall out my head into the snow
I am you now and you are me instead
Then I see you with blood on your weddin' dress
And all of the old walk down and I'm feeling unsure
When I see you in my own place when I'm not home
It is perfect  it's beautiful and still
And it is silent  it is white and it is good
And all 'bout the fallin' round with daisy chains in our hair
I walked out of the past
You were riding on a black horse
To sing songs at the table again
I walked into the desert
I walked into the dawn
You came to me on a black horse
To remind me of all I've said and done
When I roam
When I roam
When I roam
I see it more and more each day
Whether I go or when I stay
I see a mountain at my gates
I see it more and more each day
I see a fire out by the lake
I'll drive my car without the brakes
I see a mountain in my way
It's looming larger by the day
I see a darkness in my fate
I'll drive my car without the brakes
Show me the foothold from which I can climb
You show me a signpost for where I should go
I see a mountain at my gates
I see it more and more each day
And my desire wears a dark dress

Show me the foothold from which I can climb

Fire lake and far flame
Go now but come again
Dark clouds gather 'round
Will I run or stand my ground?
Show me the mountain so far behind
Its shadow gets smaller day after day
Gimme my love
Gimme my choice
You keep me coming around
Will I stay?
Gimme my lungs
Gimme my voice
You keep me coming around
Gimme my lungs
Will I stay?
Gimme my lungs
Gimme my choice
But we don't need each other now
We don't need the city
The creed or the culture now
I feel the streets are not pulling me down
So people of the city
I don't need your counsel now

The creed or the culture now
Now
From the white wards of England
The crows line the rivers and roads
I wanna walk where I know
Through the olive groves
The sky that knows my name
It gave me away
The magnolia moon
Like an eggshell  a white bell
To lighten my cold room
So let me sleep where I lay
With a murder of crows
That live in the boughs of my brain
See me when I float like a dove
Skies above lined with trees
Come and take me away
Time brings low all good things
When you open your eyes
When you open your eyes
Now in the vastness of pines
Where my ghost lies in loose-limbed array
I pass the time
And go upload my heart to the fatal shore
Forevermore  it spins there behind closed doors
Now  it's time to go through the fields of chrome
The rusted homes abandoned at the remains of the day
So come on  row me away
On black rivers and rainbows to Neptune
Where I can stay

Oh  I've waited so long
On the slow shores of England
To sing my last song
So come row me away
On black rivers and rainbows to Neptune
Where I can stay
See me when I float like a dove
The skies above lined with trees
Come and take me away
Come take me away
And only we know the way
To the cool blue lagoon
Where we sleep until noon
The city is all ablaze
With blue notes and haze
We hit the open wide roads
Snuck the moon in clothes
Get up again
Get up again
Get up again
We swim under the moon
In the cool blue lagoon
You count up all my scars
Crumble them into stars
You're such a perfect mess
You in your dirty white dress
And the day I came to

You sell snake oil to the butcher
The butcher's bill must always be paid
It's a wild wait to wait and it leads to no surprises
No surprise  no-one gets laid
You put the snake oil under my tongue
Show me the door  the way to be free
Cause you know the moves that only you do
Makes fools of a boy like me

Please don't ask me why
If the devil wants me

When the end comes my way
Will I drop to my knees and pray?
And if my parents ask you
Tell them I'll be okay
And now the robots have made the rounds
Sand dunes filled up all our towns
The foxes howl and the creepers prowl around
The peeling wet bricks of London town

Throw a party so we won't get hurt

With the lights and the roses and the cowards downtown
They tried to call my girl but she could not be found
I buried my guilt in a pit in the sound
With the rust and the vultures and the trash downtown
I fell for a girl with a port-wine stain
I knew her initials but never her name
I tried and I tried and I was never the same
So no longer felt love and I'm forever changed
