"How the hell you get all that ass in them pants?
How you drinkin' and you ain't got no glass?
And how you came in here and you ain't got no man  what
Damn  to me you look perfect
Bend that ass over  let me see how you work it
Poppin' and shakin'  get on your knees hit the dirt
Girl I go so deep in that pussy while he just hitting the surface
What is you sayin'?
Drop it down on it
Made me get a couple bands drop it down on it
Make you get a couple friends drop it down on it
Turn around drop it down  drop it down on it
Do it for a real nigga  do it for a boss
Do somethin' for a boss  do somethin' for a real nigga
Go and do somethin' for a boss
Do somethin' for a boss  do somethin'
You got a ass make a nigga wanna buy a ring
You got a ass make a nigga spend errything
You got a ass make a nigga wanna buy a ring
You got a ass make a nigga spend errything
If you've got an ass like the girls in the videos
Go and bring it my way
Ass so big it could swallow up a stripper pole
I ain't playin'  no I ain't playin'
Just give me a call and I'll beat it
I'll be all where your seat is
Mary Jane got me moving slow
Uh

Pretty much the rest of the time we here
My little niggas got more money than you fuck niggas man

Quarter million  little nigga  I was nineteen
Had my hustle down pat  I did the right thing
They don't move that fast  they act like they don't like cheese
Had a couple niggas mad like they don't like me
Is it cause I'm hella paid? I think it might be
Yeah my pockets hella straight
And I smoke so much dope I got OG in my IV
So many niggas jackin' that shit don't even surprise me
I don't even want it back  shit it's off to the good
Can't even say I didn't know you would
Make a little money  get it from the road
Bring that shit back to the hood
Anytime you see me  man I'm on the grind
Nigga wasn't workin' when you knew you should
Now you talk about me when I'm on the road
And when I ride by I'm in the newest one

Hey man  green is for the money  gold is for the honeys
Step up your game or step down
Whenever a problem troubles us all
If you trust in the Lord there will be a brighter tomorrow
For there's nothing too much for the great God to do
And all that he asks and expects of you
Is faith that's unshaken by tribulation and yield
Confidence and knowledge that God knows best
And trouble and sorrow  they are only a test
But without God testin' of our soul
It never could reach the ultimate goal
So keep on knowing and believing
All that God has promised you would be yours to receive
Preach  Church  tabernacle
Wiz! Wiz! That's the way
Wiz! Wiz! That's the way
OG Hash Oil
When it's all said and done
I'll be at the top bitch
Cause I hustle a lot
Don't even test drive it before I cop
Just boarded a yacht
We're at the craps table in Vegas
The dealer saying how he admiring my watch
I'm placing my wager
Don't even care how much paper I blow
Cause how to get this money and stay on
A couple things that I know
I'm blowing that stink by the O
My weed so strong I swear to god you would think it's cologne
I go anywhere in the world and just make it my home
Staying at the highest level but I ain’t make it alone
Now that my money right them suckers keep thinking I'm wrong
Cause this a muthafuckin life that you can't live at all

I just wanna ride in my ride with my top down

And smoke weed with my niggas
Still rolling weed on my XXL
Only difference is that's me on the cover
Once in a while call my little sister and tell her I love her
Cause shit can get crazy in this industry
Most of your friends become your enemies
That's why I stay down with the ones that's been with me
The niggas who started and they down to ride to the end with me
Make sure the positive energy keep flowing
All the weed keep rolling
We gonna keep from falling
Now I'm buying estates
Going on private island vacations
Flying on private planes
I just wanna ride in my ride with my top down
And smoke weed with my niggas
I just wanna ride in my ride with my top down
And smoke weed with my niggas
It's a cohesive thing
But the focus is still getting my thing out there
And to have people understand
This is the world that we're creating
I’mma always win  throw me in and I’m going in
I ain’t running  I’mma come until you leave
I'm 'bout to get it  talk about it ‘cause I really live it
Don’t need no intervention  you ain’t down to rider
Wonder why I’m still here act a fool if you met me (act a fool if you met me)
You try to be brave and step up with you crew it’s too scary
Plus I’m too legendary  It’s what we go hard for
I’m rocking your block  you on top you get knocked off
I’m taking your place yeah  I'll make it my property
And so it’s only right for me  annihilate ‘em if they in my way or sight
Keep 'em up off of me  a weakness in you only make an appetite
Anytime I get into it I be looking at them  looking pitiful
And their condition it be critical  nothing less than original
 for real

Drop the top in that 69

Popping champagne 'cause we made it
All of this shit that I did I probably won't remember tomorrow

Walk in the club  everybody go up
A hundred and 50K just to show up
And everything ain't what it seems
It's hard to live somebody else's dreams
I put all my trust in my team
Know that my money straight  won't let nothing come in between
Politic with my fam  never let the hate intervene
Smoking weed out of Vegas and thanking God for the scene
Thinking back to when we ain't have it
Made it on  came far  needed practice
Moving forward while you thinking backwards
Never sleep  hardly need a mattress
I kick my shoes off my feet  then fall asleep in my seat
Claiming you on your job  well doggie  it ain't complete
Claiming you got the squad but you niggas can't compete
Came with too many broads  can't fit them all in my suite
What can I say? Bring the champagne glasses  roll the J's faster

That's why where I come from the only thing we know is..
Go hard
Make sure you do whatever is that you gotta do  that's your job
And niggas gon' hate but that's no prob'
So hey fuck 'em don't need nothing from 'em
Some niggas talking but the shit they claiming don't mean nothing
And been one since I was young enough to know that everybody was gonna know me
Most niggas don't see
The bigger the bill  the harder you ball
Well I'm throwing mine  cause my money long
The quicker you here  the faster you go
That's why where I come from the only thing we know is..
The bigger the bill  the harder you ball
Well I'm throwing mine  cause my money long
The quicker you here  the faster you go
That's why where I come from the only thing we know is..
Work hard  play hard
Work hard  play hard
Work hard  play hard
Hahahahaha
