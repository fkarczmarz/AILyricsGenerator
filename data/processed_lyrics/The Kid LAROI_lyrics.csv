"Call your phone when I get lonely  yeah
Tonight  you told me that you miss the old me
You asking me  What is the issue?
Callin' my Uber 'cause I don't wanna be with you
Trust me when I tell you this ain't nothing against you
I got some problems that I don't wanna get into
I just fucked another bitch thinkin' about you
Lot of other bitches probably gon' think this about them
I just fucked another bitch thinkin' about you
Lot of other bitches probably gon' think this about them
I hate to admit it  but I think I caught some feelings for you
Still fuckin' the same hoes  but none give me that feelin' from you
It's like I be with them  but I can't help but think 'bout you
I'd rather be with you  but I can't put myself through that
Huh  again
I trusted a bitch once  I cannot do that again
But what if you're the one? I'd mess it up  then lose out again

Okay  hold up  baby  roll one
Can we light it? Can we smoke one? Can we pour up?
Mix the Hennessy with the cola
I feel better when I'm not sober
They tryna bring me down  gotta stay focused
When I get sad  I get the Hennessy and pour up
Fuck dirty Sprite  I get the liquor and the cola
And fuck my ex bitch  she did me dirty  I got no trust
I was only young  but I learned that these hoes ain't shit
I gave you my all  and this the thanks I get?
I still can’t believe all of the things I did
I still can't believe that you would leave like this
Traumatized from the shit I've seen in my life
Everything you see right now is the highlight
And no matter how hard I try
Memories still living deep in my mind
I've seen my best friends change colors like a tie-dye
But shout out to the ones that still with me  those are my guys
And fuck everybody else that's just talking from the sidelines
Seeing it and living it  bitch  there is a fine line
And R.I.P. my brother  never got to say bye-bye
It gets hard  I know  believe it
I hope you find the help you're seeking
I was down in Hell  believe me
Packed up my bags and told the Devil  I'm leaving

I got nothing to prove  but a whole lot to lose
My mama used to sell drugs to pay for my school
My uncle Dub got knocked and ended up on the news
This all I know  I had to do this  I couldn't pick and choose
I used to pray for some better days
Ten years later  I'm in L.A. whippin' that Bentayga
I'm paid up with entertainers  Henny  no chaser
And bad bitches by the cases  they entertain us
I know my ex-bitch down bad and regretting
Leavin' me and watchin' every little thing I do

That I switched up and tell 'em stories that were never true
Shit ain't nothin' new (Nah)  I'm livin' comfortable

Now I can't catch a break  thinkin' 'bout you
I promised that I wouldn't  but I ran back to you
'Cause one more night alone  just might not be good for
What got into you? Why you actin' brand new for?
And what I ever do? Maybe I just took it too far
I did fall apart  maybe I was a little too much
And now I'm thinkin' too much  drank a little too much
But I don't wanna feel how I felt before
I'm runnin' back to you  I'm runnin' back to you
And I don't wanna feel how I felt before
I'm runnin' back to you  I'm runnin' back to you
'Cause it's all a little too much  and I'm in need of your love
'Cause I don't wanna feel how I felt before
I'm runnin' back to you  I'm runnin' back to you
You used to say it was forever  I remember
Tryna forget  I can't forget ya
Still got your makeup on my sweater
And I know that it's all over
But memories live forever
For the worse or for the better
Can't let you go  my heart won't let her
Can't let you go and you know it
Yeah  I put my all in
I gave you whatever
Gave you my heart and you broke it  yeah
You were so selfish  did nothin' to help me
And I was so blinded  but I couldn't help it
