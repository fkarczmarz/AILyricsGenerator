lyrics
"Would you believe me? Would you agree?
It's almost that feeling that we've met before
So tell me that you don't think I'm crazy
When I tell you love has come here and now
A moment like this
Some people wait a lifetime for a moment like this
Some people search forever for that one special kiss
Some people wait a lifetime for a moment like this
Can we make this dream last forever?
And I'll cherish all the love we share
A moment like this
Some people wait a lifetime for a moment like this
Some people search forever for that one special kiss
Some people wait a lifetime for a moment like this
You might also like
Could this be the greatest love of all?
I wanna know that you will catch me when I fall (Fall)
So let me tell you this
Some people wait a lifetime for a moment
Like this
Some people wait a lifetime for a moment like this
Some people search forever for that one special kiss
Some people wait a lifetime for a moment like this
Some people wait a lifetime for a moment like this
 they're haunted
 yeah
 now I can't stop
 I
 already gone
 already gone
 so I'm already gone
 they're haunted
 already gone
 already gone
An exquisite extreme I know
He’s as damned as he seems
And more heaven than a heart could hold
And if I tried to save him
My whole world could cave in
It just ain't right
It just ain't right
I don't know what he's after
But he's so beautiful
Such a beautiful disaster
And if I could hold on
Through the tears and the laughter
Would it be beautiful
Or just a beautiful disaster?
He's magic and myth
As strong as what I believe
A tragedy with
More damage than a soul should see
You might also like
And do I try to change him?
So hard not to blame him
Hold on tight
Hold on tight
I don't know what he's after
But he's so beautiful
Such a beautiful disaster
And if I could hold on
Through the tears and the laughter
Would it be beautiful
Or just a beautiful disaster?
I'm longing for love and the logical
But he's only happy hysterical
I'm waiting for some kind of miracle
Waited so long
So long
He’s soft to the touch
He’s never enough
And still he's more than I can take
I don't know what he's after
But he's so beautiful
Such a beautiful disaster
And if I could hold on
Through the tears and the laughter
Would it be beautiful
Or just a beautiful disaster?
He’s beautiful
Such a beautiful disaster
Beautiful (Beautiful disaster)
Ooh
I will not make the same mistakes that you did
I will not let myself cause my heart so much misery
I will not break the way you did  you fell so hard
I've learned the hard way to never let it get that far
Because of you
I never stray too far from the sidewalk
Because of you
I learned to play on the safe side so I don't get hurt
Because of you
I find it hard to trust not only me  but everyone around me
Because of you  I am afraid
I lose my way
And it's not too long before you point it out
I cannot cry
Because I know that's weakness in your eyes
My heart can't possibly break
When it wasn't even whole to start with

I never stray too far from the sidewalk

I learned to play on the safe side so I don't get hurt
Because of you
I find it hard to trust not only me  but everyone around me
Because of you
I am afraid
I watched you die  I heard you cry every night in your sleep
(I watched you die  in your sleep)
I was so young  you should have known better than to lean on me
(I was too young for you to lean on me)
You never thought of anyone else  you just saw your pain
And now I cry in the middle of the night
For the same damn thing
Because of you
I never stray too far from the sidewalk
Because of you
I learned to play on the safe side so I don't get hurt
Because of you
I try my hardest just to forget everything
Because of you
I don't know how to let anyone else in
Because of you
I'm ashamed of my life because it's empty
Because of you
I am afraid
Oh-oh  oh  oh
Seems like just yesterday
You were a part of me
I used to stand so tall
I used to be so strong
Your arms around me tight
Everything  it felt so right
Unbreakable  like nothing could go wrong
Now I can't breathe
No  I can't sleep
I'm barely hangin' on
Here I am  once again
I'm torn into pieces
Can't deny it  can't pretend
Just thought you were the one
Broken up  deep inside
But you won't get to see the tears I cry
Behind these hazel eyes
You might also like
I told you everything
Opened up and let you in
You made me feel alright for once in my life
Now all that's left of me
Is what I pretend to be
So together  but so broken up inside
'Cause I can't breathe
No  I can't sleep
I'm barely hangin' on
Here I am  once again
I'm torn into pieces
Can't deny it  can't pretend
Just thought you were the one
Broken up  deep inside
But you won't get to see the tears I cry
Behind these hazel eyes
Swallow me then spit me out
For hating you  I blame myself
Seeing you  it kills me now
No  I don't cry on the outside
Anymore
Anymore
Here I am  once again
I'm torn into pieces
Can't deny it  can't pretend
Just thought you were the one
Broken up  deep inside
But you won't get to see the tears I cry
Behind these hazel eyes
Here I am  once again
I'm torn into pieces
Can't deny it  can't pretend
Just thought you were the one
Broken up  deep inside
But you won't get to see the tears I cry
All we want is to keep it together
This kind of life has made our hearts as hard as leather
And all these tears are from the dust in our eyes
And all these years just keep on passin' us by
And all this misery makes it hard to deny
We all know that we're just born to die
That's the way it goes when you're just born to die
I hear the voice of a whip-poor-will singin'
She don't know all the comfort she's bringin'
We all know the sound of when the truth is ringin'
All these tears are from the dust in our eyes
And all these years just keep on passin' us by
And all this misery makes it hard to deny
We all know that we're just born to die

Grew up in a small town
And when the rain would fall down
I'd just stare out my window
Dreamin' of what could be
And if I'd end up happy
I would pray (I would pray)
Trying hard to reach out
But when I tried to speak out
Felt like no one could hear me
Wanted to belong here
But something felt so wrong here
So I prayed (I would pray)
I could break away
I'll spread my wings and I'll learn how to fly
I'll do what it takes 'til I touch the sky
And I'll make a wish  take a chance  make a change
And break away
Out of the darkness and into the sun
But I won't forget all the ones that I love
I'll take a risk  take a chance  make a change
And break away

Wanna feel the warm breeze
Sleep under a palm tree
Feel the rush of the ocean
Get onboard a fast train
Travel on a jet plane
Far away (I will)
And break away
I'll spread my wings and I'll learn how to fly
I'll do what it takes 'til I touch the sky
And I'll make a wish  take a chance  make a change
And break away
Out of the darkness and into the sun
I won't forget all the ones that I love (I gotta)
Take a risk  take a chance  make a change
And break away
Buildings with a hundred floors
Swinging 'round revolving doors
Maybe I don't know where they'll take me  but
Gotta keep moving on  moving on
Fly away  break away
I'll spread my wings and I'll learn how to fly (Learn how to fly)
Though it's not easy to tell you goodbye
I gotta take a risk  take a chance  make a change
And break away
Out of the darkness and into the sun (Into the sun)
But I won't forget of the place I come from
I gotta take a risk  take a chance  make a change
And break away
Break away
I got pride I could roll out for miles in front of me
I don't need you to lower the bar for me
I know I've got this 'cause I've had it all along
I'm phenomenal and I'm enough
I don't need you to tell me who to be
Can someone just hold me?
Can someone just know me?
I'm broken and it's beautiful
I'm broken and it’s beautiful
I'm broken and it's beautiful
I'm broken and it's beautiful
We bury our emotion and pretend that we're just fine
The only way to live now is to know you're gonna fly
Don't listen to the lying liars and their lies

I'm tired (Oh)

Without piling on all sad and scared and out of time (Oh)
I'm wild (Wild)
Can I just be wild? (Just be wild)
Without feeling like I'm failing and I'm losing my mind
Can someone just hold me?
I'm broken and it's beautiful
I'm broken and it's beautiful
I'm broken and it's beautiful
Distance was a friend of mine
Catching breath in a web of lies
I've spent most of my life
Shadowboxing the other half
Learning how to react
I've spent most of my time
Turning my cheek for the sake of the show
I won't be told what's supposed to be right
Catch my breath
Catch my breath
Addicted to the love I found
Making time for the ones that count
I'll spend the rest of my time
Laughing hard with the windows down
Leaving footprints all over town
I will spend the rest of my life

Turning my cheek for the sake of the show

You called me hysterical
I finally figured us out
My fire was hot enough
To burn on for the both of us
And your water keeps puttin' us out

 I forgot how to turn it
 where the hell did you come from?
 different kind of fun
 I forgot how to turn it
 but I know you can take it
 I wasn't even gonna go out

 I forgot how to turn it
 but I know you can take it
 I only dreamed about you
 you make me feel alive and brand new
 I forgot how to turn it
 but I know you can take it
 I forgot how to turn it
 but I know you can take it
I'm stumblin' through the darkness
There ain't no sign of a spark here
I'm used to feelin' that fire
You watered down that desire
You used to make me feel like a diamond
Now it don't even seem like you're tryin'
So give me one good reason I should need you
Oh  come turn this around
I need more heat from you  baby
Make me feel weak for you  babe
Oh  wanna feel alive
Oh  like my heart's in the wild
I need more heat from you  baby

 even if you're hurt and you can only see the worst (Only see the worst)
You got too much talent
I see you through those bloodshot eyes
There's a cure  you found it
Slow motion sparks  you caught that chill
Now don't deny it
They don't wanna define it
Just give up the game and get into me
If you're lookin' for thrills  then get cold feet
So if you want me  I don't come cheap
Keep your hand in my hand and your heart on your sleeve
'Cause the more that you try  the harder I'll fight
To say goodnight
I can't cook  no  but I can clean
Up the mess she left
Lay your head down and feel the beats
As I kiss your forehead
This may not last  but this is now
So love the one you're with

So if you want me  I don't come cheap
Keep your hand in my hand and your heart on your sleeve
'Cause the more that you try  the harder I'll fight
To say—
'Cause the more that you try  the harder I'll fight
To say goodnight
Oh  sweetheart  put the bottle down
You can't see where you're goin'
I didn’t know who I could trust
So I put all my faith in us
Turned my strength into weakness
I didn't want it all to fall apart
So I decided just to play the part
Puttin' up with all the bullshit
It made me strong enough to do this
Weighing down on me
I lost my sanity
I feel freedom where I stand now
And I feel proud of who I am now
I love the woman that I became

It's back in my hands
And you swore I'd never do it
But it's your time to face the music
Weighing down on me
I lost my own sanity
It was hard to hold on
Days and nights I thought I'd never make it at all
Couldn't make it at all
Now I stand tall
Breathe
No one can stop me from livin' this moment for me
I found my heartbeat
After all that I've been through
Weighing down on me
I found my sanity
I don't think about you (no)
(Not anymore) Not anymore
I was crying out  couldn't make no sound
No one hears the silent tears collecting
You know I had lost hope  I was all alone
Never been so low 'til you came along
Teacher  I feel the dots connecting
Beat down on me  beat down like a waterfall
'Cause I can take on so much more than I had ever dreamed
So beat down on me  beat down like a waterfall
'Cause baby  I am ready to be free
Now I am invincible
No  I ain't a scared little girl no more
Yeah  I am invincible
What was I running for? (Oh)
I was hiding from the world
I was so afraid  I felt so unsure
Now I am invincible
And I'm a perfect storm (Oh)
Now I am a warrior  a shooting star
You know I got this far  had a broken heart
No one hears the silent tears collecting
'Cause it's being weak  that's strong
In the truth  I'm found
I have courage now  gonna shout it out

There is suffering too terrible to name
You hold your child as tight as you can
Then push away the unimaginable
The moments when you're in so deep
Feels easier to just swim down
And so they move uptown
And learn to live with the unimaginable
I spend hours in the garden
I walk alone to the store
And it's quiet uptown
I never liked the quiet before
I take the children to church on Sunday
A sign of the cross at the door
And I pray
That never used to happen before
He is working through the unimaginable
They say he walks the length of the city
Can you imagine?

If I could trade his life for mine
He'd be standing here right now
And you would smile
And that would be enough
I don't pretend to know
The challenges we're facing
I know there's no replacing what we've lost
And you need time
But I'm not afraid
I know who I married
Just let me stay here by your side
And that would be enough
Do you like it uptown? It's quiet uptown
He is trying to do the unimaginable
Taking in the sights of the city
They are trying to do the unimaginable
There are moments that the words don't reach
There's a grace too powerful to name
We push away what we could never understand
We push away the unimaginable
They are standing in the garden
Standing there side by side
She takes his hand
It's quiet uptown
Every kiss is a door
Can I knock on yours? Can we knock a little more?
If your touch is a key
Let me in
If I let you in
You gotta be careful with it
Let me tell you again (Hey)
Love so soft that you can't rub off

The only friend I got here's my broken heart
Feelin' like I've finally had enough
Livin' like an animal can be so rough
I've been waitin' so long for you to come my way
And now I  I can't wait another day
When you hold me  I finally see
When you say love  I know what it means
I was broke down so alone in the dark
Until you showed me the light (baby)
'Cause when you kiss me  I know who I am
And when you let me feel it I understand
When I'm lost I just look in your eyes
You show me the meaning of life
You show me the meaning of life

Thinkin' I won't make it til the morning light

Miss self-sufficient
Miss unafraid
Miss out of my way
Miss on her own
Miss almost grown
Miss never let a man help her off her throne
She'd never ever feel rejected
Little miss apprehensive
What is this feelin' takin' over?
Thinkin' no one could open the door
To feel what's real
What happened to Miss Independent?
No longer need to be defensive
When love is true

Misguided heart
Miss play it smart
But she miscalculated
She didn't wanna end up jaded
And this miss decided not to miss out on true love
She went in a new direction
She fell in love
What is this feelin' takin' over?
Thinkin' no one could open the door (Open this door)
What happened to Miss Independent? (Oh)
No longer need to be defensive
When Miss Independent walked away
No time for love that came her way
She looked in the mirror and thought today
What happened to miss no longer afraid?
It took some time for her to see
How beautiful love could truly be
No more talk of Why can't that be me?
I'm so glad I finally see
What is this feelin' taking over?
Thinkin' no one could open the door (Oh yeah)
To feel (To feel) what's real
What happened to Miss Independent?
No longer need to be defensive (Yeah)
Like the first time that you listen to your favorite singer live
Like an echo in a canyon
Like tears  but you're not sad
Like a sunrise on a mountain
I wanna move you like that
(Ooh  ooh)
Like a symphony at sundown  in the middle of July
When a lyric really gets ya and it breaks you down inside
Like the home that you were raised in
Like faded photographs
Like the thrill of Christmas morning
Yeah  I wanna move you like that
(Ooh  ooh)
Like a solemn Hallelujah
Like a choir shouts Amen (Amen)
Like your first time fallin' in love
Or a stairway up to heaven
Like a soldier who is fallin' as he holds his country's flag
And he fights for freedom's callin'

Take my hand
Will you share this with me?

Until you let go completely

And every year  another December comes and goes
Always watching
Never reaching
But this Christmas  I'm gonna risk it all
This Christmas  I'm not afraid to fall
So I'm at your door with nothing more than words I've never said
In all this white  you'll see me like you've never seen me yet
Wrapped in red  ooh

I'm getting tired always tryin' to do my best

Need a time machine and

Cuts you so deep when it feels like the end

No need for Ferris wheel memories to tend
The ache before the mend
Are you happy now? Will you ever be?
