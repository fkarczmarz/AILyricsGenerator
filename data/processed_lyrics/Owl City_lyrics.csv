"Here's my résumé
I'm looking for a part-time job
And I can start today
Well  I heard you needed some help in frozen
With Eric leavin' soon
My boss shook my hand
And I began that Monday after school
That Monday after school
So thank you kindly
I owe ya  Hy-Vee
Eatin' cold pizza in the break room
Feelin' kinda small
A skinny kid with a crooked tie
My name tag said it all
Heh  but I felt like a man
And I made it rain when payday came
'Cause that was all I had
So thank you kindly
I owe ya  Hy-Vee
Yeah  I owe ya
Yeah  I owe ya  Hy-Vee
Adam  check please (Ooh)

Na-da-da-da-da-da-da

Adam  check please (Ooh) (Help is on the way)
Help is on the way (Na-da-da-da-da-da-da)

Help is on the way
Help is on the way (Everything is beautiful)
And I'll be there in a jiffy
Because stocking shelves was how I learned
To do my level best and take pride in my work
'Cause you never know when it's your turn
To climb the ladder of success
Show the world what you do best
Yeah  you were made for this
Hey  I'm looking for Casey Connor
It seems like yesterday
I paid my dues in frozen foods
And I just wanna say
God bless the helpful smile in every aisle
I couldn't ask for more
And I'm glad I got my first real job
Working in this grocery store
In this grocery store
In this grocery store
So thank you kindly (You mean the world to me)
I owe ya  Hy-Vee
Yeah  I owe ya
(Woo)
(Ooh)
Don't stop until you reach the stars
Climb the ladder of success
Show the world what you do best
Yeah  you were made for this
So chase your passion and not your paycheck
Be proud of what you have
And put in the work until your signature
Becomes an autograph (Oh  oh)
Adam  check please
Help is on the way (Ooh)
Help is on the way (Na-da-da-da-da-da-da)
Help is on the way
Help is on the way (Yeah  I'll be filling up the Cool Whip)

Now  that friendly smile in every aisle guaranteed
(Help is on the way  help is on the way  help is on the way)
(Everything is beautiful)
That your day was breezy
(Help is on the way) (Cool Whip)
All those hours and store-bought flowers set me free
(But help is on the way  help is on the way  help is on the way)
(Everything is beautiful)
And freedom meant the world to me
(Help is on the way)
That friendly smile in every aisle guaranteed
(Help is on the way  help is on the way  help is on the way)
(Ooh  na-da-da-da-da-da-da)
(Everything is beautiful)
That your day was breezy
(Help is on the way)
(Yeah  I'll be filling up the Cool Whip)
All those hours and store-bought flowers set me free

It's like they're always trying to tear us apart
And everybody’s gonna watch what we do
And they'll be awestruck saying aw shucks
They either got real good or they got real good luck
And I'd be lying if I said that I could take any more
And I was lying on the couch and there's this knock on the door
And it's like...
All my friends
We can take it all back again
And lemme hear you say
Oh yeah
Lemme hear you say yeah
We got our card and we're going to the dance
And everybody's gonna watch what we do
They either got real good or they got real good luck

And lemme hear you say
Oh yeah
All my friends
We can take it all back again
And lemme hear you say
Oh yeah
Lemme hear you say yeah
We'll always be young at heart
And nothing's ever gonna tear us apart
And everybody's gonna watch what we do
And they'll be awestruck saying aw shucks
They either got real good or you know what
All my friends
We can take it all back again
And lemme hear you say
Oh
All my friends
We can take it all back again
And lemme hear you say
Oh yeah
And carried you away into the Alligator Sky?
Even though I'll never know what's up ahead
Ignite the night with a firecracker flash
When the stars collide and your eyes grow wide
Take it in with your breath against the glass
Remember to dream because it's going to be a starry night
So harmonize with the singing satellites
And remember to scream because you're going to be lost for words
When the sparks erupt and they light you up
Dip your toes in the galaxy because it's yours to explore tonight
Where was I when the rockets came to life
And carried you away into the Alligator Sky?
Even though I'll never know what's up ahead

Roller coaster through the atmosphere
I'm drowning in this starry serenade
Where ecstasy becomes cavalier
My imagination's taking me away
Reverie whisper in my ear
I'm scared to death that I'll never be afraid
Roller coaster through the atmosphere
My imagination's taking me away
Let's hear it for the Universe
Where it never hurts
Diving in head-first
Take a taste of the melting Milky Way
And remember to laugh because you're living in a crazy world
Where you'll never guess what could happen next
Give the outer limits my regards as you float to fly away
Where was I when the rockets came to life
And carried you away into the Alligator Sky?
Even though I'll never know what's up ahead
Where was I when the rockets came to life
And carried you away into the Alligator Sky?
Even though I'll never know what's up ahead
In the Alligator Sky
In the Alligator Sky
And carried you away into the alligator sky?
I'm sitting where I'm supposed to
The concrete and the sky switch places
So now my ceiling is painted with cosmic spaces
Blasting off like a rocket from the ground up
Condo on the milky way
A house on the cloud and God's my landlord
Where was I when the rockets came to life
And carried you away into the alligator sky?

Rollercoaster through the atmosphere
I'm drowning in this starry serenade
Where ecstasy becomes cavalier
Imagination's taking me away
Reverie whispered in my ear
I'm scared to death that I'll never be afraid
Rollercoaster through the atmosphere
Imagination's taking me away
That the sun is something that we can't fly to
Imagination is high and if you got it you can meet me
When you see me in the alligator sky
Where was I when the rockets came to life (Boom)
And carried you away into the alligator sky? (Into the alligator sky)
I'm never letting go (Never letting go)
I'm never letting go (Owl City)
Where was I when the rockets came to life (Keep your eyes shut)
And carried you away into the alligator sky?
I'm never letting go (I'ma dream like I've never dreamed)
I'm never letting go
In the alligator sky
In the alligator sky
In the alligator sky
In the alligator sky
And your strength is gone
Remember I am just a prayer away
When the way is hard
And you are faint of heart
Remember I am just a prayer away
And fear not for I am by your side
Listen through the rain
And you can hear the angels say
Help is on the way
The moment you begin to pray
When the thunders roar
You don't need to be afraid
I'll lead you through the storm
So please remember when I say
I'm with you always
When you are worn out
And you are let down
Remember I am just a prayer away
When every door is locked
And you feel so lost
Remember I am just a prayer away

So please remember when I say
I'm with you always
Soar on eagles' wings
Run and I'll be there
Listen through the rain
And you can hear the angels say
Help is on the way
The moment you begin to pray
When the thunders roar
You don't need to be afraid
I'll lead you through the storm
So please remember when I say
I'm with you always
Through the glass in my bedroom window
In the bushes far below
I thought I saw an unfamiliar shadow
Among the ones I so clearly know
I've been sleeping with the night light unplugged
With a note on the rocking chair
So wake me if you're out there.
Livin' close to the ground
Is seventh Heaven 'cause there are angels all around
Among my frivolous thoughts
I believe there are beautiful things seen by the astronauts
Wake me if you're out there
Wake me if you're out there
In the dust on my cellar staircase
A pair of footprints followed me
I saw a flicker in the fake fireplace
Blinked again but there was nothing to see
You might also like
I've been leaving all the windows unlocked
With a basket by the oak tree
'Cause I'll be picking up the acorns that fall off
If you'll be climbing up to meet me
Livin' close to the ground
Is seventh Heaven 'cause there are angels all around
Among my frivolous thoughts
I believe there are beautiful things seen by the astronauts
Wake me if you're out there
I keep my knees black and blue
'Cause they often hit the hard wood floor
(Wake me if you're out there)
And I believe
So I'm not praying to the ceiling anymore
I've been sleeping with the night light unplugged
With a note on the rocking chair
So wake me if you're out there.
Livin' close to the ground
Is seventh Heaven 'cause there are angels all around
Among my frivolous thoughts
I believe there are beautiful things seen by the astronauts
The indications reveal
(Wake me if you're out there)
That few of us realize life is quite surreal
So if you're dying to see
I guarantee there are angels around your vicinity
So if you're dying to see
I slept on the floor like a vagrant
I braved a Minnesota winter night
And drove to a movie feeling lonely
And as I thawed my heart out by the light
Of the silver screen
I was unaware that you were there
Was climbing up the stairs
And what I thought
In the parking lot
I drove away
With not much to say
But in my hand I held a paper bird
And written on it were the words
Be brave
Wildflower knew I wasn’t well
But on the kitchen floor I got better again
I grabbed my keys and drove toward a star
You might also likeCause that’s when I was introduced to true
Serendipity
I knew it when
You showed up again
Your heart is where you’re home
And what I thought
In the coffee shop
I drove away
With not much to say
But in my hand I held a paper bird
And written on it were the words
And in my mind
After all this time
I’m blown away
With no words to say
How I learned the meaning of the phrase
And restoring life to the lighthouse
A slow-motion wave on the ocean stirs
My emotion up like a rain cloud
When did the sky turn black?
And when will the light come back?
A cab driver turned to skydiver then
When did the sky turn black?
And when will the light come back?
I'm ecstatic like a drug addict
I fought all through the night
The sun starting to rise
But I'm gonna survive
You might also like
A bad feeling burned through the ceiling
Leaving my healing heart with a new scar
A vampire up from the graveyard
When did the sky turn black?
And when will the light come back?
We all suffer but we recover just
To discover life where we all are
I fought all through the night
The sun starting to rise
But I'm gonna survive
But I'm gonna survive
My heart's burning bad and it's turning black
But I'm learning how to be stronger
Cause I've always known how the story goes
When the curtain falls I'll be wearing thin
Clawing at the walls as they're closing in
In this twisted plot I was destined for
I'm an astronaut on the ocean floor
So misunderstood 'till the bloody end
How I wish I could do it all again
It feels like I'm a lone survivor
Forgotten in a dark and deadly world
And on my own I walk alone
To see the sun again I'd give anything
But life demands a final chapter
A story that we all must leave behind
The anthem of a bird with a broken wing
It's another night of the living dead
Like a viper bite in a spiderweb
It's so deathly dark in the alleyway
And a bleeding heart makes you easy prey
I would run and hide for the afternoon
With the butterfly in the panic room
For a different twist in the story line

It feels like I'm a lone survivor

But life demands a final chapter
A story that we all must leave behind
The anthem of a bird with a broken wing
The anthem of a bird with a broken wing
The anthem of a bird with a broken wing
Tell the world I know that my mind is made
 cause I'm history
 I'll ride the range
 I'll cave in)
Your life is a matinée
It's a blockbuster movie and you play the lead role
And right out of the opening scenes
The whole crowd's on the edge of their seats
Your worst critics are sitting up front
You'll be in a league of your own
So go get 'em and give it some passion!
Quiet on the set!
With all your heart and soul
Dream big and you can feel the magic
Let the camera roll
Make your cameo
Be yourself
And don't be so dramatic
Go and steal the show
Go and steal the show

Go play
'Cause your life is a thriller
We're dying to see

And right out of the opening scenes

You'll be in a league of your own
So go get 'em and give it some passion
Quiet on the set
With all your heart and soul
Let the camera roll
Make your cameo
Go and steal the show
Get a top hat and a rabbit
Win the crowd and make your magic
Turn the lights down low
(And your dreams will come true)
(May the force be with you)
Knock 'em dead
Go and steal the show
Go play
'Cause your life is a movie
Go play
Go play
Go get 'em and give it your all
Make your ceiling full of stars glow
I can sneak in through the window
And I could say it but we both know
You got me floatin' on cloud nine
Look up when the world gets you down
And you're gonna get by
Hang in when the world counts you out
And you're gonna be fine
But when your hand is in mine
You got me floatin' on cloud nine
Meet the one who makes your heart stop
Find a diamond in a gift shop
And you'll be shouting from the rooftop
You got me floatin' on cloud nine
Look up when the world gets you down
And you're gonna get by
Hang in when the world counts you out
And you're gonna be fine
But when your hand is in mine
You got me floatin' on cloud nine

Hey baby are we almost there yet?

And you're gonna be fine
But when your hand is in mine...
Look up when the world gets you down
And you're gonna get by
Hang in when the world counts you out
And you're gonna be fine
But if your hand is in mine
I'll be floatin' on cloud nine
For the rest of my life
I'll be floatin' on cloud nine
And all I did was say Hello
Her pepper spray made it rather hard
For me to walk her home
But I guess that's the way it goes
When I walked by and you caught my eye?
Didn't you know love could shine this bright?
Met a girl with a graceful charm
Got the sense I was not her type
By a black eye and bloody nose
But I guess that's the way it goes
When I walked by and you caught my eye?
Didn't you know love could shine this bright?
You might also like
It's suffocating to say
But the female mystique takes my breath away
So give me a smile or give me a sneer
Because I'm trying to guess here
When I walked by and you caught my eye?
Didn't you know love could shine this bright?
I'm sorry I ever tried (deer in the headlights)
When I walked by and you caught my eye?
Didn't you know love could shine this bright?
Put your sunglasses on 'cause you're a deer in the headlights
You're the deer in the headlights
And laugh out loud as I'm beaming from ear to ear
I'd rather pick flowers  instead of fights
And rather than flaunt my style
I'd flash you a smile  of clean pearly whites
I've been to the dentist a thousand times so I know the drill
I smooth my hair  sit back in the chair
But somehow I still get the chills
Have a seat he says pleasantly
As he shakes my hand  and practically laughs at me
Open up nice and wide he says peering in
And with a smirk he says Don't have a fit  this'll just pinch a bit
As he tries not to grin
When hygienists leave on long vacations
That's when dentists scream and lose their patience
Talking only brings the toothaches on
Because I say the stupidest things
So if my resolve goes South
I'll swallow my pride with an aspirin  and shut my mouth
Golf and alcohol don't mix
And that's why I don't drink and drive
Because  good grief I'd knock out my teeth
And have to kiss my smile goodbye

I've been to the dentist a thousand times so I know the drill
I smooth my hair  sit back in the chair
Same old tired  lonely place
Walls of insincerity
Shifting eyes and vacancy vanished when I saw your face
All I can say is it was enchanting to meet you
Your eyes whispered have we met?
Across the room your silhouette starts to make it's way to me
The playful conversation starts
Counter all your quick remarks like passing notes in secrecy
All I can say is it was enchanting to meet you
This night is sparkling  don't you let it go
I'm wonderstruck  blushing all the way home
I'll spend forever wondering if you knew
I was enchanted to meet you too
The lingering question kept me up
2 AM  who do you love?
I wondered till I'm wide awake
Now I'm pacing back and forth  wishing you were at my door
I'd open up and you would say
It was enchanting to meet you

I'll spend forever wondering if you knew
I was enchanted to meet you too
This is me praying that this was the very first page
Not where the story line ends
My thoughts will echo your name until I see you again
These are the words I held back as I was leaving too soon
I was enchanted to meet you too
Please don't be in love with someone else
Please don't have somebody waiting on you
Please don't be in love with someone else
Please don't have somebody waiting on you
This night is sparkling  don't you let it go
I'm wonderstruck  blushing all the way home
I'll spend forever wondering if you knew
This night is flawless  don't you let it go
I'm wonderstruck  dancing around all alone
Taylor I'll spend my whole life wondering if you knew
I was enchanted to meet you too
I was never in love with someone else
I never had somebody waiting on me
'Cause you were all of my dreams come true
And I just wish you knew
Told me I could be a star
On a plane for the first time
I couldn't wait to start
Landed at JFK
Father Christmas picked me up
Checked in to a dream hotel and I thought
There's no such thing as luck
I walked in to my interview
I'd stand like a one-man band and I'd say
All this is new to me but here's how it's gonna be
And I'd say
Let me be who I wanna be
And I’d say
Let me fly and follow my dreams
Then I'd say
Hey thanks for the weekend
A good time was had by all
And I'd say
I ain't a smooth-talker but thanks for the Fiji Water
Thanks for the Fiji Water

Dinner under a palm tree
I had so much on my mind
Amazed by the bright lights
I stayed up half the night
And boy I took a leap of faith
With nowhere else to go but up
I walked in to my interview
I'd stand like a one man band and I'd say
And I'd say
Let me be who I wanna be
And I'd say
Let me fly and follow my dreams
And I'd say
A good time was had by all
And I'd say
I ain't a spin doctor but thanks for the offer
And by the way
(No one does it like you do)
You know I had a ball
(It was nice to meet you)
And I'd say
I ain't a smooth-talker but thanks for the Fiji Water
Thanks for the Fiji Water
I laughed when I got back home and I thought
When I would hop into your red Firebird
'Cause in your car we understood and figured out
That everything changes
Everything changes
Tell me why I look back and I wanna cry
Sometimes I feel like we grew up too fast
You and I had the time of our younger lives
Sometimes I sigh and think about the past
A basement full of boys building homemade bombs
'Cause everything changes
Everything changes
Tell me why I look back and I wanna cry
Sometimes I feel like we grew up too fast
You and I had the time of our younger lives
Sometimes I sigh and think about the past

It was just us (It was just us)?
Pretending we were Nash and Coral
On the school bus
Life is different now and that's okay with me
I moved away and you started a family
But deep inside you and I are still the same kids
'Cause you’re my brother and that won’t ever change
Even though everything changes
Tell me why I look back and I wanna cry
Sometimes I feel like we grew up too fast
You and I had the time of our younger lives
Sometimes I sigh and think about the past
There's a new guest room in my parents' home
The carpet got replaced a couple years ago
Because it isn't my bedroom anymore
There’s new photographs on the freezer door
(Everything changes)
We should talk all night and not say a word
('Cause everything changes)
Lit up the world as I fell asleep
'Cause they'd fill the open air and leave teardrops everywhere
You'd think me rude but I would just stand and stare
I'd like to make myself believe
That planet Earth turns slowly
It's hard to say that I'd rather stay awake when I'm asleep
'Cause everything is never as it seems
'Cause I'd get a thousand hugs from ten thousand lightning bugs
As they tried to teach me how to dance
A disco ball is just hanging by a thread
I'd like to make myself believe
That planet Earth turns slowly
It's hard to say that I'd rather stay awake when I'm asleep
'Cause everything is never as it seems (When I fall asleep)
Leave my door open just a crack
(Please take me away from here)
'Cause I feel like such an insomniac
(Please take me away from here)
Why do I tire of counting sheep
(Please take me away from here)
When I'm far too tired to fall asleep?

I got misty eyes as they said farewell (They said farewell)
But I'll know where several are if my dreams get real bizarre
I'd like to make myself believe

It's hard to say that I'd rather stay awake when I'm asleep
'Cause everything is never as it seems (When I fall asleep)
I'd like to make myself believe
That planet Earth turns slowly
It's hard to say that I'd rather stay awake when I'm asleep
'Cause everything is never as it seems (When I fall asleep)
I'd like to make myself believe
That planet Earth turns slowly
It's hard to say that I'd rather stay awake when I'm asleep

Armor the airlock  blanket the bedrock
And kiss the planet goodbye (Through the galaxies)
Dear God  I was terribly lost
When the galaxies crossed and the sun went dark
But dear God  you're the only North Star
I would follow this far

There's something there and it's showing
There's no need to look around

Shout out to the dreams you'll chase
Shout out to the hearts you'll break
Nothing's gonna stop you now

Go on

In the hills and highlands
I fall asleep in hospital parking lots
And awake in your mouth
Hello Seattle  I am a manta ray
Deep beneath the blue waves
I'll crawl the sandy bottom of Puget Sound
And construct a summer home
Hello Seattle  I am the crescent moon
Shining down on your face
I will disguise myself as a sleeping pill
And descend inside of you
Hello Seattle  I am a cold seahorse
Feeling warm in your sand
I sing about the tide and the ocean surf
Rolling in the evening breeze
Hello Seattle  I am an albatross
On the docks and moored boats
I sail above your inlets and interstates
Through the rain and open wind

Hello Seattle  I am an old lighthouse
Throwing beams of bright light
Red in the morning  blue in the evening sun
Taking heed for everyone
Hello Seattle  I am a mountaineer
In the hills and highlands
I fall asleep in hospital parking lots
Take me above your light
Carry me through the night
Hold me secure in flight
Sing me to sleep tonight
Take me above your light (Hello Seattle)
Carry me though the night (I am a mountaineer  in the hills and highlands)
Hold me secure in flight (I fall asleep in hospital)
 I'm a windshield
 I'm just a lucky bug
 but I haven't seen the hive
And your love left me breathless
When the fairy dust fell over us
But love goes on and on forever
It's so dark in my mind
I cross my heart and hope to die
I don't have a lot left
Where our journey would lead us
It's so dark in my mind
I cross my heart and hope to die
I don't have a lot left
It's a perfect day to float away
I'll love you forever
And you were my dream come true
It's a perfect day to float away
And I remember the view whenever I'm holding you
The sun hung from a string
Looking down on the world as it warms over everything
Chills run down my spine as our fingers entwine
And your sighs harmonize with mine
Beat fast when you dance with me
We got older and I should've known
(Do you feel alive?)
That I'd feel colder when I walk alone
So I may as well ditch my dismay
Bombs away
Bombs away
Circle me and the needle moves gracefully back and forth
Risk it all 'cause I'll catch you if you fall
It makes me smile because you said it best
I would clearly feel blessed if the sun rose up from the West
'Cause your favorite shade is navy blue

 my strength  my song
 this solid ground
 what depths of peace

 no scheme of man
Like a birthday card for Johnny and a pair of angel wings
You were tryna light a fire  and all you wanted was a match
But you knew I didn't have one  so it was odd that you should ask
No  it wasn't just the plane crash that shook you to the core
But the very thought of losin' her  that made it all worth dyin' for
I'm sorry
I'm sorry
We both washed up on that island  all alone without a friend
Thinkin' you and I were gonna die there  and that would be the end
But as the weeks turned into months  I saw you overcome your fears
And as we became companions  all those months turned into years
When we would talk and talk for hours  you would make sure I felt heard
'Cause you knew what I was sayin' though I never said a word
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh  I'm ready for anything
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh  who knows what the tide could bring?

But I'm grateful I was with you through the sunshine and the rain
And when I wonder where ya are now  I'll probably never know
But my friend  I hope you made it and somehow you finally made it home (Ooh-ooh-ooh)
I have an ocean-worth of questions  but if I do know one thing
It's that the sun will rise tomorrow  and who knows what the tide could bring?
Doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-ooh-ooh
And like that  nobody knew where I was at
And all my logic said I would never see you again
After four years of missin' you so bad  but here I am
And now I have to learn to let you go
Even though I love you more than you'll ever know
I'm gettin' used to half a heart and the way things are
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh  I'm ready for anything

Videotapes and ice skates are beautiful things
Like a pocket watch on Kelly Time and a pair of angel wings
But I am a heavy dreamer
My imagination gives me wings
And I can go anywhere
And when I wander away to some other place
Where passenger trains catch fire and fill the sky with flames
And that black rabbit of death wakes up in a breath

Hopped on a train and headed west
Got a job at a St. Mary restaurant
Washing dishes and making friends
The years went by like the seasons
And they brought him a lifetime of joy
He bought ten or twelve acres of heaven
With a paradise vantage point
And he built a cabin at the foot of the mountains
That stole his heart when he was a boy
Get lost in Montana
Where your heart can finally roam
Get lost in Montana
Where the mountains call you home
Get lost forever in Montana
His son worked hard in West Glacier
His daughter sold souvenirs
And he always went back to Polebridge
With his family every year
To his green tin roof in the Rockies
And his sky so full of stars
His spirit lives in these mountains
Where Montana first stole his heart

So get lost in the Big Sky Country
Where adventure calls your name
Every moment is worth more than diamonds
When you spend time in the treasure state
So get lost in the Big Sky Country
 and You alone
 and I can't go on

I thought I had a map in here
The driver's door doesn't lock
I bought the car my junior year
There's candy in my backpack
And you can pick our soundtrack
We're heading for the East Coast tonight
So pack your bags and hold on tight
'Cause we're taking off
We're taking off
Run away with me
We're on the way to New York City
Take my hand and see
Manhattan never looked so pretty
Travel light and see the world right
Run away with me
Feet up on the dashboard
We're driving with the windows down
Did you forget your phone cord?
We'll buy one in the next small town
Get dinner at an IHOP
A shower at a truck stop
We'll listen to some Johnny Cash
Take my hand and don't look back

He doesn't read minds or levitate
But every time my world needs saving
He's my Superman
Some folks don't believe in heroes
'Cause they haven't met my dad
He loves his workshop and rock 'n roll
He's got a hot rod and a heart of gold
And you could say he's a man of few words
But he talks a lot within
And even though' I'm a little taller
I still look up to him
He built me a house in the arms of a tree
He taught me to drive and to fight and to dream
My dad's a hero to me
Rust ridden fenders and doors full of dings
Somehow he can fix about anything
I didn't think he knew how to cry
Till our dog died that year
He doesn't always say I love you
But I can hear him loud and clear

And we'll stir the stars around
And watch them fall away into the Hudson Bay
And plummet out of sight and sound
The open summer breeze will sweep you through the hills
Where I live in the alpine heights
The weekend we were in love
(The weekend we were in love)
Home among these mountain tops can be so awfully dull
A thousand miles from the tide
But photos on the walls of New York shopping malls
Distract me so I stay inside
I wish the rockets stayed over the promenade
'Cause I would make a hook and eye
We're hanging on so take us high
To sing the world goodbye
I am floating away
Lost in a silent ballet

And sheets on the tables and chairs
The silverware swam with the sharks in the sink
I've been longing for
Daisies to push through the floor
And I wish plant life would grow all around me
So I won't feel dead anymore
So I won't feel dead anymore
I saw a bear in the den
Readin' my textbooks again
Bats flowed like traffic as they poured from the attic
I'd rather waltz than just walk through the forest
The trees keep the tempo and they sway in time
Quartet of crickets chime in for the chorus
If I were to pluck on your heartstrings
Would you strum on mine?
I've been longing for
(I've been longing for)
Daisies to push through the floor
(I've never really felt like this before)
And I wish plant life would grow all around me
So I won't feel dead anymore

And give me a ghost of a smile
So just grin and bear it a while

I'd rather waltz than just walk through the forest
The trees keep the tempo and they sway in time
Quartet of crickets chime in for the chorus
If I were to pluck on your heartstrings
Would you strum on mine?
(The brook babbles on about nothing at all)
(A new leaf turns over unwilling to fall)
Tonight I'm busting out
Of this old haunted house
Because I'm sick of waiting for
All the spider webs to grow all around me
Because I don't feel dead anymore
And I'm not afraid anymore
I'd rather waltz than just walk through the forest
The trees keep the tempo and they sway in time
Quartet of crickets chime in for the chorus
If I were to pluck on your heartstrings
Would you strum on mine?
If I were to pluck on your heartstrings
Count from 1 to 10 and open them
All these heavy thoughts will try to weigh you down  but not this time
Way up in the air you're finally free
And you can stay up there right next to me
All this gravity will try to pull you down  but not this time
When the sun goes down  and the lights burn out
Then it's time for you to shine
Brighter than a shooting star  so shine no matter where you are
Fill the darkest night with a brilliant light
'Cause it's time for you to shine
Brighter than a shooting star  so shine no matter where you are tonight
Brighter than a shooting star
Shine no matter where you are tonight

And fan the flame so hot it melts our hearts

'cause I can't put to bed these phobias and fears
I'm new to this grief I can't explain
But I'm no stranger to the heartache and the pain
But I know better than to leave and let it die
I'm a Silhouette asking every now and then
Is it over yet? Will I ever feel again?
I'm a Silhouette chasing rainbows on my own
But the more I try to move on the more I feel alone
So I watch the summer stars to lead me home
I'm sick of the past I can't erase
A jumble of footprints and hasty steps I can't retrace
The mountain of things that I still regret
Is a vile reminder that I would rather just forget
(No matter where I go)

Whenever we pretend it's summer
Then I'm the worm
But fair is fair
If my segments get separated
I'll scream
And you'll be there
Close your eyes
(Close my eyes)

And feel the shine

I'm hooked so toss me over
And cast the line
I'll throw a party and greet my undersea friends
(It depends)
As they arrive

You and I left our troubles far behind

Between the ears
If you're my girl
Swirl me around your room with feeling
And as we twirl
The glow in the dark stars on your ceiling
Will shine for us
As love sweeps over the room
Because we tend to make
Each other blush
(You make me blush)
You and I left our troubles far behind
(Troubles far behind)
But I still have just one more question on my mind
For all my pals who live in the oceans and the seas
Who needs anemones?
And it's plain to see
That we were meant to be

If you're the bird

 I drew my over shirt
 I've never felt so at home

 do you wish we'd fall in love?

But I've delivered papers in the rain like that before
As I grabbed my bike and rode into the dark
The wind was pickin' up and howling louder all the time
The sky churned like a cauldron and the distant thunder roared
And I knew that I was in for quite a storm
Lightning struck an oak tree as I leapt off my bike
So I crawled into a culvert to wait it out
The little bit of courage I had left was almost gone

It sounded like a freight train was dragging me to hell

Save me from this terrible nightmare
That was when I saw my family with my eyes shut real tight
Would they know how much I loved them if this was how I died?
So I kept hanging on (Ooh)
(Ooh) I kept hanging on
(Ooh)
The shadows slowly melted as I was hunkered down
I crept out of that culvert and I went weak in the knees
'Cause what I saw was a somber sight to see
There was nothing but destruction and wreckage in that town
Cars were upside down and houses leveled to the ground
A twisted trampoline was hangin' from the power lines
I blinked a tear back as I felt lucky to be alive
And that was how I learned to live
When you can run but you can't hide
How to feel trapped in a tunnel
But come out the other side
'Cause with all the stormy weather in the world
You learn to take life one storm at a time
You don't have to be afraid
And I keep hanging on because it's always darkest before the dawn
And I keep hanging on
Cause the father she loved left and never looked back
He told her he loved her and then he was gone
She tried to look happy in front of her friends
But knew that she'd never feel normal again
She fought back the tears as they filled her eyes
And wanted him back just to tell him goodbye
When the rain falls down
When it all turns around
When the light goes out this isn't the end
Her dad was a good guy that everyone liked
But nobody knew he was dying inside
He promised his family he'd be all right
And then with a gunshot he left them behind
When the rain falls down
When it all turns around
When the light goes out this isn't the end
When the rain falls down
When it all turns around
When the light goes out this isn't the end

The future's a mystery and anything goes
Love is confusing and life is hard
You fight to survive cause you made it this far
It's all too astounding to comprehend
It's just the beginning this isn't the end
'Cause I believe you'd unfold your paper heart and wear it on your sleeve
All my life I wish I broke mirrors  instead of promises
'Cause all I see  is a shattered conscience staring right back at me
I wish I had covered all my tracks completely 'cause I'm so afraid
Is that the light at the far end of the tunnel or just the train?
Lift your arms  only heaven knows where the danger grows
And it's safe to say there's a bright light up ahead and help is on the way
Help is on the way
Help is on the way
Help is on the way
Help is on the way
I forget the last time I felt brave  I just recall insecurity
'Cause it came down like a tidal wave  and sorrow swept over me
Depression  please cut to the chase and cut a long story short
Oh  please be done  how much longer can this drama afford to run?
Fate looks sharp  severs all my ties
And breaks whatever doesn't bend
But sadly then  all my heavy hopes just pull me back down again
Back down again
Back down again
Back down again
Back down again
Back down again
Back down again

It hurts just to wake up  whenever you're wearing thin
Alone on the outside  so tired of looking in
The end is uncertain and I've never been so afraid
But I don't need a telescope to see that there's hope
There's a dreamy world up there
Dear friends in higher places
Carry me away from here
'Cause your flight is about to leave
And there's more to this brave adventure
Than you'd ever believe
'Cause they're all around you
Wide eyes will always brighten the blue
So bid the forest floor goodbye as you race the wind
And take to the sky (you take to the sky)
On the heels of war and wonder

You can't whisper above the thunder
But you can fly anywhere
Purple burst of paper birds
This picture paints a thousand words
So take a breath of myth and mystery
And don't look back

And I lie awake and miss you
Pour me a heavy dose of atmosphere
'Cause I'll doze off safe and soundly
But I'll miss your arms around me
'Cause I wish you were here
I'll watch the night turn light blue
But it's not the same without you
Because it takes two to whisper quietly
The silence isn't so bad
'Til I look at my hands and feel sad
'Cause the spaces between my fingers
Are right where yours fit perfectly
I'll find repose in new ways
Though I haven't slept in two days
'Cause cold nostalgia chills me to the bone
But drenched in vanilla twilight

Waist-deep in thought because when I think of you
I don't feel so alone
I don't feel so alone
I don't feel so alone
I'll think of you tonight

It's just a matter of time before we learn how to fly
Welcome to the rhythm of the night
There's something in the air you can't deny
So let me know before I wave goodbye
When can I see you again?
When can we do this again?
When can I see you again?
When can we do this again?
Yeah it's been fun but now I've got to go
Life is way too short to take it slow
B-b-before I go and hit the road
Tell me when
When can I see you again?
When can I see you again? (Tell me whe-e-en)
When life drags me down
I wanna let go
But when my spirit is weak
You come to my aid
And strengthen my soul
I'm lost without You
I'll never doubt You
Your grace is beyond compare
You know all I have is Yours
You smile when You hear my prayer
I'll never wander on my own
For I am Yours until you call me home
You might also like
Some days I just can't go on
I stumble and fall
And I hang my head
But You reach out for my hand
And You lift me up
Again and again
I'm lost without You
I'll never doubt You
Your grace is beyond compare
You know all I have is Yours
You smile when You hear my prayer
I'll never wander on my own
For I am Yours until you call me home
In the face of my depravity
My fire burns 'till He returns
I'll never wander on my own
For I am Yours until you call me home"
