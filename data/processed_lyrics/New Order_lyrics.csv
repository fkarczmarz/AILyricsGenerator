"When Johnny came home with a gift for me
To think of me at this point in time
He told me to close my eyes
My gift would be a great surprise
I saw tears were in his eyes
He never meant to hurt me
There's so many ways our lives have changed
Can I save my life at any price?
For God's sake won't you listen to me?
And though he was ashamed that he had took a life
Johnny came home with another wife
And he often remembered how it used to be
There's too many ways that you could kill someone

My gift would be a great surprise
I saw hatred in his eyes
But he never meant to hurt me
There's so many ways our lives have changed
Can I change my life for any price?
I just want you to be mine
I don't want this world to shine
I don't want this bridge to burn
I just want to feel free
I will always feel free
I will always feel free
All on the corner sent by me
Shadows the ways
Straight away you ran from me
Heard you calling
Yes  I heard you calling
Heard you calling
Yes  I heard you calling
I hear silence
I hear silence in my heart
From a distance
Turn your back and run from me
Heard you calling

Can you hear me deep inside?

 they hurt me so
 oh
 I've lost you
 I've lost you
 I've lost you
Or lecture me with poetry and tell me that I can
I don't remember what happened yesterday
But I don't give a damn about what all those people say
It takes years to find the nerve to be apart from what you've done
To find the truth inside yourself and not depend on anyone
It takes years to find the nerve to be apart from what you've done
To find the truth inside yourself and not depend on anyone
It don't take no Houdini to tell me what I am
But I don't give a damn about what those people say
It takes years to find the nerve to be apart from what you've done
To find the truth inside yourself and not depend on anyone
It takes years to find the nerve to be apart from what you've done
To find the truth inside yourself and not depend on anyone
It takes years to find the nerve to be apart from what you've done
 but it's not what I see
 that’s okay
 not a care
 that’s okay
I feel shot right through with a bolt of blue
Living a life that I can't leave behind
There's no sense in telling me
The wisdom of the fool won't set you free
But that's the way that it goes and it's what nobody knows
Every time I see you falling
I get down on my knees and pray
I'm waiting for that final moment
You say the words that I can't say
I feel fine and I feel good
I'm feeling like I never should
Why can't we be ourselves like we were yesterday?
I'm not sure what this could mean
I don't think you're what you seem
I do admit to myself that if I hurt someone else
Then I'll never see just what we're meant to be

While I walked down to the beach

Here comes love  it's like honey
You can't buy it with money  you're not alone anymore
(whenever you're here with me)
You shock me to the core  you shock me to the core
We're like crystal  it's not easy

I don't belong to no one

But I can't change the way that I am

A simple movement or rhyme
Could be the smallest of signs
We'll never know what they are or care

To be given your sight
Hid in a long peaceful night
A nervous bride for your eyes
A fractured smile that soon dies
A love that's wrong from your life and soul
A savage mine had begun
A long farewell to your love and soul
A long farewell to your soul
Now I know what those hands would do
But never guess how the 'Him' would scream
But never guess how the 'Him' would scream
Was the worst

Lost

Confusion sprung up from devotion
A halo that covers my eyes

Too young
To get a hold on me
You're much too young

To mess around with me

And that's why we could be
But you're too young

You know I've met a lot of cool chicks
But you've got style
And you've got class
But most of all
A tear in a stranger's eye
Then it goes forever
Where all things never die
People look whenever
These places have been won
Minds just go on breathing
When these moments have begun
Taken from the killing ground
By an all providing hand
With no sense or reason
Making the final demands
Taking good advantage of
All the things I'm told
I wash my hands in innocence
When you start taking hold
Love that was special for one
Waste in the fever and heat
How I wish you were here with me now
Body that curls in and hides
Hardships that often belie
Warm like a dog round your feet
How I wish you were here with me now
Hangman looks round as he waits
Cord stretches tight then it breaks
Someday we will die in your dreams
I see a thousand people just like me
A hundred unions in the snow
We live always underground
It's going to be so quiet in here tonight
There's a thousand islands in the sea
It's a shame
And a hundred years ago
A sailor trod this ground I stood upon
Take me away everyone
When it hurts thou
From my head to my toes
From the words in the book
I see a vision that would bring me luck
From my head to my toes

And makes the wounds that time won't heal
There is no end to this
I can't turn away another picture

An attack that won't subside

Like summer never happened
We're players on a stage
With roles already scripted

On a giant piece of dirt
Spinning in the universe

One day at a time
Inch by inch
For every kiss
On lovers' lips
For all lost souls
Who can't come home
For friends not here

Is make the right impression

And make it last for a while
Do all the things you can do at home
Maybe once in a while get away somewhere special
Create a memory that would last forever
In those days we spent together
They say the secret of our happiness is unconditional love
And brotherhood and trying to be good and trying not to drink
Not giving cold down in the wastes of the grim and mire
In the dark and the sun of the mire
Not getting pulled down in the wastes of the mire
I'd rather be a lover than a liar
I'd rather be a lover than a supplier
If the secret of happiness is unconditional love
Why don't you miss me?
And I feel a need for you
I feel it like the day we met all those years ago
Those times were hard to hold on to
But nothing stays the same
Like the atom and that bomb that causes so much pain
So I came in from the cold with nowhere left to go
And I gave away my freedom and the calling of the wild
So I came in from the cold and I chose to be with you
I chose
To be (growls)
With you
When it gets late at night
I move round in the dark
And leave when it gets light
I sit around by day
Tied up in chains so tight
These crazy words of mine
So wrong they could be right
What do I get out of this?
One of these days you'll go back to your home
You won't even notice that you are alone
One of these days when you sit by yourself
You'll realise you can't shaft without someone else
In the end you will submit
It's got to hurt you a little bit
I like talking in my sleep
When people work so hard
They need what they can't keep
A choice that leaves them scarred
A view without a room
Unveils the truth so soon

One word conversations do not work somehow
When one way conversations pay a price for the use of love?
I tried so hard last night  you would not talk to me
I live with the fear of the few with the gift
And I know what's going to be
Why did you never speak my name in front of my family?
You gave a gift that you then took away like you never did before
No one told the truth about it because it was so strong
Whatever I have done for you I did because you complained
When you're not here by my side
I see your make up on the shelf
And a photograph of someone else
And it breaks me up like I don't exist
Do you ever listen to what I have to say?
As life unfolded that one short day
Girl you've got me hanging like a bird caught on a wire

Oh  it's the last time
And I've never met anyone quite like you before
Thought I heard your words
Now how do I feel?
Still find it so hard
And I'm not sure how you'll tell me
Just how I should feel today
Tell me now
How should I feel?
These times I find no words to say
A crime I once committed failed me
Too much of heaven's eyes I saw through
Only when meanings have no reason
They're taken beyond your sense of right (And wrong)
Small boy kneels humble in a great hall
He placed hands to the air above him
This is the reason that I came here
To be so near to such a person
Thinking hard about the weather
Then came by a friend of mine
Suggested we go out together
Then I knew it from the start
This friend of mine would fall apart
Pretending not to see his gun
I have always thought about
Staying here and going out
Tonight I should have stayed at home
Playing with my pleasure zone
He has always been so strange
I'd often thought he was deranged
Pretending not to see his gun

When you are alone at night
You search yourself for all the things
That you believe are right
If you give it all away
You throw away your only chance to be here today
Then a fight breaks out on your street
You lose another broken heart in a land of meat
Now I know the perfect kiss is the kiss of death
And the night becomes the day
We shall remain forever
Everyone who meets this way
When the rain falls to the sea
They'll be waiting for you and for me
And the sky reflects our image
Trying to sleep right through our lives
I am still here two days later
And I'm stuck here two years too long

Their love died three years ago
It's always the same
I've studied the cracks and the wrinkles
You were always so vain
But now you live your life like a shadow
In the pouring rain
And it belongs to us
It's called love
And it belongs to everyone but us
I've lived my life in the valleys
I've lived my life on the hills
I've lived my life on alcohol
I've lived my life on pills
But it's called love
And it belongs to us
It's called love
And it's the only thing that's worth living for
It's called love
And it belongs to us
It's called love

Love is the cure for every evil
Love is the air that supports the eagle
It's called love
And it's so uncool
It's called love
And somehow it's become unmentionable
It's called love
And it belongs to everyone of us
It's called love
It's called love and it belongs to us
We all feel the same
All pleasure and nothing to gain
I've known you from the start
I've grown used to your wooden heart
Now you know my name
You search your empty brain in vain
If you don't change your ways
You'll end up here with me unraised
Without you they'll never know
Without you my life won't flow
Without you they'll never show
Without you the night won't go
Without you I'm left alone
Without you I'm on my own
Without you I live in pain
Without you I've gone insane
Now you must decide
What good's a lie when you've nothing to hide
Maps they'll never show
It's time we said goodbye
Bury your head and silence your cry
Know the feel of pain
Join our world and play our game

Something's got a hold on me
I get this feeling I'm in motion
A certain sense of liberty
And I don't care if I'm here tomorrow
Again and again I've taken too much
Of the things that cost you too much
I used to think that the day would never come
I'd see the light in the shade of the morning Sun
My morning sun is the drug that brings me near
I used to think that the day would never come
That my life would depend on the morning Sun
When I was a very small boy
Very small boys talked to me
Now that we've grown up together
They're afraid of what they see
That's the price that we all pay
And the value of destiny comes to nothing
I can't tell you where we're going
I guess there's just no way of knowing

In such a lonely way
I saw some children dance
I watched my life in a trance
And the people around me
Seemed so glad to be here
Will my time pass so slowly
On the day that I fear?
And the noise that surrounds me
Pulls so loud in my head
From the promise that healed us
To the lies that I said
Oh  it's a strange day
In such a lonely way
Some people look down on me
I know they like what they see
Strange day
Such a strange day
Amore mio

Life is so crazy these days
I don't know how to adjust
Are we the master or slave?
Do we need passion or lust?
Are we just caught in a daze?
So many words in a phrase

You've got me where it hurts
But I don't really care
'Cause I know I'm OK
Whenever you are there
You take me to a place
I always wanna go
You always make me high
Whenever I feel low
I'm paper in your hand
I'm under your command
And I'll never let you go

I had a beautiful dream
For a picture so serene
But I don't know what it means - love
I just want your love
Generations lost in space

And sometimes I just can't go on

I know my eyes are burning bright

Quella canzone
These years gone by
Deep within
Burn my skin
All those years gone by
In the heat of the night
All those years gone by
Who felt those cold hands?
Who felt those cold hands?
Touch my skin
Deep within
Burn my soul
Fell to the ground where I was found
All those years ago
All those years ago
All those years ago
Everybody makes mistakes
Everybody makes mistakes
Even me
Just be free
This is a place where in the end
It happens in our world within

At the hands of one another
If you like a sleeping demon
Listen  can you hear him weepin'?
Tears of joy and tears of sorrow
He buys love to sell tomorrow
My life ain't no holiday
I've been through the point of no return
I've seen what a man can do
I've seen all the hate of a woman too
Feel your heartbeat  lose the rhythm
He can't touch the world we live in
Life is short  but love is strong (Love is strong)
There lies a hope that I have found
And if you try  you'll find it too
Remember why I'm telling you
My life ain't no holiday

We want goals
Well  this league's got a good one
A beauty scored by Bobby Charlton
We want goals
You've got to hold and give  but do it at the right time
You can be slow or fast  but you must get to the line
They'll always hit you and hurt you  defend and attack
There's only one way to beat them  get round the back
Catch me if you can  cause I'm the England man
And what you're looking at is the master plan

It's never been quite the same
No hearing or breathing
Rise and fall of shame
A search that shall remain
We asked you what you'd seen
You said you didn't care
Sound formed in a vacuum may seem a waste of time
It's always been just the same
No hearing or breathing
The sign that leads the way
The path we can not take
You've caught me at a bad time"
