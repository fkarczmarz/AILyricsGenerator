lyrics
" take it easy  slow down
 I said still  you gotta
 don't let it fly right past you
 no matter the time
 paid dues  bought wisdom
 track is visitation
 from Chi to L-I
 I'm still growing
 why bother
 some religion change-over
I-I am-I am happy
(I have a dream) I got a dream
(That one day) We gonna work it out
(That one day) We gonna work it out
(That one day) We gonna work it out
(I have a dream) I got a dream
(That one day) We gonna work it out
(That one day) We gonna work it out
(That one day) We gonna work it out
(I have a dream) I got a dream
(That one day) That one day
(I have a dream)
My dream is to be free
My dream is to be...
My dream is to be...
My dream is to be free
Gunshots coming from sounds of blackness
Given this game with no time to practice
A life with no cabbage
That's no money if you from where I'm from
Dark clouds seem to follow me
I walk with a boulder on my shoulder
Hold the same fight that made Martin Luther the King
I ain't using it for the right thing

My dream is to be free
My dream is to be...
My dream is to be...
My dream is to be free
The world see me lookin' in the mirror
Rap music in the hood play the fatherly role
Tryna make it from a gangsta to a godlier role
Hate has no color or age
The world waiting for me to yell I Have a Dream
(I have a dream) I got a dream
(That one day) We gonna work it out
(That one day) We gonna work it out
(That one day) We gonna work it out
(I have a dream) I got a dream

My dream is to be free
My dream is to be...
My dream is to be...
But what you gon' do if you got one gun?
I sing a song for the hero unsung
With faces on the mural of the revolution
Tell the preacher God got more than one son
Tell the law my Uzi weighs a ton
I walk like a warrior from them I won't run
On the streets they try to beat us like a drum
The same they did Kobe and Michael Jackson
Make them the main attraction
Turn around and attack them
Them boy chat chat on how him pop gun
I got the black strap to make the cops run
Them dick boys got a lotta cock in them
My people on the block got a lotta Pac in them
To sleep
Stay true to what I do so the youth dream come
How can we follow leader when this a corrupt one?
The government's a G-Unit and they might buck young
Black people in the urban area one
I hold up a peace sign but I carry a gun
In the Spirit of the Ancestors
In the Spirit of the Black Panthers
In the Spirit of Assata Shakur
We make this movement towards freedom
Cover your eyes as I describe a scene so violent
Shot twice with her hands up
Police questioned but shot before she answered
Scandalous the police were as they kicked and beat her
To life  she thought she'd live with no arm
They moved her room to room  she could tell by the light
Who shot the trooper? they asked her
Her mind raced till things got still
They lied and denied visits from her lawyer
But she was building as they tried to destroy her
If it wasn't for this German nurse they would've served her worse
I wonder what would happen if that would've been me?
All of this just so we could be free

Your power and pride is beautiful
May God bless your soul
It seemed like the middle of the night when the law awakened her
Though she kind of knew
What made the ride peaceful was the trees and the sky was blue
Arrived to Middlesex Prison about 6 in the morning
Uneasy as they pushed her to the second floor in
Put in the basement of a prison with all males
Away from people so long she forgot how to speak
She discovered freedom is a unspoken sound
And a wall is a wall and can be broken down
Found peace in the Panthers she went on trial with
One of the brothers she had a child with
Out of this situation a girl was conceived
And lactated to attack hate
'Cause federal and state was built for a Black fate
Her emptiness was filled with beatings and court dates
And said she robbed places that didn't exist
In the midst of threats on her life and being caged with Aryan whites
Through dark halls of hate she carried the light
I wonder what would happen if that would've been me
All of this just so we could be free
All of this just so we could be free
Your power and pride is beautiful
May God bless your soul
News that she had had a dream
Her dreams always meant what they needed them to mean
What made them real was the action in between
She dreamt that Assata was free in their old house in Queens
The fact that they always came true was the thing
Assata had been convicted of a murder she couldn't've done
Medical evidence shown she couldn't have shot the gun
It's time for her to see the sun from the other side
Time for her daughter to be by her mother's side
Time for this beautiful woman to become soft again
She untangled the chains and escaped the pain
How she broke out of prison I could never explain
And even to this day they try to get to her
But she's free with political asylum in Cuba
May God bless your soul
May God bless your soul
Yes
I wanna be as free as the spirits of those who left
And everything a nigga do may not be what he might say
Shorties blunted-eyed and everyone wanna rhyme
We got arms but won't reach for the skies
And realize I'ma learn through her
The Messiah might even return through her
The chosen one from the land of the frozen sun
Where drunk nights get remembered more than sober ones
Explored the world to return to where my soul begun
Trayvon'll never get to be an older man
Black children  they childhood stole from them
Robbed of our names and our language  stole again
Who stole the soul from black folk?
Same man that stole the land from Chief Black Smoke
And made the whip crackle on our back slow
And made us go through the back door
And raffle black bodies on the slave blocks
Now we slave to the blocks  on 'em we spray shots
Leaving our own to lay in a box
Black mothers' stomachs stay in a knot
We kill each other  it's part of the plot
I wish the hating will stop (war!) and the battle with us
I know that Black Lives Matter  and they matter to us
These are the things we gotta discuss
The new plantation  mass incarceration
Instead of educate  they'd rather convict the kids
As dirty as the water in Flint  the system is
Is it a felony or a misdemeanor?
Maria Sharapova making more than Serena
It took Viola Davis to say this
The roles of the help and the gangstas is really all they gave us
We need Avas  Ta-Nehisis  and Cory Bookers
The salt of the Earth to get us off of sugar
And greasy foods  I don't believe the news
Or radio  stereotypes we refuse
Brainwashed in the cycle to spin
We write our own story  black America again
You might also like
Hot damn  black America again
Think of Sandra Bland as I'm staring in the wind
The color of my skin  they comparing it to sin
The darker it gets  the less fairer it has been
The hate the hate made  I inherited from them
But I ain't gon' point the finger
Need to hear them songs sometimes to believe me
Who freed me: Lincoln or Cadillac?
Drinkin' or battle raps? Or is it Godspeed that we travel at?
Endangered in our own habitat
The guns and dope  man  y'all can have it back
As a matter of fact  we them lab rats
You build the projects for  now you want your hood back
I guess if you could rap  you would express it too
That PTSD  we need professionals
You know what pressure do  it make the pipes bust
From schools to prison  y'all  they tryna pipe us
Tell your political parties invite us
Instead of making voting laws to spite us
You know  you know we from a family of fighters
Fought in your wars and our wars
You put a nigga in Star Wars  maybe you need two
And then  maybe then we'll believe you
See black people in the future
We wasn't shipped here to rob and shoot ya
We hold these truths to be self-evident
All men and women are created equal
Including black Americans
We are rewriting the black American story
We are rewriting the black American story
We are rewriting the black American story
We are rewriting the black American story
We are rewriting the black American story
We are rewriting the black American story
We are rewriting the black American story
We are rewriting the black American story
We are rewriting the black American story
We are rewriting the black American story

Aston Martin king  Luther with dreams
The young Denzel the way I move through scenes
I’m like a preacher that once was a fiend
A story of change that came with wings
Pretty as the skyline  the sky is my eyeline
Son of the most so from up high I shine
Suited in Prada  stay mellow like lala
I’m the cum-lada  top of the class
Black Wall Street so my stock will never crash
Given what I ask  pure religion and cash
From the windows that open  I’m raising my glass
Daylight beams  night life schemes
This is my inception  I’m writing my dreams
Immortal view of a star doing what I’m born to do
I see the blue sky  see the Lord's coming through

Ohh  in the sky we'll find the light
Now we in the skies  blue skies
And we going higher  that's right
It all started with a dream  I wanted to be Run–D.M.C
The Lord put the blessing upon the MC
O to the M  dreams were spoken to him
That's when I knew my flows would overflow to the rim
Open my eyes  yes sir this is what I'm made for
To go hard in the paint like D. Wade or
D. Rose  from the same streets that we rose
International heroes at world primos
Red carpet magic  taking pictures with the president
Told him for health care  my music is the medicine
My name holds weight  I am never hesitant
Different state resident  this is hood elegance
SLS classic  pursuing my passion
NOVA Fashion  now I'm Oscar party crashing
Immortal view of a star doing what I’m born to do
I see the blue sky  see the Lord's coming through
Ohh  in the sky we'll find the light
Now we in the skies  blue skies
And we going higher  that's right
Silhouettes of dreams that we had high  huh
Even now it don't seem so bad  ma
Close my eyes to see things in front of me
I'm gone now  imagine what I'm gonna be
Dirty to worthy  now I'm all wordy
My broad up in Paris  looking all purty
Immortal view of a star doing what I'm born to do
I see the blue sky  see the Lord's coming through
Now we in the skies  blue skies
And we going higher  that's right
I had these dreams in my head of an endless sphere
I could see it from my window
Wouldn't take that long to get me there
Keep running til' I can go
Remember the beautiful things that life could give me
Crazy how I'm the one
Could've been anywhere  but I'm sitting in the air
With the wheels up staring at the sun
Ohh  in the sky we'll find the light
Ohh  until high we'll shine at night
Now we in the skies  blue skies
(*beat scratches*)
From beginning to end (*beat scratches*)
Here's a little story that must be told (*beat scratches*)
From beginning to end}
I got so much trouble on my mind
So I take time out my day
Hopin' that I keep my soul
And I ain't even got a bomber
But ain't shit to do
Tryin' to find me some light
So now I sing the new negro spiritual
Stand up for your rights
Don't give up the fight
When you never had to stand under the rain?
I found you

As I walk down the road of existence
I get resistance from all angles
I tangle for cash
Hopin' it'll last 'til the end of the week
But all I eat is fast food
And you know how junk food goes right through ya
Knowin' that once I'm done with that I'll be back
To get some more
Once I get started I don't wanna stop (ahh...)
One day
I'm cruisin' down a one-way street
And I done passed *fun* day- three blocks ago
As I maneuver through the manure I try to be responsible
I want a job but I ain't lookin' (how come?)
But that disintegrated to a state that stagnated
I procrastinated
And I had a plan
But things didn't go through
The way they were supposed to
Thank God I found you
(*scratch*) {here's a little story that must be told}
{here's a little story that must be told} (*scratches*)
And try to keep my
Concentration In this idiotic nation
Adjacent to that situation
I want an occupation that I'm into
Cause yet have I begin to
When there was just' 'sunshine'
I don't think I'll ever be happy until I rest in peace
But thank God I found you

We were from different cities on the same block
Grew up in different circles in the same spot
Like raindrops we fall in love giving our all
Showing her ring off like a player at the ball
I recall the walls that I had up
Attracted to women for things that didn't matter
Ka-clow boom pop! Sound of my heart when it drop
The night that I met her  it might be forever
I hear people saying that they like us together
I ain't afraid to gamble when life is getting better
With you  I admit I had issues
Like ebony  your essence  your pedigree  your presence
It's more than clothes can say for you
When I shop I gotta spend more than a day for you
I pray for you and us  that we imbue through lust
And accrue the trust  let's shake off the dust
From the cloth

Ahh  oh
This is tailor-made love  fit like a snug
Anything we can bear so let's have some cubs
You were there when my cuz passed away
Not only does love  but life hatches day
I appreciate the hugs and the days I breed with you
Strong seeds I can see with you  the good word I read with you
Looking at things that we've been through
Things that seem simple
I know when to go hard and when to be gentle
Sentimental laughs and expressions
Let's stay in the present  no time for second guessing
You said it's this cloth that makes you feel naked
The truth we address it  that's so unexpected
Yeah that's the thread that helps us move ahead
Your hunger for affection will always be fed
Thank God we never sped and let love take its course
Cause what's inside of us  no need to outsource
The cloth
Oh  you're worried about when people stop and stare
That's just a tear on those beautiful clothes you wear
Cut from the same  cloth you just want to wear

Are we living in a dream world?
Are your eyes still green  girl?
I know you're sick and tired of arguing
But you can't keep it bottled in
Jealousy  we got to swallow it
Your heart and mind  baby follow it
And when you feel opposite
I just want you to know
Your whole  being is beautiful
I'ma do the best I can do
Cause I'm my best when I'm with you
Come close to me  baby

What's it without you? (Nothin'  nothin')

Has been sort of hard on you
But I see the God in you
I just want to nurture it
Though this love may hurt a bit

It's this thing now  that's drivin' me wild
I gotta see what's up before it gets me down
It's this thing now  that's drivin' me wild
I gotta see what's up before it gets me down
Love is not a mystery  it's everything
She was the type to watch Oprah and the Today Show
Had a body  A body that you can't pay fo'
That mean she had some Ds on her but they wasn't fake though
Had a drive for a drive for Rodeo
She spent pesos on those labels
Spin class at the gym  strip tease on a pole
She was so obsessed with her body and clothes
To every party she goes  tryin hard to be chose
They say it's hard for a pimp but extra hard for these (hoes)
Readin Us and People mag  tryna get the scoop
Chasin a actor for a Bentley Coupe
She been through the ball player from the Clippers  then came the pumps off
All thinkin she number one where she was just a jumpoff
Doin all she can for a man and a baby
Drivin herself crazy like the astronaut lady

Love is not a mystery  it's everything
He had paper since we was in we was in high school
Pop was a doc  mom taught at my school
Lock with the rocks  in his ears he kept jewels
One of the Diddy types  da D-D-Dame Dash dudes
Pushed a Maserati sport  reading the Robb Report
Wanted to be Mike but he was never live at sports
Since golf is in he was on the drivin course
To live the rap life is what he was strivin for
Spendin cash at the bar to get credit
Drinkin Chaundon just because Big said it
They say Ye is but dude was big headed
Rocked the fur in the summer so somebody'd pet it
He had a fetish for shoes that's athletic
Pathetic on his MySpace page half nekkid
It's a shame what they do for fame and to be respected
Joe  you coulda got it if you never woulda stressed it
It's this thing now  that's drivin' me wild
I gotta see what's up before it gets me down

Love is not a mystery  it's everything
They was one of them couples  people said they were the it
Unbreakable  like Bobby and Whit
Or Ryan and Reese  or Kimora and Russ
Relationships can be dead but look live to us
I guess we all been through it where we try too much
Losin yourself and you're lyin' and stuff
Wishin for the diamond cuffs  in search of a ring
Where love is not a mystery it's everything
It's this thing now  that's drivin' me wild
I gotta see what's up before it gets me down
It's this thing now  that's drivin' me wild
I gotta see what's up before it gets me down

 yeah)
 in my mind it occurred
 I mean the heart on my neck
 I would reflect on the streets of the Chi'
 'cause I know for me She'd die
 call on Her like I'm chirpin' Her
 she was his lady's best friend
 some ladies test men
 Why do men always have to stray?
 these were his confessions
 you a blessin' and my best friend
 to the end)
 I'm gonna be so faithful
About to have a little boy or baby girl. Who knows?
So bust it out this is what I was thinkin' check it
Yo the education of the Lon chicka Lonnie Lynn
Being my bloodline is one with the divine
Some say that God is Black and the devil's White
Just told believe in Jesus cause for me he did die
Curiosity killed the catechism
Understanding and wisdom became the rhythm that I played to
And became a slave to master self
And use religion as an emblem
When it should be a natural way of life
Who am I or they to say to whom you pray ain't right
That's who got you doing right and got you this far
Whether you say in Jesus name or Hum do Allah
Long as you know it's a bein' that's supreme to you
You let that show towards others in the things you do

I've lived and I've learned
I have taken and I've earned
I have failed and I have tried
Found joy through all my pain
I just wanna be happy with being me
Let me voice my concern
So many of my fellow brothers have given themselves a title that their actions didn't earn
Our ignorance is in the same breath as our innocence
I've finally come to the realization why Black people in the worse place
'Cause it's hard to correct yourself when you don't know who you are in the first place
So I try to find the clue in you
Why're we being lied to? I ain't know our history was purposely hidden
It gave my heartache relief when I started to understand belief
Hustlin' was like a gift spent my share of time in the streets
Taught me survival from this evil I'm just gonna have to deal with
And I felt like a fool when I tried to learn it in school
It almost seemed like a rehearsal when the only science and math are universal
Searched scrolls from the Hebrew Israelites
Some leads were granted with insight
He still created with the imperfection of man
By no means have I forgotten or forgiven what's been done to me but
You gon surely find there's no positivity without negativity
But one side you gonna have to choose
Any chance to speak I refuse to misuse
So how can you call yourself God when you let a worldly possession
Become an obsession and the way you write your rhymes and can't follow your lesson
I've lived and I've learned
I have taken and I've earned
I have failed and I have tried
Found joy through all my pain

From the hood
I want a bitch that look good and cook good
Butt naked in the kitchen flipping pancakes
Plus she trickin' off the dough that her man makes
Fucking in the car cause we just can't wait
The type of bitch that B.I.G. said he would die for
Is the type that I ride and stay alive for
She know shoes like she know survival
Seen her brother die so forever she's strong
Hear Beyonce's song and she gotta perform
Whether fucking or fighting: we getting it on

I notice all my flaws when it comes to writing rhymes
Subject matter be changing too quickly at times
So I keep it strictly 'bout dimes and stick to the story
Call me a pro in the pussy category
Had explicit experiences I shouldn't mention
Powerful women playing the roles of submission
Events having sponsored by some alcohol product
Jumping out a Bentley with some fresh red bottoms
You live your dream with me when you were just in the projects

These are adventures of young black millionaires
I am the voice of the meek and underprivileged
On the move like black slaves through the wilderness
They cracked the bottle then started giving gifts
Show the walking dead who the true and living is
Separate the fake from who the real reals is
Hats from liquor stores to avoid syphilis
I guess it's my addiction to women
Writing my own scripts like I'm Tennessee Williams
Now it's new beginnings like a born again Christian

Is libel to get banged like things that rival tribal slang
Your idol
So we made it to this same end of the road
And we picked up lots of chicks and pots of gold

You the one I can't leave alone

It's been hard to choose another girl

You told me I'm the mane like Gucci
With a chance to rap and make movies

I met this girl when I was ten years old
And what I loved most  she had so much soul
She was old school when I was just a shorty
Never knew throughout my life she would be there for me
On the regular  not a church girl  she was secular
Not about the money  those studs was mic-checkin' her
But I respected her  she hit me in the heart
A few New York niggas had did her in the park
But she was there for me  and I was there for her
Pull out a chair for her  turn on the air for her
And just cool out  cool out  and listen to her
Sittin' on a bone  wishin' that I could do her
Eventually  if it was meant to be  then it would be
‘Cause we related  physically and mentally
And she was fun then  I'd be geeked when she'd come around

Now  periodically  I would see
Ol' girl at the clubs  and at the house parties
She didn't have a body  but she started gettin' thick quick
Did a couple of videos  and became Afrocentric
She was on that tip about stoppin' the violence
About my people she was teachin' me  by not preachin' to me
But speakin' to me  in a method that was leisurely
So easily I approach
She dug my rap  that's how we got close
But then she broke to the West Coast  and that was cool
'Cause around the same time  I went away to school
And I'm a man of expandin'  so why should I stand in her way?
She probably get her money in L.A
And she did stud  she got big pub  but what was foul
She said that the pro-black was goin' out of style
She said  Afrocentricity was of the past
Now  black music is black music  and it's all good
I wasn't salty she was with the Boyz n the Hood
'Cause that was good for her  she was becomin' well-rounded
I thought it was dope how she was on that freestyle shit

I might've failed to mention that this chick was creative
Once The Man got to her  he altered her native
Told her if she got an image and a gimmick
That she could make money  and she did it like a dummy
Now I see her in commercials  she's universal
She used to only swing it with the inner-city circle
Now she be in the burbs  lookin' rock and dressin' hippie
And on some dumb shit when she comes to the city
Talkin' about poppin' Glocks  servin' rocks and hittin' switches
Now she's a gangsta rollin' with gangsta bitches
Always smokin' blunts and gettin' drunk
Tellin' me sad stories  now she only fucks with the funk
Stressin' how hardcore and real she is
She was really the realest  before she got into showbiz
I did her  not just to say that I did it  but I'm committed
(Girl  he's committed) But so many niggas hit it
That she's just not the same  lettin' all these goofies do her
I see niggas slammin' her  and takin' her to the sewer
But I'mma take her back  hopin' that the shit stop

Trippin' off heights  wishin' for nights in different flavors
The age of Kane and Big Daddy  short-body Caddies
Uncles named Larry  that never really grabbed me
My mother gave birth but she really never had me
Left to the hood to play daddy
Raised by niggas named Butch  Scoot or Bae-Bae
With weight so they weigh they status on the streets
License plates that say they  motto
This is Chicago in the heyday
Similar to Good Times  I guess that I was JJ
A skinny nigga  young girls with Penny figures
So many niggas  stacked upon each other
It's the black upon each other that we love so much
Wonder how many of us  these drugs gonna touch
Used to gangbang  ain't really thug that much
Rather have some thick broads and a dutch to clutch
Went to school in Baton Rouge for a couple of years
My college career got downed with a couple of beers
Came back home  now I gotta pay back loans
Same nigga  same block  same shit they on
Only thing different  quicker  they click that chrome

Man to man  I'm good workin' with my hands
My generation never understood workin' for the man

Lost  nobody found us  the force that surrounds us
Ain't with us  they get us on the ground and hit us
We paint pictures of the chains under their names and scriptures
Removed from Earth  only to return through birth
Knew this girl sellin' her body  wish she knew what it was worth
Between God and trash  lookin' in every car that pass
With a walk that suggests head  to milk niggas she was breastfed
She know dairy so she say cheese to get bread
In the area where it's more weaves and less dreads
Kinda scary  amongst thieves and base-heads
Said it was her toes  but I could tell her soul hurt
She was cold turk  growin' up she got to know hurt
Very well in a world where self hate is overt
Her stepfather thought he was Ike  so her mother he strike
She got to like like-minded niggas  who liked crimes and figures
Doin' white lines and liquor  see hard times had kicked her
In the ass  it used to be thicker
Life is fast  some choose to be quicker
I remember in high school she had a passion to sing
Now she see herself in a casket in dreams
These are the children of crack and rap  blacks that lack
Self-esteem  yo we forgot the dream
On our Jeffersons y'all but we forgot the theme
In the Chi  we even rootin' for a garbage team

I’m coming back like the Prodigal Son  and I got a son
And I don’t want my waves following him  the streets swallowing him
And I don’t want no hollows in him  his momma said she see his father in him
Hope it’s the good things  ‘til life was over is when I understood things
Standing at the gates ‘cause I know you’ve forgiven what I’ve done
I’m your son  do I have the keys to get in?
Sweet Lord Jesus  tell the polices to let a nigga breathe
My sinning father see  got a shipment by the seas
See my niggas tryna eat  eat whatever’s on your plate

But these niggas play for keeps and I gotta hold my own
Tryna watch my back ‘cause these stripes ain’t free
Leina took a puff and then she gave it to my father
Used to take the bullets out so I could play with the revolver
Satan serenading ever since I was a toddler
Tell ‘em talk is cheap  niggas living for the dollar
So in God we trust  leave the praying to my momma though
Another motherfucker out of control  just walking my soles low
See I was waking up afraid to see my name on the news

We ain't seen as human beings with feelings

On the streets love is hard to see
It's a place I got to be
Loving you is loving me
How beautiful love can be
On the streets love is hard to see
Gotta reach that frequency
Loving you is loving me
Even found it on the ground where the thugs live
My man had to dig deep to find his
Couldn't sleep cause on the real he had five kids
You and your baby's mom thought that love was a sport
As men we were taught to hold it in
That's why we don't know how 'til we're older men
If love is a place I'ma go again
At times it can take ya for a spin

Some say that I'm a dreamer 'cause I talk about it often
Seen the hardest nigga soften wit' his homie in a coffin
With the right companion we all in it
Reminiscing on letters I wrote in my small days
How beautiful love can be
On the streets love is hard to see
It's a place I got to be
Loving you is loving me
How beautiful love can be
On the streets love is hard to see
Gotta reach that frequency
Made in Black America  metaphor for a predator
Been to the Mediterranean  on my papers like a editor
I flow like a reservoir  dog
Rap Tarantino  off the chain like Django
Still let the chain glow  where they bang though
And niggas get shot like camera angles
In rap videos put up on Vimeo
I'm where the buck 50 bicentennial perennial all-star
Fruit that don't fall far from Islam
I speak  you know I'm in the building like an intercom
Enter Com  the world's most
Intricate  integrated with imminent
Domain  I'm feeling myself like a sentimen-
-Tal letter written to myself
Ask my ex  I still live on like Malcolm
My spirit and style done a transformation
Make room  nigga I don't need reservations
You sweet as a hotel  I stay presidential
Strange to be sinful and know that Heaven sent you
To rearrange the mental  I've seen things we've been through
It's hard for a man to claim gentile  let me change the tempo
I be with broads that got they shit together
Even if it ain't meant forever  still smoke the spliff together
The essence of the herbs  the presence of the words
Yeah you got a chest but I'm treasurin' your curves
You walk past  I'ma look behind you
Look you up and down to find you
Can see I was designed to  give you power and refine you
You fucking with me we can grind to
Gather the better Black America

I wonder if Pac thought we was ready for that or did we move too fast?
They pass that gun law or not  niggas still gon' pop up dead
Used to borrow dollars  now my sense ain't so common
Went across the whole nation screamin' Hiiipower (HiiiPower)
Never been a racist  but I love horsepower
I'm hot  that's why I got the fans in the stands
Em fans googlin'  enemies shakin' hands
Restorin' the balance  detourin' the malice
We kill you motherfuckin' mice with a mallet (uhh)
This is Huey P Newton with a QP
Bobby with a Seale  Fred Hampton on pills
I'm just trying to teach my homies 'bout the Emerald tablets
Stop the war in Syria over a bowl of cereal
Kill a instrumental then book a flight on Expedia

If sometimes you see that I'm mad
No one can always be an angel
When everything goes wrong you see some bad
Well I'm just a soul whose intentions are good
Oh Lord  please don't let me be misunderstood
Yeah  uh (Misunderstood)
We do this  for the people that walk that path
He stood on the corner with the rest of them
Though he knew that this corner wasn't the best of him
Hard streets and a life that crested him
Dirt police domestic beefs that's festerin
He knew the President wadn't addressin him
Though dead presidents was undressin him
Two kids from hot sex no protection and
People don't see how AIDS is affectin 'em
It get hard to get the get the God question in
Can't find a job so you robbin and hustlin
He killed marks and sold dope for cousin 'em
Can't believe they would be the ones bucking him

At heaven's gate  saying Lord please let me in
Or send me back to tell my people to be better men

She danced and she danced  she danced for them
Her body move but her mind was mannequin
Thinkin' I don't know where they hands have been
Relationships with men have been so damagin'
She thought back to when she was at Howard and
Dreams of doing scenes with Terrence Howard and
Broadway plays and dancin' with Alv and them
The ones that make it always ain't the talented
Some dreams get lost never to be found again
At first strippin' seemed so empowering
Most every girl wanna do it now and then
But bein' meat every day is devourin
Cats puttin' paper where she put powder and
Life would break her  now she powdering
She was high when she fell down and then
Crowd surrounding and  heart was pounding and
She fell into a deep sleep the siren sounded and
Seen bright lights in the midst of clouds and then
Talked to God  feeling like His child again
Said Lord let me live so I can make you proud again

Raps are black steel in the hour of commotion
The motion of Com is like that of a ocean
Devotion 'cause I'm the Earth  Wind  and Fire of hip-hop
By Rakim and Short  I've been inspired
My shit knocks environ...ments of cats with seventeen's
I'm sitting with descendants of Abraham
Who say the jam is money  cash  hoes
I went from bashful to asshole to international  lover of self
Word to the mother on my last record cover  it's felt

Niggas  magazine writers  emcees
Who request hot shit  I freeze
And tell them where I was rose  we always said cold
Hold your horses and your carriages
This never-went-gold nigga rocks shows carat-less
You not gon' respect self  at least respect the heritage
Affecting lives is where the wealth and the merit is
I realize what I portray day to day  I gotta carry this
And beats  rhymes and life is where the marriage is
Had dreams of fucking R&B broads  it came true
Journalist I wreck  shared the same view
Picked up a fallen angel on the path that I emcee
Familiar voice  come to find out the angel was me
Some say You changing  Rashid
Times are  we still close

From what you accustomed to hearing everyday  uh-ah

You couldn't hang if you was a poster
Posing like a bitch for exposure
It's rumors of gay emcees  just don't come around me with it
You still rockin hickies  don't let me find out he did it
Got my eyes on the tiger  eyes on the prize
Eyes on the thighs  of Mary J. Blige
Imagining how good the cat must be
Stop eatin meat  lost weight  but I still rap husky
My verse depth  is that of a baby's first step
Or the old lady who died and the nurse wept
I flow like cursive writing  inviting you and yours to my openess
Shows allow me to cop range like a vocalist
But man does not live on bread alone

Real People walk in the streets  the streets is talkin'
Often it's beef this city never does
People walk and talk in they sleep
Cold sweats and wet dreams
On how to get green our faith is all in a jeep
Black souls raw and they deep
Hypes tryna talk with no teeth
Shorties sayin' ball or retreat
A lesson we all speak at one point or another
What you expect from one who smoke a joint with his mother
Anointed hustlers in a fatherless region
Through the pain wish they know that God was just teachin'
We want decent homes
So dreams we say out loud like speakerphones just to keep em on
It's like a colored song that keep keepin' on
I guess knowin' I'm weak is when I'm really bein' strong
Somehow through the dust I could see the dawn
Like the Bishop Magic Juan  that's why I write freedom songs
For the real people
I wonder if the spirits of Bob Marley and Haile Selassie
Watch me as the cops be tryna and pop and lock me
They cocky  plus they mentality is Nazi
The way they treat blacks I wanna snap like paparazzi
We're the children of a better God searchin' for better jobs
We could cop ghetto cars tryin' not to catch a charge
They say the dope game is sour
Now they doin' homework that's when they follow you for hours
Come to your crib and devour all that you work for
Must be more than paper these niggas hurt for
Through the purple haze I circle days I rhyme that work for pays
Tryna reverse the slave's mind and insert the brave mentality
Heard that it's drama at home
Can a dude break free and still get honored at home
I was told by a chief it's the games nature
When you're glowin' some will love and some will hate ya
It's real people

Common Sense is in your town
Common Sense is in your town
In it's slime that's babblin' grammatics that are masculine
I wish that Madelyne was back on Video LP
I went against all odds and got a even steven
Proceed to read and not believin' everything I'm readin'
I analyze where I rest my eyes
And chastise the best of guys with punchlines
I'm Nestle when it's crunch-time
For your mind like one time
If poetry was pussy I'd be sunshine
'Cause I deliver like the Sun-Times
Confined in once-mines on dumb rhymes I combine
Eating beef sometimes -- I try to cut back on that shit
This rap shit is truly outta control
My style is too developed to be arrested
They tried to hold my soul in a holding cell so I would sell
I bonded with a break and had enough to make bail
A Mr. Meaner fell on his knee for the jury
I asked No for his ID and the judge thought there was two of me

You look at your brother man you gotta see yourself
Gotta see the God within him
We brothers gettin' changed real quick over nothin'
We losin' too many of ours
Gotta recreate y'all
Yo  check it
Knowin' you the best part of life  do I have the right to take yours?
Cause I created you  irresponsibly
Subconciously knowin' the act I was a part of
The start of somethin'  I'm not ready to bring into the world
Had myself believin' I was sterile
I look into mother's stomach  wonder if you are a boy or a girl
Turnin' this woman's womb into a tomb
But she and I agree  a seed we don't need
You would've been much more than a mouth to feed
But someone  I would've fed this information I read
To someone  my life for you I woulda had to leave
Instead I lead you to death
But I wasn't prepared mentally nor financially
Havin' a child shouldn't have to bring out the man in me
Plus I wanted you to be raised within a family
I don't wanna  go through the drama of havin a baby's momma
Weekend visits and buyin' J's ain't gon' make me a father
For a while bearing a child is somethin' I never wanted to do
For me to live forever I can only do that through you
Nerve I got to talk about them niggas with a gun
Must have really thought I was God to take the life of my son
I could have sacrificed goin' out
To think my homies who did it I used to joke about From now on I'ma use self control instead of birth control
Cause 315 dollars ain't worth your soul
315 dollars ain't worth your soul
315 dollars ain't worth it

I never dreamed you'd leave in summer
You said you would be here when it rained
Why didn't you stay
Seeing you as a present and a gift in itself
You had our child in you  I probably never feel what you felt
But you dealt with it like the strong black woman you are
Through our trials and tribulations  child's elimination
An integration of thoughts I feel about the situation
Back and forth my feelings was pacin'
Happy deep down but not joyed enough to have it
But even that's a lie in less than two weeks  we was back at it
Is this unprotected love or safe to say it's lust
Bustin'  more than the sweat in somebody you trust
Or is it that we don't trust each other enough
And believe  havin' this child'll make us have to stay together
Girl I want you in my life cause you have made it better
Thinkin' we all in love cause we can spend a day together
We talkin' spendin' the rest of our lives
It's too many black women that can say they mothers  but can't say that they wives
I wouldn't chose any other to mother my understanding
But I want our parenthood to come from planning
It's so much in my life that's undone
If you had decided to have it the situation I wouldn't run from
But I'm walkin'  findin' myself in my God
So I can  discipline my son with my rod
Not have a judge tellin' me how and when to raise my seed
Though his death was at our greed  with no one else to blame
I had a book of African names  case our minds changed
You say your period hasn't came  and lately I've been sleepy
So quit smokin' the weed and the beadies and let's have this boy
I never dreamed you'd leave in summer
You said you would be here when it rained
Why didn't you stay
I never dreamed you'd leave in summer
Now the situations made things change

Still rock the Prada—'fore that  rock the Starter
Niggas had the Georgetown  the Magic way harder

Saying for a man to survive  he needn't hustle
Seen and been through struggle her whole life
Made a transition from being his ho to his wife
Stifling  the night upend the ATF bust in
Her daddy was a hustla  so she loved him
Looked at the jury  how can they judge him?
She screamed
Before you lock my love away  before you lock my love away (Uh)
Before you lock my love away (Yeah)  before you lock my love away
Please let me testify
Fear in her chest  her face with tears
Had her man's back  he was facing years
In her name  though the place was his
They tryna take everything except the kids
For years she been through scuffle and fights
While he tryna hustle that white
Up all night wondering if he's alive
Seeing him tried  she bubbled inside and screamed
Before you lock my love away (Uh)  before you lock my love away (Yeah)
Before you lock my love away (Yeah)  before you lock my love away

Before you lock my love away  before you lock my love away (Uh)
Before you lock my love away  before you lock my love away
Please let me testify
The court awaited as the foreman got the verdict from the bailiff
Emotional outbursts  tears and smeared makeup
They stated  he was guilty on all charges
She's shaking  looking like she took it the hardest
A spin artist  she brought her face up laughing
That's when the prosecutor realized what happened
All that speaking her mind  testifying and crying
When this bitch did the crime  the queenpin
Before you lock my love away  before you lock my love away
Before you lock my love away  before you lock my love away
Please let me testify
The revolution is here
We gonna help y'all see clear
The perseverance of a rebel I drop heavier levels
Dark spots in my mind where the scene occurred
Greet brothers with handshakes on ghetto landscapes
Where a man is determined by how much a man make
Cop Cognacs and spit old raps with young cats
Want to be in the rap race but ain't ran one lap
Ran so far from the streets that you can't come back
This is rap for the Black people

This is rap for the Black people
Some days I take the L to gel with the real world
How many dead folks this art resurrected
How many nations this culture connected
Who am I to judge one's perspective?
I just want to innovate and stimulate minds
Travel the world and penetrate the times
Escape through rhythms in search of peace and wisdom
Raps are smoke signals letting the streets know I'm with 'em
For now I appreciate this moment in time
This is rap- This is rap for real
This is rap for the Black people
This is rap Co- Co- Com' sense
This is rap- This is rap for real
Yeaahhh

Memories on corners with the fo's and the mo's
Walk to the store for the rose  talkin' straightforward to hoes
Got uncles that smoke  and some put blow up they nose
To cope with the lows  the wind is cold and it blows
In they socks and they soles  niggas holdin' they rolls
Corners leave souls opened and closed  hopin' for mo'
With nowhere to go  niggas rollin' in droves
They shoot the wrong way  'cause they ain’t knowin' they goals
The streets ain’t safe 'cause they ain’t knowin' the code
By the foes I was told: either focus or fold
Got cousins with flows  hope they open some doors
So we can cop clothes and roll in a Rolls
Now I roll in a Olds  with windows that don’t roll
Down the roads where cars get broken and stole
These are the stories told by Stony and Cottage Grove
The world is cold  the block is hot as a stove
On the corners

We overstated  we underrated  we educated
The corner was our time when time stood still and
Gators and snakeskins in
Yellow and pink and collared blue
Profiles glorifying them
Street lights and deep nights  cats tryin' to eat right
Ridin' no-seat-bikes  with work to feed hypes
So they can keep sweet Nike's  they head and they feet right
Desires of street life  cars and weed types
It’s hard to breathe nights  days are thief-like
The beasts roam the streets  the police is Greek-like
Game at its peak  we speak and believe hype
Bang in the streets hats cocked left or deep right
It’s steep life  coming up where niggas is sheep-like
Rappers and hoopers  we strive to be like
G's with three stripes  seeds that need light
Cheese and recite  needs and BE strife
The corner  where struggle and greed fight
We write songs about wrong ‘cause it’s hard to see right
Look to the sky  hopin' it will bleed light
Reality's a bitch  and I heard that she bites
The corner

Uh  the corner was our magic  our music  our politics
Fires raised as tribal dances and war cries
Broke out on different corners
Power to the people
Black power
Black is beautiful
Black church services  murderers  Arabs servin' burgers
As cats with gold permanents move they bags as herbalists
The dirt isn’t just fertile  it’s people workin' and earnin' this
The curb getters go where the cash flow and the current is
It’s so hot that niggas burn to live
The furnace is  where the money movin'  the determined live
We talk shit  play lotto  and buy German beers
It’s so black packed with action that's affirmative
The corners

I wish I could give you this feelin'  uh-uh
Uh-uh-ugh  on the corners  niggas robbin'  killin'
Dyin'  just to make a living  huh? (Huh?)
The corner was our Rock of Gibraltar  our Stonehenge
Our Taj Mahal  our monument
Our testimonial to freedom  to peace  and to love
Uh
My name is Common  No I.D  hah
Uh
Ferrari Testas  Armani dressers
Exquisite thick bitches that body bless us
Rest assured  we getting festive in Miami now
Told my nigga Ye  I'm 'bout to win the Grammys now
Getting Johnny Cash  old white folks know me now
Stand close to the mic like I'm Kobe now
We celebrate with shots of the hate because we got love
It's the pop life  a lot of faces pop up
Known to tear the club and the block up
Going through the airport with more lye than an opera
Knew crooks who move books like Harry Potter
Get cleaners to get it cleaner
A legend like John  Lennon  I'm a dreamer
Tried to fuck the world  she only let me finger
Mind trips to Medina to visit the redeemer
A hero  I'll drop out like Hiroshima
Off sangria with two broads at La Esquina
Still opening roads for Omoye and Amina
I'm a dreamer

It's for the world  world  world  world  world
Yeah (Dreamer)
Dream on
Haha  yeah (I've seen  ohh)
We take  uh  we make  uh  paper
And build skyscrapers
Walking on water  building my faith up
Niggas with no heart  I'm the pacemaker
Get the beat from No-I  feel the pulse of the Chi
Survival of the fit with hope in they eye
Taking notes from the sky to fly above understanding
They notes from the most high  so I gotta land them
Career ain't random  make anthems  streets chant them
Rock roles like a phantom
Mad hoes like they throwing tantrums
I tell them I need space like Richard Branson
Dancing  with wolves and stars getting full at bars
And then pass out like a pamphlet
Never taking Grants for granted
It's Common  I'm high above standard
Fly nigga  keep my feet planted
To rock the planet  I don't stop for panic
Maybe I'm a hopeless Hip-Hop romantic
I'm a dreamer
(Dreamer)
Yeah (Dreamer)
(I've seen  ohh) Yo  this rhyme is—
He introduced me  I stepped to the podium
Said peace  give thanks to the holy one
Put my water up  thought about my daughter for a second
The youth  the living resurrection
Reflections of the sun glaring through the window
Now the audience staring at my mental
Feeling like the world  the world is at my fingers
'Bout to speak to an auditorium full of dreamers
Kinda took me back to when I first had a dream
To be like the king that sang Billie Jean
Now it's gold records  and I'm on silver screens
At the mountaintop  you still gotta dream
To the dreamers
(Dreamer)
Yeah
(Dreamer)
To the dreamer  dreamer  dreamers
Yeah  it faded down  we gon'—
(I've seen  ohh)
We gon' bring it back
Bring that beat back  bring that beat back
It's for the world  world  world  world
Keep on
Chka-d-ah  d-ah
For the world  world  world
Keep on  chika-digga-d-uh
Ayo
Ayo
Y'all to dance to us  chka
Keep on
If I dream you're here
And you dream I'm there
We'll be nowhere near
You should just come here
If I wake you up
Only difference is
You can live the dream
Just believe in it
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Once you find your shoulders dropping
And your speech gets slow and hazy
You'd better change your way of being
Before you found your brain got lazy
You can build a better future when you join the winning team
If you desire a bright tomorrow  you must build a brighter dream
Dare to let your dreams reach beyond you
Know that history holds more than it seems
We are here alive today because our ancestors dared to dream
From Africa they lay in the bilge of slave ships
And stood half naked on auction blocks
From eastern-Europe they crowded in vessels overloaded with immigrants
And were mis-named on Ellis island
From South America and Mexico  from Asia  they labored in sweat shops
From all over the world  they came to America
Many shivering in rags  and still they dared to dream
Let us dream for today and for tomorrow
You know what they say Kanye
Slow motion better than no motion
And my baby mama late (uh oh! uh oh! uh oh!)
'Cause I had to get (duh-ough! duh-ough! duh-ough!)
Until the blue and whites (po po! po po! po po!)
Slow motion better than (no-oh! no-oh! no-oh!)
Y'all know the Sprewells and trucks that's detailed
Heartless females that wanna ride in 'em
Felt the Southside venom in raw hides and denim
On the block white is selling like Eminem
On the block it jump off like Kim and 'em
Shorties get the game but no instructions to assemblin'

And my baby mama late (uh oh! uh oh! uh oh!)
'Cause I had to get (duh-ough! duh-ough! duh-ough!)
Until the blue and whites (po po! po po! po po!)
Slow motion better than (no-oh! no-oh! no-oh!)
Whether on ball courts or tires of all sorts
Wondering if it's for the art or for the dough
Though I know to grow a nigga gotta learn to let go
Though I know the dough I got to bring back to the ghetto
Arrows on tarot cards pointin' to the grind
Freedom fight in dark gear for the years to get brighter
And my baby mama late (uh oh! uh oh! uh oh!)
'Cause I had to get (duh-ough! duh-ough! duh-ough!)
Until the blue and whites (po po! po po! po po!)
Slow motion better than (no-oh! no-oh! no-oh!)
If I could just swallow my pride
But I can't run away or put my gun away
You can't front on me
See I can't run away or put my gun away
You can't front on me
Emcees and actors that seize and capture
Moments like the camcorder
Though paper can't change a man's aura
It can feed a man's daughter
Like Sam Jack they maneuver through drama like
If I could just swallow my pride
But I can't run away or put my gun away
You can't front on me
See I can't run away or put my gun away
You can't front on me
If I could just swallow my pride

You can't front on me
See I can't run away or put my gun away

Yo
I never knew a luh-luh-luh  a love like this
Gotta be somethin' for me to write this
Queen  I ain't seen you in a minute
Wrote this letter  and finally decide to send it
Love has no limit  let's spend it slow forever
I know your heart is weathered by what studs did to you
I ain't gon' assault them  'cause I probably did it too
Because of you  feelings I handle with care
Some niggas recognize the light  but they can't handle the glare
You know I ain't the type to walk around with matchin' shirts
If relationship is effort  I will match your work
I want to be the one to make you happiest and hurt you the most
They say the end is near  it's important that we close.. to the Most High
Regardless of what happen  on Him let's rely
There are times
When you'll need someone (Yeah)
I will be by your side (So  so)
There is a light that shines
Special for you and me
(Yo  yo  check it)

It's important we communicate
And tune the fate of this union to the right pitch
I never call you my bitch  or even my boo
There's so much in a name  and so much more in you
Few understand the union of woman and man
And sex and a tingle is where they assume that it land
But that's fly by night  for you in the sky I write
For in these cold Chi night's moon  you my light
If Heaven had a height  you would be that tall
Ghetto to coffee shop  through you I see that all
Let's stick to understandin' and we won't fall
For better or worse times  I hope to me you call
So I pray every day more than anythin'
Friends we'll stay as we begin to lay
This foundation for a family  love ain't simple
Why can't it be anythin' worth havin' you work at annually?
Granted we known each other for some time
It don't take a whole day to recognize sunshine
There are times
When you'll need someone
I will be by your side— Oh  darling—
There is a light that shines (Yeah)
Special for you and me
(Yo  yo  check it)
It's kind of fresh you listen to more than hip-hop
And I can catch you in the mix from beauty to thrift shop
Plus you shit pop when it's time to
Thinkin' you fresh  suggestin' beats I should rhyme to
At times when I'm lost I try to find you
You know to give me space when it's time to
My heart's dictionary defines you  it's love and happiness
Truthfully it's hard tryin' to practice abstinence
The time we committed love  it was real good
Had to be for me to arrive and it still feel good
I know the sex ain't gon' keep you
But as my equal  it's how I must treat you
As my reflection in light I'ma lead you
And whatever's right I'ma feed you
Yo  I tell you the rest when I see you  peace!
There are times
When you'll need someone
I will be by your side— Oh  darling—
There is a light that shines
Special for you and me
I take— my— chances
Be— be— be— be—
Before they pass— pass— pass—
Pass me by— Oh  darling—
You need to look at the other side
 and we didn't know
 headed back to the light
 don't drown in the gold
 but it's cold
 out of bounds
 street organizations
 hood public relations
 the terror of Bush
 herringbones and rope
 Dion making the beats
 we escaping the heat
 they just let them heats ride (Them heats ride)
 why my city keep lying? (They keep lying)
 but everybody keep dying (They keep dying)
 I looked like a street sign (I'm out here)
 and I got shot at three times (Damn)
 watch the morgue wrap me up (What?)
 'cause they will hit (Swish)
 but you don't make it (Nah)
 judges who racist and full of hatred
 you ain't never seen the shit that I seen (Huh)
 oh
 ooh
 ah-ah

Louder  louder  yeah
Louder  louder  louder  louder  louder  louder

This is street radio  for unsung hero
Riding in they regal  trying to stay legal
My daughter found Nemo  I found the new Preemo
'Ye  you know how we do  we do it for the people
And the struggle of the brothas and the folks
With lovers under dope  experiment to discover hopes
Scuffle for notes  the rougher I wrote  times was harder
Went from rocky starter to a voice of a martyr
Why white folk focus on dogs and yoga?
While people on the low end tryna ball and get over
Lyrics are like liquor for the fallen soldiers
From the bounce to the ounce  it's all our culture
Everyday we hustlin'  tryna get them custom rims
Law  we ain't trusting them  thick broads  we lust in them
Sick and tired of punching it  I look on the bus at them
When I see 'em struggling  I think how I'm touching them
The people

At the Grammy's  though they tried to India.Arie me
Got back stage  and I bumped into Stevie
He said no matter what  the people gon' see me
Can't leave rap alone the streets need me
Hunger in they eyes  is what seems to feed me
Inside peace mixed with beast seem to breed me
Nobody believe  until I believe me
Now I'm on the rise doing business with my guys
Visions realize  music affected lives
A gift from the skies  to be recognized
I'm keeping my eyes on the people  that's the prize

Standing in front of the judge with no honor
My raps ignite the people like Obama
The karma of the streets is needs and takes
Sometimes we find peace in beats and breaks
Put the bang in the back so the seats can shake
Rebel Cadillac music for the people's sake
The People

Aight wit you it ain't aight wit me
Right  gotta make money all my life
Gotta stay fucking bitches many types
Yeah you know what I'm talking bout
Yup  stay turning these bitches out

Get your third eye poked
Fuck game  I assemble dope
Ness  a nigga that's fresh as the fest
Studied this rap shit  no need to mic test
You can feel it in your chest
Your bia' feel it in her breasts
Plus you  rhyme like a nigga wit his nipples pierced
We lick off lyrics in the streets and real niggas hear us
Dreamin when I wrote this  box me if I go too wild
Still doin this shit like dude in Wild Style
Inviting wack niggas to dinner
I Trick Daddy emcees and I don't know  nann nigga
Who can take it where I take it
You better goin' to God like Ma$e did
Leaving crowds complacent
I move 'em above clouds whether on some surf and turf shit
Or thug style you can feel it in your body
Yeah y'all you can feel it in your body
Like if a 12 gauge shottie shell hit your body
You don't want it  need to find your ass a hobby
Carbon copy  niggas tryin to clone us
You know us  Thelonious  super microphone
You know this  rap shit we 'bout to own it dun  for real
Everyday (ey day)  it's like a ritual
You been invited let the mortal body stimulate the place
With the grace  nevertheless  I stress
Let the music put a smile on your face
As for the ritual  when it comes to spiritual excellence
You know I always leave you with the taste
I know you like it hard to the core
That's what you ask for  you aching for the best
Hurtin like a sore in that ass  like a ritual
Conversation with the most high makes me wanna cry
I wonder why  you wanna get to paradise
But that itty bitty part of you don't wanna die
So pay attention to my word  cause it's the truth
Meditation ease the mind  and brings the youth
It's like a verse you could never read out of a book
Dropping the line in your mind like a fish hook
Word is birth  yo I do it till the break of day
Pay attention to your heart  never go astray
Word is bond
Yo we do it and we don't quit
Sucka nigga you don't want it  it's Thelonious
Owning this rap shit  super microphonist and we known to spit
I spit fire like Esther on Sanford and Son did
I'm raw duke  more juice than Sunkist
You want this  see when J get to saying the rhyme flawless
Shit fly like MJ in his prime  Off The Wall with mines
I’m grabbin my balls when I rhyme now
Nines bust and plus ball all the time  now
Stay on your mind like great sex
You ain't on my mind I'm thinking bout paychecks
Niggas large like an 8X Avirex jacket
Conant Gardens they bust like latex sex packets
Emcees they don't rhyme and ball  they lyin' to y'all
They dyin' to ball  the rhyme we do all the time
We do all the fine bitches they fall in lines
Me and my mans is something like the Source Sports
We gettin money a long time and y'all short
My niggas bounce in foreign rides and yours Fords
You funny duke  cause really you think you can do me
When you roll a 500 that's really a 320
Should of let somebody else hook it
Numbers look crooked like King Kong shook it
I'm from where niggas bang gats when they celebrate
That's how they play  don't let it be a holiday
Thelonious niggas  if you testin us we get you laid back
 they lie
 but they don't know
 they say)
 the saturated life
 Tell Cara get us a show
 I make righteous bitches get low
 like Jamie in Ray
 so it's homework and hood crimes
 for forever and a day so goodbye
 they lie
 but they don't know
 they say)
 oh
 the sweet taste of victory
 'Ye snapped with this beat!
 gotta be them wheels
 gotta be that steel
 ask him How do it feel?
 it feel like a plane crash
 again
 but they don't know
 they say)
 oh

 they say I went too left
 like I was Mr. F
 pawns and knights
 or Frank White
 they lie
 but they don't know
