" I've got plenty
 you can't handle love
 you can't handle love
Ooh (Yeah)
(-lightenment)
Ooh (Oh)
(-lightenment)
Ooh
I have walked this earth
And watched people
It doesn't scare me at all
I can be sincere
And say I like them
It doesn't scare me at all
You can't say no to hope
Can't say no to happiness
It doesn't scare me at all
I want to go on a mountain top
With a radio and good batteries
And play a joyous tune and
Free the human race
From suffering
It doesn't scare me at all
You might also like
I'm no fucking Buddhist
But this is enlightenment
The less room you give me
The more space I've got
It doesn't scare me at all
You can't say no to hope
Can't say no to happiness
It doesn't scare me at all
I want to be on a mountain top
With a radio and good batteries
And play a joyous tune and
Free the human race
From suffering
It doesn't scare me at all
This is an alarm call
(Beep-Beep-Be-Beep-Beep-Be-Beep-Be-Be-Be-Be-Beep)
Today has never happened
And it doesn't frighten me
It doesn't scare me at all
You can't say no to hope
It doesn't scare me at all

You'll be taken care of
You'll be given love
You have to trust it
Maybe not from the sources
You have poured yours
Maybe not from the directions
You are staring at
Twist your head around
It's all around you
All is full of love
All around you
All is full of love
You just ain't receiving
All is full of love

Glow-in-the-dark threads

The cocoon surrounds you

Foetus-style

'Cause we're asking for help

I am fine tuning my soul
To the universal wavelength
No one is a lover alone
I propose an atom dance
Our hearts are coral reefs in low tide
Love is the ocean we crave
Restlessly turning around and around
I am dancing towards transformation
Learning by love to open it up
Let this ugly wound breathe
We fear unconditional heart space
Healed by atom dance
When you feel the flow as primal love
Enter the pain and dance with me
We are each other’s hemispheres
We aim at peeling off
Dead layers of loveless love
No one is a lover alone
Most hearts fear their own home
Becoming themselves fully
It scares them off

No one is a lover alone
Most hearts fear their own home
Our differences are irrelevant
To only name the flaws
Are excuses to not connect
I bow to all that you've given me
Thank you for staying while we learn
To find our resonance where we do connect
To find our resonance where we do connect
If we don't grow outwards towards love
We'll implode inwards towards destruction
If my plant doesn't reach towards you
There's internal erosion towards all
Pursuing the light too hard is a form of hiding
Are these not just excuses to not connect?
Our differences are irrelevant
To insist on absolute justice at all times
It blocks connection
Hope is a muscle
That allows us to connect
Hope is a muscle
Hope is a muscle
Hope is a muscle
Hope is a muscle
The glacier head
Looking hard for
Moments of shine
From twilight
To twilight
Aurora
Goddess sparkle
Shoot me
Beyond this suffer
The need is great
Aurora

Suggests your shape

You're the bird on the brim
Hypnotised by the whirl
Wet your beak in the stream
Game we're playing is life
Love's a two-way dream
Tide will show you the way
If you forget my name
You will go astray
Like a killer whale
Trapped in a bay
I'm a path of cinders
Burning under your feet
You're the one who walks me
I'm your one-way street
I'm a whisper in the water
Secret for you to hear

I'm the branch that you break
Something important
Is about to happen
It's coming up
It takes courage to enjoy it
The hardcore and the gentle
Big-time sensuality
We just met
And I know I'm a bit too intimate
But something huge is coming up
And we're both included
It takes courage to enjoy it
The hardcore and the gentle
Big-time sensuality
I don't know my future after this weekend
And I don't want to

It takes courage to enjoy it
The hardcore and the gentle
But our bond has broken
My shield is gone
My protection is taken
I am one wound
My pulsating body
Suffering being
My heart is enormous lake
Black with potion
I am blind
Drowning in this ocean
My soul torn apart
My spirit is broken
Into the fabric of all
He is woven
You fear my limitless emotions
I am bored of your apocalyptic obsessions
Did I love you too much?
Devotion bent me broken
So I rebelled
Destroyed the icon
You might also like
I did it for love
I honoured my feelings
You betrayed your own heart
Corrupted that organ
Family was always
Our sacred mutual mission
Which you abandoned
You have nothing to give
Your heart is hollow
I'm drowned in sorrows
No hope in sight of ever recover
Eternal pain and horrors
I am a glowing shiny rocket
Returning home
As I enter the atmosphere
 I am missing him
That a boy like him
Would have entered me lightly
Restoring my blisses?
Who would have known
That a boy like him
After sharing my core
Would stay going nowhere?
Who would have known
A beauty this immense?
Who would have known
A saintly trance?
Who would have known
Miraculous breath?
To inhale a beard
Loaded with courage
Who would have known
That a boy like him
Possessed of magical
Sensitivity?
Who would approach a girl like me
In her bosom?

He slides inside
We faint back
Into sleephood
When I wake up

Who would have known?
A train of pearls
Cabin by cabin

From a mouth
From a
From the mouth
Of a girl like me
To a boy

I'll take care of you
Protect you
You're exhausted
Come lie down
You don't have to explain
I understand
You know that I adore you
You know that I love you
So don't make me say it
It would burst the bubble
Break the charm
Jump off
Your building's on fire
And I'll catch you

Destroy all that is keeping you down

Where I can pay respects
For the death of my family?
Show some respect
Between the three of us
There is the mother and the child
Then there is the father and the child
But no man and a woman
No triangle of love
To make an offering?
I fall on my knees
Lay my flowers
Burn incense
Light the candles
To make an offering?
To mourn our miraculous triangle?
How will I sing us
Out of this sorrow?
Build a safe bridge

I raise a monument of love
There is a swarm of sound
Around our heads
And we can hear it
And we can get healed by it
It will relieve us from the pain
It will make us a part of
This universe of solutions
This place of solutions
This location of solutions
If there is one to be sought  it is he
If there are nine she's
They are bought for me
This way is as is she
And he placed her unclothed
On top of the family tree
And if he has chosen the point while she is under him
Then leave her coily placed crouched sucking him
For it is I
With her on knee
I leave her without pith or feel
And leave her be  leave it be
For he controls what there'll be
He makes his face known to none
For if he is seen  then all will
And all will know
Your love was sent to me
I'm not sure what to do with it
Or where to put it
I'm so close to tears
And so close to
Simply calling you up
And simply suggesting
We go to that hidden place
That we go to that hidden place
We go to that hidden place
We go to the hidden place
Now I have been slightly shy
And I can smell a pinch of hope
The fingers I was given to touch with
There lies my love
I'll hide it under a blanket
Lull it to sleep

And the littleness of his movements
Hides himself
He invents a charm that makes him invisible
Hides in the hair
Can I hide there too?
Hide in the hair of him
Seek solace
Sanctuary
In that hidden place
In a hidden place
In a hidden place
We'll stay in a hidden place
We'll live in a hidden place
We'll be in a hidden place
In the middle of the night
To express my love for you
Stroke your skin and feel you
Naked I can feel all of you
At the same moment
I wake you up
In the night feeling
This is our last time together
Therefore sensing all the moments
We've been together
Being here at the same time
Every single touch
We ever touch each other
Every single fuck
We had together
Is in a wondrous time lapse
With us here at this moment
The history of touches
Every single archive
Compressed into a second
And human behaviour
To human behaviour
And there is no map
Then all of a sudden turn happy
Of human emotions

But I don't know when
I thought I could organize freedom
How Scandinavian of me
You could smell it
So you left me on my own
To complete the mission
Now I'm leaving it all behind

I go through all this before you wake up
So I can feel happier to be safe up here with you

Zing  boom

You wanna laugh  you wanna cry

When you fall in love
I've seen the willow leaves dancing in the breeze
I've seen a man killed by his best friend
And lives that were over before they were spent
I've seen what I was  and I know what I'll be
I've seen it all — there is no more to see
I'm happy to say I had better to do
What about China? Have you seen the Great Wall?
All walls are great if the roof doesn't fall
And the man you will marry?
The home you will share?
To be honest  I really don't care
You've never been to Niagara Falls?
The Eiffel Tower  the Empire State?
My pulse was as high on my very first date
Your grandson's hand as he plays with your hair?

The light and the dark  the big and the small
Just keep in mind — you need no more at all
You've seen what you were and know what you'll be

One feeling at a time

Should I throw oil on one of these moods
But which one?

We've gone through the grinder  suffered loss
Attracts floral blooming softly
Soft is my chest  I didn't allow loss
Loss make me hate  didn't harden from pain
This pain we have will always be there
But the sense of full satisfaction too
I opened my heart for you
Your lower lip so heavy on you
My spine curved erotically
We're finally vulnerable
Loss of love  we all have suffered
How we make up for it defines who we  who we are
It defines us  how we overcome it
Recover  repair from loss
Loss of faith just ignites survivors
They stare doubt straight into the eye
I forgive  the past is bondage
Freedom aphrodisiac

Thousands of sounds
I thank this trunk
I have followed a path
That took sacrifices
Now I sacrifice this scar
Can you cut it off?
Our love couldn't carry you
And I didn't even notice
For our love kept me safe from death
You doubted the light
And the shelter it can give
For in love we are immortal
Eternal and safe from death
If I regret us
I'm denying my soul to grow
Don't remove my pain
It is my chance to heal
We carry the same wound
But have different cures
Similar injuries
But opposite remedies
After our love ended
Your arms don't carry me
Without love I feel the abyss
Understand your fear of death

Love will keep us safe from death

A secret code carved

Crooked five fingers

Find our mutual coordinates
Moments of clarity are so rare
I better document this
At last the view is fierce

Who has coagulated
Who can share and
Who has shut down the chances?

That makes me feel your pain?

I've ducked and dived
Like the mother in Salomon's Tale
To spare our girl
I won't let her get cut in half ever
But it's time to teach her some dignity
I won't denounce our origin

He took it from his father

Let's break this curse
So it won't fall on our daughter
And her daughter
And her daughter
Won't let this sink into her DNA
I won't let you denounce our origin
Can't take her suffer
It's so unfair
The sins of the fathers
They just fucked it all up
We had the best family
We had it all
We had it all in our hands
He just pulled us through the wringer
I will take the sun in my mouth
And leap into the ripe air alive
With closed eyes
To dash against darkness
In the sleeping curves of my body
I shall enter fingers of smooth mastery
With chasteness of seagirls
Will I complete the mystery of my flesh?
Transformed into a gate
Where I receive love from
Where I give love from
Split into many parts
Splattered light beams into prisms
That will reunite

Didn't used to be so needy
Just more broken than normal
Proud self-sufficiency
My silhouette is oval
It is a gate
Like cars and such
Have always existed
They've just been waiting in a mountain
For the right moment
And listening to the irritating noises
Of dinosaurs and people
Dabbling outside
Engin fylgist alveg
Sólin sekkur
Engin sér við mér
Það er sól þegar
Andar inn í mér
Hann bítur mig
Hann bítur mig
Fylgir eftir mér
Telur með
Siglir eftir mér
All the modern things
Have always existed
They've just been waiting
To come out
And multiply
And take over
It's their turn now

My heart comes undone
Slowly unravels
In a ball of yarn
The devil collects it
With a grin
Our love
In a ball of yarn
He'll never return it
We'll have to make new love
He'll never return it
We'll have to make new love
While you are away
My heart comes undone

The first flute carved from the first fauna
Utopia
It's not elsewhere
Let's purify
You assigned me to protect our lantern
To be intentional about the light
Utopia
It isn't elsewhere
It's here
My instinct has been shouting at me for years
Huge toxic tumour bulging underneath the ground here
Suggests exciting sex

I'm walking hills and valleys
Adore this mystical fog!
This fucking mist!
These cliffs are just showing off!
Then the body memory kicks in
I mime my home mountains
The moss that I'm made of
I redeem myself
I've been wrestling my fate
Do I accept this ending?
Will I accept my death
Or struggle claustrophobic?
Fought like a wolverine
With my destiny
Refuse to accept what was meant to be
Then the body memory kicks in
And I trust the unknown
Unfathomable imagination
Surrender to future

And find a pathway for it
Like threading an ocean through a needle
River through a keyhole
Can't fathom the grasp
I can't grasp the fathom
Then my body memory kicks in
My limbs and tongue take over
Like the ancestors before me
Show me the flow
My sexual DNA
X-rays of my Kama Sutras
Summons different bodies
Compares spines and buttocks
And back of necks
Then my body memory kicks in
It simply takes over
Bestiality
I redeem my body
I wasn't born urban
Toxic doesn't agree with me
Love lured me here
Into a stagnant state
Vacuum packed molecules
Then my body memory kicks in
On this Brooklyn dance floor
Sweating with these rhythms
Rotate this matrix
All trapped in legal harness
Kafkaesque
Farce like patriarchy
Avoided to confront it
Then the body memory kicks in
My warrior awakens
My turn to defend
Urban didn't tame me
Then my body memory kicks in
All bosoms and embraces
Enjoy the satisfaction
 soak it in
From hiding his affairs
Let's put it all on the table
Let it all out
It is time
He mustn't steal our light
Clean plate: Tabula rasa for my children
Clean plate: Not repeating the fuck-ups of the fathers
My deepest wish
Is that you're immersed in grace and dignity
But you will have to deal with shit soon enough
I hoped to give you the least amount of luggage
Got the right to make your own fresh mistakes
And not repeat others' failures
Clean plate: Tabula rasa for my children
Let's clean up: Break the chain of the fuck-ups of the fathers
It is time: For us women to rise and not just take it lying down
It is time: The world is listening
