Yeah  it's We The Best!
It's YMCMB!
One time for Top Dawg Entertainment!

Talk about it  make 'em talk about it
And your life to me is lifeless like it's livin' on life support
I license everything in my wallet
Lightest boy with the biggest heart
Nigga  play yo' part or parallel park yo' ego
Next to me and violence
Next to me is definitely no one  I'm one of one
And I musta won that from anybody who had it
Or better yet forgot it
Mack in the back of a 'Lac with a MAC
In the back of a 'Lac with a latch on the back
Of the trunk  hit a punk in the back with the pump
In the back 'til he's off balance
And I'm back in the front of the front of the future
When you are mentioning talent
And I'm back in the back of the block
With a cop  wanna cop anybody's allowance
Iraq on the block  he watch with a block
You fucked up twice  you fucked considerin' you drownin'
Die in a lake with a date with a catfish  backflip head first smilin'
Cr-cry in the face of Jesus  we just pray we keep on stylin'

Third Ward soldier  suicide rider
Militant minded  hundred mill on the counter
Hand Persian rug nigga  flame on the Bugatti
Christian Louboutin  Chanel for my models
Higher than Bugatti nigga  fishing on the fishscales
Nose diving for them hundreds  strapped up making mail
Fr-fresher than I been before
Higher than we even been  shining on them 24’s
Junior doing time ho
On the grind ho  while he doing time ho
Ya know  that time is money
And money still was made baby
Eight months ain't stop nothing  nigga
It’s like  jail was third base
And my lil' nigga still came home  ya understand? Yeah
I’m from the hood where bitches hold coke in they baby diapers
I came a long ways from rhyming up in crazy cyphers
Man I’m so happy my lil' brother came home from Rikers
My flow Lucifer  I spit hell boy
My heart numb  ain’t no pain I can't withstand
And I hold my niggas down boy like a kickstand (Young Money!)
Get off my nuts  stop acting like a bitch fam
Lil’ nigga finish puberty  grow ya own dick damn
I went from watching time fly on Earl and Red porch
To cruising through the streets of Miami in a red Porsche
Me and Stunna fly  we should join the Air Force
Stand up niggas  the fuck you brought them chairs for?
I went from making money from people with crack habits
To thanking God I’m in a whole 'nother tax bracket
Amen

I try not to wear nothin' twice
I came up off of shootin' dice  yeah

And if I cry two tears for her
That would be the most that I would give to her
She left me stranded in my nightmares
Taking pictures of my memories—she right there
She used to tell me she was all mine
I'm doing drugs trying to feel you
I'm killing me trying to heal you
I built my whole life around you
I thought I found it all when I found her
Shopping sprees on whatever coast
How'd you really feel? I may never know
And as I ride through these streets
Realize some things never change

Confused fans think that she illuminates demonic
Made some friends resent me for writing about my life
They thought I should have stayed quiet
She took me to places I would've never saw without her
And she took me from my girl powder
Give me strength so I don't do this dame like Orenthal James
Brad warned me while driving his auburn Ferrari
She slowed me down and had me guzzling on cups of lean
Noticed she wasn't breathing for a second
And everybody took it out on Nasty
I was just looking out for my music family
You can have her—she's a motherfucking whore
I fuck hip-hop
And if I cry two tears for her
That would be the most that I would I give to her
She ain’t the one you wanna play with
I fucked hip-hop

Straight up  late nights mixed with early days
It'll probably be that way until the pearly gates
Stress weighing on me  they want me to nervous break
These hoes showing fake love when I prefer the hate  man
Sheesh  at least if you real then I have to respect it
Realize the energy you give is what you manifested
So understand we positive as could be
The vision is still intact  the show is fresh out of seats (Music)
Boy it's never going south 'less we down in South Beach
Khaled on the jet skis  preaching what you believe in
Everything fast 'cept the food  watch what we eating
If it add a couple years to our life  then we might go vegan
Whoa  I hear a little bit of me in all your favorite rappers
Now or later  either way I'ma take it
Just like it's fuckin' taxes
No wonder I'm on fire  I done been to hell and back bitch
Lately I been living life in detachment
I practice seven spiritual laws and cut off distractions
We been all in the Hollywood Hills  and never been acting
Detroit gave me an accent and Christ gave me his passion
Father help us  police doing target practice with real bodies
Niggas over stressing  we under investigation
Every day off to the races  can't fuck with you if you racist
Beat your ass until you purple
They can't even tell what your race is
Doctor King meet Dr. Dre
Except this doctor lost all his patience
Have you tied up in a basement
With you and your partner facing adjacent
Until you deposit payment or reparations
If you shoot me then you gotta deal with a holy me
It feel like I'm finally free and unlock my spirit with the holy key

Everything is everything  affidavits and wedding rings
Out for blood on my higher horse  I report what it was
I don't wear crosses no more  Yeshua was coming back
I ain't scared of losses no more  I see life in that
I don't resonate with the concept of love and hate
Cause your perspective is less effective and rather fake
The universe and the heavens work in my DNA
Kendrick said Fuck Mother Earth  that's PSA
The land of the wicked  the foundation of Lucifer's spirit
Walking zombies and spellcatchers  I pray for forgiveness
Uncle Bobby and Paul June is lost again
The underworld and the fourth dimension  my family's in
The blocks I connected while re-building this Rubik's cube
Brand endorsement joining forces with sorcerers signing me
Law enforcement that forces us  tortures us with violent speed
Fuck your boss's employment my joy is to see all you bleed
Two new Royce's with choices of color my desire need
Crab and Oyster with gorgeous abortions  I require thee
Flesh and poison the point is the reason you won't die in peace

Lamborghini got a S
Parking lot look like a movie
My sex drive leave her woozy
Got my B-A-B-Y in the two-seat
Diamonds dancing on my rubies
Savage mode is on ruthless
A million dollar cash on me in the studio when I did this verse
My rubies got chalice so fuck all the chatter
Jump out that Lambo with the red bottoms on
The capital going up heavy in Florence
Duffel of Franks just to boost my endurance
Two number ones in a row
I sit back on that Act' and sit low in that Ghost
I got some permanent scars
I will not wait for tomorrow

Tables do turn and labels do burn
The second they ask you to sell your soul
Cause all them stories you told on records worth more than gold
And if you never go gold again  at least you would know
The end of your road was chose  by you and not companies
Who control our remote control  and hide the truth on my no
But don't mind me  I'm just high again
Smokin' weed to get by again
No  actually I'm lyin' 'cause smokin' ain't got me smilin'
And rhyming like I rhyme way back when I would play the violin
Thought that shit wasn't cool
Momma sorry  I just stopped tryin' it
Paid for your house in hopes there'd be no more reason for cryin'
That shows you how stupid I am 'cause niggas is out here dying
From police that flash the siren and pull up and just start firin'

A lot of sisters hold me to somethin' holy and Catholic
‘Cause the rosary and gold flashy
Just an attachment and accessory to my dress code
Now everywhere all I see is Pablo  Esco
Last time I checked I was still breathin'  my neck was still freezin'
Now everybody got an Escobar Season
To every baby on the album cover existin'
This trend I was settin'  it came to fruition
I'm assistin' to push the culture forward
To all my ghost supporters  go support us
Like a local Black-owned grocery store
‘Cause in the hood shit ain't passed down through blood
It's a dub on that  we get government aid
Spend it at they stores  puttin' they kids through college
We need balance so we can lease and own deeds in our projects
So I'm askin' Gs to go in their pockets
