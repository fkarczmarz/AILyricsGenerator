lyrics
"I grew up overnight
I survived
Like the love that comes with light
I wore envy and I hated that
But I survived
I had a one-way ticket
To a place where all the demons go
Where the wind don't change
And nothing in the ground can ever grow
And you're taught to cry in your pillow
But I survived
I found solace in the strangest place
Way in the back of my mind
I saw my life in a stranger's face
And it was mine
You might also like
I had a one-way ticket
To a place where all the demons go
Where the wind don't change
And nothing in the ground can ever grow
And you're taught to cry in your pillow
But I survived
I have made every single mistake
That you could ever possibly make
I took and I took and I took what you gave
But you never noticed that I was in pain
I did all the things that you said that I wouldn't
I told you that I would never be forgotten
And all in spite of you
I'm alive
I'm alive
I know you have never felt so alone
Oh hold on  hold on until you hear them come
Here they come  oh
Take an angel by the wings
Beg her now for anything
Beg her now for one more day
Take an angel by the wings
Time to tell her everything
Ask her for the strength to stay
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

Look up  call to the sky

You can do anything
You can do anything
You can do anything
You can do anything
You can do anything
You can do anything
You can do anything
 what you got
 nothing dragging us through the thorns
 the high life
 what you got
 no time for hate
 no time for games
 on my own
 order in
 it's agony
 I'm in pain
 blackouts and airplanes
 on my own
 order in
 it's agony
Had a voice  had a voice but I could not sing
You'd worn me down
I struggled on the ground  oh
So lost  the line had been crossed
Had a voice  had a voice but I could not talk
You held me down
I struggle to fly now  oh
But there's a scream inside that we all try to hide
We hold on so tight  but we cannot deny
Yes  there's a scream inside that we all try to hide
And I don't care if I sing off key
I found myself in my melodies
I sing for love  I sing for me
I shout it out like a bird set free
No  I don't care if I sing off key
I found myself in my melodies
I sing for love  I sing for me
I'll shout it out like a bird set free

Yes  there's a scream inside that we all try to hide
And I don't care if I sing off key
I found myself in my melodies
I sing for love  I sing for me
I shout it out like a bird set free
No  I don't care if I sing off key
I found myself in my melodies
I sing for love  I sing for me
I'll shout it out like a bird set free
I'll shout it out like a bird set free
I'll shout it out like a bird set free
I'll shout it out like a bird set free
I'll shout it out like a bird set free
I have been here many times before
Hurt myself again today
And  the worst part is there's no-one else to blame
Be my friend
Hold me
Wrap me up
Unfold me
I am small
And needy
Warm me up
And breathe me
Ouch  I have lost myself
Again
Lost myself  and I
Am nowhere to be found
Yeah  I think that I
Might break
Lost myself again
And I feel unsafe

Warm me up
I don't wanna fight anymore
Rough seas will be calm
Hold on while we weather the storm
We fall down like dogs playing dead
But our love's not worth playing chicken with
I'm not discarding you like broken glass
There are no winners when the die is cast
There's only tears when it's the final dance
This too shall pass
We're right where we're meant to be
There's things I don't ask
What I don't know can't hurt me
We fall down like dogs playing dead
But our love's not worth playing chicken with

I'm not discarding you like broken glass
There are no winners when the die is cast
There's only tears when it's the final dance
I'm not discarding you like broken glass
I'm not discarding you like broken glass
Swelling up with rage that is desperate to be let out
And I know it's a heavy load
Carrying those tears around
Carrying those fears around
Worry makes the world go 'round
You're twisted up like a slip knot
There's a hungry dog tugging at your frayed ends
We're letting go tonight
Yesterday is gone and you will be ok
Place your past into a book
Yesterday is dead and gone and so today
Place your past into a book

I've been for a walk on a winter's day
I'd be safe and warm if I was in L.A.
All the leaves are brown and the sky is gray
I've been for a walk on a winter's day
I'd be safe and warm if I was in L.A.
I stopped into a church I passed along the way
And I pretended to pray
You know the preacher likes the cold
He knows I'm gonna stay
I'd be safe and warm
I'd be safe and warm
I'd be safe and warm
I'd be safe and warm
All the leaves are brown (all the leaves are brown)
And the sky is gray (and the sky is gray)
It's the cutest thing I swear you'll ever see
You with the colors of the rainbow
Take a trip down Candy Cane Lane with me
You with the lights in all their windows
Red and yellow and pink and green
Orange and purple and blue
Christmas is waiting for you
Christmas is waiting for you
Red and yellow and pink and green
Orange and purple and blue
Christmas is waiting for you
Christmas is waiting for you

You took it in your hands and resuscitated
You said  Me and you against the world
I felt every cell fall in love with you  but
You on your phone  your laptop and your PlayStation
I stared at the diamond on my finger and I waited
And you can treat another to your lies  you'll never get it
I'd rather walk alone than let them throw dirty confetti
I'd rather walk alone  r-r-rather walk alone
I'd rather walk alone than let them throw dirty confetti
And the house we lived in had no doors  and it had no windows
You said  I'm hangin' with the boys
You said  Workin' late to pay our bills
But I found lipstick on your collar  wasn't my color

I want my life to matter
I am afraid I have no purpose here

Abandon myself daily

Sowing the seeds of love and hope  love and hope

I didn't know who to trust
So I designed a shell
Kept me from heaven and hell
Ohh oh oh
And I had hit a low
Was all I let myself know
Yeah I had locked my heart
I was imprisoned by dark
(I was imprisoned by dark)
You found me dressed in black
Hiding way up at the back
Life had broken my heart into pieces
You took my hand in yours
You started breaking down my walls
And you covered my heart in kisses
I thought life passed me by
And then you crossed my path

Then you covered my heart in kisses
I was hopeless and broken
You opened the door for me
Yeah I was hiding and you let the light in
And now I see
That you do for the wounded
What they couldn't seem to
You set them free
Like a butterfly kissing a child with an eye for the minor key
Yeah yeah
You found me dressed in black
Hiding way up at the back
Life had broken my heart into pieces
You took my hand in yours
You started breaking down my walls
And you covered my heart in kisses

Oh oh oh oh oh

I won't give up  I won't give up
And another one bites the dust
Oh  why can I not conquer love?
And I might have thought that we were one
Wanted to fight this war without weapons
And I wanted it  I wanted it bad
But there were so many red flags
Now another one bites the dust
You did not break me
I'm still fighting for peace
Well  I've got thick skin and an elastic heart
But your blade  it might be too sharp
I'm like a rubber band until you pull too hard
Yeah  I may snap and I move fast

You got too close and I pushed and pushed hoping you'd bite

The pleasure's pain and fire burn me

Why don't you come  don't you come a little closer?
We were meant for one another  come a little closer
Flame you came to me  fire meet gasoline

I'd fallen through the floor again  crashed into the basement
The pain was swallowing me
I was like a lead balloon  I couldn't even get up to turn the lights on
The dark is swallowing me
Lord knows you can't trust your head
When you're standing on the edge of breaking down
Lord knows you can't trust your head
When you're hanging by a thread
I was breaking down  and I saw
Only two footprints in the sand
Thought you'd abandoned me and let go of my hand
But you were carrying me  carrying me to safety
Two footprints  your footprints in the sand
Two footprints  two footprints  your footprints in the sand
Two footprints  your footprints in the sand
Oh  I forgot the things I knew  it was I who'd abandoned you
Forgive me  I was lost in doubt
You had never left my side  picked me up when I thought I would die
You held me and I was found

When you're hanging by a thread
And I'm breaking down
Only two footprints in the sand
Thought you'd abandoned me and let go of my hand
But you were carrying me  carrying me to safety
Two footprints  your footprints in the sand
Only two footprints in the sand
Thought you'd abandoned me and let go of my hand
But you were carrying me  carrying me to safety
Two footprints  your footprints in the sand
Two footprints  two footprints  your footprints in the sand
The pressure builds  wanna put my hands through you
I'll squeeze you tight until you take your last breath
Loving you to death  loving you to death
The pressure's rising I won't make it through tonight
This love immortal is an assassin's delight
Just blow me up or run me down or cut my throat
And when its time for you to die
I'll let you know
Detonate me (Shoot me like a cannon ball)
Granulate me (Kill me like an animal)
Decapitate me (Hit me like a baseball)
Emancipate me (Free the animal  free the animal)
Free the animal
Free the animal
Free the animal
I love you so I'm putting you in quicksand
You take your chances when you kiss the hitman
The animal's inside of this infinite jest
Loving you to death  loving you to death!

I cry out but nothing comes now
I'm giving my all and I know peace will come
I never wanted to need someone
Thought I could do all just on my own
But even Superwoman
Sometimes needed Superman's soul
Help me out of this hell
Your love lifts me up like helium
When I've hit the ground
You're all I need
And if you let go I'll float towards the sun
I'm stronger 'cause you fill me up
But when the fear comes and I drift towards the ground
I am lucky that you're around
Thought I could do all just on my own
But even Superwoman

The image of me that you see
Isolated — miles out to sea
I don't want a separate place  I need to feel safe
And I will push (Push!)
To tear down the walls (Push! Push!)
Of this box you put me in (Push! Push!)
And now you push
To find a label that fits me
I'm feelin' good on a Wednesday
With my sparklin' thoughts
Help me unload the car
Ya! Ya! Ya!
And so I push
To close the door
Of the stall you've made for me
To keep me away!
And now we push (Push!)
To stand together
Because I am Lorde!

And what's the point of knowin' it
If you can't change it? You can't change  can't change it
To be human is to love
Even when it gets too much
I'm not ready to give up
To be human is to love
Even when it gets too much
There's no reason to give up
We can take it higher
I can hear the thunder coming from your mouth
And I know my number's up
Give me some Stevie Wonder
Quick  put it on before we go under
I can see the lightning coming from your ears
Yeah  I see you're frightened
I can see the lion sleeps tonight
In the tears you're crying
Ooh  can't love me unless you love you too
Treat yourself like nothin' but a fool
Can't love me unless you love you too
Love you too
Come now  set the past on fire
Together  we can take it higher
(Ooh  together) We can take it higher
Come now  set the past on fire
Together  we can take it higher
(Ooh  together) We can take it higher

I can see the rainbow coming from your heart
Come now  see you're my angel
Ooh  can't love me unless you love you too
Treat yourself like nothin' but a fool
Can't love me unless you love you too
Love you too
Come now  set the past on fire
Together  we can take it higher
(Ooh  together) We can take it higher
Come now  set the past on fire
Together  we can take it higher
(Ooh  together) We can take it higher
I want love  I wanna give it
I want love  please deliver it
I want love  I wanna give it
I want love  please deliver it
I want love  I wanna give it
I want love  please deliver it
I want love  I wanna give it
I want love  please deliver it
Come now  set the past on fire
Together  we can take it higher
(Ooh  together) We can take it higher
Come now  set the past on fire
Together  we can take it higher
(Ooh  together) We can take it higher
I'll do it 'til the sun goes down and all through the night time
Oh  yeah
Keep my sunglasses on while I shed a tear
It's never the right time  yeah-yeah
I put my armor on  show you how strong I am
I put my armor on  I'll show you that I am
I'm unstoppable  I'm a Porsche with no brakes
I'm so powerful  I don't need batteries to play
Unstoppable today  unstoppable today
Unstoppable today  I'm unstoppable today
Breakdown  only alone I will cry out loud
You'll never see what's hiding out
Hiding out deep down  yeah-yeah
I know  I've heard that to let your feelings show
Is the only way to make friendships grow
But I'm too afraid now  yeah

I'm unstoppable  I'm a Porsche with no brakes
I'm so powerful  I don't need batteries to play
Unstoppable today  unstoppable today
Unstoppable today  I'm unstoppable today
Unstoppable today  unstoppable today
But I see pain
Behind those eyes
You play the game
By the rigid rules
But you cheat yourself
There ain't nothing you can say
That would scare me away
I got history too
And it's never too late
Share a secret today
I reciprocrate
So hurt with me
I'll hurt with you
I've been where you've been
I've seen what you've seen
So hurt with me
We can hurt together
You might also like
Someday you'll taste
The freedom and relieve
Of a trouble shared
Today I'm here loving you
Confide in me
There ain't nothing you can say
That would scare me away
I got history too
And it's never too late
Share a secret today
I reciprocate
So hurt with me
I'll hurt with you
I've been where you've been (I've been where you've been)
I've seen what you've seen (I've seen what you've seen)
So hurt with me (So hurt with me)
We can hurt together"
