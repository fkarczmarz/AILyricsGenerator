lyrics
" the way you tasted
 it hurts that you moved on
I thought we had a place  just our place
Our home base  my headspace
Was you and I always
But that phase has been phased in our place
I see it on your face  a small trace
A blank slate  we've been erased
But if we're way too faded to drive
You can stay one more night
We said we'd both love harder than we knew we could go
But still  the hardest part is knowin' when to let go
You wanted to go higher  higher  higher
Burnt too bright  now the fire's gone
Watch it all fall down: Babylon
Babylon
We burnt too bright  now the fire's gone
Watch it all fall down
You might also like
I'm tired of the feud  your short fuse
My half-truths are not amused
I wish we had a clue to start new
A white moon  no residue
The colour of our mood is so rude
A cold June  we're not immune
But if we're way too faded to fight
You can stay one more night
We said we'd both love harder than we knew we could go
But still the hardest part is knowin' when to let go
You wanted to go higher  higher  higher
We burnt too bright  now the fire's gone
Watch it all fall down: Babylon
Babylon
We burnt too bright  now the fire's gone
Watch it all fall down
We said we'd both love harder than we knew we could go
But still  the hardest part is knowin' when to let go
You wanted to go higher  higher  higher
We burnt too bright  now the fire's gone
Watch it all fall down
We said we'd both loved harder than we knew we could go
(Than we knew we could go)
But still  the hardest part is knowin' when to let go (To let go)
We burnt too bright  now the fire's gone
Watch it all fall down: Babylon
Babylon
We burnt too bright  now the fire's gone
Hanging on a feeling
Driving through the valley just to chase the pain again
So this is where we are
I should've seen it comin'
I cried in your dark brown eyes
For the thousandth time
'Cause you love somebody
I died when you left that night
For the thousandth time
'Cause you love somebody else
I tried to stop the door as it was closin'
It was closin'
Can't help the way I keep ignorin' every omen
Every omen
Heaven knows I should let go
It's nothing that I don't already know
I kiss you on your neck (Oh-na-na)
You were starin' at the ceiling (Oh-na-na)
I should've known right then and there you were a runaway (Oh-na-na)
Can you help me rearrange it? (Oh-na-na)
I'm still makin' sense of having nothing left to save

Can't help the way I keep ignorin' every omen
Every omen
Heaven knows I should let go
It's nothing that I don't already know
That's what you do when you love somebody
That's what you do when you love somebody
That's what you do when you love somebody
That's what you do when you love somebody
Else (When you love somebody)
I would still bury that body for you
Swear to God I wouldn't tell another
Even every time that you got the flu
I'm not scared at all to get close to you
But I run to get you a tissue
I don't count the days
Most people I hate
You're my best friend
Through heaven and high water
You're my best friend
Remember when your parents went out of town?
They were dumb enough to leave us with the house
We had a hundred people naked on the sofa
Turns out that it was Jerry's dad
So we did shots while we rode in the back
He'd even let us all use the siren

You're my best friend
You're my best friend
 the future's better than yesterday
 you won't regret
 you won't regret
 you won't regret
I'd be at every party  I wouldn't miss a chance
New friends again and again  gone when the morning comes
Demons I tried to defend  but I couldn't get enough
Fadin' away  fadin' away
Wake up to someone with nothing to say
I'd never change  thought I'd never change
Then you come and change it all
Wrapped in your arms  I swear I'd die for
Hmm-mmm  hmm-mmm
Hmm-mmm  hmm
Thought I'd found the highest of highs
You came and topped them all
You shine in the dead of the night
And I was the first to fall

You're the only one who could lock this wild heart up in chains
You're the only love that can make this bad man better
You're the only one who could lock this wild heart up in chains
You're the only love that can make this bad man better
All of my wrongs  they led me right to you
Wrapped in your arms  I swear I'd die for
Wrapped in your arms  I swear I'd die for
Hmm-mmm  hmm-mm

She would hope  she would pray  she was waiting it out
Holding onto a dream while she watches these walls fall down
Sharp words like knives  they were cutting her down
Shattered glass like the past  it's a memory now
Holding onto a dream while she watches these walls fall down
Where did you lose your happiness?
I'm here alone inside of this broken home
Who is right? Who's wrong? Who really cares?
The fault  the blame  the pain's still there
I'm here alone inside of this broken home
This broken home
Wrote it down on the walls  she was screamin' it out
Made it clear she's still here  are you listenin' now?
Just a ghost in the halls feelin' empty  they're vacant now (Oh)
All the battles  all the wars  all the times that you've fought
She's the scar  she's the bruises  she's the pain that you brought
There was life  there was love like a light and it's fading out
Where did you lose your happiness?
I'm here alone inside of this broken home
Who's right? Who's wrong? Who really cares?
The fault  the blame  the pain's still there
I'm here alone inside of this broken home
This broken home

You've gotta let it go
You're losin' all your hope
Nothin' left to hold
Locked out in the cold
You painted memories
Then washed out all the scenes
I'm stuck in-between
A nightmare and lost dreams
Where did you lose your happiness?
I'm here alone inside of this broken home
Where did you lose your happiness?
I'm here alone inside of this broken home (Broken home)
Who's right? Who's wrong? Who really cares?
The fault  the blame  the pain's still there
I'm here alone inside of this broken home
Oh-oh  oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh  oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Young love  close the chapter
There's no ever after
Late night conversations
Led to complications
Now  my heart is in my hands (Oh-oh)
'Cause you walked out and left me stranded
Nothing left but picture frames
And I just keep on asking myself
How'd we drift so far away
From where we left off yesterday?
I'm lonely like a castaway-ay (Oh-oh)
Heartbreak that I can't escape
A sinking ship I'll never save
I'm lonely like a castaway-ay (Oh-oh)
You might also like
All your screamin' whispers
Slip right through my fingers
But these memories linger on (Oh-oh)
Eyes closed  all I see is
Good times disappearin'
And I'm trying to hold on (Oh-oh)
'Cause you walked out and left me stranded
Nothing left but picture frames
I just keep on askin' myself
How'd we drift so far away
From where we left off yesterday?
I'm lonely like a castaway-ay (Oh-oh)
Heartbreak that I can't escape (I can't escape)
A sinking ship I'll never save (I'll never save)

How'd we drift so far away (So far away)

This is not who I'm supposed to be
Without you  I'm nobody killin' time
I try to deceive
Try to win you desperately
Now  I'm lost in the swirling sea of your sorry eyes
All my life  I've been waiting for moments to come
When I catch fire and watch over you like the sun
I will fight to fix up and get things right
I can't change the world  but maybe I'll change your mind
Oh  say  do you know?
I'm a fool in a one-man show
I'm a broken stereo out of time
So  how (So  how) does it feel? (Does it feel?)
All alone  is it so surreal? (Woah-oh)
'Cause the ghost of survivor's guilt can be so unkind
All my life  I've been waiting for moments to come
When I catch fire and watch over you like the sun
I will fight to fix up and get things right
I can't change the world  but maybe I'll change your mind

The words you speak surrounding me
This is broken love in the first degree
The air you breathe is haunting me
Maybe I'll change your mind

I will fight to fix up and get things right
I can't change the world
I know that I can't change the world

It started on a weekend in May
Felt somebody looking at me
The way she looked was so ridiculous
Every single step had me waiting for the next
Dragged me out a bar to the back seat of her car
I can't forget my English love affair
The movie playin' in my head of her king-size bed
Means I can't forget my English love affair
My English love affair

Next thing we were back at her place
Drinkin' all the way to third base
The storyline was so ridiculous
Every single step had me begging for the next
Dragged me up the stairs and it wasn't ending there
When the lights go out (Lights go out)
She's all I ever think about (Think about)
I can't forget my English love affair
The movie playin' in my head of her king-size bed
Means I can't forget my English love affair
That nobody I knew would be believin' me
I look back now and know
That nobody could ever take the memory
When the lights go out (Lights go out)
She's all I ever think about (Think about)
I can't forget my English love affair
The movie playin' in my head of her king-size bed
Means I can't forget my English love affair
My English love affair
There's your coffee cup  the lipstick stain fades with time
If I can dream long enough  you'd tell me I'd be just fine
I'll be just fine
So I drown it out like I always do
Dancing through our house with the ghost of you
And I chase it down  with a shot of truth
Dancing through our house with the ghost of you
Cleanin' up today  found that old Zeppelin shirt
You wore when you ran away  and no one could feel your hurt
But I know better now  better now
So I drown it out like I always do
Dancing through our house with the ghost of you
And I chase it down  with a shot of truth
Dancing through our house with the ghost of you
Too young  too dumb
To know things like love
Too young  too dumb

Do you tell them white lies? (Hey)

Do you tell them that you love me
The way that I been lovin' you?
'Cause every night  you and I find ourselves
Kissin' and touchin' like no one else
Fallin' and fallin' until I fell

She's a good girl  she's daddy's favorite
He's saved for Harvard (He knows she'll make it)
She's good at school  she's never truant
She can speak French (I think she's fluent)
'Cause every night she studies hard in her room
At least that's what her parents assume
But she sneaks out the window to meet with her boyfriend
Here's what she told me the time that I caught 'em
She said to me  Forget what you thought
'Cause good girls are bad girls that haven't been caught
So just turn around and forget what you saw
'Cause good girls are bad girls that haven't been caught
Well  she's a good girl  a straight A-student
She's really into all that self-improvement
I swear she lives in that library
But if you ask her she'll say (That's where you'll find me)
But if you look  then you won't find her there
She may be clever  but she just acts too square
'Cause in the back of the room  where nobody looks (Nobody looks)
She'll be with her boyfriend (She's not reading books)

She maxed her credit cards and don't got a job
She pays the gas with all the change in her car
It's not the end of the road
Yeah  we've all been there before
He's walkin' home 'cause he can't pay for the bus
He needs a dollar but he ain't got enough

Another day
Of painted walls and football on the TV
No one sees me
Fade away
Lost inside a memory of someone's life
It wasn't mine
I was already missing before the night I left
Just me and my shadow and all of my regrets
Who am I? Who am I when I don't know myself?
Who am I? Who am I? Invisible
Wasted days
Dreaming of the times I know I can't get back
Seems I just lost track
Lookin' on
As all of life's colours seem to fade to grey
I just walked away
I was already missing before the night I left
Just me and your shadow and all of my regrets
Who am I? Who am I when I don't know myself?
Who am I? Who am I? Invisible

Is it bad that I'm wishing you're still broken?
That you haven't found fish in the ocean
Is it bad? So bad
Is it weird that I'm drunken on my sofa?
Is it weird that I'm naked on my sofa?
Is it weird? So weird
I know I'm the stupid one who ended it
And now I'm the stupid one regrettin' it
It took me a couple drinks to admit it

Love is fatal  won't you give it a chance?
Center of attention  don't you ask me any questions
Go on and light me like a cigarette
Even if it might be somethin' you regret
I only light up when cameras are flashin'
Never enough and no satisfaction
Got no shame
I love the way you're screaming my name
Diggin' my grave to get a reaction
Changin' my face and callin' it fashion
Got no shame

I'll give you my permission  you'll always be forgiven

Glad you didn't listen when the world was trying to slow me
Had to fuck it up before I really got to know me

Twilight moments with you

Visions I see are strong

If you don't swim  you'll drown

'Cause this deadbeat town's only here just to keep us down

Would you wanna run away too?

Faded  I'm wrapped in your arms

Such a sentimental love in a cynical world
My feelings get the best of me (Uh-huh  uh-huh)
I messed it up before  so I'm almost pretty sure
My karma got the best of me (Uh-huh  uh-huh)
I'm bad at letting go
Won't you let me down easy?
I can't let you go  so
(When you walk away)
Cut me open  take my heart
So we'll never be apart
Don't you let it go to waste
(When you walk away)
I can feel it in my bones
You don't love me anymore
Make it worth all of the pain
(When you walk away)

I've been dreamin' like a fool in a nightmare of a world
It's bringin' out the worst in me (Uh-huh  uh-huh)
Shook me to the core  my optimism floored
My karma got the worst of me (Uh-huh  uh-huh)
Bad at letting go
Won't you let me down easy?

Why?
Switching into airplane mode again
Press my cheek against the glass
Just be good till I get back
The ground disappears
I hold back the tears
I check my phone to see your face
Staring back as if to say
Why won't you love me?
Why won't you love me?
You imagine when you close your eyes
You're with me on the other side
Few drinks deep at a table for one
In the place we like to go and you take yourself home again
Three missed calls at 2AM

The time disappears
You hold back the tears
Your best girlfriend just got engaged
You say you can't wait and need to make a change
Why won't you love me?
Why won't you love me?
We're together all alone tonight
So helpless from the other side
Can you tell me why
I hold on to you and you hold on to me?
Can you tell me why
I hold on to you and you hold on?
Why won't you love me?
Why won't you love me?
You imagine when you close your eyes
You're with me on the other side

I hear you callin' out my name
And I can see it in your face
You've got a side you can't explain

Love me till the day I die?
Surrender my everything

Pullin' away from ya
