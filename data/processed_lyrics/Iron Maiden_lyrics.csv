lyrics
"But we don't need a reason
The Golden Goose is on the loose
And never out of season
Blackened pride still burns inside
This shell of bloody treason
Here's my gun for a barrel of fun
For the love of living death
The killer's breed or the demon's seed
Don't you pray for my soul anymore
Two minutes to midnight
The hands that threaten doom
Two minutes to midnight
To kill the unborn in the womb
We'll show the unbelievers
Napalm screams of human flames
As the reasons for the carnage cut their meat
And lick the gravy
We oil the jaws of the war machine
And feed it with our babies

The killer's breed or the demon's seed
Don't you pray for my soul anymore
Two minutes to midnight
The hands that threaten doom
Two minutes to midnight
To kill the unborn in the womb
The body bags and little rags
Of children torn in two
And the jellied brains of those who remain
To put the finger right on you
As the madmen play on words
And make us all dance to their song
To the tune of starving millions
To make a better kind of gun
The killer's breed or the demon's seed
Don't you pray for my soul anymore
Two minutes to midnight
The hands that threaten doom
Two minutes to midnight
To kill the unborn in the womb
Midnight
Midnight
Midnight
It's all night

I know a place where we can go (Go)
22 Acacia Avenue
Meet a lady that I know
So if you're looking for a good time
And you're prepared to pay the price
Fifteen quid is all she asks for
Everybody's got their vice
If you're waiting for a long time
For the rest to do their piece
You can tell her that you know me
You might even get in free
So any time you're down the East End
Don't you hesitate to go
You can take my honest word for it
She'll teach you more than you can know
Charlotte  can't you get out from all this madness?
Can't you see it only brings you sadness?
When you entertain your men don't you know the risk of getting disease?
Some day when you've reached the age of forty
I bet you'll regret the days when you were laying
Nobody then will want to know
You won't have any more beautiful wares to show anymore

22  the Avenue
That's the place where we all go
You will find it's warm inside
The red light's burning bright tonight
Charlotte  isn't it time you stopped this mad life?
Don't you ever think about the bad times?
Why do you have to live this way?
Do you enjoy your lay or is it the pay?
Sometimes when you're strolling down the Avenue
The way you walk  it makes men think of having you
When you're walking down the street
Everybody stops and turns to stare at you
22  the Avenue
That's the place where we all go
You will find it's warm inside
The red light's burning bright tonight
You're running away  don't you know what you're doing?
Can't you see it'll lead you to ruin?
Charlotte  you've taken your life and you've thrown it away
You believe that because what you're earning
Your life's good  don't you know that it's hurting?
All the people that love you  don't cast them aside
All the men that are constantly drooling
It's no life for you  stop all that screwing
You're packing your bags  you're coming with me
Then comes the sound of the guns sending flak
Got to get up for the coming attack
Jump in the cockpit and start up the engines
Gathering speed as we head down the runway
Got to get airborne before it's too late

Move in to fire at the mainstream of bombers
Let off a sharp burst and then turn away
Move to their blindsides and firing again
Bandits at 8 o'clock move in behind us
Ten ME-109s out of the sun
Ascending and turning our Spitfires to face them
I wipe the sweat from my brow
But it's not the fear
'Cause I'd rather go now
Trying to visualize
The horrors that will lay ahead
The desert sand mound
A burial ground
When it comes to the time
Are we partners in crime?
When it comes to the time
We'll be ready to die
And finish what's to be done
Thy kingdom come
Thy shall be done... on Earth
Trying to justify to ourselves
The reasons to go
Should we live and let live?
Forget or forgive?

Afraid to shoot strangers
Afraid to shoot strangers
Another kingdom
For that which I leave
Is too small for thee
Near to the east  in a part of ancient Greece
In an ancient land called Macedonia
Was born a son to Philip of Macedon
The legend  his name was Alexander
At the age of nineteen  he became the Macedon King
And he swore to free all of Asia Minor
By the Aegean Sea in 334 BC
He utterly beat the armies of Persia
Alexander the Great
His name struck fear into hearts of men
Alexander the Great
Became a legend 'mongst mortal men
The Scythians fell by the river Jaxartes
Then Egypt fell to the Macedon King as well
And he founded the city called Alexandria
By the Tigris River  he met King Darius again
And crushed him again in the battle of Arbela
Entering Babylon and Susa  treasures he found
Took Persepolis  the capital of Persia

Alexander the Great
His name struck fear into hearts of men
Alexander the Great
Became a god amongst mortal men
A Phrygian King had bound a chariot yoke
And Alexander cut the Gordian Knot
And legend said that who untied the knot
He would become the master of Asia
Hellenism he spread far and wide
The Macedonian learned mind
Their culture was a Western way of life
He paved the way for Christianity
Marching on  marching on
The battle-weary marching side by side
Alexander's army line by line
They wouldn't follow him to India
Alexander the Great
His name struck fear into hearts of men

What do you think you'd expect you would see?
Just like a mirror reflecting the moves of your life
And all the wounds are reopening again
We're blood brothers
We're blood brothers
We're blood brothers

And as you look all around at the world in dismay
Not if you're taking a look at the war-torn affray
Out in the streets where the babies are burnt

There are times when I feel I'm afraid for the world
There are times I'm ashamed of us all
When you're floating on all the emotion you feel
And reflecting the good and the bad

Can you really tell me what life is?
Maybe all the things that you know that are precious to you
Could be swept away by fate's own hand
We're blood brothers
We're blood brothers
We're blood brothers
We're blood brothers
When you think that we've used all our chances
And the chance to make everything right
Keep on making the same old mistakes
Makes untipping the balance so easy
When we're living our lives on the edge
Say a prayer on the book of the dead

About a thing that I saw
One night wandering in the Everglades
Gazing up at the stars
Not aware of a presence so near to me
Watching my every move
As something rushed me from the trees
Took me to an unholy place
And that is where I fell from grace
Then they summoned me over to join in with them
To the dance of the dead
And the blaze of the fire did no hurt upon me
As I walked onto the coals
Then I felt I was in a trance
And my spirit was lifted from me
And if only someone had the chance

All had death in their eyes
They had ascended from hell
Was laughing and howling down at me
Just danced the circle of death
Until the time came to reunite us both
My spirit came back down to me
I didn't know if I was alive or dead
As the others all joined in with me
And took the attention away from me
When they took their gaze from me
Was the moment that I fled
But behind I did not glance
One thing that I did not dare
Was to look just straight ahead
When you know that your time has come around
You know you'll be prepared for it
Say your last goodbyes to everyone
Drink and say a prayer for it
When you're lying in your sleep
When you're lying in your bed
And you wake from your dreams
To go dancing with the dead
When you're lying in your sleep
When you're lying in your bed
And you wake from your dreams
To go dancing with the dead
Just why they let me go
But I'll never go dancing no more
 they climbed aboard their silver ghost
 oblivion
 brandy and cigars
 they laughed
 stone sweats with the dew
 red before the blue
 waiting for command
 the R101
 a giant of the skies
 the Titanic fits inside
 with the beating yet to come
 the storm rising in the west
 we must take our chance with fate
 a trial never done
 her Achilles would become
 a hardened breed
 the telegraph sounds
 Damn the cargo! We'll be on our way tonight
 that's what he said
 just ashes in our past
 now what have we done?
 the angel of the east
And when I'm walking a dark road
When the light begins to change
I sometimes feel a little strange
A little anxious when it's dark
I have a constant fear that something's always near
I have a phobia that someone's always there
Have you run your fingers down the wall
And have you felt your neck skin crawl
When you're searching for the light?
Sometimes when you're scared to take a look
At the corner of the room
You've sensed that something's watching you

I have constant fear that something's always near

See the madman in his gaze
Fly as high as the sun
Now the crowd breaks and a young boy appears
Looks the old man in the eye
As he spreads his wings and shouts at the crowd
His eyes seem so glazed
As he flies on the wings of a dream
Now he knows his father betrayed

A life that's made to breathe destruction or defense
A wolf in sheep's clothing  or saintly or sinner
Or some that would believe a holy war winner
They fire off many shots and many parting blows
Their actions beyond the reasoning only God would know

He gave his life for us  he fell upon the cross
To die for all of those who never mourn his loss
It wasn't meant for us to feel the pain again
Tell me why
Reflecting on my past life and it doesn't have much time
'Cause at five o'clock they take me to the gallows pole
The sands of time for me are running low
When the priest comes to read me the last rites
Take a look through the bars at the last sights
Of a world that has gone very wrong for me
Can it be that there's some sort of error?
Hard to stop the surmounting terror

Mourning bleak and utter waste

I am formed of the dead
I am the harvester of the soul meat
And I suck the lives from around my bed
And I filled their living corpses with my bile
What humanity I knew I have long forgotten
Infinity is hard to comprehend
I couldn't hear those screams
Even in my wildest dreams
Suffocation  waking in a sweat
Scared to fall asleep again
In case the dream begins again
Someone chasing  I cannot move
Standing rigid  a nightmare's statue
What a dream  when will it end
And will I transcend?
Restless sleep  the mind's in turmoil
One nightmare ends  another fertile
It's getting to me  so scared to sleep
But scared to wake now  in too deep
Even though it's reached new heights
I rather like the restless nights
It makes me wonder  makes me think
There's more to this  I'm on the brink
It's not the fear of what's beyond
It's just that I might not respond
I have an interest  almost craving
But would I like to get too far in?

Tell the world of Passchendaele
Relive all that he's been through
Last communion of his soul
Rust your bullets with his tears
Let me tell you 'bout his years
Laying low in a blood-filled trench
Killing time till my very own death
On my face  I can feel the falling rain
Never see my friends again
In the smoke  in the mud and lead
Smell the fear and the feeling of dread
Soon be time to go over the wall
Rapid fire and the end of us all
Lifeless bodies hang on barbed wire
Battlefield: nothing but a bloody tomb
Be reunited with my dead friends soon
Many soldiers  eighteen years
Drown in mud  no more tears
Surely a war no one can win

Home  far away
From the war  a chance to live again
Home  far away
But the war  no chance to live again
The bodies of ours and our foes
The sea of death  it overflows
In no-man's-land  God only knows
Into jaws of death  we go
Crucified as if on a cross
Allied troops  they mourn their loss
German war propaganda machine
Such before has never been seen
Swear I heard the angels cry
Pray to God no more may die
So that people know the truth
Tell the tale of Passchendaele
Cruelty has a human heart
Every man does play his part
Terror of the men we kill
The human heart is hungry still
I stand my ground for the very last time
Gun is ready as I stand in line
Nervous wait for the whistle to blow
Rush of blood and over we go
Blood is falling like the rain
Its crimson cloak unveils again
The sound of guns can't hide their shame
And so we die in Passchendaele
Dodging shrapnel and barbed wire
Running straight at the cannon fire
Running blind as I hold my breath
Say a prayer  symphony of death
As we charge the enemy lines
A burst of fire and we go down
I choke a cry  but no one hears
Feel the blood go down my throat
Home  far away
From the war  a chance to live again
Home  far away
But the war  no chance to live again
Home  far away
From the war  a chance to live again
Home  far away
But the war  no chance to live again
See my spirit on the wind
Across the lines  beyond the hill
Friend and foe will meet again
I've been looking so long for you now
You won't get away from my grasp
You've been living so long in hiding
And hiding behind that false mask
And you know that I know that you ain't got that long to last
Your looks and your feelings are just the remains of your past
You're standing in the wings there  you wait for the curtain to fall
And knowing the terror and holding you have on us all
Now  I know that you're gonna
Scratch me and maim me and maul
And you know I'm helpless from your mesmerising catcall
Ooh
Don't you stray from the narrow way  yeah

Green is the cat's eye that glows in this Temple
Enter the risen Osiris  risen again
Tell me why I had to be a Powerslave
I don't wanna die  I'm a god
Why can't I live on?
When the Life Giver dies
All around is laid waste
And in my last hour
I'm a slave to the Power of Death
When I was living this lie  Fear was my game
People would worship and fall
Drop to their knees
So bring me the blood and red wine

Bow down and hear our cry
Our earthly rulers falter
Our people drift and die
The walls of gold entomb us
The swords of scorn divide
Take not thy thunder from us
Take away our pride
Just a babe in a black abyss
No reason for a place like this
The walls are cold and souls cry out in pain
An easy way for the blind to go
A clever path for the fools who know
The secret of the hanged man  the smile on his lips
The light of the blind  you'll see
The venom tears my spine
The eyes of the Nile are opening  you'll see
She came to me with a serpent's kiss
As the eye of the sun rose on her lips
Moonlight catches silver tears that I cry
So we lay in a black embrace
And the seed is sown in a holy place
And I watched and I waited for the dawn  oh

It is you  oh
See his eye as he stops one of three
Mesmerises one of the wedding guests
Stay here and listen to the nightmares of the sea
Driven south to the land of the snow and ice
To a place where nobody's been
Through the fog and ice and the albatross follows on
The Mariner kills the bird of good omen
His shipmates cry against what he's done
And make themselves a part of the crime
Sailing on and on and north across the sea
Sailing on and on and north till all is calm

The albatross begins with its vengeance
His shipmates blame bad luck on the Mariner
And the curse goes on and on and on at sea
And the thirst goes on and on for them and me
We stuck nor breath nor motion
As idle as a painted ship upon a painted ocean
All the boards did shrink
Nor any drop to drink
There comes a ship over the line
But how can she sail
With no wind in her sails and no tide?
See... Onward she comes
See... She has no crew
They throw their dice for the crew
She wins the Mariner
And he belongs to her now
Then... crew one by one
Too quick for groan or sigh
Each turned his face with a ghastly pang
And cursed me with his eye
Four times fifty living men
(And I heard nor sigh nor groan)
They dropped down one by one.
Along with the sea creatures
And by the light of the moon
Then the spell starts to break
The albatross falls from his neck
Sinks down like lead into the sea
Then down in falls comes the rain
Hear the groans of the long-dead seamen
See them stir and they start to rise
Bodies lifted by good spirits
Now the curse is finally lifted
And the Mariner sights his home
Spirits go from the long-dead bodies
And then a boat came sailing towards him
It was a joy he could not believe
Penance of life will fall onto him
And the Hermit shrieves the Mariner of his sins
The Mariner's bound to tell of his story
To tell this tale wherever he goes
To teach God's word by his own example
That we must love all things that God made
And the wedding guest's a sad and wiser man
He brought us pain and misery
He took our game for his own need
Out on the plains we gave him hell
Riding through dust clouds and barren wastes
Galloping hard on the plains
Chasing the redskins back to their holes
Fighting them at their own game
Soldier blue in the barren wastes
Hunting and killing's their game
Raping the women and wasting the men
The only good Indians are tame
Selling them whiskey and taking their gold
Enslaving the young and destroying the old

He sees them in the distance
Where the darkened clouds roll
He could feel tension
In the atmosphere
He would look in the mirror
See an old man now
Can be done about the situation
We can do at all
To sit and wait around
For something to occur

As he stares across the garden
Looking at the meadows
And wonders if they'll
Ever grow again
The desperation of the situation
Getting graver
Getting ready
When the wild wind blows
Have you seen what they said
On the news today?
Have you heard what they said
About us all?
Do you know what is happening
To just every one of us?
There will be a catastrophe
The like we’ve never seen
There will be something
That will light the sky
That the world as we know it
It will never be the same
He carries everything
Getting ready
When the moment comes
He has enough supplies
To last them for a year or two
They tell us nothing
That we don't already know about
They tell us nothing
That is real at all
They only fill us
With the stuff that they want
He's nearly finished
With the preparations for the day
He's getting tired
That'll do for now
They are preparing
For the very worst to come to them
Getting ready
When the wild wind blows
He sees the picture on the wall
It's falling down upside down
He sees a teardrop from his wife
Remember times they had
Of a lifetime spent together long ago will be gone
They've been preparing for some weeks now
For when the crucial moment comes
To take their refuge in the shelter
Let them prepare for what will come
They make a tea and sit there waiting
They're in the shelter feeling snug
Not long to wait for absolution
Can't believe all the lying
All the screens are denying
That the moments of truth have begun
Can't you see it on the TV?
Don't believe them in the least bit
Now the days of our ending have begun
Say a prayer when it's all over
Got to try and help each other
Got the will to overcome
I can't believe all the lying
All the screens are denying
That the moments of truth have begun
Can't you see it on the TV?
Don't believe them in the least bit
Now the days of our ending have begun
Arms wrapped around each other
Their tins of poison laying
Nearby their clothes
The day they both mistook
An earthquake for the fallout
Of engines roar in the night
The mission is near  the confident men
Are waiting to drop from the sky
No one should go where eagles dare
Bavarian Alps that lay all around
They seem to stare from below
The enemy lines a long time passed
Are lying deep in the snow
Into the night  they fall through the sky
No one should fly where eagles dare
They're closing in  the fortress is near
It's standing high in the sky
The cable car's the only way in
It's really impossible to climb

They make their way  but maybe too late
They've got to try to save the day
The panicking cries  the roaring of guns
Are echoing all round the valley
The mission complete  they make to escape
Away from the Eagle's Nest
They dared to go where no one would try"
