"Ha
Yeah!
Ha
Woke up a little too late this morning
But I think I'll be okay
I'll be okay
My mom is gonna kill me
Gonna kill me
Traffic's backed up from corner to corner
So I guess I'll hit the highway
The highway
Shake away all the stress off my shoulders
Gonna have a good day
A good day
Because I'm eighteen
And I still live with my parents
Yeah they're not like yours
Well yours are more understanding
I've never fell in love
I saved those feelings for you
So let's do all the stupid shit that young kids do
Let's do all the stupid shit that young kids do

No I've never really been the smartest
Yeah I've made my mistakes
My mistakes
You were there when times were at their darkest
Always showing me the way
Lead the way
You'll always have a part of me
A part of me
Losing you has always been the hardest
I wish it were the old days (oh I wish it were the old days)
'Cause I was eighteen
And I still lived with my parents
Yeah they're not like yours
Well yours were more understanding
I never fell in love
I saved those feelings for you
When we did all the stupid shit that young kids do
Let's do all the stupid shit that young kids do
It's me and you
You
You
Just me and you
You
Hey…hey
Because I'm eighteen
And I still live with my parents
Yeah they're not like yours
Well yours are more understanding
I've never fell in love
I saved those feelings for you
So let's do all the stupid shit that young kids do
Let's do all the stupid shit that young kids do
Noooo....
The key to the city to Khalid Donnel Robinson
Told everyone I turned my phone off
Didn't ask for help and now I’m lost
Life comes in phases (Phases)
Consequences and mistakes
I'm sorry that it's taken me so long
Only sweet until it all goes sour
I need another chance to say goodbye
I shouldn't have to die to feel alive
Here's the thing with disappearing
You can yell and no one hears you
When I finally have so much to say
And do what I have to stop the tears
You might also like
I wish you could've stopped me from falling off the hill
Only sweet until it all goes sour
But life is what you make it until it gets too real
I need another chance to say goodbye
My eyes are on the grey skies
Saying I don't want to come home tonight
I don't even remember
But my friend passed out in the Uber ride
Where all the girls are pretty
And they're down for the hype
All my boys are with me
Going up for the night
'Cause this is our year
So wake me up in the spring
While I'm high off my American dream
We don't always say what we mean
That's the lie of an American teen
Maybe the end is near
But I've been waiting all year
To get the hell up out of here
And throw away my fears
I'm so faded (I'm so faded)
Maybe I'm not really drunk
Maybe I'm really good at faking

'Cause this is our year
So wake me up in the spring
While I'm high off my American dream
We don't always say what we mean
That's the lie of an American teen
My youth is the foundation of me
Living life as an American teen (American teen)

We don't always say what we mean
When we're high off our American teen
My youth is the foundation of me
So wake me up in the spring
While I'm high off my American (American dream)
And we don't always say what we mean
It's the lie of an American teen
My youth is the foundation of me
Living life as an American teen
American teen (American teen)
American Teenager
And I'll be living this dream with you
We don't always say what we mean
When we're high off our American teen
My youth is the foundation of me
In my living room
That have walked the sun
And have slept on the moon
Covered in the fragrance
Of their own perfume
Telling me the stories
Stories coming true
Well you see these angels
These angels see the light
Yeah I had my troubles
I've been seeing angels
Oh no
They'll hold onto their secrets
And torn up memories
We float above horizons
And sail across the seas
I hope for better days
And lightly times are tough
The angels give me strength
And I'm not giving up
So I wipe away my tears
I unveil my pain
They're brushing off my shoulders
And I hold on to their stain
I've been seeing angels

You cut me deep and you left me wide open
I fought the demons that lie in between us
I guess this sounds like another sad love song
I can't get over how it all went wrong
Bridges they are burning
Tables they are turning
I took the time to think of what you said
You were tap-dancing in my head
But I'm broken inside

 this is all you've been talking about
 oh no
 this is what you like
 bring it side to side

 oh no
 this is what you like
We're so in denial of breaking up  we make it up
Every time I look in your eyes  I’m back in love
I've waited all my life  for someone like you
But I'm losing sight of your point of view
Are we broken? Lost in emotion
Are you all in? Are you bluffing?
Is this the last fight? Lay here one last night
I know we’re both tired  that's our excuse
Are you all in? Are you bluffing?
It's no one's fault  that's what they say
You want it your way  you know it all
We said its no one's fault  losing our minds
Lie after lie  fake love
We had a hell of a ride
Issues aside  both of us

Searchin' for pieces  covering up the hole
I'll fight for your love  I'll fight for your soul
I'll throw all of my cares away for you
I'll be there to wait for you
Maybe you weren't the one for me
But deep down I wanted you to be
I'll still see you in my dreams
All the things that I did for you  just wasn't it for you
So I'll be coasting  roller-coasting
Through my emotion
I will be coasting  roller-coasting
I'm hoping that you'll come back to me
Moving on seems harder to do
When the one that you love moves faster than you
I gave you my all  I showed the proof of your lies
And you weren't worth it  you don't deserve me
As time passes I'm feeling high
You're not the one I'm thinking of tonight
I may not be over you  but I'll try inside

So don't come back to me  no
No  don't come back to me
No  don't come back to me
You weren't the one for me
You weren't the one for me
You weren't the one for me
The way you've been treating me is getting out of hand
And you walk around like you're so innocent
I gave you my heart and it melted in your arms
This isn't a place that I belong
I feel your fear
Surrounded by your skin
You feel my heartbeat vibrate so violent
Inside of your head
I see it in your eyes
You're no good for me
And love is blind
You want what I'm giving up
But my love is not enough
Cold blooded  cold blooded
And I can’t feel my fingertips
But you feel better when we touch

Surrounded by your skin
You feel my heartbeat vibrate so violent
Inside of your head
I see it in your eyes (see it in your eyes)
That you're no good for me
And love is blind
You want what I'm giving up
But my love is not enough
Cold blooded  cold blooded
And I can't feel my fingertips
But you feel better when we touch
Mmmm
Fill me up  keep me hot
Use me up of all I've got
I feel your fear
Surrounded by your skin
You feel my heartbeat vibrate so violent
Inside of your head
I see it in your eyes
You're no good for me
And love is blind
You want what I'm giving up

Let's burn out tonight
Even if we don't survive
We were right about being wrong
Don't look back to the wreck
And now the way you say
My name sounds like a song
That you've been singing all along
Don't forget it once I'm gone

Focused on the smell of all the burnt out cigarettes
My thoughts play on repeat
Only comfort that I keep
'Cause in a moment I will be
Something you will forget
Now tell me was I ever something that you could regret

But at least I tried my best
But if my memory’s right
You're the one that left
I'll be hopeless hopelessly romantic

But at least I tried my best
But if my memory’s right
You're the one that left
I'll be hopeless hopelessly romantic
 but I get back on my feet
 I got a lot on my sleeve
 but it's all on repeat
 I got no room to breathe
 the sun won't shine on my face
 got a hundred things I gotta do today
 the sun won't shine on my face
 got a hundred things I gotta do today
 gotta be prepared

I never know what you feel no more  just say you don't want me
Say you can't deal with me no more  just say you don't want me
I never know what you feel no more  just say you don't want me
It's been too much  I've been on the side and I'm waiting
What's on your mind? I can never read you (I can't)
Especially when you're loving me  yeah
It's never enough for the both of us  so sorry
Couldn’t have known it would ever be this hard
I should be here waiting for you to answer my calls  no
But I'm never giving up on word  I've been
I've been focusing on putting me first
Still could never see you with somebody else
I can't even live with being by myself
That's the part of me that really needs your help
Lately  I haven't been doing very well
That's the difference between heaven and hell
I feel heaven when you're here with me
I feel hell every time you leave
But I need to get you off of my back
I gotta get you off of my back
We said we would never take it this far
Here we are  going back and forth
I hoped we would never make it this far
But now  I gotta find my worth

I never know what you feel no more  just say you don't want me
And I couldn't stand the scent
But if it's what it takes to put a smile on your face
I guess I'll deal with it
You hung with the popular kids
And I couldn't stand them

Can you feel this energy?
This is the start of something great
We might... be a little late... hey
Hey  but at least we're on our way
You got too much time to waste
Focusing on what people say
They might not like that we've arrived
But we're here to stay
Leave your sorrow on the table
Pick up your worries and throw them out the window
You don't gotta let your friends know
There's so much trouble to get into
Let's go  let go
Let's go  let go

Go 'head and drop all the relations
Leave your sorrow on the table
Pick up your worries and throw them out the window
You don't gotta let your friends know
There's so much trouble to get into
Let go  let go
Let's go  let's go
So let's go  let's go
I meet you at the spot  send the location
I don't do this a lot  special occasion
I know you ain't a thottie  you ain't no basic
I turn your dry spot to an oasis
I kiss the right spots  I know all the places
Oh I lick the right spots  that's an ultimatum
The loud in rotation  cloud 9  flotation
Let the rose petals spread like rosacea
I know your ex to blame for your cold nature
Tell him stay in his lane  stop the road ragin'
And now I got you in here makin' those faces
Runnin' 'round the bedroom like four bases  moolah!
Send me your location  let's
Focus on communicating
'Cause I just need the time and place to come through (Place to come through)
Send me your location
Let's ride the vibrations
I don't need nothing else but you (I don't need nothing else but you)
At times I wonder why I fool with you
But this is new to me  this is new to you
Initially  I didn't wanna fall for you
Gather my attention it was all for you  so don't
Take advantage  don't leave my heart damaged
To understand that things go a little bit better when you plan it... oh

I just really care about you (You)
I'm enjoyin' starin' into (To)
Your eyes when I'm all in it with you
They can choose to watch  but I'd rather they just listen
Could fill up an album with everything that they're missin'
They so superficial  don't understand how we're chillin'
We don't need a lot  we got us and that's why we're winnin'
To them it's a park bench  us a magic carpet
Little trips to Target turn to avant garde shit
I promise  we got this  we got this
Baby just send me your

But I'm going in the right direction
Floating through different dimensions

Mmm  yeah
You go searching for paradise
You sit back and close your eyes
We're burning  yet so alive
And now you've got your hands up
Hoping you catch the high
Feels like the summer time
Chasing the northern lights  oh
Don't like watching your momma cry
You say you'd rather die
She says you're wasting your life
Oh  life don’t stop the more we pray
All your wrongs from yesterday
Smokin’ himalayan haze
Won’t wash all your sins away
Hate don’t give
Love don’t rewind all the good times
All the dollars you’ll spend
Give it up for nights like this
Don’t give into overthinking
Pour a drink when it ends

Do you hear me through your speakers
So much distance  space between us
Say you're dreaming and I’ve been  too
And no-one knows what you’ve been through
And I've been thinking a little deeper
Contemplation  getting cleaner
See no leaders  need more teachers
I'm in shambles  I don't sleep much
Oh  life don’t stop the more we pray
All your wrongs from yesterday
Smokin’ himalayan haze
Won’t wash all your sins away
Hate don’t give
Love don’t rewind all the good times
All the dollars you’ll spend
Give it up for nights like this
Don’t give into overthinking
Pour a drink when it ends (Overthink)
Could I make you my baby?
If we do the unthinkable
Would it make us look crazy?
If you ask me  I'm ready
'Cause you already know him  it's coincidental
That he learns your body and mind the way I do
Secrets you told me  were they confidential?
Or do you let anyone inside your mental?
I bet you ain't told him the things that we been through
I know you're not flossing your wrist like you been doin'
The fact that I actually started to trust you
Then you broke my heart  somеone bring me a tissue
Or maybе my notebook  I'll sharpen my pencil
To write you a letter and show you I'm into you (Show it)
Still down forever  even if it's pleasure
Go 'head  sign your name on the package I sent to you (Open)
Open it up and when you get to cheesing
I hope you believe in the end that I got you (Got you)
How can I move forward if every relationship
I get in don't hit the same if it's not you?

Do you still use that Versace bag that I bought you?
Look back at the pics of vacations I brought you on?
He can't even match it  he's not in my bracket
It doesn't look good on you  way too appealin'
