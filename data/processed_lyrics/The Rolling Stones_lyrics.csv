"I can't get no satisfaction
'Cause I try and I try and I try and I try
When I'm driving in my car
And that man comes on the radio
And he's telling me more and more
About some useless information
Supposed to fire my imagination
I can't get no satisfaction
I can't get no satisfaction
When I'm watching my TV
And a man comes on and tells me
How white my shirts can be
Well he can't be a man 'cause he doesn't smoke
The same cigarettes as me

I can't get no satisfaction
I can't get no girl reaction
When I'm riding 'round the world
And I'm doing this and I'm signing that
And I'm trying to make some girl
I can't get no satisfaction
You meet at certain dismal dull affairs
Running up and down the stairs
Too much in too few years
Your eyes are edged with tears
Here comes your 19th nervous breakdown
But you were never brought up right
You were always spoiled with a thousand toys
But still you cried all night
Your mother who neglected you
Owes a million dollars tax
And your father's still perfecting ways
Of making sealing wax

That girl's just insane
It only seems to make matters worse
You were still in school when you had that fool
Who really messed your mind
On treating people kind
To rearrange your mind

Here comes your 19th nervous breakdown
That girl's just insane
It only seems to make matters worse
But you were never brought up right
You were always spoiled with a thousand toys
But still you cried all night
Your mother who neglected you
Owes a million dollars tax
And your father's still perfecting ways
Of making sealing wax
Here it comes
Here comes your 19th nervous breakdown
Here comes your 19th nervous breakdown
Here comes your 19th nervous breakdown
Here comes your 19th nervous breakdown
Here comes your 19th nervous breakdown
When will those clouds all disappear?
Angie  Angie
Where will it lead us from here?
With no loving in our souls
And no money in our coats
You can't say we're satisfied
But Angie  Angie
You can't say we never tried
But ain't it time we said goodbye?
Angie  I still love you
Remember all those nights we cried?
All the dreams we held so close
Seemed to all go up in smoke
Let me whisper in your ear

I sit and watch the children play
Smiling faces I can see
But not for me
I sit and watch
As tears go by
My riches can't buy everything
I want to hear the children sing
All I hear is the sound

It is the evening of the day
I sit and watch the children play
Doing things I used to do
They think are new
I sit and watch

 I need no nursing
Just had a fortnight's sleep
I'm feeling so stuffed  I'm so distracted
Ain't touched a thing all week
I'm feeling drunk  juiced up and sloppy
Ain't touched a drink all night
I'm feeling hungry  can't see the reason
Just had a horse meat pie
Yeah when you call my name
I salivate like a Pavlov dog
Yeah when you lay me out

The one that shut the kitchen door?
He don't give a hoot of warning
Wrapped up in a black cat cloak

Kids are different today
I hear every mother say
Mother needs something today
To calm her down
And though she's not really ill
There's a little yellow pill

Of her mother's little helper
And it helps her on her way
Gets her through her busy day
Things are different today
I hear every mother say

So she buys an instant cake
And she burns a frozen steak

Like a queen in days of old
She shoots colours all around
Like a sunset going down
Have you seen a lady fairer?
She comes in colours everywhere
She combs her hair
She's like a rainbow
Coming colours in the air
She comes in colours
She's like a rainbow
Coming colours in the air
With a smile on your face and a tear right in your eye
My sweet honey love
Berber jewelry jangling down the street
Make you flirt your eyes at every woman that you meet
Could not seem to get a high on you
My sweet honey love
May the good Lord shine a light on you
Make every song your favorite tune
May the good Lord shine a light on you
Warm like the evening sun
And your late night friends leave you in the cold gray dawn
I just can't brush them off
Angels beating all their wings in time
With smiles on their faces and a gleam right in their eyes

Please allow me to introduce myself
I'm a man of wealth and taste
Stole many a man's soul and faith
And I was 'round when Jesus Christ
Had his moment of doubt and pain
Made damn sure that Pilate
Washed his hands and sealed his fate
But what's puzzlin' you is the nature of my game
Stuck around St. Petersburg
When I saw it was a time for a change
Killed the Tsar and his ministers
Anastasia screamed in vain
When the Blitzkrieg raged and the bodies stank
