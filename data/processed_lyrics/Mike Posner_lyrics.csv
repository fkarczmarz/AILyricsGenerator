lyrics
" I think it'll be an experience for you that you'll never forget.
 I'm really excited for you.
 Nobody gets hurt.
 and I love you.
 though it's it my throat
 I feel like a misanthrope
 we don't talk as much as we used to
 if I can get myself out of this broke mood
 that's what I'm gon' do
 then I would
 then I would
 and I'm open wide
 watch me toe the line
 in the grand art piece that is my life
 this is just a brush stroke
 universe means one song
 swim into the unknown
 isn't fame
 then I would
 then I would
 what would that be?
 this is what you wanted.
I can't tell if she's down or not
Oh  you like me?
What the hell does that mean?
Don't be so ambiguous girl
Don't be so ambiguous girl
Are we gonna fuck or not?
Maybe I'm just dumb
But I can't read the signals that you're givin'
And I can never tell
If you're looking at me or Clinton
Is this the way that you talk to every guy that you meet?
Or do you wanna come back and stay up
Baby  what's your favorite drinks?
I think I'mma buy a round of 'em all
I'm rollin' up the bestest
Come help me blow a pound of it all
I'm on that up-upper echelon
You should climb up and be down with it all
Come here  cause we go hand in hand
Like (*clap clap clap*)  round of applause
Showtime bitch  action
I think it's time for that night scene
She go to sleep and dream about my sex
I guess it's a pipe dream
28  but I make her feel like she 19
Tryna stick around like wifey
But I send her home in my white T like
Bye

Now  every time I see this girl
She be askin' all type of shit
Where is it I'm going to
And who is it I'm hanging with?
Can't ever tell if she into me
Or just wanna be a friend to me
Mixed signals she's sending me
Late night at the club  drunk texted me
Like  Can I come over your house?
Okay  but can I come over your mouth?
Smiley face  LOL
Back and forth  I can't tell
Without being conspicuous
So (don't be so ambiguous girl)
Whatever name you like to use
We ask that you allow tonight to be another one of our best shows
We're grateful for what we get to do
Please allow the lights to be perfect  the sound to be perfect
And my fingers to hit all the right keys
I remember writing all these little songs in my notebook
And now these people pay to see me
That's just crazy  you must admit
Before that first deal  before those hits
Tone and I would wrap our arms around each other backstage
And Big Sean would say words like this
I didn't understand though  mama raised me a atheist
Which is fine  but I now think maybe it's
More to life than the things you can touch and feel
To me  God's just life and love  it's real
Not a old white man in the sky
That's how I used to think about it  but it didn't feel right
It's 9:08  we getting kinda late  so we open up our eyes and say
Amen (Amen)
For the life  the love  the spirit
Amen (Amen)
For the things my eyes don't see
Amen (Amen)
For the ones no longer with us
Amen (Amen)
Please say a prayer for me

To the family of Jessica Joe May
Six years ago  she wrote me and said she was my biggest fan
And she wouldn't go to sleep if I didn't hit her back
A friendship started  but ended too soon
Just a child  she used to tweet me every day
Draw me little pictures  say I hope you feel okay
I bet she never knew that I was going through some shit
My family was pissed at me and I almost quit
On that November night 'til I saw what she tweeted
Keep making good music  that was just what I needed
You know I never even told her Thank you  and I don't know why
'Cause on August 26th  Jessica died
I never thought that some fan on Twitter
Would give me a broken heart  but Lord  I miss her
When you opening the gates up  don't forget her
And save me a spot  soon  I'll be right there with her
Amen (Amen  amen)
For the life  the love  the spirit
Amen (Amen)
For the things my eyes don't see
Amen (Amen)
For the ones no longer with us
Amen (Amen)
Please say a prayer for me
Dear Ra  Jehova  Dao  Brahma
Whichever name that you prefer
My big sister is a real light in the world
So yes  Lord  this is for her
I used to think she was crazy
All that hippie shit that she was on
Tying yourself to trees  man  I thought it was wrong
While I was flying 'round the world tryna get famous
You volunteered in New Orleans when the hurricane hit
Helping displaced kids
And people interview me while she remains nameless
Hmm  I didn't always get it
You lived in such a bad hood that I was 'fraid to visit
Uh  but on the side of your crib
You started a garden for all them little kids
And you taught 'em to grow fruits and veggies for they families
And here I am  worrying about a GRAMMY
I'll never forget that February night
I was in the studio with J. Cole  they were prepping the mic
You hit me with that text saying we needed to speak
I thought you were pregnant  I was prepping a speech
But it was something different that you had to say
Michael  I'm in love with a woman  I'm gay
Searching for the words in my head
When I found 'em  this is what I said
I just want you to know that I love you
That's no matter what  Mom and Dad do too
And I got your back until my last day
And the universe does too  that's why I say
Amen (Amen)
For the life  the love  the spirit
Amen (Amen)
For the things my eyes don't see
Amen (Amen)
For the ones no longer with us
Amen (Amen)
No one seemed to notice me
Being young was getting so old
Cheap beer and cigarettes
Life was like a movie set
And I seemed to be given no role
But in times of trouble
I can turn to my mother
And I know that she gon' understand
So at age 18
I cried to my mother
There are moments when you fall to the ground
But you are stronger than you feel you are now
Just be as you are
Life is not always a comfortable ride
Everybody's got scars that they hide
Just be as you are

They played me on the radio
I thought I was all the way grown
But I can still remember in that cold November
When I realized I'm all alone
But in times of trouble
I can turn to my mother
And I know that she gon' understand
So at age 22
I cried to my mother
There are moments when you fall to the ground
But you are stronger than you feel you are now
Just be as you are
It doesn't matter if you become some star
Life is better when you open your heart
Just be as you are (Just be as you are)
Be as you are (Whoa)
Be as you are
If I'm speaking truthfully
I'm not who I used to be
And I know some people might laugh
'Cause my music doesn't sound the same
And my head's no longer shaved
I'm worried if I'm on the right path
But in times of trouble
I can turn to my mother
And I know that she gon' understand
So at age 26
I spoke to my mother
There are moments when you fall to the ground
But you are stronger than you feel you are now
Just be as you are
It doesn't matter if you become some star
Life is better when you open your heart
Just be as you are (Be as you are)
Be as you are (Be as you are)
Be as you are (Be as you are)

I’m a Midwest music man
And I’ve been to a lot of places
But I’m gon’ end where I began
I took class in Carolina
Got high smoking joints
And now they know my name in Paris
But I’ll be buried in Detroit
I used to live in New York City
Not for my hometown
That place people avoid
I’ve made love in every city
But I’ll be buried in Detroit
I try to tell it like it is and sometimes God makes it rhyme
I like my songs how I like my women
Honest and to the point
You see I got fucked up in Stockholm

And now I pray to God like I hope you a map for me
Up at 5 am like nobody want it as bad as me
I guess hunger either kill you or it energize you
Me and ma started a charity to give the kids clarity
And take it further than the foundation we laid
Buried in Detroit

So I'm sitting here trying to go through the motion
Get along but it'd be better if we boned
I beat my dick like I don't need money
She get around probably fuck yo homie

It was how you used words I didn't know
And the way you said my name
And cut up peaches and them brown eyes
Lit a flame up that we pretend doesn't glow
You know space and time wouldn't let you be mine
What I've come to understand
Is entropy wouldn't leave you to me

Overcome by the nostalgias

You will never be craving me

It was the prettiest mask that you ever wore

Put my face inside my hands
The day my daddy died  I became a man
The cops came  they did not take off their shoes
January in Detroit is cold as fuck
The day my daddy died  I damn near quit the band
The day my daddy died  I held my mama's hand
I cried my tears  then dried 'em up
Put my face inside my hands
The day my daddy died  I became a man

And lived the free life of the rover
And played my little songs all over
And they shipped me away to the war
And the DJ played Miley Cyrus
A Party in the USA
And the DJ played Miley Cyrus
And we flew to the Afghan that day
I remember the day our orders came in
I was scared and my stomach was sinking
And I fired right back without blinking
We chased them with bullets
And we showered them with shells
And in ten minutes flood we blown them to hell
I thought of my mom in Atlanta

Cause she always loved Miley Cyrus
A Party In The USA
Though the words seemed to take on new meaning
As I turned nineteen on that day
I looked at my brothers who'd once been young boys
And their eyes have gone black from the slaughters
And for ten weary weeks I kept myself for life
As we moved down the range towards the water
But then one day a shell knocked my ass over head
And when I woked up in my hospital bed
And when I saw what it had done I wished I was dead
I never knew there were worse things than dying
And the nurses hummed Miley Cyrus
As the doctors explained what was wrong
But I no longer cared for that song
And they sent us all home to Atlanta
I wore fatigues and a blood red bandana
We landed on the same runway we'd lefted on February
And when I looked down where my legs used to be
I thanked God that no one was waiting for me
To grieve and to mourn and to pity
A Party In The USA
And no one cheered they just stared at us
And slowly turned their heads away
That I could do anything I want
So I'm about to change up

Went to see some shaman in Malay
To hear some things I wanted to hear

We spent the night on Lydia's couch
I didn't know you were gon' break my heart then
I didn't know the pain I'd feel right now
But underneath are memories
To let go
But it's not that simple
Type of misery
All these mixed up signals
In my head
I still hear these echoes
Of when you loved me
But now you're just someone in my mind

I can worry  I can overthink things
That's exactly when I tend to wanna drink things
Tend to wanna smoke things
'Til I realized there's no thing outside of me
That kinda helped me grow wings
Listen up  I think this is dope
To love's very different than to own
Let that sink in
I grew my hair  but never lost my J Dilla vibe
Airplane mode  don't kill the vibe
I had to remind people I was still alive
I had to remind people of what's real inside
But even more beautiful with no pill inside
Feel the vibe?
I wanted to be Deion  I was more Wojciechowski
My friends gon' hit the club  I tell 'em go without me

Ashamed of the way that I used to treat women
Objectifying
Embarrassed  but I'll never lie

I was in the gym the other day in Los Angeles
And I saw all of the beautiful bodies

I'm gon' do it
Twitter is apoplectic

Ships are safe in the harbor  but that ain't what ships are made for
I say I am not my haircut  I'm not my body
Not my clothes  I'm something much more beautiful
Deeper than even I know
Took me 30 years to wake up and write this song
 I just believe that there's no proof
 the melody's important

Talkin' 'bout you're leavin'
Cause you don't believe in
Me and all my reasons
Left me with these demons
And this little pen
And this nostalgic feeling
Only me alone
I'm faking all my smiles
And you're just killing me with silence
And you're just killing me with time
I don't know where to put my sorry's
You're running laps around my mind
How could you leave me on this tightrope?
And I feel nothing when it storms
You know you're killing me with silence

If you would've taken the time you would've read  'Lets leave here  right fuckin' now  without a breath or a call home'.
But all you heard was I love you  a joke of a sentence. A sentence men who pretended to know you whispered to you during sex because it seemed appropriate for the situation. It played out that way in a movie they'd seen so they recycled the line. No novel laid under their 'I love you's'. So you never read mine.
I keep my ten thousand words to myself while you label me with ones like 'weird' and 'aloof'.

But the more I think about it shit it's probably better
I'mma turn a single stone into a pile of diamonds
I remember when I didn't have the funds to buy shit
Holla if that's something that you can identify with
But now I drop a grip on the jeans
And now I drop your rent on some weed
And now I'm making love on your sheets
I'm in your worst nightmare and in your girlfriend's dreams
I'm a skinny motherfucker like six foot three
I said fuck a weight room  I was selling CD's
Getting more pussy than the whole football team
I was born in Riverside and I'm still that
Yeah I heard your new shit and it's still wack
Every time we get together you gonna feel that
One shot  everything rides on tonight
Even if I've got three strikes
I'mma go for it
This moment  we own it
And I'm not to be played with
Because it can get dangerous
See these people I ride with
This moment  we own it
I got them wetter than a Vilbrequin youngest of the champions
Beach house music  cue the dark pads and violins
Clear glass out in Malibu with all my friends
I'm growing up I gotta buzz call it motivation
Blowing up like iPhone push notifications
Priceless if I had it back I wouldn't change a thing
It's far from over so I tell the fat lady sing
And she hitting the notes and I'm starting to feel
Like I can't sit in coach cause I get fucking killed
Cold like Winterfell I Game of Throne it
They all in the D now  Beantown we own it
Shouts to the D.O. Beantown we roll it
Yeah me and my Gs and we own it  yeah Sammy
One shot  everything rides on tonight
Even if I've got three strikes
I'mma go for it
This moment  we own it
And I'm not to be played with
Because it can get dangerous
See these people I ride with
This moment  we own it
One shot  everything rides on tonight
Even if I've got three strikes
I'mma go for it
This moment  we own it
And I'm not to be played with
Because it can get dangerous
See these people I ride with
I know
I light my dutchy up puff maybe one day I'll fly
Who knows? Who knows? Who knows? (I know)
Who Knows?(I know)
I wish that I could be what I want to
I wish that I would do what I don't do
I need a miracle  I hope it come through
I'm trying to work it out  I need a jumpsuit (damn)
Mama on the phone not braggin' or nothin'
Cause her son ain't really got shit happenin' much
Saw my bank account like where is all the O's at?
Hit the club like where is all the hoes at?
Get a little change you gonna see how shit change
You gon' be up in the crib like where is all her clothes at?
And ask your girl she know it easy to say no to a nigga that's broke
But somebody with dough that got a little more?
Shit...I don't know
And I always had drive
Get's where I'm going if I ain't got a ride
And I always kept Faith like B.I.G
Tryna do it big until my crib on Cribs
Man my girl ain't got to worry about shit
Cause our world is going be the shit
So she can tell her mom I'm a keeper
I'mma put my hands together like an applaud
I know if you try to you can turn these gray skies back to sky blue
Was made for the give and go like a drive-thru
Give us opportunity and see what we do with it
 but it was gorgeous"
