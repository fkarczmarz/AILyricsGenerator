But they can't do us nothin'
You're the one I want and I'ma continue lovin'
Cause you're considered wife and I'm considered husband
And I'ma always be there for you
That got the kind of love that always make a better fussin'
And that's what gets me closer to you
And no one know why I'm into you
'Cause you'll never know what it's like to walk in our shoes
And no one know the things we've been through
Can never measure up to half of what I put you through
That's why we'll break through
Wanna be the one that give you the whole enchilada
You ain't got to match with the shoes
Keepin' it always true

And ain't no one I compare you to
And I know that you will never walk away from me no matter what

I made the mark on February 1st
Between me and you  you can call it birth
The beginning of our universe
Remind me of Alicia Keys verse
I'm falling for you
I wish I had an opportunity to not do
What I did to hurt you
And now I'm here living with regrets
I know that it was my fault
I know that I got caught
So please don't lose your thoughts
Of me loving you and you loving me
I'm on the highway swerving
I ain't drunk but I'm about to hit the curb'n
Looking at the calendar getting nervous
Just a few more days to the first soul
This the day it all began
One place that it came together
More than a ring or a tattoo
Wish your birthmark that reminds me of you
You might also likeSo let's get on an airplane
Go back to where we began
To that point which is days apart
That stamp right next to your heart

To your heart  to your heart
To your heart  to your heart
To your heart  to your heart
To your heart
Get the calendar  go to August 3rd
First words stay  we heard our first words
First argument gotta let it go
Cause it could possibly affect what our future holds
Flipping pages now famous
Thinking back I ain't seen you in ages
Wishing that I coulda made it less painless
Brings me back right back to the same as
I know that it was my fault
I know that I got caught
So please don't lose your thoughts
Of me loving you and you loving me
I'm on the highway swerving
I ain't drunk but I'm about to hit the curb'n

January  February  March  April  May
June  July  August is just another day
September  October  November trying to find a way
In December to mark my calendar to meet again
If only we can go to that place where me and you know
There's no faith fronting cheating even lying
The time has come where we stand face to face
This the day it all began
One place that it came together
More than a ring or a tattoo
Wish your birthmark that reminds of you

Don't act like your ho ain't choosin
Riding round blowing on stank bombs
Pussy so good you should thank moms
Top floor suite chilling at the Palms

In my lair looking at the blue sky
Can't let another day pass by
Without you knowing what I feel inside
Cause it's embedded in my soul
The day I stop will be the day I turn cold
Let you know I'm breaking out of that hole
And let go
And you can look back one day
And know I shared with you my gift
I hope you wouldn't think I just leave
Pack up and roll up my sleeve
Give it all up and live for nothing to take with me all I got to give
Thats why

I see you working go and put your back into it
You know exactly what you’re doing
So go and do your dirty work
Go and do your dirty work
Ass up
Face down
Perfect body and she lay it to the ground
Stacked up
Waist down
Wanted to throw it like a pitcher on a mound
I see them niggas reaching for their last dollar
Isn’t she the most beautiful thing that you ever saw?
Don’t she deserve the biggest diamond ring that you ever bought?
Go and do your dirty work

Don’t she deserve the biggest diamond ring that you ever bought?
Keep grabbin' all up on my coat

Just know that I try to always apologize

Thanks to Katherine Dunham
For giving my pops his glory
He came down with his drum
And a dream to change the world
In a free uplifting world
And that's all he ever want

This goes out to my tatta's in the ghetto
My Turkoes in the ghetto
My Mocro's in the ghetto (Ghetto)
'Cause this goes out to the Anti's in the ghetto
Maluku's in the ghetto
The Joego's in the ghetto (Ghetto)
Ghetto living
These streets remind me of quicksand (Quicksand)
When you're on it you'll keep goin' down (Goin' down)
And there's no one to hold on to
And there's no one to pull you out
You keep on fallin' (Fallin')
No one can hear you callin'
So you end up self-destructing
On the corner with the tuli on the waistline
Just got outta the bing doin' state time
Teeth marks on my back from the K9
Dark memories of when there was no sunshine
'Cause they said that I wouldn't make it (I remember like yesterday)
Holdin' on to what God gave me

A lot of niggas dead or locked away

I know how it feel to wake up fucked up
Pockets broke as hell  another rock to sell
People look at you like youse the user
Selling drugs to all the losers  mad buddha abuser
But they don't know about your stress-filled day
Baby on the way mad bills to pay
That's why you drink Tanqueray  so you can reminisce
And wish  you wasn't livin so devilish  ssshit
I remember I was just like you
Smokin blunts with my crew  flippin over 62's
Cause G-E-D  wasn't B-I-G
I had to get P-A-I-D  that's why my moms hate me
She was forced to kick me out  no doubt
Then I figured out licks went for twenty down South
Packed up my tools for my raw power move
Glock nineteen for casket and flower moves
For chumps tryin to stop my flow
And what they don't know will show on the autopsy
Went to see Papi  to cop me a brick
Asked for some consignment and he wasn't tryin to hear it
Smoking mad Newport's cause I'm due in court
For an assault  that I caught  in Bridgeport  New York
Catch me if you can like the Gingerbread Man
You better have your gat in hand  cause man
(you betta have your gat in hand cause man)

Addicted to fatal attractions
Pictures of actions be played back
In the midst of mashin'
No fairy tales for this young black male
Some see me stranded in this land of hell  jail  and crack sales
Hustlin' and heart be a nigga culture or the
Repercutions while bustin' on backstabbin' vultures
Sellin' my soul for material wishes  fast cars and bitches
Wishin' I live my life a legend  immortalized in pictures
Why shed tears? Save your sympathy
My childhood years were spent buryin' my peers in the cemetary
Here's a message to the newborns  waitin' to breathe
If you believe then you can achieve
Just look at me
Against all odds  though life is hard we carry on
Livin' in the projects  broke with no lights on
To all the seeds that follow me
Protect your essence
Born with less  but you still precious

These streets remind me of quicksand
When you're on it  you'll keep goin' down
And there's no one to hold on to
And there's no one to pull you out
You keep on fallin'  no one can hear you callin'
So you end up self-destructin'
On the corner with the toolie on the waist line
Just got up out the thing doin' state time
Teeth marks on my back from the K-9
Dark memories of when there was no sunshine
‘Cause they said that I wouldn't make it
I remember like yesterday
Holdin' on to what God gave me
‘Cause that's the life
When you're livin' in the (ghetto)
And eatin' in the (ghetto)
Oh  sleepin' in the (ghetto)
Ghetto  that's the life
When you're livin' in the (ghetto)
And eatin' in the (ghetto)

No need to cherish luxuries
‘Cause everything come and go
Even the life that you have is borrowed
‘Cause you're not promised tomorrow
So live your life as if every day is gon' be your last
Once you've moved forward
You can't go back just to remove your past
‘Cause you gotta be willin' to pray
Yes  you gotta be willin' to pray
‘Cause there gotta be  there gotta be a better day
Whoever said that the struggle would stop today?
A lot a niggas dead or locked away
Teenage women growin' up with AIDS
‘Cause that's the life
When you're livin' in the (ghetto)
Oh  eatin' in the (ghetto)
Oh  sleepin' in the (ghetto)
Ghetto  that's the life

And them snipers sitting on the roof already saw y'all

Rather have them dollar bills rain on me
Than let them haters come and make a name off me

I slide through the hood  the game unchanged
My niggas on the corner still selling cocaine
Now I ain’t even tripping you should do the same thing
Til I got the opportunity to make some more change
I’m watching all these haters getting close to my fame
Only if they know what it takes to maintain
If you live by the bar then we raised it

Collecting all this money from different parts of the world
Flown up out of this loop  gotta see me first
Cause I sacrificed it all to be me
You ain’t got enough what it takes to beat me
Conditioned by the slums and raised by the streets
I've killed for this life it takes another soldier
We gon' rush at each other like two rams fighting in the grass land  yeah!
And i’ma be the last man standing!
I know you gotta go cause you got things to do
Wish I could keep you much longer
Wish I could stop by and maybe say hi
Wish I could just stop by and lay by your side
Wish I could just stop by and maybe say hi

The tables have turned

J'déambule en ien-ch dans ma cellule
Négro j'repense au Sénégal  à l'île de Gorée
41 balles pour un contrôle  le roi de la pop décoloré
Tout l'monde y est allergique
Bosser pour survivre  dealer pour vivre
Pour que tu kiffes sur l'habillage  que ta biatch kiffe l'équipe
La rue t'attends la rue te regarde
Dans mes rêves y a que des putes  hélicoptères échelles grenades
Sûr d'aller en calèche  d'y faire un p'tit stage
C'est pas du ma-nec'  la taule les halls les tours de manèges
Certains figurent dans le Guinness pour leurs aller-retours
Premier sa-medi du mois ton A.D.N. dans un Kleenex
Et sur les murs j'ai des photos d'tass'
I'm steady trynna find a motive
Why do what I do ?

Un peu de biff la rue est bleu ciel
Prises 22 voilà les kissdés  le crime paie jusqu'à la perquis'

Can't believe I had a girl like you
And I just let you walk right out of my life

What really hurt me is I broke your heart
Baby you a good girl and I had no right
I really wanna make things right cause
Without you in my life girl I'm so
Been all about the world ain't never met a girl
That can take the things that you been through
Never thought the day would come
Where you would get up and run
And I would be out chasing you

Y yo pienso en ti dia a dia
Sin ti mi alma esta vacia
Ahora yo comprendo lo que tu sentias
Ahora se lo que mi nena sufria
Y oye duele saber que tu que perder
Para aprender en el futuro saber mantener
Una relacion que me lleno de querer

Sit here in solitude
With the smell of your perfume
You never took the time to know me
You never took the time to understand
You never took the time to know me  yeah
‘Cause loving you is all I ever had
Said loving you is all I ever had
This wasn't what I wanted to be
A man in misery

That people ain't satisfied
And you're hating your 9 to 5
And e'rybody wanna live another life
But ain't no length you'd go or mountain you'd climb
Not to better your days
But all that would do is leave room for people to say
I guess you're living better now
Share a little of that cheddar now

The ice in the watch reflects the light to her
The money quite green and the ice light bluer
The swag might kill her  so I said good night to her
She don't want me to leave  I can see right through her
So we dipped out  burn one  trip out
Get low like Caribbean limbo
Didn't go out like light  baby girl  get right
Head so swole my hat don't fit right
We can cruise in the car or we could take flight
The middle of the night  make your body ape like
Mike Vick against the Eagles
Call myself a king 'cause I'm regal
To be this hot is not legal
But we don't care—listen  baby  it's a fact that

Like how you are the best thing in my world

For the embarrassment that she felt
Just a little young girl tryna have fun
Her daddy should have never let her out that young
I'm sorry for Club Zen gettin' shut down
I hope they manage better next time around
How was I to know she was underage?
In a 21-and-older club they say
Why doesn't anybody wanna take blame?
I'm just a singer tryna entertain
Because I love my fans I'll take that blame
Even though the blame's on you
Even though the blame's on you
Even though the blame's on you
I'll take that blame from you
And you can put that blame on me (On me)
And you can put that blame on me
You can put that blame on me (Blame's on me)
And you can put that blame on me (Blame's on me)
And you can put that blame on me
Where I would see my ghetto life fade away
And now I look forward to everyday
Welcome to my sunny day
No matter how the season scorch
I still remember when they took me away
Realized I had to stop
Then I took time to explore a better way
I just know there's a sunny day
Who'd ever thought that I would see this day (I would see this day)
Where I would see my ghetto life fade away (fade away)
And now I look forward to everyday (everyday)
Welcome to my sunny day

Saw my first 9 millimeter in the ghetto
I got my first kiss in the ghetto
Playin' hide go seek with the girls in the ghetto
I wrote my first hit in the ghetto
I had to find a way out the ghetto
Haters used to hate in the ghetto
Said I would have never made it out the ghetto
I guess that's why my cousin sold the yayo
Even though Annie said the sun come out tomorrow
But the ghetto stay dark
I never thought I'd ever see the Billboard charts
Who'd ever thought that I would see this day (I would see this day)
Where I would see my ghetto life fade away (fade away)
And now I look forward to everyday (everyday)
Welcome to my sunny day
To my holy place to pray
Give thanks for every blessing given to me
No more living in misery
Cause this how I vision life to be
I just know there's a sunny day
Who'd ever thought that I would see this day (I would see this day)
Where I would see my ghetto life fade away (fade away)
And now I look forward to everyday (everyday)

When everything has changed (Oh)  it'll never be the same (Oh)
Nobody knew me then  now everybody knows my name
And I feel so ashamed
I never been the kind of nigga that would complain
But it's so crazy  man

On tour doin' so many different shows
Head spinnin'  feelin' like it's gonna explode
And I just wanna know
If anybody out there's feelin me
I'm losin my mind and I can't believe
I let this shit get the best of me
And now I gotta let you know
What's got me insane?
Ohh  'cause I can't stand the rain
Ayy  it's hitting my window pane a little too much
And now I gotta let you know
What's got my face in a frown?
Ayy  'cause I can't stand the sound (Can't stand the sound)
Ohh  the thunder that's crashing down upon my house (Ayy)
'Cause now I gotta let you know

It's all over  but I can't escape the rain
Now it's been months out on the road

 so now it's back to this Glock
Popping bottles with models and just watching them drank
Partying so hard  the ladies don't want it to end
They looked at me and said
I heard that you're a heartbreaker (I said)
Baby I'm a troublemaker

Roll with the fellas  even hold my cheese

She don't mind climbing up that ladder
Similar to the words  it don't matter

And that's just what I'm attracted to
And I'd rather go all the way
Love her long time  till the break of day
I won't let her ever leave my bed
Till she sees the color purple like Anna Mae
Now she wants to start holding on me  like whatever she's smoking on
I'll be long gone before you can say  Look at me now

Had a barrel inside of my head
I was lying awake in my bed
Thinking 'bout all the things I should have said
I'm gonna break the silence
Cut like a laser through the dark
I'm gonna light a fire
I'm gonna fight the triads
They are no chains around my heart
I'm gonna light a fire
Cause I'm not afraid
Wish that you could be here with me now
I keep hearing your voice late at night

Seen it rising up from the ground
Seen it rising up from the ground
Can't hold me down

Can't hold me down
Can't hold me down"
