lyrics
"I'm like  who knew? Who knew? Who knew?
That after all the years  I'd make a Weezy fan
Out of you too  you too  you too
When I met you  you were Thom Yorke
Chris Martin and U2  U2  U2
When you met me  I was Three 6  Pimp C
Bun B  8-Ball and MJG  yeah
But we're both a long way from home
We got the windows down  the radio's on  always
I wrote a letter to the sky
Saying  Maybe one day you'll get to kiss me
My girl found it in the car and said
Baby  why you trying to diss me?
'Cause you know you're my baby
Oh  you know you're my baby  ooh
I'm not just in it for the ride  in it for the ride
Yeah  oh  ah
Yeah  oh  ah
Yeah  oh
Yeah  oh

You said  One day  I'll start up my car and it'll explode
Well  now that's the last time I'm letting you watch Casino alone
You hate when I leave you in the motel while I hunt for jobs
So now I let you drive and wait outside in the parking lot
I know we're both a long way from home
Just keep the windows down  the radio's on  always
I wrote a letter to the sky
Saying  Maybe one day you'll get to kiss me  kiss me  kiss me
My girl found it in the car and said
Baby  why you trying to diss me  diss me  diss me?
Don't you know you're my baby?
Don't you know you're my baby  ooh?
I'm not just in it for the ride  in it for the ride  yeah
You'll live a better life
(A better life  young one  a better life  young one)
A dull life ain't nothing
Don't speed  who cares what car you're driving?
No Benz can make you friends
She don't care what car I'm driving
And no Bentley can kiss me back
This song is dedicated to my '91 Acura
Sometimes it's hard to tell you so
You may not be in the mood to learn
What you think you know
There are times when I find
You wanna keep yourself from me
When I don't have the strength
I'm just a mirror of what I see
You're a positive motivating force within my life
If you ever feel the need to wonder why
Love
When you feel what you feel
It's hard for me to understand
So many things have taken place before this love affair began
But if you feel more like I feel
Confusion can give way to doubt
For there are times when I fall short of what I say

Look beyond your world
You're a positive motivating force within my life
Should you ever feel the need to wonder why
Love
Be my shrink for the hour
Leave the meter runnin'
It's rush hour
So take the streets if you wanna
I guess it couldn't hurt me
If it brings me to my knees
It's a bad religion
And cyanide in my styrofoam cup
I can never make him love me
Never make him love me

I swear I've got three lives
Balanced on my head like steak knives
I can't tell you the truth about my disguise
I can't trust no one
If it brings me to my knees
It's a bad religion
And cyanide in my styrofoam cup
I can never make him love me
Never make him love me
To be in love with someone who could never love you
Listen  stop trying to be somebody else
Don't try to be someone else
Be yourself and know that that's good enough
Don't try to be someone else
Don't try to be like someone else  don't try to act like someone else
Be yourself  be secure with yourself
Rely and trust upon your own decisions
On your own beliefs
You understand the things that I've taught you
Not to drink alcohol  not to use drugs
Don't use that cocaine or marijuana  because that stuff is highly addictive
When people become weed-heads
That's all marijuana does to you  okay? This is mom
Unless you're taking it under doctor's  um  control
Then it's regulated
Do not smoke marijuana  do not consume alcohol
Do not get in the car with someone who is inebriated
 turn the music up  uh  yeah

Lo que él quiere de ti  yo no se lo negaría
Si esto no me ha partío'  ya no me partiré nunca
Si puedo soportar lo que siento  ¿por qué me estoy cayendo?
You stood me up  you laid me down
You know too much  I can't be proud
If you won't  then I will
If you can't  then I will
Is it love to keep it from you?
No hablará de mí  ni hablará de esto
Lo que él quiere de ti  yo no se lo negaría
Si esto no me ha partío'  ya no me partiré nunca
Si puedo soportar lo que siento  ¿por qué me estoy cayendo?
¿Acaso voy cayendo?
You stood me up  you lay me down
You know too much (Too much)  I can't be proud

I see both sides like Chanel

Swimming laps through pool water

Hide my tattoos in Shibuya
Police think I'm of the underworld

How you looking up to me and talking down? (Yeah)
Can't you see I am the big man? (Big man)
Dick could roll the eyes back in the skull
Got one that's straight acting
Turnt out like some dirty plastic (Ride)
2016: burnt some discs (Dope)
2017: ideas playing off a Walkman
And I don't like to fight 'til I'm fighting (Fighting)
Revenge in the air makes my lungs sick

You need a co-sign for your health
I need that bitch to grind on my belt
I know you need to try for my belt
I know you seen it driving itself
No matte black on the ride 'cause it's stale
But it's stealth
I see both sides like Chanel

I rubber band a bunch of thousand-dollar Delta gift cards
I rubber band a bunch of thousand-dollar Delta gift cards
But you could've held my hand through this  baby
Let my mind run underneath warm jets
I run my hands through what's left
But we're getting older  baby
Don't have much longer  baby
Why am I preaching
To this choir  to this atheist?
Just like mine  versions of these belong to you
After a while  they're keeping me close to you
In the middle of Arkansas with a little rock left in that glass dick
Hittin' stones in glass homes
You're smokin' stones in abandoned homes
You hit them stones and broke your home
Hittin' stones in glass homes
You're smokin' stones in abandoned homes
You hit them stones and broke your home
To get the fixing that you're itching for

Won't let you hold their infant

Are just candles in the sun
Voodoo
Don't you let her see divide

My negatives at home aren't working for my Kodak
So that means that I don't want to go back
Just know that I would like to stay here and hold that
Your face is the best
'Cause it's the same color as the lace on my neck
Let's toast and listen to Michael Bolton
I free-fall off the hill again
I'm just hopin' that you don't turn my neck green
And I was together since three years
And uh  I was not even cheating her or what
And Facebook arrived and  uh
She wanted me to accept her on Facebook
And I don't want it  because I was  like  in front of her
In front of her  and she told me  like  Accept me on Facebook
It was virtual  means no sense
So I say  I'm in front of you  I don't need to accept you on Facebook
She starting to be crazy
She thought that because I didn't accept her  she thought I was cheating

'Cause what niggas say  that's what she tell her man
What a difference distance makes

Friendship and how it controls the world
Hahaha
Alright  um
What three superpowers do you wish you had?

Best thing about being me is

Probably spend a lot of time with my family
Spend a couple hours with my family and I would go out and do like everything that I ever thought about trying
I don't know  there's a lot of things that you could do
That's it
How far is a light-year? How far is a light-year?
How I do
Let go of a prayer for you
Just a sweet word
The table is prepared for you
There will be mountains you won't move
How I do
I let go of my claim on you
It's a free world
You'll look down on where you came from sometimes
But you'll have this place to call home always
This love will keep us through blinding of the eyes
This love will keep through blinding of the eyes (Oh)
I'll always love you
Until the time we die
Said if I was in NY  I should look you up
I  first time I'd ever saw you
And you text nothing like you look
Here's to the gay bar you took me to
Here's when I realized you talk so much more than I do
I  here's to the highlights when I was convinced
That this was much more to you than some some night shit
I know you don't need me right now
And to you  it's just a late night out
They told me
I used to fuck with all of 'em
Yeah  I ain't got bitches no more
We've been in this room too long
Recreation is keeping us self-contained and aware
Of each other's forms still and in full strides
Just the same
Keeping us warm
Walking in straight lines
Talking to sleep at night
Coddled and pacified
By versions of mothers
It's all new to me
It's all new to me
Having you around
It's all new to me
It's all new to me
Having you 'round the Higgs
What if we decide to live by choice?
All this time I knew
That average was something to fall back on after genius ends
I watch video
Only difference is flattened and remiss
Sparks of lightning storm behind wet faces
Slipped my pants back on and rewind it backward more
The tape stopped before I was back alone

I'll be back before
I was spoiled by lavish thoughts
And had this been the past I might not know
What to do with all
Of what you showed
And if acts of God breaks us apart
Least we did ours
No sleeper seats  that's a mattress
You ain't stingy  split your tablets with me
You won't flinch when camera's flashing  flashing
And I think you made for the life I lead
That kinda coffin don't need lean
Rest in peace
Got this lust for life in me  yeah
Horny for the game  uh
Then that bitch wanna play it off  huh
Fuck it  I'm pretty still in a pit of snakes
While serpents shake some brand-new scales
I need a new face  I'm tired of these weirdos
Acting familiar  took all the rock
And turned it to pop  he think that he Elvis
And he ungrateful  they don't say thank you
Look at my skills  running through blocks like 49ers
Forty-nine diamonds  stuffed in my bracelet
That cost a whop  that cost a whopper
And it ain't new  I had a knot at John Ehret in my locker
Pretty still  it ain't no pretty pill
It's either real or real
Real easy on the eyes  green like a soccer field
Skin hot when they tried me like them poppers feel

Look at all the people feet dance
I know that your nigga came witcha
But he ain't witcha
We only human and it's humid in these Balmains
Sippin' pink-gold lemonades
Feelin'
I'll mean something to you

Uh-huh

What if my mother comes over?
You can't get up and get a job
'Cause this little hustle's getting you by
You're the dealer and the stoner
With the sweetest kiss I've ever known
I know what I was on
I had a Pilot Jones (What you know about it?)
Then she took me home (We talkin' 'bout)
Tonight she came stumblin' across my lawn again
I just don't know why I keep on tryin' to keep a grown woman sober

If the ground is black and yellow

Nod my head  don't close my eyes
Halfway on a slow move

If you could fly  then you'd feel south
Up north's getting cold soon

Still  I'm someone to hold true

Gave you tools just to stay alive

What do you think my brain is made for
Is it just a container for the mind?

Switch worlds and we can huddle then
