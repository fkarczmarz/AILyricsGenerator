lyrics
" it's been a couple years and it just keeps on gettin' better
 know I can't predict the future
 the one for you
 the one for you
 the one for you
 the one for you
 the one for you (Let me love you)
 the one for you
I been waiting  I been hoping that there's still some chance
You and me can find a reason to believe in
All them weekends that we used to have
You're pretending that you don't care
So I'm doing the same
I love you more when you're taken
Oh Lord  you're good at this game
Don't do me dirty  show me some mercy
Darling  please lay down your weaponry
How did we end up somewhere between a
Lover and a memory?
'Cause I don't believe in a halfway heart
And you gave me all of my favorite scars
How did we end up somewhere between a
Lover and a memory?
Lover and a memory
Lover and a memory

When the truth is that the thoughts still come
Now in then when you're in private
You can sit up in the silence  and it sounds like drums
I'm pretending I don't care
So you're doing the same
You like me more when I'm taken
Oh Lord  I'm good at this game
Don't do me dirty  show me some mercy
Darling  please lay down your weaponry
How did we end up somewhere between a
Lover and a memory?
'Cause I don't believe in a halfway heart
And you gave me all of my favorite scars
How did we end up somewhere between a
Lover and a memory?
Lover and a memory
Oh  oh  oh
Nothing on me  but my body
Got no money  but I got all I need
Got my city right behind me
I know these streets  will take care of me (Oh)
We live it day by day
No sleep 'til we got pa-a-aid (Oh)

We are searching into the unknown
Exploring ever-expanding frontier
Tryin' to find answers
To understand hope
To find the truth of life
Beyond life
Afterlife
To become closer to God
Inside the matrix
The clock keeps ticking
And ticking
Until we reach zero
We keep exploring
And transforming
Evolving
Progressing
Surviving
Coming closer and closer and closer
To our final moment
In the neon future
We are searching into the unknown
Engage control

Wanna do Molly  then holla at Bari

Feel the kiss
And smile so softly
We're just friends
But I like you slightly
We won't cross the line
Just a boy and a girl
Just us two in a world
The mood is set

When the battle is at its hardest
When I'm beat down and broken hearted
I won't give up
But it feels like it's over
What if it's too late for me?
Feel my blood getting colder
And I can't get the breath I need
Just a burden on your shoulders
But I don't want to be
You haven't seen the last of me

The moon is not a perfect circle
Moon’s full of craters
So along with the many other scientific discoveries
That humans have made
