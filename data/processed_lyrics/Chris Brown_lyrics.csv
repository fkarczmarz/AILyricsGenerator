lyrics
"What if the sky was turnin' red?
I'm gon' kiss your other set of lips
Hold your body by your legs and hips
And we gon' do it like it's 'bout to be the end of the world
And they depended on us
To make Earth-shakin' love
I feel your knees gettin' weaker and weaker
I got your body shiverin' 'cause we're covered in sweat
I got that pillow for your knees right here
Your voice is the last thing I'm gonna hear
Then I wanna make you holler

We gon' do it like it's 'bout to be the end of the world
And they depended on us
To make Earth-shakin' love
I feel your knees gettin' weaker and weaker
And do it to you right
Buildings and bridges may be fallin' down
Won't you come on over
And we can treat it like it's the motherfuckin'
End of the world? (Woo!)
And they depended on us (And they depended on us to make it)
To make Earth-shakin' love (Love)
I feel your knees gettin' weaker and weaker
A nigga goin' hard in the paint (Right now)
Watch a nigga go hard in the paint (Just take that)
Watch a nigga go hard in the paint (Lay it down)
Too much to take  these memories end in tragedy ('Gy)
And all of these places  all of these faces
I didn't wanna let you down (Down)
And all these mistakes of mine  I can't replace it
I gotta move on somehow
Healing energy on me
Baby  all I really need's one thing
Healing energy on me
Baby  can you make a wish for me?
Healing energy on me
Whеn it's 11:11  I need it
Healing energy on mе
Baby  can you make a wish for me?
11:11  oh
11:11
When it's 11:11  I need it

Don't let the pressure get to your head

You can see the diamonds  don't complain on this (Me)
We was hustlin'  you niggas got no say on this (No)
I'm just bein' honest
I'm movin' steady (Shoot)
You can't buy success  ain't got no sale on it
You know that God did  he never gon' fail on us
Too much paper  got me thinkin' I'ma save all this
I know the opps want it  they love this
Two-tone  got the bussdown like woah (Woah)
The streets crazy  they don't love me no more (Ooh)
Not one for pressure  but I'll bang for my bros (Bros)

She told me  Why didn't you just fight for it?
All these baddies  had too many (Many)
I promised that I would have died for it
You just had to fuckin' let me (Let me)
Now I'm married to the game  I'm in that
No more chains  I'ma buy me some gold (Woah)
Three babies  tryna make room for some more (Ooh)
Life learnin' lessons 'cause you reap what you sow (Grow)
Walkin' in Giuseppe  I be ten on my toes
Mama  pray for me so I won't fold (Fold)

If you leave this time  I fear that you'll be gone for good  so
And I hold on like leaves in fall to what is left
Said her father left her young and he said he'll be back
With that same tone that you just said you'll stay forever with
Ooh
It seems that all the autumn leaves are fallin'
Ooh-ooh-ooh
I feel like you're the only reason for it
Ooh
All the things you do  all the things you do  all the things you do

If it don't chip  then a toe tag is one last  I'ma hope (I'ma hope)
So iceberg  don't float (Don't float)
If I do manage to do damage to you  dammit
It'll be grand as ten Grammies on my granite
Still standin' with a note (With a note)
That read  ''Granted  don't you panic''
When you make mistakes the most (The most)
One day  it'll make you grow (You grow)
When you outlandish and you lose manners
To God  you shall consult (Consult)
When the bright cameras are still crammin' in your face
And it provoke (Provoke)
You to act mannish  just stay planted
'Cause you reapin' what you sow
Keep (Keep) positivity in your heart and (And)
Keep a noose from 'round your throat and (And)
When you get mad  and when you poke at it

The iceberg is a reflection of you when you renew your vision
Just think  if it had sunk Titanic
The fuck it would do to a critic  my nigga?
(Ooh-ooh)
Yeah  yeah
(Ooh-ooh)
Do you hear 'em  Lord? Do you hear 'em?
And if my ship go down  tell me  who will abort?
And they won't let me live  even with remorse that I give
When they gon' rejoice and forgive  tell me how I stay positive
(Ooh-ooh)
When they never see good in me
Even though I got hood in me
Don't mean he won't redeem me  Lord

Got a racin' Lamborghini half my homies scared to drive
The farewell email (Yeah) from a female (Yeah)
What it entails is hard to say like sellin' seashells

And leave with all them shoppin' bags and half of it ain't yours
Well enough to know if this is all that she came for
Times to my cousin house to see if I was there
We out here tryna have a good time
It's hard to throw up the deuces
'Cause when you know it's juicy
You start to sound like Confucius when makin' up excuses
Chase Cabooses 'til the track gone
