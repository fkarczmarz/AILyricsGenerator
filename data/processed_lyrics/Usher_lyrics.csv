"What'd he do? Yeah!

Bad than a mother (Oh  na)
I hear you saying (I need a bad girl  oh)
Let me hear you (if you're a bad girl  oh)
Players  when you see me
Act like you know me
I keep a dollar worth of dimes
You know pimping ain't easy
For all my chicks in the club
Who knows how to cut a rug
(If you're a bad girl
Get at me  bad girl)
Shaking it the way I like
I'm ready to be bad
I need a bad girl (say yeah)
Get at me  bad girl

Coming home with me tonight?

I just can't escape all of these bad habits
I had way too many one nights  yeah
I keep messin' up my love life  yeah
I love love  I'm just bad at it
I just can't escape all of these bad habits
I had way too many one nights  yeah
I keep messin' up my love life  yeah
Every time I think that I found the one
I turn around and then another one come
On God  I be tryin' baby
At least you know the truth  I ain't lyin' baby
Every time I say my new girl is the best
Then I get anothеr text from my ex
On God  it's like clockwork
Shе come through  I take her down and buy a new purse
So  now you got to pray just a little
Make a way  just a little
'Til the day I finally figure it out
Don't know what all these emotions about

See  it's burnin' me to hold on to this
I know this is somethin' I gotta do
But that don't mean I want to
I feel like this... is comin' to an end
And it's better for me to... let it go now
Than hold on and hurt you
But I gotta let it burn
It's gon' burn for me to say this  but it's comin' from my heart
It's been a long time coming  but we done been fell apart
Really wanna work this out  but I don't think you're gonna change
Tell me why I should stay in this relationship
Plus there's so many other things I gotta deal with
I think that you should let it burn
When your feeling ain't the same and your body don't want to
But you know  gotta let it go 'cause the party ain't
Hate the thought of her bein' with someone else
But you know that it's over  we knew it was through (Yeah)

What I gotta do now (Now) to get my shorty back?

Inside out that you know exactly the man that comes to see you
I'll go deep as I can
Giving you the rest of my love
But what if I tell you too much?
So much to explore
So much we have yet to discover
I ask myself  Should I go there?
Can I give it to you fully?
Can you handle it?

Before anything began between us  you were like my best friend
The one I used to run and talk to when me and my girl was havin' problems
You used to say it'll be okay
Suggest little nice things I should do
And when I'd go home at night and lay my head down
All I seemed to think about was you
And how—

Knowin' it should've been you
And what's sad is that I love her  but I'm fallin' for you
What should I do?
Should I  tell my baby bye-bye?
Should I  do exactly what I feel inside?
But I really need to get it together
