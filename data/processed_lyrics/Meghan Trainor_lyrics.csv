lyrics
"I told myself a month ago that I'd be through with this
Somebody told me that some other girl was hugging you
I still get crazy every time I hear your name
And I know it's complicated
But you know I'm impatient
3 AM
Even though I'm hanging with my friends
3 AM
I might be looking for a late night friend
Kinda stressing like I'm gonna have a heart attack
It's been an hour and you haven't even hit me back

And I know it's complicated
This always happens when I'm wasted
3 AM
Even though I'm hanging with my friends
3 AM
I might be looking for a late night friend
Somebody take away my phone
'Cause I've been drinking all night long
Somebody take away my phone
'Cause I've been drinking all night long
3 AM
Even though I'm hanging with my friends
3 AM
I might be looking for a late night friend
Tell me we got time
I saw a world without you there
Somehow  you are mine
And no  please don't go
Please don't go and leave me alone
Don't wanna give my heart to someone new
Won't be anybody after you
And even if one day  our time is through
Won't be anybody after you  after you
I'll never find another lover after you
If you have to go  be my ghost
Hope you haunt my dreams
So I won't be alone 'cause I'd give up hope
If you weren't there for me
And no  please don't go
Please don't go and leave me alone

I won't be able to love nobody else
So if you go  won't you take me with you?
Don't leave me alone
I don't wanna give my heart to someone new
There won't be anybody after you

I couldn't tell 'cause the lights were out
I beat the sunrise again  oh-oh-oh
Neighbors stare  I smile and wave 'cause I just don't care
They're probably jealous of my sexy hair
And the heels in my hands
I had a lot to drink
But I was only being safe
Well
Don't act like you haven't been there
7 AM with the bed head
Everyone knows it's the walk of shame  but
My daddy knows I'm a good girl
We all make mistakes in the drunk world
Everyone here's done the walk of shame
Oh my brain  little birdies sound like airplanes
How can something so cute cause me so much pain?

Don't even try to act like you ain't done the same yourself
And if you're gonna do the walk  do it like a boss
A boss  that's right
He kissed me and called me his bae  asked me to stay
How could I turn that away?
Don't judge  it was mad late

I've been on a low-hater diet
I'm the shh  be quiet
I've been on a low-hater diet
'Cause I just woke up and I feel some type of way
I get all choked up when I see how much I've made
And I feel so good like James Brown in his day
Watch me do  watch me
Watch me do  watch me
Wha-da-do  watch me
I ain't saying I'm the besteses
But I got nice curves  nice breasteses
I don't erase-a textes from my exeses
All in my DMs  leaving messages
Whoo  head spinning like an exorcist
And I ain't a teacher  but the lesson is
If you wonder how I make it look effortless
The answer to your question is

Drowning in my tears  this love's a sinking boat
Oh  oh (No)
Once my hands have reached the shore
You pull me back in
And I shouldn't beg for more
But I don't want it to end
Take me like a wave  pull me back and forth
Crash into my arms  tell me I am yours
Head at the surface  I'll keep you afloat
Right in the middle of Heaven and Hell
This world was made for us (Yeah)
Don't blame you at all (Yeah)
It was all my fault (Yeah)
I swear that I won't do the shit that I did before

When you're lookin' good
You know you're gonna have a good time
Don't forget mascara
And to keep your head up
Like Madonna would
Wear a lipstick redder than wine
So let's go
Roll your bumper and wine slow
If you don't need a man

Don't matter what you been through
Just make them remember you

'Cause it's always been so hard believin' them
You say I'm beautiful
And I say you're full of it
Nothin' personal
I'm still not used to this
Tryna be good to me
I should give myself way more love
I'm my worst enemy
I'm the voice who says I'm not good enough
