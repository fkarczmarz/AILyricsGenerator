lyrics
"I wanted to buy a 50 Cent CD
I took that shit home
That shit was wack like a motherfucker
I fuck with Game
I like 50 Cent
He reminds me SpongeBob
And Tony Yayo is Blue's Clues
And Lloyd Banks is Dora the Explorer
They're my friends
Psyche
I went down one of them bodega shits right there in Harlem
Got me a bootleg Lloyd Banks and Young Buck CD
Thought I was 'bout to be on some Radio Raheem shit
Man that shit sound like some Vanessa Williams in '88
I mean Olivia cute but they say that bitch a man
So this Black Wall Street for life now
G-G-G-Unot!
You might also like
300 Bars and Runnin'
Just loan me your ears for fifteen minutes
Walk with me
Here the breakdown
Why would I wanna do that? When I'm just the new cat
That was taught if a nigga take shots to shoot back
Watch everybody sleep through it
What you thought? Them was the only niggas rapped in Philly?
See them niggas with the sunnis leave you wrapped in Philly
Then dash in groups like Beanie Mac in Philly
So they wouldn't get the dogs start searching for the Glock
What's beef? Beef is when I murk you on the spot
When Ludacris say he coming for the number one spot
You sell records but a G-G-G-U-not
You can ask Mister Cee who hot
Run up on that new 300C you got
And I hope you blackout before you see the cops
But what I got in my high tops'll make your breathing stop
Now I'm moving on up to George and Weezy's spot
I picked up where my homeboy Eazy stopped
Bring hell to niggas when Dre producing a track
Now you left leaning back thanks to Fat Joe
I'ma say he hit me first if me and Dre talk
All Nas said back was he had a braveheart
See niggas running their mouth about what the fuck they gon' do to me
But quit the yapping before I proceed to clapping
And you gon' see the captain with plans of getting me captured
How you gon' drop Olivia? You only drop dimes
1-800-split a faggot nigga wig
Now your career is over-career is over
And tell 50 Cent to send you a copy of Beef 3
I'm airing their ass out on D-V-D
I'm a G-Unit toy soldier on Sesame Street
Need a rhyme dictionary to rehearse his lines
Sound like Oscar the Grouch with them nursery rhymes
We was in the studio when I first got signed
All he gon' tell you is say G-Unit one more time
Got mad 'cause I ain't wanna make your beef mine
Said he'd put you with your mom and you ain't fucked with that
I knew from the beginning not to trust those cats
I'd kill 'em all if I could bring Justo back
It's the reason niggas saying my name like Mike Jones
It's the reason niggas saying my name like Mike Jones
It's the reason niggas saying my name like Mike Jones
I said
It's the reason niggas saying my name like Mike Jones
And I'm far from Houston but you can chop it and screw it
You can put it on Skee if you want it
And watch them shits sell out like a Air Jordan shoe
I told Funk Flex when I catch the nigga Whoo Kid
We gon' see if he know how to DJ with bruised ribs
Don't hit me on the Sidekick asking what you did
Get a gun or ask 50's police to use his
'Cause Bloods gonna get ya
Blood-Blood-Bloods gonna get ya for that Shadyville chain
For caking off niggas on them CD's and tapes
That G-Unit use every time 50 on stage singing like
Bitches only feel your shit just a lil' bit
Niggas only feel your shit just a lil' bit
Tell Ecko to make him a suit
For thinking he can walk through muddy waters like Redman
Banks blacked out and let the gun blam
Without a M-E-T-H-O-D Man
So the lieutenant gotta ask for his strings
Unless you one of the Bloods or a Latin King
'Cause if you left with the Aryans your ass'll sting
And your cellmate is a 25 to lifer
And life goes on
He told Vibe Dre was gonna leave me on the shelf
Nigga stop acting tough before I stand over you
Show you how The Documentary live on top of The Massacre
Throw in Makaveli and lift the doors on the Maganum
In and out of lanes like a New York cab
I miss the old king that New York had
Who's this fake nigga on pictures with the Jake nigga?
If he ain't Cube or Pac then who you got?
We getting tired of you talkin about who you shot
I'll use another six bars to tell you who you not
Now the same nigga wanna take us to the Candy Shop
Nigga got mad when The Game start buzzing
So fuck making friends now I'm into throwing slugs
I don't wanna shake hands or wear your G-Unit shoes
Just wanna sit here and wait (for the summer)
Fresh white Nike Airs and the matching Sox fitted
And the D.A. waiting on Jayceon to make a mistake
So they can put me in the squad car and lock me away
Give me a odd job in the pen for minimal pay
Let me out so I can drive down criminal way
The summer too hot and I just want the winter to stay
'Cause I'm a cold nigga when I put the pen to the page
Similar to them shells going into my gauge
And the flow is hot like thou with Satan
And the only thing I got spinning is Daytons
Compton swap meet to get me some All-Stars
'Cause they heard about what went on in D.C
Now tell me do he got a conscience?
I'd rather be pushing rock like Samantha Ronson
Hip-Hop police on me like I'm the convict
What happened to the old school? I thought it was rhyming
Doug E. Fresh and Dana Dane on the corner like Common
G-Unit and I rebounded like Rodman
Should I be mad? I ain't
And I keep a black four-five on the side of my Prada denim
Chip on my shoulder like I'm fresh outta prison
Then re-up like Kim before the d-cup
Continuously getting money with my feet up
Feel me? If not then I guess you gotta kill me
While I do B.I.G. and Pac impersonations on two tracks
Now back to rap and why I gotta stay strapped?
They don't know which hole to patch up when the K clap
Now I gotta lay you down like the last nigga
Prepare for burials when I'm reincarnating Harry-O
And you don't want that David 'cause you love your life
Juve left you for dead and went back to the N.O
50 heard you on the tour bus and felt your little flow
Then he made you temporary replacement for Yayo
You a bitch and that's hard to swallow
And you got robbed for your spinning G-Unit chain in Chicago
I call my nigga Jojo to get it back
He had the shit in his hands and you ain't had the ten stacks
Then you ran and told 50 that I did the shit
Take one shot of Brandy and pop
Watch his panties drop when I run inside the Candy Shop
I'm fly like a hummingbird on a tree top
A king in the making and the throne is for the taking
So I climb the mountain top and put my stake in
Got the weight of the world on my shoulder
 chrome pipen'
 What up Ghost!?)
 Louis bag the fuckin' mall
 nigga I want it all
 I want it all)
 she suck it soft
 I'm above the law
 when I wrap the punk
 what's up Jigga?
 I'm in VA
 they spinning shit
 shit
 shit!
 Perri seal
 this is crack
 you clapped
 yeah!
 yeah
 Steve Kerr
 he can vouch it
 Grand Theft
 hop in the truck with that
 gotta make a cash run
 tell Wack I'll meet 'em outside)
 that's a tummy tuck
 no sleep
 blood
 right around the subs
 respect
 then hit the block with that
 while I stay on my trap shit
 Busta hit me like: u wrote 400 that quick? 
 I'm with it
 throw on my khakis
 new whip
 a cool flip
 come through bitch
 jam on it
 I'm 'bout to roll this shit up
 time to perm' it out
 tie you up
 a salad fork... I'm starvin' nigga!)
 I'm my own threat
 apologize to Cube)
Where bitches love The Game like Tyson Beckford six pack
Presidential Rollie  nigga  where your wrist at?
I can kill you in four bars  that's a Kit Kat
Did the Lambo my way with a sick wrap
Smooth as Frank Sinatra with a motherfucking slick back
No rats in my pack  ain't no wrinkles in my slacks
Counting singles in my Shaqs  stacking Pringles from the crack
Nigga I was on the bus with it
Had 12 stuck to my chest in the field with the colt
Andrew Luck with it
We had the rock  hit the block like what's up with it
Jay was in the Z  my young gunnas in the truck with it
Sigel would've loved it  Philly would've fucked with it
California state property you niggas stuck with it
Brrrring  sold Peedi Crakk
Game was on the block in his beanie with a Mac
I'm what you rap niggas 'fraid of
A Compton nigga that could go bar for bar with Jada
Let me tell you who suck  like banana Now or Laters
Blac Chyna head the bomb  al-Qaeda
Listen  you want beef I'll cater
Game snap on everything he like a fucking wild gator
Silver and black Ghost  nigga that's Al Davis
Give me Left Eye back  take Fetty Wap and the Raiders
The Rams is back  them bullets getting tossed
16 on your back like you fucking Jeff Goff
Your man acting girly too put 30 on his chest
Kanye shrug bitch  welcome to the west
YG  Nipsey  and Kendrick yea check
Shout 'em out I just do it like a fucking Nike rep
Bentley truck Chuck  with the Henny cupped up
Don't get me fucked up  you see the semi tucked  duck
Pass the Goose  where them duck ducks?
These hoes foaming at the mouth  they got Penny fucked up
I'm 'bout to poke 'em like a cactus
Told that bitch to roll the Philly for the game  and she talking about practice
The Maybach is A.I
Artificial intelligence motherfucker that's Junior Seau
All my doors suicide  I'm in Vegas shoot the five
Tell the dealer pay me don't be shy he ain't from Do or Die
Now do you wanna ride  back seat of my Caddy?
Used to flip them pies ain't no relation to Patti
And I move Ps  ain't no relation to Swaggy
Before that it was missing teeth and nickel sack baggies
That's caine  no daddy cause I ain't really have one
And you can't call yourself dope if you ain't never bag none
I'm the old DMX  you niggas Drag-On
Game raw as fuck like poking holes in the Magnum
Used to ether the niggas in all of my 16s
Now I scare 'em once a year like I'm fucking Halloween
This ain't a dream  nigga hurricane a nightmare
Stab you in your sleep and smack your baby out his highchair
Your daddy was a bitch  I had to do it
I ain't need no ski mask to do it
Murder is Rihanna and I'm attracted to it
Name a state  I'll send a package through it
If the fed hack into it  they get bossed on like I'm Massachusetts Huh!
Sitting in this Maybach with music
Your head is like Mustard beat and I'll put the ratchet to it
PARTY sent my jackas to it
Drama bring the Mac into it
And this scope will get your mouth washed when I attach it to it
Gold on my neck  I make your bitch put her back into it
Usain Bolt if you bring a real track into it
Another classic moving the way to Aftermath to do it
Dre had the Chronic all I did was put the matches to it
Traffic moving backwards through it
Ever since I had the Buick
Known for putting cheese on niggas heads the way the Packers do it
And I had the yay  yea I brought crack to music
Every situation in rap  I've been a savage through it
And all these hoes getting mad cause I'm smashing through 'em
They can get a ring one day  if the Cavs can do it
Be LeBron bitch  I'm Jayceon bitch
Who else you seen parked at the swap meet in James Bond shit?
Another foreign car driven by a convict
Aventador matte black Akon lips
Nas ether niggas  Game napalm shit
Niggas say my name I pop up like the State Farm bitch
No nigga can see me  on or off TV
Gum bottom Yeezys  I'm the 6' 5 Eazy
Lightskin bitches be mad and talking greasy
I'ma start fucking them Dej Loafs and Dreezy's
I'ma start beefing with Cole  Drizzy and Cornrow Kenny
Or you could pick your favorite rapper  and he gon' be pouring out Henny
I got a bitch from Minne-Apolis pack a semi
Bang the ratchet at Denny's and fly herself back to Philly
She got a couple mill and she don't even know Meek
And ever since that nigga snitched on me we just don't speak
See that shit you got with Drake is like a slow leak
Blood'll be dripping like Niagara if I poke Meek
Nicki won't get no sleep  I'm coming through at 4 a.m
Four deep  to leave his dead body on the soaked sheets
It could happen lowkey
You better have Ross call me or you gon' be eye level with a roach feet
This ain't a diss  nigga
This is all lives matter except this nigga's

This the Golden State and my shooters ain't on no hoop shit
Nigga  you know that I'll snap you like a toothpick
And snitching on niggas ain't never been no cool shit
And I've been wanting to give Nicki this pool stick
So tell your lil' vivrant thing come fuck with Q-Tip
We know where you live  nigga  you better move quick
I mean handcuffs  time to man up
Put my hands up? Fuck you sayin'  bruh?
'Cause I'm a black man in a Phantom
Or is it 'cause my windows tinted?
Car cost 300 thou' and I blow Indo in it (2 Chainz!)
You mad 'cause your daughter fuck with me on spring break
Well  I'ma fuck her till the springs break
Yeah  roll another one 'cause I'm winnin'
In my four-door  lookin' real photogenic
Gentleman attire  in threads that won't expire
I'm in a class of my own  my teacher got fired
Money gettin' long  pussy rate keep risin'
Versace outfit cost me 3 000
From the P houses  did it from the wee hours
Sellin' that chicken  no lemon pepper  no sweet and sour
First you get the power  then you get respect
I'm gettin' so much money I can buy your bitch
Take it how you wanna  if you wanna take it
I like clubs where all the women workin' naked
Fell in love with a waitress—what the fuck I'm thinkin'?
Bought that ho a ring  it was for her pinky
Got a bottle of cologne that cost more than your rent

Bad bitches and D-boys  we bring 'em out
This the voice of ghetto intelligence. If you got work
Go to work  don't work at your residence
…For presidents
Word to Muhammad  that triple beam is heaven-sent
Ridin' through the jungles in that mothafuckin' elephant
That's a gray Ghost  with the ears on it
Swimmin' through the hood like it got fins on it (Tell 'em!)
You know I got that work on the foreman grill
Weigh the mothafuckas in  made another mil

Feel like I'm looking down from Heaven
She always had a player back like them field lights
And every time I left it ain't feel right
Cheated on her and she stayed  that's just real life (shit)
Cause it's hard when you ain't on the same coast
Burning bread in the club so all these girls want toast
Hoes try and wade but we ain't on the same boat
They trying to sink everything that we made float
She told me 'bout her ex man  her old boy stories
Don't fuck her on her period  ain't into horror stories
I take her to my favorite restaurant  she order for me
'Cause she know me

Paid cash money like I was from Hollygrove
Sold ten mill  everybody know my name now
Thinkin' back  it's a motherfuckin' shame how
Biggie got killed and Pac got murked
Sometimes I gotta step in the church  cause I ain't tryin' to go to hell
As the blood spills from my pen
It's time to confess my sins  cause I ain't tryin' to go to hell
Cause I ain't tryin' to go to hell
I'm tryin' to get some head tonight  have a stripper in my bed tonight
But I ain't tryin' to go to hell

As we keep our hands up high and scream for justice
Ferguson  rest in peace Mike Brown
And all the young soldiers out there
God help us
Time to take a stand and save our future
Like we all got shot  we all got shot
Throwing up our hands don't let them shoot us
'Cause we all we got  we all we got
God ain't put us on the Earth to get murdered  it's murder
God ain't put us on the Earth to get murdered  it's murder
Don't point your weapons at me
Tired of them killing us  I'm on my way to Ferguson
Mothers crying Stop the riots  we ain't got to chalk the city
I seen Cole out there  felt I should go out there
They left that boy for hours in the cold out there
They killin' teens  they killin' dreams (It's murder)

History keeps repeating itself  like a Biggie instrumental
America's a glass house and my revenge is mental
Rather use my brain than throw a cocktail through a window
I got the keys to the city still we left in the cold
Hands in the sky  still was left in the road
Stole by the system  black men we pay the toll
The price is your life  Uncle Sam want a slice
Black dress code now we looting in the night
Now we throwing Molotovs in this holocaust
And I know they hate to hear me screaming  I'm a Boss!

If excessive force was a drug  then they overdosed
Got us tryna protest  it's a slow process
Heard it's a lotta rotten eggs in the crow's nest
People praying on they feet  police holding on they heat
Turned on the news and seen a tank rolling down the street
Yeah  I seen a lot of ice water tossed and I know it's for a cause
My only question is  what we doing for the loss
Of Mike Brown?
'Cause right now  I challenge you to use your talents to
Speak up  and don't you ever let 'em silence you
'Cause action speaks louder than words  that's what I heard
Shot down with his hands up  that's what occurred
Man that sound absurd
Matter fact to me that sound like murder
We want justice
Ayy yo Game  I had a crib out there
I used to live out there
So I know how niggas feel out there
So it's time we come together
Use our voice as a weapon
I am Michael Brown  'cause I stand for what he stand for
News say we're looting
Paint pictures like we some animals
On my NWA CMG
Hollerin' Rest in peace Eazy and fuck the police
Heard another brother slain up in St. Louis
Sure the mother feel the pain  but what you famous doing
I’m sure the general population trying to be more active
But when the light finally catches you  you're ice challenged
Okay  and I support the ALS just like the rest of them
But you have yet to pay your debt
So you just flexing then
'Cause everybody care for a minute  then stop
People only there for a minute  then stop
And what's the point of giving if you ain't giving your all
We never getting ahead  might as well give up your heart
Where does it end?
I got my hands up  what else am I supposed to do?
Rest in peace to Mike Brown
Where does it end?
And all the other fallen soldiers
Tell me  where's the love for everything we're going through?
That will not be on the news or televised  ah
Hope that God can save us
As we lead in peace
Martin Luther King had a dream
But they ain't respecting Jesse up out here
And they don't really respect Obama out here
Lights out  go dark - it's like a nightmare
How the fuck you play the game  but they ain't playing fair
It's going down  Armageddon right here
Right now  not on TV but right here
Put your flags in the air if you don't really care (Wave it)
We need justice yeah  we need justice here
I heard he surrendered but we all saw how they did him
Television broadcasts  a confused country
I'm a resident of a nation that don't want me
What's done is done the town erupts in fury
And I'm already hearing 'bout this lopsided jury
Three faces like his  the rest another story
A lot of motherfuckers need to act more worried
The revolution has been televised
Fuck that  we have arrived
And who cares who ain't on our side 'cause we on our own
How do you preach peace to a family that just lost they own?
My brodie Game just banged my line like We gotta do something
All that marching and that peace ain't gonna fucking do nothing
The police done let the animals out of the cage
Oh lord it's

Throwing up our hands don't let them shoot us

I hopped every backyard on my block
Till I got to  Elm Street  took the rag out my sock
And I could have been a Crip but I ain't like blue that much
All Crip school  I ain't really go to school that much
I was selling crack on Elm  bagging up sacks on Elm
With the ratchet in my Bulls jacket  giving you the facts on Elm
King Frog and Big Face  they had my back on Elm
We was fighting over territory with the T-Flats on Elm
I had to scrap on Elm  that's how I got my stripes

Sometimes I thank God that I got set up
Suspect one: the homies never came to see me
Suspect two: Red hid my gun behind the TV
Suspect three: I was beefing with this Crip in my apartment
Shit started cause we fought and he couldn't see me
There's usually ten niggas in our dope spot
I usually play Xbox with the gun cocked
Hole in my chest 'bout the size of a kumquat
I know who shot me 'cause I shot them
But who set me up? I ain't tripping but—

Let me tell you how I met my nigga Wack
And everything is all good when you banging for your hood
Compton
That nigga Wack got my number and came through
Now let me tell you the type of shit the Game do
He walked in the booth where I was spitting
Now we like two red-nosed Pits
And don't forget about where my nigga AR be
And put roses on the grave of Kanye's mama
This for all the lost girls locked up in the pen
All the girls that hold it down  getting beat on by they man
Respect women  I don't care if they a 2 or a 10
We don't beat on Kat Stacks  we just bring it to an end
And we don't wanna see Nicki fighting Lil Kim
There’s missing women out there  let’s just focus on them
This song is dedicated to Natalee Holloway
I feel for her daddy so I wrote this on father's day
I know she gone  but she ain't far away
I just had a daughter  pass me that cigar 'Ye
I'm 'bout to tell a story  everybody parlay
Sit back listen while I kick it  the Compton Boulevard way
My daddy used to beat up on my mama all day
So I took my Chronic album and slept in the hallway
I learned this the hard way  when police came our way
My daddy had his act on like it never happened (Broadway)
Plus I was kinda scared to keep it real with you
Now my mama good  nigga she ain't gotta deal with ya
You want some money nigga? I ain't get a deal with ya
You ain't saying nothing  you like a still picture
You better thank God you still breathing air

Good evening  I'm in Chicago at the Elysian
With some girls that say they models but umm  I don't believe 'em
Who's still getting tested?
Where's all the women that can still remember who they slept with?
Where's all the girls too busy studying to make the guest list?
But when you do go out  you still working what you was blessed with?
Do it girl  I'll be the king to your Queen Latifah
I love your ass like Milhouse loved Lisa
I love your ass like the Ninja Turtles love pizza
This song remind me of Cat from Philly  a girl I used to love
Until she started acting silly  her heart's a little chilly
She a little too carefree
In 10 years  who's paying for all that therapy?
I'm probably not the man you take me for
But I bet I could be if you make me yours
Most of the shit I say is true
When I’m done with bad bitches  know I’m coming straight to you good girl

Can't swim in that poon fool  that's a crucial conflict
Never sleep with the wife of niggas you eat with
And never buy a chick a bag on the first date
I pop a bottle with her on her birthday and tell her ass get on!
Disrespect my chick  that type of shit'll get you spit on
I don't hit on girls  I just hit on girls
Like hey lil mama  come in Game and Drizzy world
Get busy girl  drink that rosé 'til you're dizzy girl
She walking around the club all lost  like where is he girl?
He on the top of the charts  next to Beyonce
Right under Kanye  so let the Don spray
That’s your girl? Nigga go on and make her cry

Yeah I’m married to the game
And she married to my chain  watching Boyz n The Hood
Uh-huh
Coming up I was confused  my mommy kissing a girl
Confusion occurs coming up in the cold world
Daddy ain't around  probably out committing felonies
For a four finger ring  one of them gold ropes
Nana told me if I passed I'd get a sheepskin coat
If I can move a few packs I'd get the hat  now that'd be dope
Tossed and turned in my sleep that night
Woke up the next morning  niggas had stole my bike
I'd run away from this bitch and never come back if I could

And I'm so tired of orderin' takeout  what's beef?
Beef is when you tell the chef to bring them steaks out
So let's play house with the Dracos and the AR
Stay the fuck up off of Stanley grass and take a shit in they yard
And my dick stay hard  when I see Lizzo on the internet
(Here it is another BBL)
And my dick get little on the internet
My intellect is NFTs and Cryptos  I can never be a Crip though
I tip-toe with my red rag around six O's
Chuck?
Yeah
Nobody cares about that shit anymore
You got a charger up there with you?
Good lookin'  homie
What?
He gave me this hat twenty-two years ago
Damn
It's my favorite
Can I see that shit for a minute?
Who signed it for you?
Eminem
He used to be like this rap God
Man  me and my brother praised him
Back when I was little  I don't really like any of his new stuff
Yo  shut the fuck up
Stop lookin' back  stop lookin' back here
Focus on the fuckin' road
Okay
Alright
Drive
Alright  alright
Drive
We'll go  we'll go
Shut the fuck up
Alright
Ask Dre
All I got is my word  my dick and my MAC 10
One thing you can never have is my motherfuckin' Black  skin
This ain't no suit that I wore
He got all the Blackest friends
He wants to be African  me
Left for dead on the Doctor's Advocate
Dre never executive-produced it  I just imagined it
Oh  here goes the magic tricks
Candy shops and the magic stick
DeAngelo Bailey got in shape to whoop your ass again
You depressed  you just maskin' it
But the math wasn't mathin' in
So pass me the torch 'cause the torture in my mind
With the voice that defied rhymes will force the blind eye
To see that I was in the white Rolls Royce with five .9's
When you was pretendin' to be the white Royce da 5'9
I just crossed a fine line
Might just force the white guy to call D12 so he can be the pork they grind  swine
And the biggest rapper in Detroit  that award is Sean Don
So uncork the Chardonnay and stick my fork in white wine
I never heard you in a club  I never heard you in a bar
Eleven albums and ten never got played inside of my car
I'd rather listen to Snitch9ine like sixty-nine times
And participate in sixty-nines with sixty-nine nuns than listen to you
With a Glock and he got it cocked
And the tattoos on his face is a star and a teardrop
He standin' on a teal drop and he says he can feel 'Pac in the air
(Ah  Epstein chased me around Epstein island)
Nothin' rhymes with orange
Shoot the fade with me  I'd love to put these hands up
I could 40 Glocc you  unarmed
Drop the world on your head with one arm
These are the deepest secrets  I keep and I be on defense
'Cause G's ain't supposed to fold up
With all the facades I hold up inside of my mind  I froze up
The Zika virus  pneumonia is deep inside my persona
On each side of my shoulders is demons chasin' Jehovah
The renegade or the soldier  I really gave it to Hova (How it feel?)
Twenty-three years  still ain't penetratin' the culture
Sniff a white line  this the right time
I Suge Knight Vanilla Ice  I'm not Mr. Nice Guy
I'm crazy (I'm crazy  I'm crazy)
I'm crazy (I'm crazy  I'm crazy)
I'm not Mr. Nice Guy
I'm crazy (I'm crazy  I'm crazy)
Dre know
I'm crazy (I'm crazy  I'm crazy)
Way to fuckin' go
('Cause I'm shady) Shadier than him
(I'm crazy) Crazier than Kim
So when the Bat signal goes up in the clouds above the buildings
I hope you live long enough to see heroes turn into villains
You love your mother?
Well  I'm cleanin' out your closet for you and your half-brother
And I told you when I was in Detroit  I wanna go to 8 Mile
'Cause when I was little to get some M&M's  I had to walk eight miles
But you wouldn't leave the studio  your life is on loop
That's why I'm doggy in style  'cause niggas rather bump Snoop
And I'm a lyrical .50 cal
Hello? Hello?
Pagin' Dr. Dre?
He ain't got a lot to say
But since Curtis always do  let him write the rhymes for you
Tell him to clip the wings on my butterfly tatt' and force 'em back in the cocoon
Now does he still rap or did he have a change of heart too?
The chick on the show wasn't pickin' me and Mariah wasn't pickin' you
So the cannons is blam-blammin' and if it jam then I unjam it
And wipe down my stripper pole with the hair grease from your bandana
You wish you was Santana or Cam in them 10 J's
Durag for ten years and never had one wave
And I was that runaway slave  that they buried in that one grave
And some say he would back to haunt Slim Shady one day
This your dad was twenty-two when he ate lil' Debbie
He takes the cake
'Cause she was only fifteen  so how could one not sympathize with her havin' you as a teen?
She had to lose herself in the moment  give up her dreams
Just to see her son out here lookin' like a wigger in jeans (Yeah)
Little Marshall Mathers
Mad 'cause nobody thinks that little Marshall matters
That sentiment's hard to gather
You like it  Slim?
I made it just for you
I even kidnapped Stan's brother and baited him here for you
But you would just say  No
Probably leave us in the blistering cold
God made you damn near perfect  he just missed your soul
You ain't the shell of who you used to be
And Matthew's dead now  it's just you and me
Umm  is that cultural appropriation?
Ask Paul if it's even appropriate for me to make that statement  rude of me
How your day went?
Did you re-dye your beard or get another face lift or do shrooms in your mom's basement
Until you nod and see spaceships
And the aliens inside it come and tell you your talent's wasted
Then you wake up and you ain't shit
I know you fiendin' for a Dr. Dre bass hit
How ironic  an addict in a basement
And now I chronic  'cause I done had it with the fake shit
You never understood ebonics or a cadence
I press everything like a weight bench
And every time the plate hits  you off another playlist
Sorry  it ain't workin' out
Niggas shootin'  Billy Blanks (It's my winner's speech)
My other twelve personalities wasn't really in the mood today
Crashed the car  hit and run
Jumped out  hid the gun
I came to put Slim in a box but he already live in one
Mr. Shady  don't be shady
Pick that pen up  don't be lazy
Call up Dre and get that Dre beat
Jump off stage if shit get crazy
Mr. Shady  don't be shady
Pick that pen up  don't be lazy
Call up Dre and get that Dre beat
See any angels in the city
See any angels in the city
Tell them mothafuckas I'm forever paid
Drive up out that mothafuckin' swamp in the Escalade
So before you put that red rag in your pocket
I wanna see your fuckin' résumé
Rip rappers a new asshole – I never hesitate
I'ma give 'em hurricanes until another levee break
Now Dre's weapon of mass destruction is 'bout to detonate
But I'm not stoppin' till I'm the fuckin' king in every state
Give me fuel for the fire burnin' when I yearn these lights
In the midst of the hieroglyphs my fingertips start to write
I'm a raging bull when the needle drops
I'ma tie a knot on a downtown buildin'
In the dark with the ghetto children
You might also like
I'm sick of mothafuckas talkin' about the West died
Can't you hear my heart beatin'? That's the motherfuckin' Westside
Then I can split you with this Tommy gun
You won't have no time to run
I'm from the city where two of the best died
How dare you niggas pop fly
When I'm the nigga sold 5 mill' out the gate and numbers do not lie
Give me fuel for the fire burnin' when I yearn these lights
In the midst of the hieroglyphs my fingertips start to write
I'm a raging bull when the needle drops
I'ma tie a knot on a downtown buildin'
In the dark with the ghetto children
And this is what you all been waitin' for
I'm the lost angel knockin' on Satan's door
What the fuck y'all take me for?
I love you ‘cause you hate me more
Shake you like Haiti's floor
Shots in that Mercedes door
Either I'm crazy or the black Slim Shady or
Could that be the reason that Baby said he would pay me more?
But I still owe Jimmy one more album
Give me fuel for the fire burnin' when I yearn these lights
In the midst of the hieroglyphs my fingertips start to write
I'm a raging bull when the needle drops
I'ma tie a knot on a downtown buildin'
In the dark with the ghetto children
We don't wanna see the box like Manny Pacquiao
Little nigga Mayweather size
Ride like Pac in his prime  Thug Life is now on radar
'Til the federal come through and raid ours
Reminiscin' when the L.A. Raiders
And I don't condone dickridin'
I'm addicted to Westsidin'
Livin' in a city where the skinny niggas die
Tryin'… and I mean that shit
I was in the city where a nigga hadn't seen that shit
Compton! – a nigga gotta scream that shit
Can't block or screen that shit
Now everybody sing that shit!
You only gave me five dollars!
I gave you twenty mother fuckin' dollars!
No  you didn't! You only gave me five dollars!
This is America!
You know  that's the thing about you mother fuckers
Go home!
I ain't goin' no where 'til I get my mother fuckin' change
I will blow this mother fucker up if I don't get my mother fuckin' change
*Speaking Japanese*
*Mocking Japanese*
I want my mother fuckin' change!
What happened in hip-hop that got Pac and Big shot?
The thicks blocks  now every rapper claim he let his clip pop
But even myself tote a gun  and know to run than get shot
I've been there before now I'm fuckin' with Doc
(Gotta do them Calvin Broadus numbers)
Media think I'm fakin' like Mason  but when it comes to mace
Fuck R. Kelly  I don't take it in the face
I find out who sprayed it  and I'm puttin' you under the pavement
I'm far from religious  but I got beliefs
So I put canary yellow diamonds in my Jesus piece
I came back from the dead without a part of my chest
Laid in a hospital bed on cardiac arrest
I waited for 3 years while everybody else dropped
Now I understand why Nas did a song with his pops

Got a hook from Faith  no verse from Jay
I guess on Westside Story he thought I spit in his face
Told Ed Lover & Moni Love I was talkin' to Ja
With that Maybach line  it was payback time
Keep fuckin' with me nigga  I'll put you under me
Take your car and trade it in for eight 300 Z's
If you cross my T  I'll dot your eyes
You'll do life in a cemetery  I'll do mine with Shyne
Come home sit in the throne with my legs crossed
'Cause I'm feelin' like Puff when Life After Death hit
Mo' money  mo' problems and I lost my best friend
I'm the second dopest nigga from Compton you'll ever hear
The first nigga only put out albums every 7 years
(You know what speaking of Jay
That just makes me roll down
Now your song Westside Story)
Uh Oh
(You got a line that says
I don't do button up shirts
Or drive Maybachs
Is that a shot at Jay?)
Nah  I was talkin' about Ja Rule
You know what I'm sayin'?
I never take shots at legends
I just-that's just somethin' I don't do
Let me tell you why I do this shit
I'm a son of a gun 'cause moms was a Hoover Crip
First day I got signed  I had to prove I spit
Freestyle with Busta Rhymes (son  duke is sick)
The protégé of Doc Dre  I could finally put the shoes on
Now that the rumors of Rakim and Cube gone
They say truth hurts  sunk like quicksand
Don't stop me in traffic and ask about Hittman
I gotta restore the feelin' that crawled from under the rock
After Tha Dogg Pound crushed the buildings
I got a family to feed  I'm the middle of 9 children
We can talk about a loan after I sell 5 million
If I tell you I ain't Game and I don't know Dre
You goin' do me like Xzibit and cut half my face?
I take all the credit for puttin' the West back on the map
If you ain't feelin' that  guess I'm Guerrilla Black
I'm Ready To Die without a Reasonable Doubt
Smoke Chronic and hit it Doggystyle before I go out
Until they sign my Death Certificate  All Eyez On Me

You are now about to witness the strength of Aftermath
Straight out the mothafuckin' streets of Compton
Put your hands together for Game  bitch! Hahahaha
Yeah! Yeah  mothafuckas!
Compton's back on the mothafuckin' map
Aftermath in that ass  bitch
Game  let's go
Me and Marshall ain't start shit  they listen to our shit
Then talk shit about us but that shit is foul when
I'm tryna feed my son and drop multi-platinum albums
Make my mother proud that her son made it out
But it's hard when they hate us  and think Em a racist
They say shit but fuck them  Shady one of the greatest
Like Biggie and 'Pac was  we saw the throne was empty
This rap shit is basic  I followed that Jay shit
Think of what I wanna say  step in the booth and one-take it
How could I not sell a million when I'm rappin' on Dre hits
Then spit that classical L.A. N.W.A. shit
The media is bullshit  now we can't even say bitch
They accusin' Michael of touchin' kids in the wrong places
At first they embraced him  had a couple of facelifts
Now people wanna place him with murderers and rapists
Put the clip in and waste 'em before I go out on that fake shit
I'm so sick and tired of this black shit  this white shit
So I sit here and write shit  Em they ain't gon' like this

You'll end up in the same situation  same shit
Way do you wanna face when your brain's hit pavement?
Think of what you'll say to Pastor Mase and save it
For the day that they got them affidavits waving
Eminem battles to ward off accusations
That he had somebody blasted  the mask of Jason
Was found at the scene of the task with masking tape
And the victim's penis up his ass  a basket case
And they ask him to clean up his act  you bastards wasting

If Eminem is in it  body armor under the Pendleton
These niggas is killing it  take a minute to listen
Turn down my Jimi Hendrix  I'll throw your demo out the window
For telling me it's hot  when it's not and you got
Telling Dre you got shot with a Glock  that don't fade me
I'm crazy  why the fuck you think I'm rhyming with Shady?
I don't care if the radio don't play me  I say

Been there  done that  sold crack  got jacked
Got shot  came back  jumped on Dre's back
Payback  homie  I'm bringing C.A. back

Let her put on your chain  she'll throw you some cot
Picture that  like Meagan Good and Jamie Foxx
Hype said it's a wrap  she still on the set
Puttin' oil on her legs like she Gloria Velez
She was Eye Candy in the XXL
Hopped off the page and on a skateboard with Pharrell
I knew she (Wouldn't get far) 'cause five hundred dollars
Can't get you that (Far)  how you get that (Far)
And all these new video bitches tryin' to be Melyssa Ford
