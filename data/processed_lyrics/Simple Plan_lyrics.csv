"But I want you to know
I'm a dick
I'm addicted to you
I can't pretend I don't care
When you don't think about me
Do you think I deserve this?
I tried to make you happy
But you left anyway
I'm trying to forget that
I'm addicted to you
But I want it and I need it
I'm addicted to you
Now it's over
Can't forget what you said
And I never wanna do this again
Heartbreaker
Heartbreaker
Heartbreaker
Since the day I met you
And after all we've been through
Still a dick
I'm addicted to you
I think you know that it's true
I'd run a thousand miles to get you
Do you think I deserve this?

I tried to make you happy
I did all that I could
Just to keep you
But you left anyway
I'm trying to forget that
I'm addicted to you
But I want it and I need it
I'm addicted to you
Now it's over
Can't forget what you said
And I never wanna do this again
Heartbreaker
Heartbreaker
How long will I be waiting?
Until the end of time
I don't know why I'm still waiting
I can't make you mine
I'm trying to forget that
I'm addicted to you
But I want it and I need it
I'm addicted to you
I'm trying to forget that
I'm addicted to you
But I want it and I need it
I'm addicted to you
Now it's over
Can't forget what you said
And I never wanna do this again
Heartbreaker

Heartbreaker

Heartbreaker
I'm addicted to you
Or am I talking to myself?
My mind is running empty
In this search for someone else
Who doesn't look right through me
It's all just static in my head
Can anybody tell me why
I'm lonely like a satellite?
'Cause tonight I'm feeling like an astronaut
Sending S.O.S. from this tiny box
And I lost all signal when I lifted off
Now I'm stuck out here and the world forgot
Can I please come down? (Come down)
'Cause I'm tired of driftin' around and 'round (And 'round)
Can I please come down?
I'm deafened by the silence
Is it somethin' that I've done?
I know that there are millions
I can't be the only one
Who's so disconnected
It's so different in my head
Can anybody tell me why
I'm lonely like a satellite?

'Cause it’s still your face
But there’s something strange
Not the one I remember
Can you please explain
Did they wipe your brain?
Is this gonna be forever?
Then I swear I thought I knew you
But all that was yesterday
So we pull your strings
'Cause it makes no sense

But I crashed in a wall
I guess it's no use

I'm born to lose
God must hate me
Cursed me for eternity

Because I just can't take it

When you're gone it won't stop bleeding

I've got no place to go
I've got no where to run
They love to watch me fall
They think they know it all
That's what they always said
But I'll make it on my own
I've gotta prove them wrong
Me against the world
Me against the world
Now I'm sick of this waiting
So come on and take your shot
You can spit all your insults
But nothing you say is gonna change us
You can sit there and judge me
Say what you want to
We'll never let you in
That's what they always said

I can remember smelling your hair  I'll meet you anywhere
Somewhere that no one can retrace
Somewhere where nobody will know our faces

And four legs to wrap around me
She's not your typical girlfriend
She's my alien
My alien
She knows when something is wrong
When something doesn't belong
She can read in my mind
And she can be assured that with me
There is no conspiracy
She's not wasting her time
She can take me to the place that she calls home
In a spaceship that will someday be my own
Please take me to your leader
Tell her I will surrender
I will surrender

I look around me
But all I seem to see
Is people going nowhere
Expecting sympathy
It's like we're going through the motions
Of a scripted destiny
Tell me where's our inspiration
If life won't wait
I guess it's up to me
Whoa
Whoa
Whoa
We'll leave the past in the past
Gonna find the future
If misery loves company
You're gonna miss me when I'm gone

While you sit there contemplating
You wound up left for dead (Left for dead)
Life is what happens while you're busy making your excuses
And that won't happen to me
Whoa
Whoa
Whoa
We'll leave the past in the past
Gonna find the future
If misery loves company
You're gonna miss me when I'm gone
You're gonna miss me when I'm gone
When I'm gone
Let's go!
Won't look back
When I say goodbye
I'm gonna leave this hole behind me
Gonna take what's mine tonight
'Cause every wasted day becomes a wasted chance
You're gonna wake up feeling sorry
'Cause life won't wait
I guess it's up to you
Whoa
Whoa
Whoa
We'll leave the past in the past
Gonna find the future
If misery loves company
You're gonna miss me when I'm gone
You're gonna miss me when I'm gone
You're gonna miss me when I'm gone
I'm trying to leave the memories of you behind
I'm gonna be fine
As soon as I get your picture right out of my mind
I wanna feel the way you make me feel when I'm with you
I wanna be the only hand you need to hold on to
But every time I call you don't have time
I guess I'll never get to call you mine
You're nothing at all
I know there's a million reasons why I shouldn't call
With nothing to say
Could easily make this conversation last all day
I wanna feel the way you make me feel when I'm with you
I wanna be the only hand you need to hold on to
But every time I call you don't have time
I guess I'll never get to call you mine
Another lesson
I didn't get to learn
You're my obsession
I've got nowhere to turn

How low you're ready to go
You don't mean anything to me
You don't mean anything to me

Connection undeniable
I swear I thought you were the one forever
But your love was like a loaded gun
You shot me down like everyone
'Cause everyone's replaceable
When you're just so incapable
Of getting past skin deep
You can't trust a serial cheater
You suck at love
You played me like an amateur
Then stabbed me like a murderer
It's not like you're unpredictable
But your act is so believable
You're good at what you do

You've messed this whole thing up
Well you were such an awesome fuck
That's it
I fall asleep by the telephone (Telephone)
It's two o'clock and I'm waiting up alone
I found a note with another name (Another name)
'Cause I can feel that you're gone (Feel that you're gone)
I can't bite my tongue forever
While you try to play it cool
You can hide behind your stories
But don't take me for a fool
You can tell me that there's nobody else (But I feel it)
You can tell me that you're home by yourself (But I see it)
You can look into my eyes and pretend all you want

You look so innocent (So innocent)
But the guilt in your voice gives you away
How does it feel when you kiss when you know that I trust you
And do you think about me when he fucks you?
Could you be more obscene? (Be more obscene)
So don't try to say you're sorry
Or try to make it right
You can tell me that there's nobody else (But I feel it)
You can tell me that you're home by yourself (But I see it)
You can look into my eyes and pretend all you want
Your love is just a lie (Lie)
It's nothing but a lie (Lie)
