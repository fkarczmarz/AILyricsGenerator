lyrics
"I bet you are still sleeping
I just want to bless you this morning
May the God of Jehovah bless you
Guide you  protect you  everything you are doing
May the God lead you as he lead the Israelite to their promised land
God will lead you far
My son  I'm blessing you this morning
God will lead you far  okay?
Just put your trust and hope and everything in him
And he will take care of everything  okay?
God will bless you  in Jesus' name
Have a pleasant day  my lovely son
God bless you  bye
Yeah  yeah  look
Your son did good  Mum
Know I used to run around with a buj  Mum
But I promise I was doing what I could  Mum
Now I made a little change  now we're good  Mum
I was saying I'ma get you out the hood  Mum
Take a selfie  show 'em how you look  Mum
Flex on 'em  let 'em know that we're good  Mum
See  back then I was bumping cabs
South of the Thames  where I come from's mad
Done some dirt and I ain't too proud
That you're living on the road where your son got stabbed
Man  I had you on the station  your son got nabbed

Tough luck  just mums  no dads
And we all know growing up in London's mad
Mummy ain't never seen a hundred bags
So let 'em all know that my mumzy's glad
Yeah  I bought Mumzy a pad
Ghanaian queen  let 'em know that you're back
'Cause Mummy ain't never seen a hundred bags
Now I'm like  Mum  buy a hundred bags
Be right here whenever you need me
I need you to know that your son's got your back
Everything  I'ma repeat that
And when I make a song  you give me feedback
I watched you plant the seeds and then you reap that
Made a little money from trees  I let you keep that
Hid drugs but you probably couldn't see that
Young thug  missing colly like an eediyat
Fucked up  saying sorry like I'm Three Stacks
Man  I just hope you can play this
All the times that you worked on a late shift
Just to see you come short on your payslip
Always in and out of beef with the bailiffs
Now I'm on the playlist
Yeah  where I come from's bad
Same old shit  just mums  no dads
And we all know growing up in London's mad
Mummy ain't never seen a hundred bags
So let 'em all know that my mumzy's glad
Yeah  I bought Mumzy a pad
Yeah  like Mumzy you're bad
Ghanaian queen  let 'em know that you're back
'Cause Mummy ain't never seen a hundred bags
Now I'm like  Mum  buy a hundred bags
Be right here whenever you need me
I need you to know that your son's got your back  look
Mum  I save it all for you
Listen to the words I say
No more broken promises  I promise this
So I save it all for you
Mum  I save it all for you
Listen to the words I say
No more broken promises
No more broken promises  I swear
No more broken promises  I swear
No more broken promises  I swear
No more broken promises  I swear
No more broken promises
Never seen a hundred bags
Now I'm like  Mum  buy a hundred bags
Never seen a hundred bags
Now I'm like  Mum  buy a hundred bags
Never seen a hundred bags
Now I'm like  Mum  buy a hundred bags
And I'll be right here whenever you need me
I need you to know that your son's got your back
And them boy had a chance but them man failed
And you went and brought a Mini with your dad's help
You have to give me a reason to spit game
I let you pose in the mirror with my big chain
Got me laying with my hands tied
Are you bringing out your bad side?
Cause them man said they're good but them man lied
I let you buss back when my gun shoot
So you deserve rounds tonight
And if I come it’s only fair that you cum too
Never had a nigga hold you down like this
Never had a nigga hit you up with a backstroke
Never had a nigga make you sound so slip
Scratches all on my back
Girl why you gotta be so aggressive?
You tell the world that it's mine
But I think your ex man never really got the message
And cater for me cause I got you
And 15 yellow and brown ones don’t mean shit
Cuh girl they are not you
Man I swear on my life
Every time we arrive it's a hype cause they wave when we bop thru
Man I'd be pissed if I lost you
Show em that Christopher Kane
And you ain't gotta go and get mad
Ain't nobody taking your place
Million dollar pussy on my mattress
Cause the pengtings always come with the fan club
You know your inbox all crammed up
Tell em hands off or I make em put their hands up but
Back to the us shit
Straight back to the love shit
That 'we don’t give a fuck' shit
Babygirl love sick
This nigga got her love sick
She need a leg for them crutches
A ring for my buff chick
All diamond encrusted
The only girl I've trusted
But you made it clear that you're killing 'em straight
Expensive wear with your Vivienne taste
Never woulda thought that you'd grew in an estate
But you left that life with your vision and faith
You bop right up to the bouncers and tell em
Have a black cab ready for my exit shit
Who's fucking with you?
I said I got a late night shift
How the fuck did you get so attractive?
Other girls ain't telling you shit
And when them other girls try step
You niggas audacious
Hmm
Yeah
I roll out with no cash on me
Calm now with no mash on me
Stay away from these ashy youts
'Fore they come around and get ash on me
That's five thousand capacity
Five thousand capacity
Then spread that over the UK
And then add it up and get back to me
You pussios are not bad for me
Who the fuck went an' gassed you up
Like you're good enough to be clashin' me?
Charge me up and put gas in me
Them likkle fish want to try ting
I got girl in my inbox sendin' me eyes
Livin' on the edge 'til the end of our lives
Wolf in a sheepskin tellin' me lies
Sometimes I love when my enemy dies
Mainstream boy starts lettin' off lie
Dodge the paps and do boat
My boys are maximum boast
Ain't no time to bly man
Know my ting from here to Thailand
You man got that gun off my man
So you man got that gun on finance
Like what's this rented skeng? Buy your own
Use my pen to skeng-fry your dome
You're not tough or hard
They callin' me the virgin Mike
How the hell I bust so fast?
No cosigns for me and no carers

To another day

Till you came and saved
You came and saved me
And the rain was pouring
'Cause the sun faded away

No longer afraid
Blinded by your grace
You came and saved me
Amazing grace that saved the wretch
And now prayers all I got (saved the wretch)
Care is there
I say spades a spade
If you’re digging me or not
I’m a heal the world with words
You go heal a load of hurt
And I'm a write 'cause my Gods almighty
I asked for forgiveness
I sold my soul with my business
I even brought in my siblings
I hear their cries in the distance
That’s something I have to live with
Still I reply ‘I’m a Christian’
Sacrifice all my bread
Give my time up for lent
Every night say my prayers
Cause sometimes I forget
And I swear every time I shouldn’t
And cause of you I care every time I shouldn’t
But God made man in the light
Of his own image
So I shine bright by my woman
She my better side
And my suns like very bright
And my sky’s like heavens sight
And I drop down on both knees
And I raise my arms to exercise my
If God’s working overtime
I shall not want unless I grind

Don't get lost in the fast pace
My god
Guess your man dem ain't built like ours
Tell a boy come then I make a boy run
You can go and buy a gun but you can't buy a heart
Then I swapped my beef for a future
Used to link my mans for some weed
Now I call up T for a link for producers
Niggas better get with the movement
What's a washed up vet to a student?
How you gonna try and order my slice?
But you wanna try and force it on man
Man said he's the coldest in grime
Man would've thought that I died
Went to my show and came back with a cheque
Couple man used to get slapped in the head
Now men are talking like the bad that is dead
Me plus twenty-two goons on the guest list
Sending for me? That was expected
I does what I normally do
Fuck your crew and your 4-5
You wanted a piece but it's all mine
Got the drop from Sloth like it's war time
Get a box in your gob if you talk like
Tell him just wait till I come
That's MistaJam and that's Semtex
Now these niggas wanna try and come to my vids
For some pics and a cameo too
I'm like where was you when I started?
Put your money where your mouth is
I don't wanna talk bout them
How they gonna put money in my trousers?
My big bro's putting money into houses
You made all that dough just to go and buy clothes
And put your last money in your outfit
And a scarf and they think they're about it
I'mma tell you like a man told me
You can't come nicer than I can
All I need is a mic and a mic stand
Still I stand with my niggas on my right hand
They ask who's the best? I tell them I am
Dying to rep flow
Best know that whatever I said goes
Took a shot to your head with your dead flow

Go so hard until you make them miss you
And everybody's talking but there ain't an issue
So I beg you 'llow me with your bummy arse
Are you bored?
So how you asking for a premium?
How you asking for a favour?
We're just tryna make a living
And I can tell that you're a hater
So there's no way you can be greater
I need a lair and some paper
Need a table and a waiter and a pastor and a bishop
And a spade for me to dig it
You're looking at the saviour
Get my wave on listening to Annie Mac
I hit Napa in my slippers and my fanny pack
In some Stan Smiths courtesy of Adidas
I phone Ims and tell her put it in my calendar

This some shit I hate to share
Escape this life or pay the fare
Grab this gun and aim it there
Shoot my pain and slay my fear
Before I die  I say my prayer
Don't worry about the mess  just lay me there
This is all I got  so lay me bare

Grab this gun and aim it there
Shoot my pain and slay my fear
Before I die  I say my prayer

This is all I got  so lay me bare
Tryna call my name and take my crown
Little bit of pain  I'll paint the town
When they put me in my grave  don't make a sound
'Cause there's still some days I find it hard
Smoke my spliff and write my bars
I know they see me climb the charts
But plaques won't help me find my heart
Devil's in my ear  I need you back
Got scars in my soul  I've been attacked
Even when I'm low  I seem relaxed
But then year's been mad  I lost my way
They think I went ghost to drop my tape
Not knowing that I fell and lost my faith
So fuck this shit  this ain't a joke
Just to get away  I take a toke
I took this pain and made a boat
Lord knows how the fuck it's staying afloat
Last year  I cried too many times
Weren't for Flipz and weren't for rhymes
Weren't for Rachel  weren't for Kelly
Man  them people saved my life
Like man'a get low sometimes  so low sometimes
Airplane mode on my phone sometimes
Sitting in my house with tears in my face
Can't answer the door to my bro sometimes
Roaming around all alone sometimes
Don't know sometimes

But this shit's like Game of Thrones sometimes

Fuck you  that's where I draw the line!

I put her on a jet if her pussy—  wait
There's guests in my kitchen and my left wrist is glistening
My tunes getting played from a set to a christening
They're pissed on the net 'cause I said I ain't listening

They tell their jokes to spite the man

Know Khaleesi couldn't fathom all the fire I spill  nah
You old washed niggas should retire  for real
There's a time you should move and a time to be still
There's a time to destroy and a time to rebuild
But all I see is washed up godfathers and washed up podcasters
I own all my masters  I ain't got masters
I throw a party on the yacht and wear my Yacht Master
They think I just chart-top  but I'm the top charter
Gaffer like I'm Scott Parker
For when the mandem used to rock parkas
I am nasty  but I'm not Marcus
Genius  I could've clocked Harvard

My accolades are bigger than my head

(The killy'dem ah carry one inna di head)
(Don Dada  kick arff face with bank robber)
If it's a ting then I'll just pattern it like Trev  ah
Walk in a gym and I bump into William
But the M on my hairline stands for my millions
They wanna bring up my past because I'm living my dream
What we achieved ain't a shock 'cah we knew it
Now there's not enough space in my wardrobe
Benjart fitted on my waist and my torso
I've never seen real dons turn loose women
If we ever played a game called Guess Who's Winning
Then you'll open up the door  I'll be in the room chillin'
There'll never be a time where me and you's twinnin'
Why? Different status  my chicks the baddest
You know the bags Chanel  the trips to Paris
And if your boy's a king  the bit's a palace
Okay  three O2s that I sell out

Me and Flipz don't talk like we fell out
Every time I double-plaque  they gotta double my P
I was double-spread Mike  now I cover i-D
Wouldn't cover for you dickheads if you covered my—

You little boys are out your depth
Know I got Ashville on the yard and Yianni on the wrap
I mean  I'm Yianni on the rap
I'm the best at what I do  they think I'm braggin' on the track
But I'm flexing 'cah it's true and if you went and run it back
You'd know I'd left you with the truth
'Cause the cars don't make you this lit
The money don't make you this good
The plaques don't make you this cold
Give a fuck what my shit sold
I buss a rhyme when I'm in flip mode  you pricks know

Primary  sippin' on my juice with my biscuits
I'm from a place where we move to da witness
Stare in your face  tell 'em  Business is business
Came for the fame  but she stayed for the litness
