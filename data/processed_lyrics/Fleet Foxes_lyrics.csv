"Who turned you so against you?
Accepting just virtue?
Ooh
And did he act alone?
Were any more complicit?
Who?
Who?
Who?
Who?
Fire can't doubt its heat
Water can't doubt its power
You're not adrift
You're not a gift
More than I wish I knew
And now it’s near on me
Some rush of red fear
And my worst old times look fine from here
I know you walked this route
And you might help me out
You said what's done is done
I can't turn the hand 'round
But still it looks a long way down
And so I want to walk out in the night
See the wide young river flood rain
We're not on one straight line
I made my own way through
And when the track goes cold
I'll know that it's true
That rebirth won't work like it used to

And so I want to walk out in the night
See the wide young river flood rain
And I can't let go
Of a lot I've left
I'm holding nothing
But what I kept
And it all got dimmer
Each passing step
And I need you with me
And you read the writ
Are you now insisting
Is it not worth it?
But I've got no option
I inherited this and I'm overcome
All my fingers rotting
I woke up a dying man
Without a chance
I came to your window
Threw a stone and waited
The stranger's voice said nothing good
I turned to walk the frozen ground
Wide-eyed walker
Do not wander
Do not wander
Through the dawn
Both my eyes are fading
No light in the evening
Planted like a seed in sand
And drowned in rain
Watch you for an hour
He kept you beneath him
He kept you on lock and key
He paid the wage you sent to me
And wastes the day so idlly

I have borrowed all my lonesome life
The borrower's debt is the only regret of my youth
And believe me it's not easy when I look back
Everything I took I'd soon return
Just to be at Innisfree again
All of the sirens are driving me over the stern
Just to be at Innisfree again
All of the sirens are driving me over the stern
One day at Innisfree
One day that's mine there
In the street one day I saw you among the crowd
In a geometric patterned dress
Gleaming white just as I recalled
Old as I get I would never forget it at all
Gleaming white just as I recalled
Old as I get I could never forget it at all

One day at Innisfree
Under stormy night  tell nobody
My brother  where do you intend to go tonight?
I heard that you missed your connecting flight
To the Blue Ridge Mountains  over near Tennessee
You're ever welcome with me any time you like
Let's drive to the countryside  leave behind some green-eyed look-a-likes
So no one gets worried  no
So no one gets worried  no
But Sean  don't get careless
I'm sure it'll be fine
I love you  I love you
Oh  brother of mine
In the quivering forest
Where the shivering dog rests
Our good grandfather
Built a wooden nest
And the river got frozen
And the home got snowed in
And a yellow moon glowed bright
Till the morning light

Why is the Earth moving 'round the sun?
Why in the night sky are the lights hung?
Why is life made only for to end?
Why do I do all this waiting then?
Why this frightened part of me that's fated to pretend?
Why is life made only for to end?
In the city only for a while
Here to face the fortune and the bile
In the city only for a while
Why in the night sky are the lights hung?
Why is the Earth moving 'round the sun?
Can I
Ever know your mind?
Am I handing you mine?
Do we both confide?
Now I’m learning the ropes
Never get this close
I've been wounded before
Hasn't let me go
Staying under my weather all day
Can I believe you when you say I'm good?
I didn't need to when I wished you would
Never held that much
Now another way up
Been a row too rough
Staying under my weather all day
What type of desire I can break
What half is it of me rearranged?
Can I believe you?
Can I believe you?
I want to need you
I want to need you
Can I believe you?
Life makes short work of all I see
Men take the change from beggars
Tight bound in sheets
Red and blue  the useless sirens scream
Song of masses  passing outside
All inciting the fifth of July
When guns for hire open fire
Blind against the dawn
When the knights in iron took the pawn
You and I  out into the night
Held within the line that they have drawn
As I went they're all beside us in silence
As if unaffected amid the violence
Ooh  are we also tamed?
I was in a river  as if in water
Ooh  are we also tamed?

And the arm won't set
And the bright red eye
Isn't off you yet
So the words won't come
And the hand won't touch
And a midnight sun
Doesn't look like much
As an iris contracts
Facing the day

Like a china plate.)

Barely believe we made it
When I met eyes with you
I caught a walking fever
I know how all this ends
Palm over my receiver
Young today  old as a railroad tomorrow
Days are just drops in the river to be lost always
Years ago  birds of a feather would arrive nightly
Gone you know  held to another like clutched ivy

To an edge I caught when we both were young
That the world I won wasn't near enough
Many men might die for what I'd renounced
I was staging life as a battleground
May the last long year be forgiven
All that war left within it
And we've only made it together

There's a ration back in a manifold
If you need it or forgot
May the last long year be forgiven
All that war left within it

And later on remember
When the fever broke and you could eat
And you've brought enough to last another week or two
You sought land
Overgrown
Water stands
Waves just pass through it
Some horizon eyeing me up  often does right at dusk
Often known it wore that look
And I've known it one too many times
And the thought of flight for water whiter
Now those passing dotted lines
Going on and on just shake my sleep all night
Could be I'm finally losing my fight
Due south all the fog aired out  no idea where all this leads
Though I still wanted to show Going-to-the-Sun Road to you
Still got one in me
If I want to  I'll arrive at peace
I know I decide what I remember
If this ever mended me
All the on and on
Just shakes my sleep all night
Now I'm losing my fight
A estrada do sol
O começo de tudo
E as nuvens que agora se afastam
Mostrando um caminho que está sempre lá
Still as starlight reflected in fountains then
Children grown on the edge of the ocean
Kept like jewelry  kept with devotion
In that dream moving slow through the morning time
You would come to me then  without answers
Lick my wounds and remove my demands for now
Eucalyptus and orange trees are blooming
In that dream  there's no darkness a-loomin'
In that dream  moving slow through the morning time
In that dream I could hardly contain it
All my life I will wait to attain it
I know someday the smoke will all burn off
All these voices I'll someday have turned off then
I will see you someday when I've woken
I'll be so happy just to have spoken
I'll have so much to tell you about it then

You don't say a single word of the last two years

I didn't understand

Like a snowflake distinct among snowflakes

Serving something beyond me

I don't need to be kind to the armies of night
That would do such injustice to you
Or bow down and be grateful
To the men who move only in dimly lit halls
And determine my future for me
If I know only one thing

Of the world outside is so inconceivable

Than my mother and father
When they had their daughter

Naked as when they came

Any faces above me
Or just cracks in the ceiling

Second son  for the second time...
Can I be light and free?
If I lead you through the fury will you call to me?
And is all that I might owe you carved on ivory?
But all will fade. All I say. All I needed
Life unfolds in pools of gold
I am only owed this shape if I make a line to hold
To be held within one's self is deathlike  oh I know
I was a fool
Crime after crime to confess to
But I hold the fleet angel  she'll bless you
Hold fast to the wing. Hold fast to the wing
 graceful in the morning light?
 to follow you softly
 down to your grave
 and the tall grasses wave
Blame it on timing
Weakening August water
Loose-eyed in morning
Sunlight covered over
Wading in sight of fire
And we're finally aligning
More than maybe I can choose
Soon as I knew you
All so wide open
Wading inside of fire
As if I just saw you
Cross Second Avenue
Wading in waist-high water
And I love you so violent
More than maybe I can do
Now we're finally aligning
I was following the  I was following the
I was following the  I was following the
I was following the  I was following the
I was following the pack  all swaddled in their coats
With scarves of red tied 'round their throats
To keep their little heads from fallin' in the snow
And I turned 'round and there you go
Red as strawberries in the summertime
I was following the pack  all swaddled in their coats
With scarves of red tied 'round their throats
To keep their little heads from fallin' in the snow
And I turned 'round and there you go
Red as strawberries in the summertime
I was following the pack  all swaddled in their coats
With scarves of red tied 'round their throats
To keep their little heads from fallin' in the snow
And I turned 'round and there you go
I'll be lying in my ocean of time
I could dress as Arthur Lee
Scrape my shoes the right way
Maybe read Ulysses
But it's a young man's game
Dying fire  so tired of this place
Not inspired  can't keep to this pace
I could worry through each night
Find something unique to say
I could pass as erudite
But it's a young man's game
You should know
You're my last hope
I've been solving for the meaning of life
No one tried before and likely I'm right
Not too straight or too clean
Like your borrowеd blue bike
I've been a rolling antiquе
For all my life

You're my last hope
I've been lucky as sin
Not one thing in my way
Just the arena I was in
Your protector's coming home
Safe from the outside world
You walk along the stream
Your head caught in a waking dream
On the morning that you came
Would you wait for me?
The other one would wait for me
On the morning that you came
Would you wait for me?
The other one would wait for me
You run with the devil
You run with the devil
Tell your brother to be good
Tell your sister not to go
Tell your mother not to wait
Tell your father I was good
