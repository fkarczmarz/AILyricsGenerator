lyrics
"Keep your mind on your money  and you ain't looking to settle down
When you're 'round me  yeah
That's why I keep it 100  100  100
When you're 'round me  yeah
When you come around me  mm
When you come around me  yeah
Girl you keep it 100  100  100
When you're 'round me
Girl  when you come around me
I'mma keep it 100  I'm a boss chick  but he run it
No Michael Kors  just Tom Ford
Saint Tropez  I'm like bonjour
In Spain wearing that Balmain  Lanvin Givenchy
On the top floor of that penthouse  I got ten toes on that concrete
Keep it G with him  I ain't gotta lie 'bout shit
I don't need the money  I can buy my shit
Heard in the streets that he fucked that bitch
He know I'mma put his ass out my shit
Paid one million for that drop six
And he got the Glock in my cockpit
Them other chicks he get caught with
I'm the bitch he gon' rock with
They talk shit  but we bought shit
Fly Aussie on boss shit
When he need to be  where he need to be
I tell him  Go on  it ain't no thing to me
Gotta hit that thing  bring that back witcha
Let me thumb through the check if you wanna get sexy
You knew I was high-class ass when you met me!
My money tall  too bad for y'all
Y'all dough as short as Joe Pesci
I'm a fancy bitch  but I'm ratchet
Not like the bitch you had  ain't never had shit
So respect that  how I come around
No run around  you better humble down
Them games  ain't gon' play none
I keep it A1 since day one  yeah

You ain't the type of lady that's known to fuck around  mm  uh
Keep your mind on your money  and you ain't looking to settle down
When you're 'round me  yeah
That's why I keep it 100  100  100
When you're 'round me  yeah
When you come around me  mm
When you come around me  yeah
Girl you keep it 100  100  100
When you're 'round me
Girl  when you come around me
Bankrolls are us  we got it
You know how we ride
No credit  no debit  no thanks
My clique pay cash everything we buy
See me walkin' by with my nose in the sky
Make you be like  Damn bitch  can't say hi?
Then I hop in the drop and I wave goodbye
As I drive through the tunnel looking like Lady Di
Why stress myself when he not there?
Let's see how he likes seeing me out there
You know how many dudes want me out there?
Just stop thinkin' 'bout it  you got no idea
Don't try me man  you know I will
Throw this brick through your wind shield
Knife your nice new Rover Wheel
The fireplace? Your clothes in there
If I know you two in there
No askin' what you doin' there
I'mma send my crew in there
You two gon' be ruined there
You violate  I demonstrate
Especially if I'm true to you
And when I come around  I keep it 100 as usual
You ain't the type of lady that's known to fuck around  mm  uh
Keep your mind on your money  and you ain't looking to settle down
When you're 'round me  yeah
That's why I keep it 100  100  100
When you're 'round me  yeah
When you come around me  mm
When you come around me  yeah
Girl you keep it 100  100  100
When you're 'round me
Girl  when you come around me
100 as usual  100 as usual
(When I come around  I keep it 100 as usual)
(When I come around  I keep it 100 as usual)
100 as usual  100 as usual

I got twenty racks on my new jeans

I walk in and I turn up  pimp tight like I'm permed up
I heard broke bitches talkin' like they rollin' like us
Man  these bitches sound shermed up
And these bitches be mad at us 'cause these bitches so down to fuck
Claim that shit  I can bang that shit
I hope you ain't wife that bitch
Cause I know a couple homies that'll pipe that bitch
Lifestyle flashy like a Nikon pic
And your bitch chose me 'cause you walk out with
Better fo' drip  and that's a fo' sip and all my flows is slow piff
My brand right and I'm on one and these bitches don't want none
These bitches don't want none

Ayy  tell 'em run it back
AJ ruin everything  he in here
Paid for this body and none of it's cheap
I heard your song  now I'm goin' to sleep
Boys in my yard  but this ain't from Kelis
Look at my cars you  see nothin' on lease
Look  I'm showin' my cards how I play with a King
Heard they was sleepin'  I'm breakin' the dream
Closin' a deal while you makin' a meme
Superstar status  I stay in the Hills
Light hundred thousand to play in some heels
Festival season  I'm out in Brazil
Mercedes the Benz and I park on the curb
Your man wanna pitch  but I'm tossin a curve
The way that I live  you might call it absurd
I got it
All I got is these racks in my pocket
Stick my tongue out  I'm feelin' erotic
Hear my accent  he think I'm exotic
And still  I got it
Hands all over my body
Hands all up in his wallet
Baddest bitch up in the party
For real  I got it
All I got is these racks in my pocket

I'm a fantasy  you a tragedy
And I'm rich  that's some shit that you will never be
This a movie  I'm somethin' they wanna see
Had a baby  bounced back like I'm twenty-three
I had millions on millions at twenty-three
Think it's funny that someone could fuck with me
Talkin' down the whole time they look up to me
Y'all my children  I skipped out on custody
Faces is ugly  bitches is mad
I worked at a store  I still get to the bag
I'm the front page
Checkers or chess?
I got it
All I got is these racks in my pocket
Stick my tongue out  I'm feelin' erotic

If they don't got a story  I swear they gon' make it
No more questions  I ain't giving no statements
The shots I send back do not come with a chaser
Heard 'em say that I got dropped from the label
But that did not happen  please stop all that capping
My downfall  they pray on that shit like a pastor
I love all my haters  I'm being sarcastic
I left  but I'm 'bout to bounce back like elastic

Thought this was poker with the cards up  but we were bluffing
I miss you  but pride won't let me tell you
Thought that we had all the time
But I'm guessing that plans fell through
I paid twenty for that Rolly  I just want my time back
Was wrong too but I see it now that you don't give a damn
I got you tatted  you took off before the ink dried on my hands
I was down to give you the world  instead you gave me hell
I lied  tried to be perfect and I played myself
And it hurts so bad  we coulda worked on that
'Cause you say you love me  but real love don't work like that
The truth is  I left a piece of me in a piece I gave you
And I tend to laugh and crack a smile when things get painful
Said I crack a smile when things get painful
Remembering the moments when I used to da-date you
Rolex's don't tick-tock
So I need payback for all the time lost

But we live and learn and learn and love and let go
'Cause if we stay in this  then we might make it worse than before
Both of us saying it shouldn't have went like that
But sometimes in love  it just get like that
Used to think that when it went wrong we'd get right back
And for all of y'all watching  I hope that this entertain you
And that you enjoyed this song that I sang you
'Cause I'm still here laughing when it get painful
Remembering the moments when I used to da-date you
