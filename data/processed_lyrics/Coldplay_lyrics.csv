lyrics
"In a world I hadn't seen
When I'm feeling ordinary
When I don't know what I mean
Oh  I think I landed
Where there are miracles at work
For the thirst and for the hunger
Come the conference of birds
Saying it's true  it's not what it seems
Leave your broken windows open
And in the light just streams
And you get a head  a head full of dreams
You can see the change you wanted
Be what you want to be
And you get a head  a head full of dreams
Into life  I've just been spoken
With a head full  a head full of dreams
Oh  I think I landed
Where there are miracles at work
When you got me open-handed
When you got me lost for words

A head full of dreams (Oh  oh-oh-oh)
Into life  I've just been spoken (Oh-oh-oh)
I'm gonna put it six feet underground
He said  I'm gonna buy this place and watch it fall
Oh  I'm gonna buy this place and start a fire
Stand here until I fill all your heart's desires
Because I'm gonna buy this place and see it burn
And do back the things it did to you in return
Ha-ah  ha-ah
Ha-ah  ha-ah
He said  I'm gonna buy a gun and start a war
If you can tell me somethin' worth fightin' for
Blame it upon a rush of blood to the head
Honey
All the movements you've started to make
See me crumble and fall on my face
And I know the mistakes that I made
See it all disappear without trace
And they call as they beckon you on
They say start as you mean to go on
Start as you mean to go on

He said  I'm gonna buy this place and see it go
Some will laugh and some just sit and cry
But you just sit down there and you wonder why
So  I'm gonna buy a gun and start a war
If you can tell me somethin' worth fightin' for
And I'm gonna buy this place  is what I said
Blame it upon a rush of blood to the head
Honey
All the movements you've started to make
See me crumble and fall on my face
And I know the mistakes that I made
See it all disappear without trace
And they call as they beckon you on
They say start as you mean to go on
As you mean to go on
As you mean to go on
So meet me by the bridge
Oh  meet me by the lane
When am I gonna see that pretty face again?
Meet me on the road
Meet me where I said
Blame it all upon
I'm gonna give you my heart
'Cause you're a sky  'cause you're a sky full of stars
'Cause you light up the path
I don't care  go on and tear me apart
'Cause in a sky  'cause in a sky full of stars
I think I saw you ooh-ooh-ooh  ooh-ooh-ooh
'Cause you're a sky  'cause you're a sky full of stars

Stood on a bridge  tied to a noose
Sick to the stomach

Stood on the edge  tied to the noose

Two angles of the same view

Saw the lights go down and standing in front of me
Ooh-ooh-ooh

So she ran away in her sleep
And dreamed of para-  para-  paradise
Para-  para-  paradise
Para-  para-  paradise
Every time she closed her eyes
Ooh-ooh-ooh  ooh-ooh-ooh  ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh  ooh-ooh-ooh  ooh-ooh-ooh
When she was just a girl
She expected the world
But it flew away from her reach
And the bullets catch in her teeth

Life goes on  it gets so heavy
The wheel breaks the butterfly
Every tear  a waterfall
In the night  the stormy night  she'd close her eyes
In the night  the stormy night  away she'd fly
And dream of para-  para-  paradise
Para-  para-  paradise
Para-  para-  paradise
She'd dream of para-  para-  paradise
Para-  para-  paradise
Para-  para-  paradise
La  la-la  la-la-la
La  la-la  la-la-la
So lying underneath those stormy skies
This could be para-  para-  paradise
Para-  para-  paradise
This could be para-  para-  paradise
This could be para-  para-paradise
Para-  para-  paradise
This could be para-  para-  paradise

Give me time and give me space
Give me heart and give me soul
Tell me your own politik

Open up your eyes
Open up your eyes

Don't forget the rest of us
Give me heart and give me soul
Wounds that heal and cracks that fix
Tell me your own politik

Pullin' your puzzles apart

And I lost my head
And thought of all the stupid things I'd said
Oh no  what's this?
A spiderweb  and I'm caught in the middle

Down upon the canvas  workin' meal to meal
Waitin' for a chance to pick your orange field
Up and up  up and up
See a pearl form  a diamond in the rough
See a bird soaring high above the flood

Underneath the storm an umbrella is saying
Sitting with the poison takes away the pain

Trying to empty out the ocean with a spoon

 white snow
 they were watchin'
 oh
Seas would rise when I gave the word
Sweep the streets I used to own
I used to roll the dice
Feel the fear in my enemy's eyes
Listen as the crowd would sing
And I discovered that my castles stand
Upon pillars of salt and pillars of sand
I hear Jerusalem bells a-ringin'
Roman cavalry choirs are singin'
My missionaries in a foreign field
Never an honest word
And that was when I ruled the world

Look how they shine for you

I wrote a song for you
And all the things you do
And it was called Yellow
So then I took my turn
And it was all yellow

I swam across
I jumped across for you
'Cause you were all yellow
I drew a line
I drew a line for you
