"Hunt you down  eat you alive
Maybe you think that you can hide
I can smell your scent from miles
Baby  I'm...
So what you trying to do to me
It's like we can't stop  we're enemies
But we get along when I'm inside you
You're like a drug that's killing me
I cut you out entirely
But I get so high when I'm inside you
You can find other fish in the sea
You can pretend it's meant to be
But you can't stay away from me
I can still hear you making that sound
Taking me down  rolling on the ground

Baby  I'm preying on you tonight
Hunt you down  eat you alive
Maybe you think that you can hide
I can smell your scent from miles
Baby  I'm...
So if I run  it's not enough
You're still in my head  forever stuck
So you can do what you wanna do
I love your lies  I'll eat 'em up
But don't deny the animal
That comes alive when I'm inside you
You can find other fish in the sea
You can pretend it's meant to be
But you can't stay away from me
I can still hear you making that sound
Taking me down  rolling on the ground
Baby  I'm preying on you tonight
Hunt you down  eat you alive
Maybe you think that you can hide
I can smell your scent from miles
Baby  I'm...
You can't deny-ny-ny-ny
The beast inside  si-si-side
You can't deny-ny-ny-ny (You can't deny)
The beast inside  si-si-side
This a gift from the Gods  this was meant to be
But in time you gon' find you was meant for me
You a part of me and I'm a part of you
I'm addicted  one hit won't do I need a lot of you
Overdosing  your potion has got me floating on cloud nine
Tell me what I'm supposed to do when I run out of you  I'm through
I need a fix like d-boys need bricks
And plus whips to transport 'em
One more time together
I hope your new man don't mind  girl you're mine forever
Oww!
Baby  I'm preying on you tonight
Hunt you down  eat you alive
Maybe you think that you can hide
I can smell your scent from miles
Baby  I'm...
You can't deny-ny-ny-ny
The beast inside  si-si-side
You can't deny-ny-ny-ny (You can't deny)
The beast inside  si-si-side
Hunt you down  eat you alive
Just like animals  animals
Like animals-mals
Maybe you think that you can hide
I can smell your scent for miles
Just like animals  animals

I'm only hoping I don't waste  I don't waste
All of my love  all of my love

Asking me for space here in my house

The things we said and did have left permanent scars
Obsessed  depressed at the same time
I can't even walk in a straight line
I've been lyin' in the dark  no sunshine
No sunshine

Struggle to memorize
The way it felt between your thighs
Pleasure that made you cry
It feels so good to be bad
Try to get you back
I still don't have a reason
And you don't have the time
And it really makes me wonder if I ever gave a fuck about you
Give me somethin' to believe in
'Cause I don't believe in you anymore  anymore
I wonder if it even makes a difference to try
Yeah  so this is goodbye
God damn my spinnin' head
Decisions that made my bed
Now I must lay in it
And deal with things I've left unsaid
I want to dive into you
Forget what you're goin' through

(Oh no) Yeah  so this is goodbye
I miss the conversation
I'm searching for a song tonight
I'm changing all of the stations
I like to think that we had it all
We drew a map to a better place
I was there for you in your darkest times
I was there for you in your darkest night
And you said you had my back
When all the roads you took came back to me
So I'm following the map that leads to you
The map that leads to you
Ain't nothing I can do

Dysfunction between you and me
We must free up these tired souls
Before the sadness kills us both
I tried and tried to let you know
Just don't know
Still afraid that I will desert you

With every worthless word
We get more far away
The distance between us makes it so hard to stay
But nothing lasts forever
A bed that's warm with memories
Can heal us temporarily
But misbehaving only makes
The ditch between us so damn deep
Built a wall around my heart
Never let it fall apart
It would fall down while I'm asleep

The chaos that controlled my mind
Whispered goodbye as she got on a plane
Never to return again
This love has taken its toll on me
She said goodbye too many times before
And her heart is breaking in front of me
And I have no choice
'Cause I won't say goodbye anymore
I tried my best to feed her appetite
Keep her coming every night
Kept playing love like it was just a game
Pretending to feel the same
Then turn around and leave again
But I know

This summer's gonna hurt like a motherfucker  fucker
Her body's hot
Her body's like the summer
I'm in a trance or something
Her mind is not  no
As sharp as all her diamonds
She must be smoking something
I see her dancing in the streets
Sipping champagne on the beach
So expensive when she eats
'Cause she's so fancy
I see her when I go to sleep
I check my phone when I am weak
She never posts anything deep
'Cause she's so fancy
This summer's gonna hurt like a motherfucker  fucker

She wants it all
She's always taking something
And now I'm left with nothing
I'm ripping off  oh
I'm ripping off that bandage
Because I just can't stand it
I see her dancing on a fool
Like she's seventeen and cool
She really thinks that she can move
But it's just nasty
I see her when I go to sleep
I check my phone when I am weak

You can tell me  I can handle it
Stop pretending  'cause we're going down
If you let go  then just let go
It's disrespectful how you've handled this
Never ending  kinda run around
I lied to my heart  'cause I thought you felt it
You can't light a fire if the candle's melted
No  you don't have to love me if you don't wanna
Don't act like I mean nothing  but if you're gonna
Well  then you better
Un-kiss me  un-touch me
Un-take this heart
And I'm missing just one thing
A brand new start
Can't erase this  can't delete this
I don't need this  I can't handle it
I just feel it that you're over us
It won't matter  what's the point of this?

The night came in  it made her shiver
I told her she could have my jacket
Wrapped it tight around her shoulders
And I was so young 'til she kissed me
Like a whiskey  like a whiskey
I never knew that love was blind
'Til I was hers  but she was never mine
Yeah  I was reckless
The feelin'  it was bittersweet
Realizin' I was in too deep
She was a lesson
I used to try to forget her
But now I smile when I remember
Ooh
Leaves are fallin' in September
The night came in  it made her shiver
I told her she could have my jacket
Wrapped it tight around her shoulders
And I was so young 'til she kissed me
Like a whiskey  like a whiskey

Would've left this world behind
Just to wake up by your side
Every mornin'  I would've sold my soul for a lil' more time
Would've waited a thousand nights
If she never said goodbye
I admit that I
Would've sold my soul for a little more time
Ooh
I used to try to forget her
But now I smile when I remember
Leaves are fallin'  it's September
The night came in  it made her shiver
I told her she could have my jacket
Wrapped it tight around her shoulders
And I was so young 'til she kissed me
Like a whiskey  like a whiskey
I ain't like the other Cognacs
Or type of cat that'd never call back
Or lose contact when you runnin' out of rum and you make a run
(Feelin' light and dizzy  might be tipsy)
All of that tequila's a killer  little vodka
Break her off somethin' proper
Pop a cork and play spin the bottle
(Every time you kiss me  like some whiskey)
Punch drunk love  it's a fine line
Dom Pérignon  she the fine wine
Someone call 911  I'm runnin' out of time
She done got off with my heart
Leaves are fallin'  it's September (oh)

See this one goes out to all the lovers
Lovers' lovers that is
Who spend their nights and days under covers
Aw  yeah
No  don't ask me if I love you
'Cause I'm sure as the night is long
And don't ask me if I need you
'Cause I'm sure that the time will come
I shouldn't have to say it for you to understand
'Cause you already got me in the palm of your hand
Just wait a couple lifetimes and ask me again

I ain't got no wings  but you got me floating on a cloud
Looking down  it's emotion
Champagne flutes  everybody toasting
Heart beat fast on this roller coaster
Love you up and down  spin you 'round and 'round
Can you hear me now?

But she wouldn't listen
The words that would mend
The things that were broken
Why does every moment have to be so hard?
Hard to believe that
It's not over tonight
Just give me one more chance to make it right
I may not make it through the night
I won't go home without you
The taste of her breath
I'll never get over
The weight of the things
That remained unspoken
