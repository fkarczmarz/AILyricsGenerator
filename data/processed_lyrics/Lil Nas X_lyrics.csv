lyrics
"As I'm sinkin'  I relive the story
As I'm sinkin'  I relive the story
Oh  never forget me
And everything I've done
Oh  never forget me
Like I'm your favorite song
I'm fadin'  replayin'
These thoughts I thought while sinkin' down
Oh  never forget me
And evеrything I've done
As I'm sinkin'  I relive the story
As I'm singin'  I rewrite my story
Oh  never forget me
And everything I've done
Oh  never forget me
Like I'm your favorite song
I'm fadin' (Fadin')  replayin' (Mm)
These thoughts I thought while sinkin' down
Oh  never forget me
Yeah  aight
I feel like layin' some pipe
G-Give me some pink hole that's ripe
Don't be pissed or polite
Give me a hell of a night
Don't call me baby  you'll call me your daddy tonight
'Cause I know it  you hit the scene for somebody you can hoe with
Y'know a nigga like me on his race shit
But  aight shit
Please say you want me bad
Won't you come next to me
I know you must not hear my lies
Come get the rest of me
Nah-nah-nah  no

Give you what you want
Give you  give you what you want
You will never get to cuff me
I'm too good at breakin' laws
Party with the pussycat  I'm lookin' like a doll
I'm a different kind of Pedigree when dealin' with a dog
Tell me what you like
Tell me  tell me what you like
Everyday I get a message of you beggin' me to slide
Thirsty in my presence  but I guess that's no surprise
Please say you want me bad
Won't you come next to me
I know you must not hear my lies
Come get the rest of me
Nah-nah-nah  no
Nah-nah  nah-nah

Oh  I'm sorry
I might end up taking you home
I'm sorry
Pour that shit up  Trvpyyy
When I get some wins  I'm complacent
Might blow up go buy a new place and
Right now  I still live with my mom and my dad
But I’ll skeet on your face in that basement
See  I fuck with crackers and Haitians
I'm rapping  they say he gon' make it
I really think ain’t no more rules to this rap shit
I really think Josh could be Drake'ing
They thinkin' that I got hella' guap
Did you love me 'fore I got it? Not
Gucci on my socks  it's too cold  I can't take it off
I see hella people watching me because they envy a nigga
Moving up  I got my old friends acting friendlier
Run up them bands up  run up them bands up
(Run me my paper)
Run up them bands up  run up them bands up
(No time for haters)
Run up them bands up  run up them bands up
(I told my neighbors)
Run up them bands up (Can you pardon that water vapor?)

Lotta niggas on  trashy songs
They won’t last too long
'18 set me up for '19
It's gon' be a killer year

To let go  use my time to be free
It's like it's always what you like
It's always what you like
Why it's always what you like?

I only see you in your halo
I was hopin' we could stay close
But we no longer sing the same notes
I rеmember when I mеt you
Thought the universe sent you
Thought you were someone I could vent to
So I hit your line  what you getting into?
I need time to get up and get off the floor
I need time to realize that I can't be yours
I need time to give up just like before
I love it how you know I'd only come right back for more

Are you happy  do your dreams still seem inbound?
Tell me  are we finished now?

To let you know that all in all  it ain't all what it seems
I feel like I've hit a low
One I've never hit before
Lately  I've been feeling small as the salt in the sea
Oh  it's so much to do in so little of time

It seems so out of reach
The place I want to be
Whoever thought I'd get there anyway?

I'd rather die than to live with these feelings
Stuck in this world where there's so much to prove
Every win gives you more room to lose
It's too many ups and downs on the ride
I spent inordinate 'mounts of time
Trapped in a lonely  loner life
Looking for love where I'm denied
I find it hard to get
Way too hard to live
Tell me what you know
Now before I go
To say I'm gonna run away from home
But today  I'm gonna run away from home
Away from home
Oh  oh
Today  I'm gonna run away
Na-na-na-na-na
This door in my home
Ain't ever gon' let me grow
She won't close now  honestly
She's slowin' me down and it seems
This river of gold
Ain't ever gon' let me flow
These aimless rides on a boat
Have brought my tries to a halt
So can we keep it going  keep it going?
'Cause I miss the moments when the mornings
Dawned on me
And I could see
So where do we go now?
We've seen everything we had to see
We figured it out  my love
So where are we goin'?
So where do we go now?
We did everything so endlessly
And only to feel undone
So where are we goin'?
