"You're full of the stuff
Go back and tie up tight
High on life  you should try it
You should know (You should know  you should know)
Go on while no one's looking
A-ha! Caught you now! (Caught you now)
Caught you red handed in the biscuit tin!
Cost you to keep me quiet
La la la la  la la la la
La la la la  la la la la
La la la la  la la la la
La la la la la
Golden boy boots
Pocket pedestal
Making sharp  smart moves
Busy bee wave  wave 'Save The Planet' flag
But sneaky in suburbia

A-ha! Candid camera!
Hook the line and sinker
For a four-wheel drive
Cost you to keep me quiet!
Keep me quiet! (keep me quiet)
It's so charming  very charming
Well  reckon play the fool
No one's ill at ease
And put their deepest Swiss bank trust in you
No one saw it coming
Cost you to keep me quiet
La la la la  la la la la
La la la la  la la la la

 no escape from reality
 look up to the skies and see
 I need no sympathy
 to me
 just killed a man
 life had just begun
 ooh (any way the wind blows)
 my time has come
 body's aching all the time
 ooh (any way the wind blows)
 Galileo figaro magnifico
 nobody loves me
 we will not let you go
 just gotta get right out of here!
 anyone can see
 and nothing can stop us now!
 what it isn’t
 little bit of cautious
Tell me  have I lost my mind?
Am I just afraid of loving?
Or am I not the loving kind?
Kissing in the moonlight  movies on a late night
Getting old

Supposed to be hot but it's just cold
Somebody wake up my heart  light me up
Set fire to my soul  yeah

Sit with me on a muddy clump
We'll sing a song of days gone by
Run along now  don’t be glum
Don't be long  for the end is nigh
Don't let moments pass along
And waste before your eyes 
March with me and the borogoves
Come with me and the slithy toves
And never ask us why
Run away from the hum-drum
We'll go to a place that is safe from
Greed  anger and boredom
We'll dance and sing till sundown
And feast with abandon
We'll sleep when the morning comes
And we'll rise by the sound of the birdsongs
We'll be here when the world slows down
And the sunbeams fade away
Keeping time by a pendulum
As the fabric starts to fray
There’s no such thing as time to kill
Nor time to throw away

Cuddle up with a hesitant skeleton

Once we're fed  we shall disappear rapidly
Many moons to the west of here and happily
Our journey never ends
Shut your ears when sirens sing
Tie armbands to your feet 
Listen up and you won't go wrong again
Float along on a verse-less song and then
Get to where the two ends meet

You lift my heart up when the rest of me is down
You  you enchant me even when you're not around
If there are boundaries  I will try to knock them down
Hush  don't speak
When you spit your venom  keep it shut  I hate it
When you hiss and preach
About your new messiah 'cause your theories catch fire
I can't find your silver lining
I don't mean to judge
But when you read your speech  it's tiring
Enough is enough
I'm covering my ears like a kid
When your words mean nothing I go la la la
I'm turning up the volume when you speak

I'm so encaptured  got me wrapped up in your touch
Feel so enamored  hold me tight within your clutch
How do you do it? You got me losing every breath
What did you give me to make my heart beat out my chest?
Now  I've got you in my space
I won't let go of you
Got you shackled in my embrace
I'm latching on to you (never let go  I won't let go)
I feel we're close enough
I can't find your silver lining
I wanna lock in your love

Now it's time to sleep
May you find great adventure
As you lie and dream
If you're scared of the darkness
I will calm your fear
There's a light in the hallway
So you know I'm here
So count your blessings every day
It makes the monsters go away
And everything will be okay
You are not alone
You are right at home
Goodnight  goodnight
You won't need me forever
But I'll still be here
For we all have our nightmares
Even me  my dear
From now on  if you need me
You can sing this song
There's a light in the hallway
Burning all night long

Thank you for your smile

Is sweeter than a choir

The right words to choose

I've come to talk with you again
Because a vision softly creeping
Left its seeds while I was sleeping
And the vision that was planted in my brain still remains
Within the sound of silence
In restless streams I walked alone
Narrow streets of cobblestone
Beneath the halo of a streetlamp
I turn my collar to the cold and damp
When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light
That split the night
And touched the sound of silence
And in the naked light I saw
10 000 people maybe more
People talking without speaking
People hearing without listening
People writing songs that voices never share
And no one dare disturb the sound of silence
Of silence
Of silence

Silence like a cancer grows
Hear my words that I might teach you
Take my arms that I might reach you
But my words  like silent raindrops fell
And echoed in the wells of silence
And the people bowed and prayed
To the neon god they made
And the sign flashed out its warning
In the words that it was forming
And the sign said:
The words of the prophets are
Written on the subway walls
And tenement halls
If I showed you all I really want to
Would you stay  dare push me away
I just can't pretend anymore

Make me stronger (ooohhh)

And so I pray I don't drive you away
