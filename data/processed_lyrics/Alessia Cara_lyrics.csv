lyrics
" curled up on his couch right now?
 does he turn down the sound?
 don't turn away from your screen
 Mr. Man Upstairs
 way up there
 the land of poor taste
 please say it was worth the seven days
 maybe he's upset by the loose ends
 it happens to the best of us
 or is it Mr. G to me?
 you’ll show us the clarity
 but don't turn away from your screen
 Mr. Man Upstairs
 way up there
 the land of poor taste
 please say it was worth the seven days
 we'll be back in a moment
 we are just coping
 but it ain't showbiz
 have some hope in us
 Mr. Man Upstairs
 way up there
 the land of poor taste
 please say it was worth the seven days
You played in a marching band
I can't help but wish I knew you then
But I guess I know you now
It looks as if I've stumbled right into the palm of your hand
I'm sorry that I've been emotions galore
Am I crazy for wanting a little bit more?
A little more of you
This feeling's hard to ignore
Please say you'll never get bored
Can you blame me for wanting a little bit more?
A little more of you
Say that it's the same
Take a drill right to my brain
Oh the way you did just yesterday
I guess I get it now

It looks as if I've stumbled right into the palm of your hand
I'm sorry that I've been emotions galore
Am I crazy for wanting a little bit more?
A little more of you
This feeling's hard to ignore
Please say you'll never get bored
Can you blame me for wanting a little bit more?
A little more of you
(A little more of you)
A little more of you
And Oz was just a lonely man
It’s so damn hard to believe in anything again
Wise is the optimist
But truth is I don't understand
Haven't figured out much of anything
But strange world
’Round and 'round and 'round it goes
Heroes fall like dominoes
All we know is that we don't
'Round and 'round and 'round we go
And it’s all out of our control
All we know is that we don’t
Is this all there is?
Preachers and rocket ships
Have never quite made any sense of it yet

With yourself at twenty-somethin'
Wish I knew what I'm becomin'
And felt the ground while I was on it
What if my best days are the days I've left behind?
And what if the rest stays the same for all my life?
You live and then you die
But the hardest pill to swallow is the meantime
Are the best days just the ones that we survive?
If I'd known to fuеl the fire (Fire)
I would'vе thrown my arms up higher (Higher)
Woulda held on a little tighter

To give your heart a song to sing
I wish you love (I wish)
Bluebird in the spring
Told me that your new girl makes you sing
Guess my loving only clipped your wings
Tear up on the beach to Viva La Vida like Frida
Bluebird in the spring
Told me that your new girl makes you sing
Guess my loving only clipped your wings
I'll write you a song I'll never send ya
I don't wanna disrespect ya
She'll be what you waited for

I don't think I could live up to the mother that my mother was
If I always just feel so unprepared
I might be too weak to fall in love
And I might be too much for everyone
All these explosive emotions I'm holdin'

What happens to a love that's not new?
What happens when I'm no longer impressive?
Or when there's nothing left to learn about you?
What it would be like to love you
Now I've seen every hole in your heart
I'm used to loving slowly
I hope you like all the broken parts
Oh it's time we make way for the comfortable
They say the honeymoon is just a puppet show (Puppet show)
They say nobody really makes it through (Makes it through)
And though a part of me wishes that this was two July's ago
The rest of me is safer here with you

But now I know you inside and out
I'm used to loving slowly
But it took you nothing to know me
What happens when I run out of parts? Yeah
It turns out you think my favorite song's annoying
Turns out no one makes me sensitive like you
I used to be sad that the honeymoon's behind us
Until I realized that it means we made it through
'Cause it's already comfortable (It's already comfortable)
Open up  you know you look prettier when you smile
Look around  it's a decent life
You feel too much  pick up your feet and make use of your time
They sure know how to talk up a storm
Rain down on your pity parade
Trying to find the cure
Bask in your distress a little bit more
’Cause a sad face don't go away that easy
Healing and patience are lovers
Don't place the blame on your heart just to shut ’em up
There ain't a rush to recover
'Cause it's easier said  it's easier said than
Healing and patience are lovers
Don't place the blame on your heart just to make 'em stop
Just take your time to recover
'Cause it’s easier said  it’s easier said than done

Man up  crawl your way up off the ground

So what if you're a bit bitter before you recharge?
I mean  I spend my days complaining to a guitar
Remember  everyone is coping with their own scars
And just a little bit of time can get you so far  yeah
Healing and patience are lovers
There ain't a rush to recover

Staring up at the ceiling watching particles fall
See I prayed every day for a change to be made
Shut my eyes and let the bass buzz into my brain
See I knew I was destined for bigger and better but never said a thing
I assumed there was only room for
My dreams in my dreams so I'd sleep and repeat 'til the moon went home
And I didn't know where it'd take me but made me so crazy in love with it
Then the universe aligned
With what I had in mind
Who knew there was a life
Behind those four pink walls?
Now I wake up to a different bedroom everyday
Living up in the clouds thinking of how it all changed
Used to sit and watch paint dry
Amazed by the limelight
I can't ever be afraid

Who knew there was a life behind those four pink walls?
With what I wanted all this time
I knew there was a life
Behind those four pink walls
All of the days that I wasted gazing outside the window
Impatient frustrations let out into my pillow
Lied awake at night while my head wandered
And I wondered why
Things weren't different
Everything shifted overnight
Went from when boredom strikes to Ms. Star on the Rise
Then the universe aligned
With what I wanted all this time
I knew there was a life
Behind those four pink walls
 yeah
 I can think too much
 no
 no
I make my bed to lay in it again
Don’t know who to trust
And no time of the month can justify this
Blame it on the growing pains
Just blame it on the growing pains
Blame it on the growing pains
Or blame it on me?
Blame it on the growing pains
Just blame it on the growing pains
Blame it on the growing pains  yeah
Or blame it on me?
Just blame it on me?
You are
Make my way through the motions  I try to ignore it
But home's looking farther the closer I get
Don't know why I can't see the end
Is it over yet? Hmm
A short leash and a short fuse don't match
So I just hold my breath
Don't know why I can't see the sun when young should be fun (Fun)
And I guess the bad can get better
Gotta be wrong before it's right
Every happy phrase engraved in my mind
And I've always been a go-getter
There's truth in every word I write
They're keeping me up at night
And I can't hide 'cause growing pains are keeping me up at night

Starting to look like Ms. Know-It-All can't take her own advice
Can't find pieces of my peace of mind
I cry more than I want to admit
But I can't lie to myself  to anyone
'Cause phoning it in isn't any fun
Can't run back to my youth the way I want to
The days my brother was quicker to fool
AM radio  not much to do
Used monsters as an excuse to lie awake
Now the monsters are the ones that I have to face
Or I'm not listenin'  or I'm indifferent
Truly  I ain't got no business here
But  really I would rather be at home all by myself
Not in this room with people who don't even care about my well-being
I'll be here somewhere in the corner
Under clouds of marijuana  with this boy who's hollerin'
I can hardly hear
Over this music I don't listen to and I don't wanna get with you
So  tell my friends that I'll be over here
Oh-oh-oh here  oh-oh-oh here
Oh-oh-oh I ask myself  what am I doin' here?
Oh-oh-oh here  oh here
And I can't wait 'til we can break up out—
Excuse me if I seem a little unimpressed with this
An anti-social pessimist  but usually I don't mess with this
And I know you mean only the best
Somewhere with my people  we can kick it and just listen to
Some music with a message  like we usually do
And we'll discuss our big dreams  how we plan to take over the planet
Not there in the kitchen
With the girl who's always gossipin' about her friends
So  tell them I'll be here
Right next to the boy who's throwin' up
'Cause he can't take what's in his cup no more

Some girl talkin' 'bout her haters  she ain't got none
How did it ever come to this? I shoulda never come to this
So holla at me  I'll be in the car when you're done
I'm stand-offish  don't want what you're offerin'
And I'm done talkin'  awfully sad it had to be that way
So tell my people when they're ready that I'm ready
And I'm standin' by the TV with my beanie low
Yo  I'll be over here

 I ain't got no business here
 I just came to kick it
 I would rather be at home all by myself
 who don't even care about my well-being
 whip out the phone for the Instagram flex
 click
 it's no flex
 I give 'em what's next
 I sit in the cut in the club
 oh-oh-oh here

At the bottom with killers and dealers
Now they say that diamonds forever but never explain
That the diamonds fillin' up your safe cannot fill up the pain
I hope you'll understand that I'll be here
And I can't wait 'til we can break up out of here
Hours later congregatin' next to the refrigerator

 never really knowing why
 no matter how hard I try
 every trail I track
 every road leads back
 where I cannot go
 everything is by design
 I can make us strong
 how deep it goes
 so come find me
 will I cross that line?
 how far it goes
 how far I'll go
Looking for something new
Stuck in my ways like old-fashioned days
But all the roads led me to you
The house that you live in don't make it a home
But feeling lonely don't mean you're alone
But if I had a choice I know where I would be
When the sky turns to grey and there's nothing to say
Now I found the strength to make a change
And look at the magic I found
No matter the name or where you came from
'Cause no one has much figured out
The house that you live in don't make it a home
But feeling lonely don't mean you're alone
I finally found where I feel I belong
And I know you'll be there with wide open arms

Who would have ever thought I'd have to erase it? Uh
Every little thing is reminding me of you
I don't want to let it show  but I still love you
And how do I let you know if I can't call you?
And I don't want to be alone another night
I don't want to feel this blue
How do I let you go if I don't want to?
I double take at every phone that rings out of habit
I can't shake the little things  they're harder to manage  woah
I can't bury the past  but I'll bury the hatchet
Can we just pretend that this never happened? Yeah
Every little thing is reminding me of you

You'll never ever fade
You're lovely  but it's not for sure
That I won't ever change
And though my love is rare
Though my love is true  woah-oh
I'm like a bird  I'll only fly away

To break up my lonely
And tell me you want me
How dare you march into my heart
To ruin my miserable
And tell me I'm beautiful
Nobody asked you to get me attached to you
So all that I'm asking
Is that you handle me with caution
'Cause I don't give myself often
But I guess I'll try today
'Cause I've had my heart broken before
And I promised I would never let me hurt anymore
But I tore down my walls
And opened my doors
And made room for one
But I tore down my walls

To melt this heart of iron
But the way you hold me makes the old me pass away
And I would be lyin'
If I said I wasn't scared to fall again
But if you promise me you'll catch me
Then it's okay
'Cause I've had my heart broken before

Spend my days just wasting time (Yeah)
Daydreaming till I see you again (Yeah)
I'm not used to this (Yeah)
For you to be you to me (Yeah)
Feels new to me (Yeah)
'Cause I usually cheer for the bad side
Love under a bad sign
So it makes me mad I'm falling again
Falling again
But I tore down my walls
And opened my doors
And made room for one
But I tore down my walls
And opened my doors
And made room for one

Once upon a time
Can we wait a minute?
Or can we just try to try?

It's just something 'bout the snow this time of year

Don't have me spending it alone

Playing with Troll dolls to scare the kids away
I wish we told those little girls they're gonna be okay
Still picture it all in my mind
Making a campfire out of broken flashlights
Jealous of your high tops 'cause someone stole mine
Wish somebody would've told me that we'd be alright
My kind of time's meant to carelessly spend
And my kind of nights are the ones that don't end
My kind of fun doesn't make any sense
My kind of time's meant to carelessly spend
And my kind of nights are the ones that don't end
My kind of fun doesn't make any sense
Do you remember all the cartoons at midnight?
Like the one about the crass-humoured French guy
And what about all that we built in just a couple weeks?
Talkin' 'bout all of our fears through a cracked screen
Picking little fights over falling asleep
I wish you knew I loved you when you knew you loved me
Really wish I knew you sooner than my 20s

Who's gonna beat this level?
I speed up  you slow down
Looks like I'm on your tail now
Another round  do we give up?
This is taking longer than Zelda
Hold on  what I meant was
Is it too late to get a 1-up?
I don't have the training
So we should stop playing
Push and shove  go 'head and take your aim
We better duck 'cause right now nobody's safe
And we could grow up  but it's no fun that way
And so we treat love like it's a Nintendo game
But nobody wins
Nobody wins
Nobody  nobody wins
But no-  but the game goes on

Someday I will not be chained to my bed
Someday I’ll forget the day he left
But surely not today
One day I won't need a PhD
To sit me down and tell me what it all means
'Til you're too sad to fall asleep
One day I'll be snoozing peacefully
One day I'll swear the pain will be a blip
I'll have the hardest time recalling it
I'll be the king of misery management

My view with a looking glass won’t catch the past
Only photographs remind us of the passing of days
Oh nothing stays the same from yesteryears

And holding on to teddy bears
I’d wrap myself in blankets just to cover me from fears
That was then and now I’m here
And the night is mine
So hear me scream
I was too young to understand what it means
I couldn’t wait 'til I could be seventeen
I thought he lied when he said take my time to dream
Now I wish I could freeze the time at seventeen

It's been my story  It's never switched up
And I never kissed up
So fuck the world then I got my dick sucked
Try and say I'm too wild
Did my own thing so fuck the cool crowd
Late nights with the music too loud
I made it this far  now ma's just too proud
So if you don't like me
I was raised in the land of hyphy
World looked different as far as I see
I'm doing me  don't mind me
Only one time I'mma tell you kindly
Please fuck off  I don't need you by me
But if you search then you know where to find me
Eazy
I lose my balance on these eggshells
You tell me to tread  I'd rather be a wild one instead
Don't wanna hang around the in crowd
The cool kids aren't cool to me
They're not cooler than we are
So aye  we brought our drum and this is how we dance
Then leave us alone  cause we don't need your policies
We have no apologies for being...
Find me where the wild things are
Oh my  we'll be alright
Don't mind us  yeah
Find me where the wild things are
Oh my  we'll be just fine
Aye-aye-aye don't mind us
We will carve our place into time and space
Find you're great  don't you hide your face
So aye  we brought our drum and this is how we dance
Then leave us alone  cause we don't need your policies
We have no apologies for being...
Find me where the wild things are
Oh my  we'll be alright
Don't mind us  yeah
Find me where the wild things are
Oh my  we'll be just fine
Don't mind us  yeah
Say your social graces
We make our own rules
Let 'em sell what they are sellin'
There are no buyers here
So gather all the rebels now
We'll rebel rouse and sing aloud
And we will leave the empty chairs
To those who say we can't sit there
We're fine all by ourselves
We have no apologies for being...
Find me where the wild things are
Find me where the wild things are
Find me where the wild things are

Can't run free if I keep looking back
It's a storm but gotta face it
I love you but you let me down
I love you but you let me down
The last time for an eternity
You're only mine when I am on my feet
You're elusive and it kills me
I love you but you let me down
I love you but you let me down
And I'll go as fast as I can
No time for a moment to myself
And I'll go as fast as I can
I swear on my life it's for the best

And I might call you on your birthday
Cover words I wanted to say
I love you but you let me down
I love you but you let me down
And I'll go as fast as I can
No time for a moment to myself
And I'll go as fast as I can
I swear on my life it's for the best
Though our moments kept us waiting
I never meant to let you down"
