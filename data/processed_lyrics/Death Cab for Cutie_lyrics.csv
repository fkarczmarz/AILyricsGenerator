lyrics
"It's nothing funny how you're spending your days
But you're laughing like a kid at a carnival
I watched you stumbling around this dusty town
I heard your bottle talking way too loud
As the Federales tried to hunt you down
For something you can't remember what was about
The curtain falls to applause
He's a superhero growing bored
With no one to save anymore
I used to watch you on the late night scene
The timely rescue of a metal teen
Six strings were strumming rhythm and lead
And that hadn't occurred to me
When I met you I was 22
Trying so hard to play it cool
But there was so much that I needed to say
And nothing came out the right way
The curtain falls to applause
He's a superhero growing bored
With no one to save anymore
The curtain falls to applause
He's a superhero growing bored
With no one to save anymore

There's nothing elegant in being a drunk
It's nothing righteous being 60 and a punk
But when you're looking in the mirror do you see
That kid that you used to be?
Broke and working in a record store
Daydreaming about the upcoming tour
Were you happier when you were poor?
Were you happier when you were poor?
The curtain falls to applause
He's a superhero growing bored
With no one to save anymore
The curtain falls to applause
He's a superhero growing bored
But my brain knows better  it picks you up and turns you around
Turns you around  turns you around
If you feel discouraged that there's a lack of color here
From absorbing everything  the spectrums A to Z
Ah-ah  ah-ah
And all the girls in every girly magazine can't make me feel
Any less alone  I'm reaching for the phone
To call at 7:03
And on your machine I slur a plea for you to come home
But I know it's too late
And I should have given you a reason to stay
Given you a reason to stay
Given you a reason to stay
Given you a reason to stay

The air on Railroad is making the same sounds
And the shop fronts on Holly are dirty words
Asterisks in for the vowels
We peered through the windows
With prices inflating
Inflating
As if saved from the gallows
There's a bellow of buzzers
And people stop working
Passing through unconscious states
With your hands on my shoulders
And the patrons are leaving
Leaving

Passing through unconscious states
Just shuffling the sheets to toss and turn
You can't begin to get it back
Passing through unconscious states
The onset of a later stage
The headlights are beacons on
Just leave me floating on the open ocean
Let the moonlight take me anywhere on a tidal flow
'Cause I've been feeling too invincible
I need to know depths deeper than the deepest of connections
Oh oh oh oh oh
This autumn love
Oh oh oh oh oh
Is not enough
If there's no beacon tonight to guide me
I'll finally break the shackles of direction
And let the headlights lead me anywhere that they wanna go
I feel at home now out on a bough
In the lattice of the backbone
Where the highways are holding in the pieces of our broken hearts
Oh oh oh oh oh
This autumn love
Oh oh oh oh oh
Is not enough

The one he used to hold before
But the weight it brought him to the floor
As you watched him struggle to his feet
You took photos capturing his defeat
And messaged them to all your friends
And we all laughed at his expense
Oh come my love and swim with me
Out in this vast Binary Sea
Zeros and ones patterns appear
They'll prove to all that we were here
For if there is no document
We cannot build our monument
So look into the lens and
I'll make sure this moment never dies
Oh Atlas could not stay engaged
Was more distracted every day
You slowly fell into disarray
Just trying to think of something to say
For if there is no document
There cannot be a monument
So lean in close or lend an ear
Beneath the Bixby Canyon Bridge
Until I eventually arrived
At the place where your soul had died
And barefoot in the shallow creek
I grabbed some stones from underneath
And waited for you to speak to me
That you had long ago disappeared
I cursed myself for being surprised
That this didn't play like it did in my mind
All the way from San Francisco
As I chased the end of your road
'Cause I've still got miles to go
And I want to know my fate
If I keep up this way
And it's hard to want to stay
Awake
When everyone you meet
They all seem to be asleep
And you wonder if you're missing your dream

I trudged back to where the car was parked
No closer to any kind of truth
And there is death upon the vine
There is fear in the eyes of your father
And there is yours and there is mine
There is a desert veiled in pavement
And there's a city of seven hills
All our debris flows to the ocean
How could something so fair be so cruel
When this black sun revolved around you?
There is an answer in a question
And there is hope within despair
And there is beauty in a failure
And there are depths beyond compare
There is a role of a lifetime
And there's a song yet to be sung
And there's a dumpster in the driveway
Of all the plans that came undone
How could something so fair be so cruel
When this black sun revolved around you?

'Cause I'm not who I used to be
No longer easy on the eyes
But these wrinkles masterfully disguise the youthful boy below
Who turned your way and saw something he was not looking for
Both a beginning and an end
But now he lives inside someone he does not recognize
When he catches his reflection on accident
On the back of a motorbike
In the city where we still reside
And I have learned that even landlocked lovers yearn
For the sea like navy men
'Cause now we say goodnight from our own separate sides
Like brothers on a hotel bed

You may tire of me as our December sun is setting
With a well-intentioned man
But she can't relax
With his hand on the small of her back
And as the flash-bulbs burst
She holds a smile
Like someone would hold
A crying child
And soon everybody will ask
What became of you
'Cause your heart was dying fast
And you didn't know what to do
Cath  it seems
That you live in someone else's dream
In a hand-me-down wedding dress
Where the things that could have been are oppressed

 mhm
 you can't find nothing at all
 the sun in retreat
 you can't find nothing at all
 you can't find nothing at all

Who stormed through your turnstile and climbed to the street

Can you tell me why you have been so sad?
He took a lover on a faraway beach
While you arranged flowers and chose color schemes
Can you tell me why you have been so sad?
Can you tell me why you have been so sad?
The youngest one glared with furrowed brows
The bride then tripped and broke the vase
The one you thought would spend the years
So perfectly placed below the mirror
And walked into the angry sea
And it felt just like falling in love again
And it felt just like falling in love again

An outdated map crumpled in my pocket
But I didn't care where I was going

The boundaries of language I quietly cursed

If you keep all your friends on the payroll
The non-disclosure pages signed
Your secrets safe between those lines
The scaffolding will cheer and console you
But remember what your mother told you
That good help is so hard to find
For people who are so refined
You're trying to turn into the skid
In this never-ending grid
To a darkened stage
And I hear you say
Only a fool gives it away
Only a fool would give
Only a fool gives it away

High above the city from where you came

And the grapevines seemed left for dead
And the northern sky looked like the end of days
The end of days
The wake-up call to a rented room
Sounded like an alarm of impending doom
To warn us it's only a matter of time
Before we all burn
Before we all burn
Before we all burn
Before we all burn
We bought some wine and some paper cups
Near your daughter's school when we picked her up
And drove to a cemetery on a hill
On a hill
And we watched the plumes paint the sky gray
As she laughed and danced through the field of graves
There  I knew it would be alright
That everything
Would be alright
Would be alright
Would be alright

The firemen worked in double shifts
With prayers for rain on their lips
There's only one thought that swirls around my head now
And that's that everyone there on the screen
They're all dead now
And it ain't easy living above
And I can't help but keep falling in love with bones and ashes
With bones and ashes
And when the color is too bold and bright
I'm daydreaming in black and white until it passes
Until it passеs
I wanna know the measure from hеre to forever
And I wanna feel the pressure of God or whatever
You gotta hold a gun to my back to make me smile
To make me smile
And the only way I seem to cope
Is by trying to hold on to hope if just for a while
If just for a while

 it'd been so long  my mind filled in the blanks
 I dreamt we spoke again
 it'd been so long  your voice was like a ghost
 yes  only in a dream
 is anything the way it used to be?
 I dreamt we spoke again
 when I awoke  I could not remember
But I'll be close behind  I'll follow you into the dark
No blinding light or tunnels to gates of white
Just our hands clasped so tight  waiting for the hint of a spark
If Heaven and Hell decide that they both are satisfied
Illuminate the nos on their vacancy signs
If there's no one beside you when your soul embarks
Then I'll follow you into the dark
In Catholic school  as vicious as Roman rule
I got my knuckles bruised by a lady in black
And I held my tongue as she told me  Son
Fear is the heart of love  so I never went back
If Heaven and Hell decide that they both are satisfied
Illuminate the nos on their vacancy signs
If there's no one beside you when your soul embarks
Then I'll follow you into the dark

From Bangkok to Calgary and the soles of your shoes
Are all worn down  the time for sleep is now
But it's nothing to cry about 'cause we'll hold each other soon

Little wanderer off across the sea

Back to me
Always fall asleep when you’re waking
I count the hours on my hands

But someone’s gotta be the lighthouse
And that someone’s gotta be me

I hope we always feel the same
When our eyes meet past security
We embrace in the baggage claim
When we kiss in the baggage claim
You’re my wanderer
Little wanderer off across the sea
You’re my wanderer
You’re my wanderer
How I need you back with me
And span the length of the Isle of Manhattan
I'd bring it to where you are
Making a lake of the East River and Hudson
If I could open my mouth
Wide enough for a marching band to march out
They would make your name sing
And bend through alleys and bounce off all the buildings
I wish we could open our eyes
To see in all directions at the same time
If you were never aware of what was around you
And it is true what you said
That I live like a hermit in my own head
But when the sun shines again
I'll pull the curtains and blinds to let the light in
Sorrow drips into your heart through a pinhole
Just like a faucet that leaks and there is comfort in the sound
But while you debate half empty or half full?

There’s too many things that I can’t remember
As I disappeared like a trend
In the hum of the five in the early morning
And now I'm taking my time
This highway lived in my mind
It takes me back to the place that made me
Was I in your way?
When the cameras turned to face you
No room in frame
For two
You cannot outrun a ghost
Speeding southbound lanes with abandon
It catches you on the coast
And then it hovers above
Reeling bodies failing to discover

Raising their voices to convince one another

Against the silver sheen of a moon like painted glass
Under stars out on a pier  a celestial sphere
We were weightless as the waves that disappeared
Northern lights filled our skies
Empty nights synchronized
We shared a clove cigarette on the parapet
As the TVs glowed from the windows of the model homes
And I'd never be that close again to your lips and perfect skin
As the tide receded into the unknown
Northern lights filled our skies

When you need directions  then I'll be the guide
For all time
 the childish fits
 spent cigarettes
 all beauty and truth
 left a note and it read:

 just as when you were living
 single mother
 cafeteria tables
 but I won't buy it
 it doesn't change the fact
The longest shadows ever cast
The water's warm and children swim
And we frolicked about in our summer skin
I don't recall a single care
Just greenery and humid air
Then Labor Day came and went
And we shed what was left of our summer skin
And we peeled the freckles from our shoulders
Our brand new coats were so flushed and pink
'Cause the season's change was a conduit
And watch the rain fall through the street lights
'Cause you're standing still in my mind
And I wonder where you are tonight
If the one you're with was a compromise
As we're walking lines in parallel
That will never meet and it's just as well
Sometimes I'm overcome
By every choice I couldn't outrun
The junctions all disappear
You can't double back to your summer years
And I wonder where you are tonight
If the one you're with was a compromise

 I'll let you be the wave

The seasons have changed  and so have we
There was little we could say  and even less that we could do
To stop the ice from getting thinner under me and you
We bury our love in the wintery grave
A lump in the snow was all that remained
Though we stayed by its side as the days turned to weeks
And the ice kept getting thinner with every word that we'd speak
And when the spring arrived  we were taken by surprise
When the floes under our feet bled into the sea
And nothing was left for you and me
We're not the same  dear  and it seems to me
There's nowhere we can go with nothing underneath
And it saddens me to say what we both knew was true
That the ice was getting thinner under me and you
And I don't feel any different
The clanking of crystal
Explosions off in the distance
In the distance
So this is the new year
And I have no resolutions
Or self-assigned penance
For problems with easy solutions
So everybody put your best suit or dress on
Let's make believe that we are wealthy for just this once
Lighting firecrackers off on the front lawn
As thirty dialogues bleed into one
I wish the world was flat like the old days
Then I could travel just by folding the map
No more airplanes or speed trains or freeways
There'd be no distance that could hold us back
There'd be no distance that could hold us back
There'd be no distance that could hold us back
So this is the new year
So this is the new year
So this is the new year
That my tongue has tied off
But they never make it past my mouth
And I can't wait to go grey
And I'll sit and wonder of every love that could've been
If I'd only thought of something charming to say

There's nothing to keep my fingers warm
And all I find are souvenirs from better times
Before the gleam of your taillights fading east
To find yourself a better life
I was searching for some legal document
As the rain beat down on the hood
When I stumbled upon pictures I tried to forget
And that's how this idea was drilled into my head
'Cause it's too important to stay the way it's been
But there's no blame for how our love did slowly fade
And there's no blame for how our love did slowly fade
It touched the lead to the pages of your manuscript
I took my thumb off the concrete and saved up all my strength
To hammer pillars for a picket fence
My able body isn't what it used to be
Your advantage left me helplessly into you
Talking how the group had begun to splinter
And I can taste your lipstick on the filter
I tried my best to keep my distance from your dress
But call-response overturns convictions every time
My memory cannot recall a wave of alcohol
We shared a cigarette and shaved the hours off
Talking how the group had begun to splinter
And I can taste your lipstick on the filter
Lushing with the hallway congregation
My best judgment signed its resignation

Tripped into the guest room
The clouds above opened up and let it out
I was standing on the surface of a perforated sphere
When the water filled every hole
And thousands upon thousands made an ocean
Making islands where no island should go  oh no
Most people were overjoyed  they took to their boats
I thought it less like a lake and more like a moat
The rhythm of my footsteps crossing flatlands to your door
Have been silenced forevermore
The distance is quite simply much too far for me to row
It seems farther than ever before  oh no
I need you so much closer
I need you so much closer
I need you so much closer
I need you so much closer
I need you so much closer

Remembering when you were mine in a still suburban town
When every Thursday I'd brave those mountain passes
And you'd skip your early classes  and we'd learn how our bodies worked
God damn the black night  with all its foul temptations
I've become what I always hated when I was with you then
We looked like giants in the back of my grey subcompact
Fumbling to make contact as the others slept inside
And together there
In a shroud of frost  the mountain air
Began to pass
From every pane of weathered glass
And I held you closer
Than anyone would ever guess
Do you remember the J.A.M.C.?
And reading aloud from magazines
I don't know about you  but I swear on my name they could smell it on me
But I've never been too good with secrets  no

And together there
In a shroud of frost  the mountain air
Began to pass
Through every pane of weathered glass
Is a tiny prayer to Father Time
As I stared at my shoes in the ICU
That reeked of piss and 409
And I rationed my breaths as I said to myself
That I'd already taken too much today
As each descending peak on the LCD
Took you a little farther away from me
Away from me
Amongst the vending machines and year-old​ magazines
In a place where we only say goodbye
It stung like a violent wind that our memories depend
On a faulty camera in our minds
And I knew that you were a truth I would rather lose
Than to have never lain beside at all
And I looked around at all the eyes on the ground
As the TV entertained itself
'Cause there's no comfort in the waiting room
Just nervous paces bracing for bad news
And then the nurse comes 'round and everyone lifts their head
But I'm thinking of what Sarah said
That love is watching someone die

Or to be faithful every day till the end
I just need you to be always a friend
As the sun sets over Dakotas
Underneath a crimson ocean of sky
Know I'll always want you by my side
When we drive
When we drive
You and I were born in motion
Never in one place for too long a time
Now it's the only way we know to survive
I like the way that your hair tangles
The way your suntan's only on one side
We always keep the windows open wide
When we drive
When we drive
When we drive

Climb into the backseat and close your eyes
I've got the wheel
Dream of all the places only we will find
I can't expect you to be honest
Or to be faithful every day until the end
I just need you to be always a friend
Until the engine kicks and sputters
Until we roll the rubber off the tires
Know I'll always need you by my side
When we drive
When we drive
When we drive
When we drive

This  fire grows   higher
This  fire  grows  higher
This  fire  grows  higher
When there's a burning in your heart
An endless yearning in your heart
Build it bigger than the sun
Let it grow  let it grow
When there's a burning in your heart
Don't be alarmed
This  fire  grows  higher
When there's a doubt within your mind
Because you're thinking all the time
Framing rights into wrongs
Move along  move along
When there's a doubt within your mind
When there's a burning in your heart
And you think it'll burst apart
Or there's nothing to fear
Save the tears  save the tears
When there's a burning in your heart

And if you feel just like a tourist in the city you were born
Then it's time to go and define your destination
There's so many different places to call home
'Cause when you find yourself the villain
In the story you have written  it's plain to see
That sometimes the best intentions are in need of redemptions
Would you agree? If so  please show me
This  fire  grows  higher
This  fire  grows  higher
When there's a burning in your heart
When there's a burning in your heart (This  fire  grows  higher)
When there's a burning in your heart (This  fire  grows  higher)
When there's a burning in your heart (This  fire  grows  higher)
And start new when your heart is an empty room
With walls of the deepest blue
But you don't know what now to do
'Cause the chase is all you know
And she stopped running months ago
And all you see is where else you could be when you're at home
And out on the street are so many possibilities to not be alone
The flames and smoke climbed out of every window
And disappeared with everything that you held dear
But you shed not a single tear for the things that you didn't need
'Cause you knew you were finally free
'Cause all you see is where else you could be when you're at home
And out on the street are so many possibilities to not be alone
And all you see is where else you could be when you're at home
The stars are cracks in the ceiling of night
And I just keep watching them for a sign
That you'll be alright
'Cause every time there's a knock on my door
I fall to my hands and knees on the floor
'Cause when your wreckage washes up on my shore
You're not like before
And you try to explain who's at fault for your mistakes
But I won't be the debris in your hurricane
You used to be such a delicate kid
A lonely fish in a sea full of squid
So I can't blame you for leaving how you did
You just fell off the grid
'Cause heaven is a hole in the sky
And the stars are cracks in the ceiling of night
But you can't be your own alibi
As hard as you try

It's a tired refrain you're singing over and over again
As you try to explain who's at fault for your mistakes
In your new twin-sized bed
With a single pillow underneath
Your single head
I guess you decided that that old queen
Was more space than you would need
And now it's in the alley behind your apartment
With a sign that says it's free
But I hope you have more luck
With this than me
You used to think that someone would
Come along
And lay beside you in a space that
They belong
But the other side of the mattress
And box springs stayed like new
And what's the point of holding onto
What never gets used?
Other than a sick desire
For self-abuse

And I try not to worry
But you've got me terrified
It's like you're in some kind of hurry
To say goodbye  to say goodbye
To say goodbye
You look so defeated  lying there
In your new twin-sized bed
You look so defeated  lying there
Through endless days and countless nights
There was a storm when I was just a kid
Stripped the last coat of innocence
You've haunted me all my life
You're always out of reach when I'm in pursuit
Long-winded then suddenly mute
And there's a flaw in my heart's design
For I keep trying to make you mine
You've haunted me all my life
You've haunted me all my life
You are the mistress I can't make a wife
And you've haunted me all my life
How to capture your diminishing returns
I still see you through the eyes of a child
Not even thinking we could tame the wild
You've haunted me all my life
You've haunted me all my life
You are the mistress I can't make a wife
And you've haunted me all my life
