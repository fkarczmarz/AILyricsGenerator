lyrics
"The best of us passed out  I don't know who's where
I got all my old friends and new friends I've met once before
In a blanket of smoke as we sink through the floor
You are my familiar  you are my familiar
You are my familiar
Oh  there is nowhere I would rather be
Never feel more comfortable  could never want for more when I'm here
Never feel more comfortable  could never want for more when you're near
Ooh
Ooh  ah
Tuesday'll be a doom day  this got out of hand

You are my familiar  you are my familiar
You are my familiar
Oh  there is nowhere I would rather be
Never feel more comfortable  could never want for more when I'm here
Never feel more comfortable  could never want for more when you're near
Ooh
Ooh  ah
I don't care if we're talkin' 'bout the same things
I don't care if we're stuck in the familiar
I don't care if we're goin' 'round in circles
You are my familiar  you are my familiar (Not much more that I would ask for)
You are my familiar (Not much more that I would ask for)
Oh  there is nowhere I would rather be
Never feel more comfortable  could never want for more when I'm here
Oh  there is nowhere I would rather be
I never feel more comfortable  could never want for more when you're near
Ooh  ah
Ooh  ah
I can't remember  I can't remember
I can't remember  I can't remember
I can't remember  I can't remember
 none more than I can take
 I feel guilty
 I feel guilty
With a night that we can't replace
I'm lost but found with you in a bed that we'll never make
It's a feeling we always chase
I could write a book about the things that you said to me on the pillow
And the way you think and how you make me feel
So don't make promises to me that you're gonna break
We only ever wanted one thing from this
Don't paint wonderful lies on me that wash away
We only ever wanted one thing from this
And in another place
You might also like
So lie to me tonight and pretend till the morning light
And imagine that you are mine
'Cause when the sun'll rise with the truth coming out your eyes
We'll be good in another life
I could write a book about the things that you said to me on the pillow
And the way you think and how you make me feel
So don't make promises to me that you're gonna break
We only ever wanted one thing from this
Don't paint wonderful lies on me that wash away
We only ever wanted one thing from this
It felt like something special but it never felt like love
Wonder what we could be living in another life
Catch us in the mirror and it looks a lot like love
Then you stop me talking as you kiss me from above
So don't make promises to me that you're gonna break
We only ever wanted one thing from this
Don't paint wonderful lies on me that wash away
We only ever wanted one thing from this
In another time
(I don't wanna talk about it  I don't wanna talk about it)
We were young and drinking in the park
There was nowhere else to go
And you said you always had my back
Oh  but how were we to know?
That these are the days that bind you together  forever
And these little things define you forever  forever
All this bad blood here  won't you let it dry?
It's been cold for years  won't you let it lie?

If we're only ever looking back
We will drive ourselves insane
As the friendship goes  resentment grows
We will walk our different ways
But those are the days that bind us together  forever
And those little things define us forever  forever
All this bad blood here  won't you let it dry?
It's been cold for years  won't you let it lie?
I don't wanna hear about the bad blood anymore
I don't wanna hear you talk about it anymore
I don't wanna hear about the bad blood anymore
(I don't wanna talk about it  I don't wanna talk about it)
(I don't wanna talk about it  I don't wanna talk about it)
I don't wanna hear you talk about it anymore
(I don't wanna talk about it  I don't wanna talk about it)
(I don't wanna talk about it  I don't wanna talk about it)
(I don't wanna talk)
All this bad blood here  won't you let it dry?
It's been cold for years  won't you let it lie?
Rhythm of the evening  chasing a good time
London's burning
If the world is ending  let's stay up all night
Do you remember what you said to me?
'Cause we lost track of time
Yeah  we lost track of time
You always let me down so tenderly
So live fast and die young and stay forever numb
You said that maybe this is where it ends
Take a bow for the bad decisions that we made
Bad decisions that we made
And if we're going down in flames
Take a bow for the bad decisions that we made
Bad decisions that we made
So we'll make the same mistakes
Till the morning breaks
So we'll make the same mistakes
Till the morning breaks

You said that maybe this is where it ends
Take a bow for the bad decisions that we made
Bad decisions that we made
And if we're going down in flames
Take a bow for the bad decisions that we made
Bad decisions that we made
So we'll make the same mistakes
Till the morning breaks
So we'll make the same mistakes
Till the morning breaks
Now we find ourselves lying around here
Always find ourselves lying around here
Down here
(And we make the same mistakes)
(Till the morning breaks)
Ooh
(And we make the same mistakes)
(Till the morning breaks)
You said that maybe this is where it ends
(Maybe this is where it ends)
Take a bow for the bad decisions that we made
Bad decisions that we made
And if we're going down in flames
Take a bow for the bad decisions that we made
Bad decisions that we made
So we'll make the same mistakes
Till the morning breaks (Ooh)
So we'll make the same mistakes
Till the morning breaks
Do you remember what you said to me?
'Cause we lost track of time
There's no room for you here
There's no room for you here
Wrap your teeth around the pavement
'Cause your body's a message
Send my regards to hell
This is my body and soul here
You've got the power and control
Don't pin it all on me
Don't pin it all on me!
You've been granted three wishes
I can hear your pulse racing from here
Sitting next to this gun beats your heart in your mouth
This is my body and soul here
You've got the power to control
Don't pin it all on me
Don't pin it all on me!

Don't pin it all on me
Just another tall pile of papers making it crowded in here
Someone else's work in your theses  someone else's words in your mouth
Someone else's hard work and research taking you up in the world
Oh  never leave me out
I'm standing by the sidelines
Oh  never leave me out
I'm standing by
Just another brain on the campus  just another set of ideas
Just another theory in motion waiting there for you to steal
It must be so lonely  knowing what you know
Oh  never leave me out
I'm standing by the sidelines
Oh  never leave me out
I'm standing by

A sadness in the breeze as the night divides us
In these darker days  I push the limit to the love you offer
There's a riot in my head  demanding we do this forever
Why would we divide when we could come together?
Just bodies that collide  lost and found each other
So don't  don't leave me alone
Don't leave me alone  don't leave me alone
Why would we divide when we could come together?
Looking back around  glamorize the chaos
Don't let summer nights destroy everything before us
In these darker days  I push the limit to the love you offer
There's a riot in my head  demanding we do this forever
Why would we divide when we could come together?
Just bodies that collide  lost and found each other
So don't  don't leave me alone
Don't leave me alone  don't leave me alone
Why would we divide when we could come together?

All I think about is you
When I watch the world burn
All I think about is you
There must be something in the Kool-Aid
Cruising through the doom days
God knows what is real and what is fake
Last couple years have been a mad trip
How'd y’all look so perfect?
You must have some portraits in the attic
We'll stay offline so no one gets hurt
Hiding from the real world
We fucked this house up like the planet
We were running riot
Crazy that some people still deny it
Think I’m addicted to my phone
My scrolling horror show
I'm live-streaming the final days of Rome
Everybody's at it
No surprise we're so easily bored
Let's pick the truth that we believe in
Like a bad religion
Tell me all your original sins
So many questionable choices
We love the sound that our voice makes
We're gonna choose the blue pill
We’re gonna close the curtains
She's gonna flip some tables
I’m gonna move this tale on
We'll be the proud remainers
Here 'til the morning breaks us
We run away from real life thoughts tonight
We’re gonna Peter Pan out

When you're being stopped at every turn
Ooh-ooh

Melt me down  I'm like wax to your jokes
And there's no point reliving crimes to lose this
Still wanna waste all of my time

One floor to sleep upon and only these four walls to keep you ()
These four walls contain you

This is a collect call from Kansas State Penitentiary:
We were lying in the middle of the road
Counting the planes as they flew by
Inconceivable imagining them go
And drunk we set the world to rights
As we fell and hit our heads upon the curb
You make me laugh until I die
Can you think of any better way to choke?
Stories told to me and stories told to you
Did you ever feel like they were ringing true?
Way down here upon the ground when we're lying in the dirt
Not everything had gone to plan
Passing the drink from hand to hand
We admit we really know nothing at all

Stories told to me and stories told to you
And was it feeling real? And were they ringing true?
And way down here upon the ground when we're lying in the dirt
I'll take my chances on the curb here with you
We watch the planes leave us behind
On the curb here with you
We watch the planes leave us behind
And pulled me back from things divine
Stop looking up for heaven
Waiting to be buried
And way down here upon the ground when we're lying in the dirt
Watching through my fingers
Watching through my fingers
Shut my eyes and count to ten
It goes in one ear out the other  oh
One ear out the other  oh
Burning bright right till the end
Now you'll be missing from the photographs
Missing from the photographs
Watching through my fingers
Watching through my fingers
In my thoughts  you're far away
And you are whistling a melody
Whistling a melody
Crystallising clear as day
Oh  I can picture you so easily
Picture you so easily

What's gonna be left of the world if you're not in it?
What's gonna be left of the world  oh?
Every minute and every hour
Every stumble and each misfire
Watching through my fingers
Watching through my fingers
Caught off-guard by your favourite song
Oh  I'll be dancing at a funeral
Dancing at a funeral
Sleeping in the clothes you love
It's such a shame we had to see them burn
Shame we had to see them burn
What's gonna be left of the world if you're not in it?
What's gonna be left of the world  oh?
Every minute and every hour
Every stumble and each misfire
If you want to be a party animal  you have to learn to live in the jungle
Now stop worrying and go  get dressed
You might have to excuse me
I've lost control of all my senses
And you might have to excuse me
I've lost control of all my words
So get drunk  call me a fool
Put me in my place  put me in my place
Pick me up  up off the floor
Put me in my place  put me in my place
Every minute and every hour
Every stumble and each misfire
Watching through my fingers
Watching through my fingers
Cause every minute and every hour
When we're all experts who pretend
Where's a good place to begin
Let's start with the truth
'Cause it gets you in the end
Hangin' the past out to dry
No matter how hard you try
They blow round in the breeze
Still through the leaves
Don't leave me hangin'
Don't leave me hangin'
Hindsight's an unhelpful friend
Who's waiting there at the end
He catches you unaware
With I told you so
And the spirit of the stairs
Now that it all seems so clear
You can end the lies from now on here
Those bits you'd rather forget

Don't leave me hangin'
Don't leave me hangin'
Don't leave me hangin'
Don't leave me hangin'
Don't leave me hangin'

Look who's digging their own grave
That is what they all say
You'll drink yourself to death
Look who makes their own bed
Lies right down within it
And what will you have left?
Out on the front doorstep
Drinking from a paper cup
You won't remember this
Living beyond your years
Acting out all their fears
You feel it in your chest
Your hands protect the flames
From the wild winds around you

Look out to the future
But it tells you nothing
So take another breath
Your hands protect the flames

Icarus is flying too close to the sun
And Icarus's life  it has only just begun
This is how it feels to take a fall
Icarus is flying towards an early grave

Thought I'd never be waking on the kitchen floor
But here I lie  not the first time
Now my morning has broken and it brings the fear
My mind's falling  fall in
Then I feel my pulse quickenin'
But regrets can't change anything
Yeah  I feel my pulse quickenin'
When your name lights up the screen
Joy  set my mind free

Joy  set my mind free

You're a sweet relief  you saved me from my brain

Oh  oh  oh
You took me to your favourite place on Earth
To see the tree they cut down ten years from your birth
Our fingers traced in circles 'round its history
We brushed our hands right back in time through centuries
As you held me down  you said
I'll see you in the future when we're older
And we are full of stories to be told
Cross my heart and hope to die
I'll see you with your laughter lines
Changes on our hands and on our faces

Walking out into the dark  cutting out a different path
Lead by a beating heart
All the people of the town cast their eyes right to the ground
In matters of the heart
The night was all you had
You ran into the night from all you had
Found yourself a path up on the ground
You ran into the night  you can't be found
But this is your heart

And do little errands for my mother
The ones she allows I might be capable of doing
And do you go out with friends?
Well  a-a boy's best friend is his mother
A scrub is a guy who thinks he's fly
And is also known as a buster
Always talkin' about what he wants
And just sits on his broke arse  so
No  I don't want your number
No  I don't want to give you mine  and
No  I don't want to meet you nowhere
No  I don't want none of your time
No  I don't want no scrubs
A scrub is a guy that can't get no love from me
Hangin' out the passenger side if his best friend's ride

Oh  yes  son  I've been talking to you

If you have a shorty  but you don't show love
Clamped in them  and none of us can ever get out
Wanna get me with no money
Oh  no  I don't want no
No scrubs  no scrubs
Sometimes we deliberately step into those traps

When you're in my arms but you've gone somewhere deeper
Are you going to age with grace?
Are you going to age without mistakes?
Are you going to age with grace?
Or only to wake and hide your face?
When oblivion is calling out your name
You always take it further than I ever can
When you play it hard and I try to follow you there
Are you going to age with grace?
Are you going to leave a path to trace?
When oblivion is calling out your name
You always take it further than I ever can
When oblivion is calling out your name
People feel it everywhere
Lift your hands and voices
Free your mind and join us
You can feel it in the air
(This is the rhythm) You can put some joy up on my face
Feel you give me love again
Round and round we go
Each time I hear you say
The rhythm of the night
The rhythm of my life
The rhythm of the night
The rhythm of my life

Won't you teach me how to love and learn?
There'll be nothing left for me to yearn

The rhythm of the night
The rhythm of my life
The rhythm of the night
The rhythm of my life
The rhythm of the night
The rhythm of my life
So her fingers ran away with themselves
Till everything was documented
Her mind it was reaching out
To put into words what their bodies had done
They lie together — oil on water
It's a catalogue of modern mistakes
Her words and legs wrapped around each man
Leaving stories like digital crumbs
As she turns these nights into literature
They lie together — oil on water

These words are all we have

Oh  I hear you calling in the dead of night
You lean towards despair
Any given opportunity you're there

I was left to my own devices
Many days fell away with nothing to show
And the walls kept tumbling down in the city that we love
Grey clouds roll over the hills  bringing darkness from above
But if you close your eyes  does it almost feel like nothing changed at all?
And if you close your eyes  does it almost feel like you've been here before?
How am I gonna be an optimist about this?

'Cause pain  I can take it easily
Did you really think I'd fall to my knees
Just to pray for some sweet simplicity?
'Cause woah  you're squeezing my heart
Too hard in your bare hands  they hold too tight
And woah  the air is on fire
This room feels electric caught here in your sights
Power  power
I will never understand the power you were holding over me
Power  power
Pain  just synapses firing in our brains
So when you cut me  cut me deep
Hurt the ones you love the most easily
'Cause in time we show our Achilles' heels
'Cause woah  you're squeezing my heart
Too hard in your cold bare hands  they hold too tight
And woah  the air is on fire
This room feels electric caught here in your sights

Singing Love Will Tear Us Apart

This is my favourite part so
Before it falls apart
But we're talking about the most brilliant mind this world's ever seen
I've got demons running round in my head
And they feed on insecurities I have
Won't you lay your healing hands on my chest?
Let your ritual clean
Soak the ropes with your holy water
Tie me down as you read out the words
Set me free from my jealousy
Won't you exorcise my mind? Won't you exorcise my mind?
I want to be free as I'll ever be
Exorcise my mind  help me exorcise my mind
Desdemona  won't you liberate me?

Through my darkest of dreams

Exorcise my mind  help me exorcise my mind
Where are those friends who pulled no punches?
Shot from the hip with one another
We got so far from them
We're miles from way back when
I'm so nervous saying this out loud
As the words roll off my tongue and out my mouth...

Saturday night  was at this real wild party
There was liquor overflowin' the cup
About five or six strippers trying to work for a buck
So I took one girl outside with me
Her name was Londi  she went to Junior High with me
I said  Why you up in there dancing for cash?
I guess a whole lot's changed since I seen you last
She said  What would you do if your son was at home
Crying all alone on the bedroom floor
'Cause he's hungry  and the only way to feed him is to
Sleep with a man for a little bit of money?
And his daddy's gone in and out of lockdown
I ain't got a job now  he's just smokin' rock now
