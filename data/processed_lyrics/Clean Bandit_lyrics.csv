lyrics
" me and my phone
 ordered a car
 walked in straight to the bar
 ordered one more
 could change all that I know
 what's your name
 what are you drinking
 they played Prince
 could change all that I know
 I didn't know you
 I didn't need you
 I never kissed you
 I didn't miss you
 could change all that I know
 I never kissed you
 I didn't miss you
Bruises that won't heal
Bring down the government
I'll take a quiet life
A handshake of carbon monoxide
With no alarms and no surprises
No alarms and no surprises
No alarms and no surprises
Silent
Silent
This is my final fit
My final bellyache
With no alarms and no surprises
No alarms and no surprises
No alarms and no surprises
I'm a killer  you won't see me as I slither down the street
I make noise and I'm poised like a train as you please
I make heat when I tweet  I am the real McCoy
All the lies that you say to me
Better pray for me
Better kill me or pay for me
You gotta get what you want  get what you want
And all those things that I see you do
They make me pray for you
About to kiss you or kill you too
Da da da da da
Da  da da da
Da da da da
Da da da da da da da 
I'ma come for you  I'm a predator
(Woo  ha!) predator
Gonna make you right  gonna edit ya
(Woo  ha!) edit ya

So now you sit and you watch TV

It seems your great plan has fallen through

In the beginning  the light shone bright with possibilities
It's still shining cause it runs on electricity
So don't stop dreaming of the man that you could be
Eh  I'm glad we moved on from the bullshit
Eh  and now you see me on some new shit (On some new shit)
But don’t forget  I never gave up  I never gave up
Eh  but now I got my cake up  and I'm fucking famous
If she tells you that she loves you  oh

And she'll never let you go (Never let you go)

And when I finally saw you
My mouth began to make this sound
I called
It's not enough to hear you
Your voice will never do
I find I hate to be near you
I long to see this evening through
Everybody thinks I'm weird but the truth is I'm not
When I'm in the studio and the 808 pops
Everybody thinks I'm weird but the truth is I'm not
Gonna let the music take control of me and let the bass rush through me
I want to stop until I drop I know I'm on top and now it's time to bop
(Let me see you get low)
Whatever happens tonight stays in the crowd
Whatever happens stays between you and I
Whatever happens tonight stays in the crowd
Whatever happens stays between you and I
Your cologne and the bass is making my heart beat insane
Your cologne and the bass is making my heart beat insane
Your cologne and the bass is making my heart beat insane
Your cologne and the bass is making my heart beat insane
It's amazing when we party all night for the cause
When I watch you get down I forget all your flaws
But the music takes us deep 'til the breaking of dawn

Get-get-get low
Get-get-get low
Get-get-get low
But sometimes all it takes is just a symbol
Because the place you want to reach is right in front of you
Ra pa pum
You bring me sun sun sun sunshine
You bring me sun sun sun sunshine
So before the night over I want you to know that I'm willing to change my ways
You bring me sun sun sun sunshine
You bring me sun sun sun sunshine
You better make time to sit down and put pen to paper
Because the things you want to do will slip away from you

Wasn’t really there
It was made up in your mind
Could be anyone/anywhere
'Cause you'd been living in a world
In another place
Other space in time
As the dust clears and it all starts to disappear
It may get harder 'cause you just restarted
It may get harder 'cause you just restarted
Realise that the situation’s going nowhere
Because you act so tough I’ve totally lost control
So please try to understand that if I could
I'd call and I would be there
And if it didn’t hurt so much you know I'd give you it all
Imagine if the friend that you thought you knew
Wasn't really true
It just existed in your head
The reflection used wasn't you
Completely unaware
Could be anywhere/anytime
'Cause there was shift
In the paradigm

Every night try to escape
Got me calling for your name
Feel you touching
You take me to a place only we know
Away from all the noise and the people
You take me to a place only we know
When I hear your voice
Say the word and we'll go
'Cause darling when we pull close
I know we call pull through
I just wanna let go (Let go) of everything but you
'Cause nothing even matters
If it's me you're holding on to
I just wanna lеt go of everything but you
Everything but you
Evеrything but you
I'm so tired of the hollow
Show me signs I can follow

 my door is open
 two wrongs can make it right
 they can't fake
 something real
 surely you can sympathise?
 then why are you lonely?
 two wrongs can make it right
 something real
 surely you can sympathise?
 something real

You came in deep  I'm hijacked  it's a hold-up
I'm under it  send me spinning every time we touch
My head is done in  I think and think about you much
I've never been the type of girl to dream about
Sugary things and I don't believe in fairy tales
But now  to me  it's like your love is oxygen
So hear me when I say this
Boy I tell you true  I ain't easy
There's something about you
Just makes me so crazy
I can't breathe  you set my heart on fire
(Fire...)
Every single thing you do does set my heart on fire
I struggle to breathe – I can't breathe  you set my heart on fire
(Fire...)
Start it again – I can't breathe  you set my heart on fire

 under my skin
 we feel no pain
 got me strugglin'
 no lie
 oh baby we slide
Was the best route
But it's safe now to say that I'm stressed out
'Cause I maybe might want you back  yeah
And I'm a mess now  making love is a dub
It's just sex now
That's why I'm calling
I unblocked your number just to tell you I'm all in
And I know we're not supposed to talk
But I'm getting ahead of myself
I get scared when we're not
'Cause I'm scared you're with somebody else
So  I guess that it's gone
And I just keep lying to myself
Though I’m tryin’ not to right now

You weren't a fan of pictures
So I hardly ever took 'em
Got them saved in my mind from the bedroom
So that way I can't forget your skin
So I saved all the texts
All of the best over the years
Just to remind myself of how good it is  or was
(And get this good thing back)
Back like we used to  cruising with my boo
(Those were the good days)
The best started outweighing good
And I didn't have patience to mend it
'Cause I should've have waited a minute
Though I’m tryin’ not to right now
So I saved all the texts
All of the best over the years
Just to remind myself of how good it is
Yeah  I saved all the texts off of my ex
Minus the tears
Just to remind myself of how good it is  or was
'Cause I...
Though I’m tryin’ not to right now
I can't help it  I just...
Though I’m tryin’ not to right now

I miss you
And I was so wrong
Now I'm having cold nights
I made your heart pound
But you won't sell that for no price
And I know we're not supposed to talk
But I'm getting ahead of myself
I get scared when we're not
'Cause I'm scared you're with somebody else

Minus the tears
'Cause I...
Though I’m tryin’ not to right now
Though I’m tryin’ not to right now
Hanging with your brother
Wishin' that I was your bottle
So I could be close to your lips again
I know you didn't call your parents
And tell 'em that we ended
'Cause you know that they'd be offended
Did you not want to tell 'em it's the end?
And I know we're not supposed to talk
But I'm getting ahead of myself
I get scared when we're not
'Cause I'm scared you're with somebody else

Could you tell how much when I took you back?
I kept on thinking of you
The only reason I remain
In us I believe
You mean too much to me

And a few broken dishes

I don't let up 'til your heart's on the floor
Losing our minds  scream and we shout
'Til we forget what we fighting about
Turns me into a monster
We're no good for each other
Lying in bed  miles apart
We're side by side and alone in the dark
There's no going back
Back to when things were easy
But there's something that I'd like to do
Right before you leave me
If this really is the end
Then why don't you please come back to bed
Come on and spend the night
And let's say our last goodbye
Baby don't walk away
Don't wanna remember you this way

Mek we just cry and have a likke kiss
Spring the g-string
Forget about the phone when I ring
Lovin' at the backseat  you deh pon mi
I will not forget anything
Den we hear the knock and the guns go pow
It's been only 50 seconds
I've been all up on you now
It's so sad to see that we couldn't be all up in the clouds
And it's the last time I'll be all up in your mouth (Yeah)
The ting went off we no fly we no shy we nah cry
There's no going back

As if I woke up in a different life  ay ay ay
Feels like I'm walking with my heart on fire
Somebody pass me the water 'cause I'm burning
'Cause a little bit's turning into a lot

Guess I'm everything that I thought I was not
Tell me  tell me  ay ay ay

Don't know what this is

You think... it's stupid?
You think it's repetitive?
Find myself a stage but I hate to speak
Wanna be a social but I hate to creep
Scared of heights but I got to leap
'Cos we're leaping for the stars
Not close but far from far
And if I don't try I won't go
Never leave I won't go

Getting confused 'cos everyone's singing all the time
I won't stand it – Clean Bandit
And if I get too animato
Tan my face with adagietto
Allegro or andante
I can make this  voice staccato
And then make it all legato
The doors are open but it's leaving time
Cruising at the speed of Ayrton Senna
Wondering if we'll even get to Vienna
We'll run this house
Now we made it to Mozart's House
This is Mozart's House
So you think electronic music is boring?
You think... it's stupid?
You think it's repetitive?
I gather up my thoughts and questions
Could I ever be like you?
It seems implausible
I look at my reflection
If only I could say
The things I never mention
The things you never knew
And I'd like to thank you for the human I've become
I'm sorry if I've let you down
To see this new world without your eyes
Once upon a time there was a girl who so much loved the world
She have her only begotten sunshine
And dried her stained eyes on a neck tie
Took the best lies made 'em truths
And spit sad soliloquies in the booth
Cause people think they know but they barely knew
The reality of what the other-siders do
Seen a whole bunch of world and done came back
Got a reckoning for wrecking in my knapsack
'Bout to journey on foot through the outback
GRRRL PRTY is the label on my snapback
Doin' worldwide shows in a black hat
'Bout to tell your ass a story so take that
Free prophecies from a black cat

Seen his demise with a pair of brand new eyes
Never wanted to be stickin' it to thickening thighs
But now he deeper than the secrets that he keep with a lie
Now wait...
He never wanted to be a loser
But the bruises of losing is oozing through his fingers
The tips that like to brush at my hips
To never think about another lover
Hopin' he had time to recover but nothing's ever easy
Beware the sting of queen bee (grr!)
And I'd like to thank you for the human I've become
I'm sorry if I've let you down
To see this new world without your eyes
So many things in he I would like to be
I could look up in the mirror and change me
Or right over my shoulder and save me
Not a thing or a ring to my name
Feelin' like Gwen Stefani in this thing
But I can't complain cause we asked for this
Feelin' like a workaholic or a masochist
Don't call like I should like its sacrilege
To make a dollar in a dream into packed venues
I can feel the weight of wars you've lost
They're victories in my eyes
Every swing you take brings me closer and closer
Open the gates and I'm poised to charge
You told me we'd never get this far
Now we at the final round
There's no way we'll escape battle scars
Battle scars
And I'd like to thank you for the human I've become
I'm sorry if I've let you down
I am trying to get to know you baby
Let's start there by what's your name
So many things I want to tell you
So many things I want to share

So many hours praying for you  so many things to prove
You can't be serious?  the moment that we're cool
The day that I've been waiting for now it's all eyes on you
'Cause everybody wants to get some of the action
Everyone with half a mind sees your attraction
I'm not usually the type to follow fashion
I can't help it
Everybody wants a piece of you
I know  I know
That everybody wants a piece of you
I know  I know
That everybody wants a piece of you
You
I know  I know
That everybody wants a piece of you
I gave my heart away  I put it down for you
Believed the lies you told me
How I wished that they were true
But I knew all along  it wouldn't be my time

It's a shot in the dark but I'll make it
Know with all of your heart you can't shame me
When I am with you  there's no place I'd rather be

Make it everlasting so nothing's incomplete

January always brings a fear of creatures
Strong-holdings and salt in places yet to heal
Crying at the site of strings
She was there when they came for you
A great man and the child in you
Enough when I take you far from here
Enough to cut a morning view
Strange how a sound could change your feelings
Staring wide and dirty breathing
I remember how a calling came in
Scared of deceiving and all I could hear was
Run
(The fire) (The fire)

Of thinking that there was one way  only one way out
I was hoping by now  that maybe I'd have found
Answers to the questions that are keeping me down
Even though I'm not over it yet
I can put forever in the plans that you have
Stooping low with the odds that you bet
I can put forever in the plans that you have
Take my life and start it somewhere else
Breathe in the change
The only way is up again
Everybody knows that I
Won't make the same mistakes
The only way is up again
I wanna take it back  everything we had
The curse of love has had me and it turned my heart bad
With a will there's a way  I'd definitely say
I'm looking out to the water  I'm singing my heart out

I can see forever in the plans that you've had
It's take to take it back  everything we had
The curse of love is healthy if it gives your heart back
With a will there's a way  to definitely say
I'm running out to the water  I'm singing my heart out
(I'm singing my heart out)
The only way is up again
Getting in playground fights  holding me back
Saved my life like once or twice
We moved to the city  I was staying out most nights
Hanging with the wrong guys
You pulled me back
Saved my life like once or twice
Didn’t wanna be young  Didn't wanna be young
I never said it enough  could never say enough
We were just kids
We had each other  you're still with me
’Cause you had my back  I had your back
You carry me
Lifted me up  onto your shoulders when I couldn't see
'Cause you had my back  I had your back
You carry me
We were just kids  we were just kids

In the street playing ball  yeah
So how'd you even get so tall  yeah
The summers got to turn into fall  yeah
I swear it's like we've been through it all  yeah
Hear our mum and dad fighting
Hiding in my room like we're tryna dodge lightning
Riding in my car  let's forget and get ice cream
Don’t you ever wonder where those nights went?
Didn’t wanna be young  Didn't wanna be young
I never said it enough  could never say enough
We were just kids
We had each other  you’re still with me
'Cause you had my back  I had your back
You carry me
Lifted me up  onto your shoulders when I couldn't see
'Cause you had my back  I had your back
You carry me
We were just kids  we were just kids
Didn’t wanna be young  Didn't wanna be young
I never said it enough  could never say enough
We were just kids
We had each other  you're still with me
'Cause you had my back  I had your back
You carry me
Lifted me up  onto your shoulders when I couldn't see
'Cause you had my back  I had your back
You carry me
We were just kids
We had each other  you're still with me
'Cause you had my back  I had your back
You carry me
Lifted me up  onto your shoulders when I couldn't see
'Cause you had my back  I had your back
You carry me
I ain't wearin' na nada
I know you're always on the night shift
But I can't stand these nights alone
And I don't need no explanation
I gotta get through this
I gotta get through this
I'm gonna get through this

When your love is pouring like the rain
When will I get the chance to say I love you?
I pretend that you're already mine
Now my heart ain't breaking every time I look into your eyes
When your love is pouring like the rain
When will I get the chance to say I love you?
I pretend that you're already mine
Now my heart ain't breaking every time I look into your eyes"
