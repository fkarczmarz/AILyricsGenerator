lyrics
" show ya right
 we fuss and fight
 then we go all night
 we're both insane
 show ya right
 we fuss and fight
 then we go all night
Yeah  it's nothing
You're just like  What?
Get the bare maximum
We're giving 'em a little intro
That's nice
There were two lovebirds
They met each other at the perfect time
And one just didn't know how to handle it
These days feel so different with the thought
I can't help but see your face
The look in your eye lets me know I'm mesmerized
You lеft me a mess since thе day we kissed and said
I wish I never met you no more
I wish I never met you no more
Oh
I wish I never met you no more
I wish I never met you no more
I wish I never met you no more
I'm so blown
I'm so blown
I'm so blown
I'm so—
Pulled up to the outing
And we off the loud
They said they fuck with my style
And then I pulled out my phone
See a text from my mom
Asking when will I be home (Where you at nigga?)
That shit is always unknown
Probably thinks you tryna smash
I'm tryna get you alone
But was just too blown
Blown
I'm so blown
I'm so blown
I'm so blown
I wish I knew
I wish I knew you wanted me
I wish I knew
I wish I knew you wanted me
If I knew I'd be with you
Is it too late to pursue?
Kinda mad that I didn't take a stab at it
I wish I knew
I wish I knew you wanted me (I wish I knew)
I wish I knew (Oh)
I wish I knew you wanted me
I wish I knew (Yeah)
I wish I knew you wanted me (Oh)
I wish I knew
I wish I knew you wanted me

Please say to me (Please just say to me)
If you still want it
I wish you wouldn't play with me
I wanna know (I wanna know)
Can I bite your tongue like my bad habit?
Would you mind if I tried to make a pass at it?
I wish I knew
I wish I knew you wanted me
I wish I knew (Wish I knew)
I wish I knew you wanted me (Oh)
You can't surprise a Gemini (I wish I knew)
If I decide if you're invited (I wish I knew you wanted me)
You always knew the way to wow me
You grabbin' me hard 'cause you know what you found
You can't surprise a Gemini
I knew you'd come back around
I know I'll be in your heart 'til the end

Yourself from all the rain

Let our guards down (Down  down)
Then treat me like a dog
And make me walk for miles

I don't deserve the blame
I just don't feel the same
The feelings I attained
They trickle down the drain
I'm just not entertained
There isn't much to gain
Why you bother me?
Unless you're swallowing
I could use your deep throat
We don't gotta be
'Causе I could ('Cause I could) do better (Do bеtter)

To move a little closer to you
If you want me to  I'll share my heart
I’m not anxious  I'll tell the truth
You know  if you feel about the same way  yeah

We'll fall I'd fall  I'd fall
But I'll give you the world  I'll give you the world
I’ll give you the world  I’ll give you the world now  now
And we've suddenly a cloudy day to keep us inside
Who came up out to carry them?
Filling up inside  I’m filling with doubts

'Cause I'm addicted to this drug
You're my addiction
I can't find the diction to what I feel
Your touch is a trip
I need some self-discipline
Where do I start to begin
Who can I call to help me?

By myself
Damn I wish I could have been a clone
Date myself

But we don't know each other enough
To tell
Looks ain't enough
Looks ain't enough
I know you think you like
Me cause I'm the man
And I be lookin' good
But you gotta understand
That there's more to this
What if I got with you and turned out to be a total dick
Would you be happy 'bout that?
No...
I want you and you want me
But we don't know each other enough
To tell
Looks ain't enough
And it ain't cool
Got me thinking 'bout how things decay
And about you
I think I'm just moving too quickly
Based on the patterns I've been studying on myself
Of the most scientific research and I think
That I should just take things a little slower
I swear there's something 'bout a loss there is to gain
Perhaps a lesson

I flexed up on the judge in court
And pulled out in Ferrari and my all-denim Versace fit

Nigga you can't turn a thot
Into a housewife
Bass effect on overdrive
I made this shit sober
But I'm usually fuckin high
Would tell myself from the past  You'll be fine
But what you don't know is the fun part of passion
And its the place where I think all the fun begins
What you don't see is what you believe
But to be is the place where the angels dance
What you don't hear is the voice of fear
When you get passed that is when your life appears
What you don't touch is what you won't clutch
But you'll latch on tight when the coast is clear
If I could travel through time  I think I
Can't get you outta my head
Can't get you outta my head
Can't get you outta my head
Can't get you outta my head
Can't get you outta my head
Can't get you outta my head
Put in so much work  I check in like a 9 to 5
They protectin' shit  I’m feelin' how I do in love
I can't even lie  I think I was really high
And these niggas always hating me  but they binge watch
I should have a show on Netflix that they friends watch
Copped the dealer  now we're reckless
I'm a big boss like I'm Rick Ross
Yeah  man
You niggas already know what the fuck going on  man
I'm lying
This shit over  this shit is over

All my old friends  they just dissolve
Because they stayed on the same old shit

Something's out of pocket  not my hand
And I'm going crazy
