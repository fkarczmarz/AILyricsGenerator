lyrics
"The world can overwhelm me
There's almost nothing that you could tell me
That could ease my mind
Which way will you run
When it's always all around you
And the feeling lost and found you again
A feeling that we have no control
Around the sun
Some say
There's going to be the new hell
Some say
It's still too early to tell
Some say
It really is no myth at all
Keep asking ourselves are we really
Strong enough
There's so many things that we got
Too proud of
We're too proud of
We're too proud of
You might also likeI want to take the pre-conceived
Out from underneath your feet
We could shake it off
Instead we'll plant some seeds
We'll watch them as they grow
And with each new beat
From your heart the roots grow deeper
The branches will they reach for what
Nobody really knows
But underneath it all
There's this heart all alone
What about when it's gone
And it really won't be so long
Sometimes it feels like a heart is no place to be singing from at all
There's a world we've never seen
There's still hope between the dreams
The weight of it all
Could blow away with a breeze
If you're waiting on the wind
Don't forget to breathe
Cause as the darkness gets deeper
We'll be sinking as we reach for love
At least something we could hold
But I'll reach to you from where time just can't go
She doesn't wear any wings
She wears a heart that can melt my own
She wears a smile that can make me want to sing
She gives me presents
With her presence alone
She gives me everything I could wish for
She gives me kisses on the lips just for coming home
She could make angels
I've seen it with my own eyes
You've got to be careful when you've got good love
Because the angels will just keep on multiplying
But you're so busy changing the world
Just one smile can change all of mine
We share the same soul
Oh oh oh oh oh ohh!
We share the same soul
Oh oh oh oh oh ohh!
We share the same soul
Oh oh oh oh oh ohh!
Oh oh oh oh oh ohh!
There ain't no need to go outside
But baby you hardly even notice
When I try to show you this
Song  it's meant to keep you
From doing what you're supposed to
Like waking up too early
Maybe we could sleep in
Make you banana pancakes
Pretend like it's the weekend now
And we could pretend it all the time
Can't you see that it's just raining?
There ain't no need to go outside
But just maybe
Hala ka ukulele
Mama made a baby
Really don't mind the practice
'Cause you're my little lady
'Cause I love to lay here lazy
We could close the curtains
Pretend like there's no world outside

And we could pretend it all the time
And can't you see that it's just raining?
There ain't no need to go outside
Ain't no need  ain't no need
Mmm-mmm-mmm-mmm
Can't you see? Can't you see?
Rain all day and I don't mind
We don't need to
We got everything we need right here and everything we need is enough
Just so easy when
The whole world fits inside of your arms
Do we really need to pay attention to the alarm?
But baby
You hardly even notice
When I try to show you this
Song  it's meant to keep you
From doing what you're supposed to
Like waking up too early
Maybe we could sleep in
Make you banana pancakes
Pretend like it's the weekend now
And we could pretend it all the time
Can't you see that it's just raining?
There ain't no need to go outside
Ain't no need  ain't no need
Can't you see? Can't you see?
Bella che fa?
But Belle
Je ne comprend pas français
So you'll have to speak to me
No song that I could sing but I can try for your heart
Our dreams and they are made out of real things
Like a shoebox of photographs with sepia-toned loving
It's not always easy and sometimes life can be deceiving
And all of these moments just might find their way into my dreams tonight
But I know that they'll be gone when the morning light sings
But if all of these dreams might find their way into my day to day scene
I'd be under the impression I was somewhere in between
You might also like
I believe in memories
But there is not enough time
And there is no combination of words I could say
But I will still tell you one thing
 the central coast
 for rain
 an old guitar
 a deck of cards
 a book of rocks
 one for the knots
 the lines begin to speak
 smoke signals
 and always
Then I could take a walk around
See what there is to see
Time is just a melody
With all the people in the street walking as fast as their feet can take 'em
I just roll through town
I need this old train to break down
Centipede gonna crawl westbound
So I don't even make a sound
Because it's gonna sting me when I leave this town
And all the people in the street that I'll never get to meet
If these tracks don't bend somehow
And I got no time that I got to get
You might also like
I need this old train to break down
I need this old train to break down
I wanna break on down
But I can't stop now
Let me break on down
But you can't stop nothing if you got no control
Of the thoughts in your mind that you kept and you know
You can't stop wishing if you don't let go
The things that you find and you lose and you know
I need this old train to break down
I need this old train to break down
I wanna break on down
We left everything behind
But nothing that we needed
At least not at this time
And now the feeling that I'm feeling
Well it's feeling like my life is finally mine
With nothing to go back to we just continue to drive
Without you I was broken
And I'd rather be broke down with you by my side
So without you I was broken
But I'd rather be broke down with you by my side
I didn't know what I was looking for
So I didn't know what I'd find
I didn't know what I was missing
I guess you've been just a little too kind
And if I find just what I need
I'll put a little peace in my mind
Maybe you've been looking too
Or maybe you don't even need to try

Without you I was broken
And I'd rather be broke down with you by my side
So without you I was broken
But I'd rather be broke down with you by my side
With everything in the past
Fading faster and faster until it was gone
Found out I was losing so much more than I knew all along
Because everything I've been working for
Was only worth nickels and dimes
But if I had a minute for every hour that I've wasted
'Cause without you I was broken
But I'd rather be broke down with you by my side
So without you I was broken
But I'd rather be broke down with you by my side
So without you I was broken
But I'd rather be broke down with you by my side
So without you I was broken
That her eyes are as big as her bubbly toes
On the feet of the queen of the hearts of the cards
And her feet are all covered with tar balls and scars
It's as common as something that nobody knows
That her beauty will follow wherever she goes
Up the hill in the back of her house in the woods
But all I wanted was some
She's got a whole lot of reasons
She can't think of a single one
That can justify leaving
And he got none but he thinks he got so many problems
Man he got too much time to waste
His dreams are like commercials
But her dreams are picture perfect and
Our dreams are so related though they're often underestimated
It's as simple as something that nobody knows
That her eyes are as big as her bubbly toes
On the feet of the queen of the hearts of the cards
And her feet are all covered with tar balls and

Well I was eating lunch at the DLG
When this little girl came and she sat next to me
I've never seen nobody move the way she did
Well she did and she does and she'll do it again
When you move like a jellyfish rhythm doesn't mean nothing
It's as common as something that nobody knows
That her beauty will follow wherever she goes
Up the hill in the back of her house in the woods
She la da da da da da

If you would only listen
You might just realize what you're missing
You're missing me
If you would only listen
You might just realize what you're missing
You're missing me
It's as simple as something that nobody knows
That her eyes are as big as her bubbly toes
On the feet of the queen of the hearts of the cards

The children's laughter sang
And skipping just like the stones they threw
Their voices echoed across the waves
It's getting late
It was just another night
With a sunset and a moonrise not so far behind
To give us just enough light to lay down underneath the stars
Listen to Papa's translations of the stories across the sky
We drew our own constellations
The west winds often last too long
And when they calm down nothing ever feels the same
Sheltered under the Kamani tree
Waiting for the passing rain
Clouds keep moving to uncover the sea
Of stars up above us chasing the day away
To find the stories that we sometimes need
Listen close enough  all else fades
Fades away
It was just another night
With a sunset and a moonrise not so far behind
To give us just enough light to lay down underneath the stars
Listen to all the translations of the stories across the sky
Will it ever stop?
How will this all play out
By now we should know how to communicate
And there ain't no stopping us now
We're burning under control
Isn't it strange how we're all
Burning under the same sun?
It's the same old game
But do we really want to play?
We could say it's us against them
We could try but nobody wins
Gravity has got a hold on us all
Could try to put it out
But it's a growing flame
Using fear as fuel
Burning down our name
And it won't take too long
'Cause words all burn the same
And who we're gonna blame now in all?
You might also like
By now it's beginning to show
A number of people are numbers that ain't coming home
I could close my eyes it's still there
Close my mind be alone
I could close my heart and not care
But gravity has got a hold on us all
It's a terrific price to pay
But in the true sense of the word
Are we using what we've learned?
In the true sense of the word
Are we losing what we were?
It's such a tired game
Will it ever stop?
It's not for me to say
And is it in our blood?
Or is it just our fate?
And how will this all play out?
And who we're gonna blame all in all?
It was sometime in early September
I was so crazy about you I didn't mind
I guess that I was afraid that if you rolled away
You might not roll back my direction real soon
Well I was crazy about you then and now the craziest thing of all
Is over ten years have gone by
Let's rewind
Do you remember when we first moved in together?
The piano took up the living room
We built our getaway up in a tree we found
Now I remember watching that old tree burn down
I took a picture that I don't like to look at

Over ten years have gone by
But you're still mine
So while she lay there sleeping  I read the paper in bed
And in the personal columns  there was this letter that read:
If you like Piña Coladas  and getting caught in the rain
If you're not into yoga  if you have half-a-brain
If you like making love at midnight  in the dunes of the cape
I didn't think about my lady  I know that sounds kind of mean
But me and my old lady
Had fallen into the same old dull routine
So I wrote to the paper  Took out a personal ad
And though I'm nobody's poet  I thought it wasn't half-bad
I'm not much into health food  but I am into champagne
I've got to meet you by tomorrow
And cut through all this red tape
At a bar called Scrappy Malloy's  we'll plan our escape.
So I waited with high hopes  then she walked in the place
I knew her smile in an instant  I knew the curve of her face
If you like making love at midnight  in the dunes of the cape
But you can make it up next time
I know she knows it's not right
There ain't no use in lying
Maybe she thinks I know something
Or maybe she knows something I don't
It seems to me that maybe
It pretty much always means no
So don't tell me you might just let it go
And often times we're lazy
It seems to stand in my way
I know she loves the sunrise
No longer sees it with her sleeping eyes
And I know that when she said she's going to try
Well it might not work because of other ties and
I know she usually has some other ties and
Maybe she'll help me to untie this but

It seems to me that maybe
It pretty much always means no
So don't tell me you might just let it go
And often times we're lazy
It seems to stand in my way
It seems to me that maybe
It pretty much always means no
So don't tell me you might just let it go
Even with all the money in the whole wide world
And just like a tree down by the water baby I shall not move
Even after all the silly things you do
And when I touch you my heart begins to flutter
'cause you're smooth and creamy like peanut butter
Girl I wanna lay you down
I said girl I wanna lay you down
I'm gonna flood you  like a love river
Awe baby the post man  is about to deliver
Cook you up some dinner  a little pasta
Listen to some music  a little Rasta
I said girl I wanna lay you down
I said girl I wanna lay you down
(Girl I wanna lay you down)
Aww baby baby
Don't you know I need your love!
So turn out the lights  bring out the candles
Wrap your arms around my love handles
They say the passion may not always endure
But this feeling that I have for you is burning up my world
Girl I wanna lay you down oooohhh
I said girl I wanna lay you down
Girl I wanna lay you down
I said Girl I wanna lay you down
I said Girl I wanna lay you down
Watching the twilight behind the telephone lines
Nothing to prove or to assume
Just thinking that your thoughts are different than mine
In my rear view  I watch you
And I give you your life  but you give me mine
I see you slowly swim away as the light is leaving town
To a place that I can't be  but there's no apologies
Just go on
Just go on
There's still so many things I wanna say to you
But go on
Just go on
We're bound by blood that's moving
From the moment that we start
From the moment that we start
I see your perfect little eyes watch the shadows of the clouds
On the surface of the ocean  out the window of a plane
I get nervous when I fly  I'm used to walking with my feet
Turbulence is like a sigh that I can't help but overthink
What is the purpose of my life if it doesn't have to do
With learning to let it go? Live vicariously through?
You could do the same  it's the least you could do
'Cause it's a lonely little chain if you don't add to it

So go on

There's still so many things I wanna say to you

There's still so many things I wanna say to you
Just go on
Just go on
We're bound by blood that's moving
From the moment that we start
Well look at all those fancy clothes
But these could keep us warm just like those
And what about your soul? Is it cold? Is it
Straight from the mold and ready to be sold?
And cars and phones and diamond rings
And what about your mind? Does it shine? Are
Are there things that concern you more than your time?
Gone be the birds  when they don't wanna sing
Gone
Look at you  out to make a deal
You try to be appealing  but you lose your peel
And what about those shoes you're in today?
They'll do no good on the bridges you burnt along the way  oh
You willing to sell anything? Gone  with your herd
Leave your footprints  we'll shame them with our words

Gone be the birds  if they don't wanna sing
So what's it going to be?
'Cause people will tune in
How many train wrecks do we need to see
Before we lose touch  oh
And we thought this was low
Well it's bad  getting worse so...
Where'd all the good people go?
I've been changing channels
I don't see them on the TV shows
Where'd all the good people go?
We got heaps and heaps of what we sow
They got this and that with a rattle a tat
Bad news misused  got too much to lose
Give me some truth now  whose side are we on
Whatever you say
Turn on the boob-tube  I'm in the mood to obey
So lead me astray
And by the way now...

We got heaps and heaps of what we sow
Sitting around feeling far away
So far away but I can feel the debris
Can you feel it?
You interrupt me from a friendly conversation
To tell me how great it's all going to be
You might notice some hesitation
Because it's important to you  it's not important to me
But way down by the edge of your whole reason
Well  it's beginning the show
And all I really want to know is...
Where'd all the good people go?
I've been changing channels
I don't see them on the TV shows
Where'd all the good people go?
We got heaps and heaps of what we sow
(Where'd all the good people go?)
They got this and that with a rattle a tat
Bad news misused give me some truth
You got too much to lose
Now whose side are we on today  anyway
(Where'd all the good people go?)
Okay  whatever you say
Wrong and resolute but in the mood to obey
Station to station desensitizing the nation
(Where'd all the good people go?)
There's food on the ground and the birds have all moved back
I will patch all the holes up again
And so I tried to understand what I can't hold in my hand
And if you could try to find it too
In the back of our house there's a trail that won't end
And there's no trail at all only grass growing taller
Get out my machete and battle with time once again
But I'm bound to lose 'cause I'll be down if time don't win

All the seeds from the fruits buried and began their
And this old trail will lead me right back to where it begins
And so I tried to understand what I can't hold in my hand
And if you could try to find it too
You don't really know what to do
Do you think that you're not alone?
You really think that you are immune to it
It's going to get that the best of you
It's going to lift you up and let you down
Mmm-mmm-mmm
It will defeat you then teach you to get back up
After it takes away all that you learned to love
Your reflection is a blur
Out of focus but in confusion
The frames are suddenly burnt
And in the end of a roll of illusion
Is a ghost waiting its turn
Now I can see right through
It's a warning that nobody heard
It will teach you to love what you're afraid of
After it takes away all that you learned to love

But you don't always have to hold your head
Higher than your heart
You better hope you're not alone
You better hope you're not alone

You better hope you're not alone
You better hope you're not alone
You better be hoping you're not so
Hope you're not alone
Now you can quite get used to it
Reverb is just a room
The problem is that there's no truth to it
It's fading way too soon
The shadow is on the move
And maybe you should be moving too
Before it takes away all that you learned to love
It will defeat you then teach you to get back up
'Cause you don't always have to hold your head
Higher than your heart
You better hope you're not alone
You better hope you're not alone
You better hope you're not alone
You better be hoping you're not alone
You better hope you're not alone
You better hope you're not alone
You better hope you're not alone
You better hope you're not so
Hope you're not alone
Better ho-oh-oh-oh-ope
Every pot of gold feeling full of distortion
But soon
I got you
I don't need nothing more than you
We went walking through the hills trying to pretend that we both know
Maybe if we save up we could build a little home
I got you
I don't need nothing more than you
This weight's too much alone
Some days I can't hold it at all
You take it on for me

 baby cried  said your tears are like mine
 didn't sound so good
 I'd give him more if I could
 one comes in
I would have told you that you looked good as I walked away
If you could have tried to trust the hand that fed
You would've never been hungry but you never really be
The more of this or less of this or is there any difference
Or are we just holding onto the things we don't have anymore
Sometimes time doesn't heal
Just stand still
While we fall
I'm going to win you back when you got eyes like that
It won't let me in
Always looking out
Lot of people spend their time just floating
We were victims together but lonely
You got hungry eyes that just can't look forward
Can't give them enough but we just can't start over
Building with bent nails we're falling but holding
I don't want to take up anymore of your time

It's better when we're together baby
You look so pretty sleeping next to me
But you'll never never know
We feel so certain
But we don't know a thing
Cept for when I wake up in the morning
And im sitting in the shade
Eating banana pancakes we made
With all the good people
Really not so hard to find
Theres no other way
When my mind is a mess well
I think that its best that we wait
So im sitting waiting wishing
That you will believe in some kind of
Superstitions baby
Then you could see if we staple it together
And call it bad weather
Oh na na here I come
The kids are laughing in their sleep
Swimming through their dreams into the morning
So peaceful all the stories that we're told
Lead them through the night back from the shadows
So much joy every little girl and boy
Even better when they wake up tomorrow
So much love
In their little mistletee
Going to miss you until we meet again in the morning
So much peace in their pitter-patter feet
Any open eyes can see that minds are reaching
So much joy
I'm afraid to be swept away
Upstream there's a spring that brings in the new day
These are the gifts we keep
And this is the morning that we breathe
And then we see
These moments are the only gifts we need

Your maka piapia stare
Smiling down from the top of the stairs
You're so sweet
And your robot pictures spread around
I swear your feet don't touch the ground
Once it starts it don't slow down
But I don't want it to
And these are the gifts we keep
And this is the morning that we breathe
And then we see
Itsy-bitsy diamond wells
Big fat hurricanes
Yellow-bellied given names
Well shortcuts can slow you down
And in the end we're bound
To rebound off of we
Well dust off your thinking caps
Solar powered plastic plants
Pretty pictures of things we ate
We are only what we hate
But in the long run we have found
Silent films are full of sound
Inaudibly free
Slow down everyone
You're moving too fast
Frames can't catch you when
You're moving like that
Inaudible melodies
Serve narrational strategies
Unobtrusive tones
Help to notice nothing but the zone
Of visual relevancy
Frame-lines tell me what to see
Chopping like an axe
Or maybe Eisenstein should just relax

Well Plato's cave is full of freaks
Demanding refunds for the things they've seen
I wish they could believe
In all the things that never made the screen
And just slow down everyone
You're moving too fast
Frames can't catch you when
You're moving like that
Slow down everyone
You're moving too fast
Frames can't catch you when
And you were an ocean away from me
Didn't know what I wanted yet
But you were already listening to The Pixies
And we were a little shy
And you were still an arm's length away from me
Didn't know what I wanted yet
But you were already reading beat poetry
And we were a little free
When we were seven seas away from anything
Finally knew what I wanted then
But you were already my best friend
When you were teaching geometry
And we were both living off of your salary
I wanna thank you for not kicking me out
I wanna thank you for letting me live in our house
I wanna thank you for letting me live in our house

Finally we made a family
Make a little home then
Fill it up with children
Irrelevant if we're just stardust
This dusty old world won't rest and
These dusty little kids keep stretching high
Just like the tide
When you were a little middle-aged like me
And we were already 15 love songs deep
You might not know this song
This is not the kind of song that you can sing along to but
Hey  little girl
Maybe someday
At least that's what all the good people will say
Hey  little girl
Look what you've done
You've gone and stole my heart and made it your own
You stole my heart and made it your own
Hey  little girl
Black and white and right and wrong
Only live inside a song  I will sing to you
You don't ever have to feel lonely
You will never lose any tears
You don't have to feel any sadness
When you look back on the years
How can I look you in the eyes
And tell you such big lies?
The best I can do is try to show you
How to love with no fear

I heard he likes to race
I heard that six or seven words he likes to use
Are always in bad taste
And I heard that Monday's just a word we say
Every seven times around
And then we pin the tail on Tuesday
And watch those strings go up and down
The elephant in the room begins to dance  the cameras zoom into
His mouth begins to move
Those hateful words he uses
I don't care for your paranoid
Us against them walls
I don't care for your careless
Me first gimme gimme appetite at all
And all the real estate in my mind
Is for sale  it's all been subdivided
Divided into reasons why
My two opposing thoughts at once are fine
The residue from the price tag on the tip of my tongue
The words don't come  they go
How many likes I gotta get
Before I know the truth and the truth is
Season three will be a great reason
To forget all about
Reality's a slippery slope
Watch the TV scream and shout it

I don't care for your paranoid

Now I heard the blinker's on  I heard we're changing lanes
I heard we need more space
I heard that six or seven words
Are in bad taste
It's absurd to believe that we might
Deserve anything  as if it's
Balanced in the end
And the good guys always win
I don't care for your paranoid
Us against them fearful kind of walls
I don't care for your careless
Me first gimme gimme appetite
With the residue from the price tag
On those two opposing thoughts in my mind
But don't leave much up to the imagination
So I want to give this imagery back
But I know it just ain't so easy like that
So I turn the page
And read the story again and again and again
It sure seems the same
With a different name
We're breaking and rebuilding
Never knowing
We're shocking but we're nothing
We're just moments
We're clever but we're clueless
We're just human
Amusing and confusing
We're trying
But where is this all leading?
We'll never know
It all happened so much
Faster than you can say disaster
Want to take a time-lapse
And look at it backwards find the last word
And maybe that's just the answer
That we're afterBut after all
We're just a bubble in a boiling pot just
One breath in a chain of thought
We're moments just combusting
We feel certain but we'll never never know
It sure seems the same
Give it a different name
We're begging and we're needing
And we're trying and we're breathing
Never knowing
We're shocking but we're nothing
We're just moments
We're clever but we're clueless
We're just human
Amusing and confusing
We're helping
To tell you that their metaphor is better than yours
And you can either sink or swim
And things are looking pretty grim
If you don't believe in what they're spoon-feeding
It's got no feeling
So I read it again and again and again

It sure seems the same
So many different names
We'll always be competing
Never knowing
We're shocking but we're nothing
We're just moments
We're clever but we're clueless
We're just human
Amusing and confusing
But the true things
All we got is questions
We'll never know
'Cause it hurts when I think my thoughts aren't at peace
With the plans that we make  the chances we take
They're not yours  they're not mine
There's waves that can break
All the words that we said and the words that we mean
Words can fall short  can't see the unseen
'Cause the world is awake for somebody's sake
Now please close your eyes
Woman  please get some sleep
And know that if I knew all of the answers
I would not hold them from you
Know all of the things that I know
We told each other there is no other way
Too much silence can be misleading
You're drifting  I can hear it in the way that you're breathing
We don't really need to find reason
'Cause out the same door that it came well it's leaving  it's leaving
Leaving like a day that's done and part of a season
Resolve is just a concept that's as dead as the leaves
But at least we could sleep  it's all that we need
When we wake we would find  our minds would be free
To go to sleep

They go out with the tide and come back with the waves  so
It's only the ocean and you
You don't want  you don't wait
You don't love oh  but you don't hate
You just roll over me
And you pull me in
When this work is done and this coat is dry
When this world's too much  it will be
Only the ocean and me
When these sails go up  mountains fade away
Stars come out  I'm finally free
It's only the ocean and me

Turn on the lights  gettin' ready for tonight
Nobody's romancin' 'cause it's too early for dancin'
But here comes the music
Bright lights flashin' to cover up your lack of
So many people  so many problems  so many reasons
To buy another round  drink it down
Just another night on the town
With the big man  money man  better than the other man
He got the plan with the million dollar give a damn
When nobody understands  he'll become a smaller man
The bright lights keep flashin'  women keep on dancin'
They pick me up when I'm down  yeah  yeah
Pick me up when I'm down
The disco ball spinnin'  all the music and the women and
The shots of tequila  man they'll say that they need ya
What they really need  is just a little room to breath
Teeny boppin' disco queen  she barely understands
Her dreams of belly button rings and other kinds of things
Symbolic of change but the thing that is strange
Is that the changes occurred  and now she's just a part of the herd

And if you ever saw it
You might even say it glows
And all of the other reindeer
Used to laugh and call him names
They never let poor Rudolph
Join in any reindeer games
Then one foggy Christmas Eve
Won't you guide my sleigh tonight?
As they shouted out with glee
Rudolph the red-nosed reindeer
You'll go down in history
How can you look me in the face when only yesterday you called me names?
We're truly gonna try
You believed in superstitions
Then maybe you'd see the signs
But Lord knows that this world is cruel
And I ain't the Lord  no I'm just a fool
Learning loving somebody don't make them love you
Must I always be waiting  waiting on you?
Must I always be playing  playing your fool?
I sang your songs  I danced your dance
I gave your friends all a chance
But putting up with them wasn't worth never having you
Ah  maybe you've been through this before
But it's my first time so please ignore
The next few lines 'cause they're directed at you
I can't always be waiting  waiting on you
I can't always be playing  playing your fool
I keep playing your part
But it's not my scene
Want this plot to twist
I've had enough mystery
Keep building it up
But then you're shooting me down
But I'm already down

And if I was I wouldn't be so cruel
'Cause waiting on love ain't so easy to do
Must I always be waiting  waiting on you?
Must I always be playing  playing your fool?
No I can't always be waiting  waiting on you
I can't always be playing  playing your fool
It's the one that's just begun
But evidently it's too late
Situation number two
It's the only chance for you
It's controlled by denizens of hate
Situation number three
It's the one that no one sees
It's all too often dismissed as fate
Situation number four
The one that left you wanting more
It tantalized you with its bait
When you're specially designed for crash testing
Or wearing wool sunglasses in the afternoon
Come on and tell us what you're trying to prove
Because it's a battle when you dabble in war
Whether the storm drain running rampant just stamp it
And send it to somebody who's pretending to care
Just cash in your blanks for little toy Tanks
Learn how to use them
Then abuse them and choose them over conversations
Relationships are overrated
I hated everyone said the sun
And so I will cook all your books
You're too good looking and mistaken
You could watch it instead
From the comfort of your burning beds
Or you can sleep through the static
Who needs sleep when we've got love?
Who needs keys when we've got clubs?
Who needs please when we've got guns?
Who needs peace when we've gone above
But beyond where we should have gone?
We went beyond where we should have gone

Stuck between channels my thoughts all quit
The feelings that rained down on the plains all dried and cracked
Waiting for things that never came
Shock and awful thing to make somebody think
That they have to choose pushing for peace supporting the troops
And either you're weak or you'll use brute force-feed the truth
The truth is we say not as we do
Pick up the beat and stop hogging the feast
That's no way to treat an enemy
We just eat them up and keep on driving
Freedom can be freezing take a picture from the pretty side
Mind your manners wave your banners
What a wonderful world that this angle can see
I no longer see our unborn children
Under the tree where we once talked
Of an old couple burning their love letters
So that the children won't be shocked
Love calls just like the wild birds
Spring wind blew my list of
Things to do away
All my friends are gettin' older
I guess I must be too
I don't know what I'll do
The money's all been spent
And we're a cross between our parents and
Hippies in a tent
Love calls just like the wild birds
Spring wind blew my list of
Things to do away

He stabbed the moment in the back with the round thumbtack
That held up the list of things he got to do

Caught from the places that he did 'cause he forgot to look

If the weather gets better we should get together
Spend a little time or we could do whatever
And if we get together we'd be twice as clever
The gordian knot must be cut through
Which part of yourself can you afford to lose?
If you show me your list  then I will show you mine
Let's kill off a character or two
All the light under the sun
And all the light above it  too
Is gonna rise and shine
And all the light under the sun
And all the light above it  too
It don't shine for you
Like the joy and the tear in your eye
Like the little star that could
Could you remember every mistake that you made?
At least all the ones you should (have made)
If you make it your wish  then I will make it mine

Run from the shadows or relax in the shade
Which road you gonna choose?
We've all got places to be  we've all got things to do
We've all got this moment  it's ours to lose

Is about last night when the sun went down
And the warm wind blows in that same old sound
And the water below gives a gift to the sky
And the clouds give back every time they cry
And make the grass grow green beneath my toes
And if the sun comes out I'll paint a picture all about
The colors I've been dreaming of
The hours just don't seem enough
To put it all together
Maybe it's as strange as it seems
Hmm hmm hmm hmm
And the trouble I find is that the trouble finds me
And a feeling I get when I look and I see
And put it all together and then I'll rearrange it
I'll follow it forever

It's enough to make me cry
But that don't seem like it would make it feel better
Maybe it's a dream and if I scream it will burst at the seams
Whole place would fall into pieces

Brand new shoes  walking blues
Climb the fence  books and pens
I can tell that we are going to be friends
Yes  I can tell that we are going to be friends
Walk with me  Suzy Lee
Through the park and by the tree
We can rest upon the ground
And look at all the bugs we've found
Safely walk to school without a sound
We safely walk to school without a sound
Well  here we are no one else
We walk to school all by ourselves
There's dirt on our uniforms
From chasing all the ants and worms

You broken king
Watch you change the frame or
Watch you when you take your aim at the sum

But you and your heart
Shouldn't feel so far apart
You can choose what you take
Why you got to break and make it feel so hard
You lay there in the street
Like broken glass reflecting pieces of the sun
But you're not the flame
You got the people passing by
Because you know what you don't like
