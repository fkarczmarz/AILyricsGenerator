lyrics
"I don't know who to trust anymore
There's a shadow running through my days
Like a beggar goin' from door to door
I was thinkin' that maybe I'd get a maid
Find a place nearby for her to stay
Just someone to keep my house clean
Fix my meals and go away
A maid
A man needs a maid
A maid
It's hard to make that change
When life and love turns strange
And cold
To give a love
You gotta live a love
To live a love
You gotta be part of
When will I see you again?

A while ago somewhere I don't know when
I was watchin' a movie with a friend
I fell in love with the actress
She was playin' a part that I could understand
A maid
A man needs a maid
A maid
A man needs a maid
Sayin' something about a queen
There were peasants singin' and drummers drummin'
And the archer split the tree
There was a fanfare blowin' to the sun
That was floating on the breeze
Look at Mother Nature on the run
In the 1970s
Look at Mother Nature on the run
In the 1970s
I was lyin' in a burned out basement
With the full moon in my eyes
I was hopin' for replacement
When the sun burst through the sky
There was a band playin' in my head
And I felt like getting high
I was thinkin' about what a friend had said
I was hopin' it was a lie
Thinkin' about what a friend had said
I was hopin' it was a lie
In the yellow haze of the sun
There were children cryin' and colors flyin'
All around the chosen ones
The loadin' had begun
Flying Mother Nature's silver seed
To a new home in the sun
Flying Mother Nature's silver seed
The devil fools with the best laid plan
Swing low  Alabama
You got the spare change  you got to feel strange
And now the moment is all that it meant
Alabama  you got the weight on your shoulders
That's breaking your back
Your Cadillac has got a wheel in the ditch
And a wheel on the track
Oh  Alabama
Banjos playing through the broken glass
Windows down in Alabama
See the old folks tied in white robes
Hear the banjo  don't it take you down home?
Alabama  you got the weight on your shoulders
That's breaking your back
Your Cadillac has got a wheel in the ditch
And a wheel on the track

Oh  Alabama
Can I see you and shake your hand?
Make friends down in Alabama
I'm from a new land  I come to you and
See all this ruin  what are you doing?
Alabama  you've got the rest of the Union
To help you along
The air was magic when we played
The Riverboat was rocking in the rain
Midnight was the time for the raid
They tore you down and plowed you under
You're only real with your make-up on
How could I see you and stay too long?
All along the Navajo Trail
Burn-outs stub their toes on garbage pails
Waitresses are crying in the rain
Will their boyfriends pass this way again?
She needs someone that she can scream at
And I'm such a heel for making her feel so bad
I guess I'll call it sickness gone
It's hard to say the meaning of this song
An ambulance can only go so fast
It's easy to get buried in the past
When you try to make a good thing last

I saw today in the entertainment section
There's room at the top for private detection
To Mom and Dad this just doesn't matter
But it's either that or pay off the kidnapper
So all you critics sit alone
You're no better than me for what you've shown
With your stomach pump and your hook and ladder dreams
We could get together for some scenes
And out on the corner it's half past five
But the subways are empty
And so are the cafes
Except for the Farmer's Market
And I still can hear him say:
You're all just pissing in the wind
You don't know it but you are
And there ain't nothing like a friend
Who can tell you you're just pissing in the wind
I never knew a man could tell so many lies
He had a different story for every set of eyes
How can he remember who he's talking to?
 you know
Who'll hover over you beneath the sun
Tomorrow  see the things that never come today
When you see me fly away without you
Shadow on the things you know
Feathers fall around you
And show you the way to go
It's over  it's over
Nestled in your wings  my little one
Is special  morning brings another sun
Tomorrow  see the things that never come today
When you see me fly away without you
Shadow on the things you know
Feathers fall around you
And show you the way to go
My head in the clouds
I hope that it matters
I'm having my doubts
I'm watching the skaters
Fly by on the lake
Ice frozen six feet deep
How long does it take?
I look out on peaceful lands
With no war nearby
An ocean of shaking hands
That grab at the sky
I'm singing this borrowed tune
I took from the Rolling Stones
Alone in this empty room
Too wasted to write my own
I'm climbing this ladder
My head in the clouds
Comes a time when you settle down
Lift that baby right up off the ground
It's a wonder tall trees ain't layin' down
There comes a time
We took our souls and we flew away
That's how we kept what we gave away
It's a wonder tall trees ain't layin' down
There comes a time

With the lorries rolling by
Blue moon sinking from the weight of the load
And the buildings scrape the sky
Cold wind ripping down the alley at dawn
And the morning paper flies
Dead man lying by the side of the road
With the daylight in his eyes
Don't let it bring you down
It's only castles burning
Find someone who's turning
And you will come around
Blind man running through the light of the night
With an answer in his hand
Come on down to the river of sight
And you can really understand
Red lights flashing through the window in the rain
Can you hear the sirens moan?

Who charge ten dollars at the door
You can really learn a lot that way
It will change you in the middle of the day
Though your confidence may be shattered
It doesn't matter
All the great explorers
Are now in granite laid
Under white sheets for the great unveiling
At the big parade
You can really learn a lot that way
It will change you in the middle of the day
Though your confidence may be shattered
It doesn't matter
All the bush league batters
Are left to die on the diamond
In the stands the home crowd scatters
For the turnstiles
For the turnstiles
Weather's good there in the fall
I got some friends that I could go to working for
Still I wish you'd change your mind
If I ask you one more time
But we've been through this a hundred times or more
Four strong winds that blow lonely
Seven seas that run high
If the good times are all gone
Then I'm bound for movin' on
I'll look for you if I'm ever back this way
If I get there before the snow flies
And if things are lookin' good
You could meet me if I send you down the fare
But by then it would be winter
Not too much for you to do
And those winds sure can blow cold way out there
Four strong winds that blow lonely
Seven seas that run high
The good times are all gone
So I'm bound for movin' on

Can we get it together? Can we still stand side by side?
Can we make it last like a musical ride?
From Marilyn to Madonna  I always loved your smile
Now we're headed for the big divorce  California-style
I found myself singing like a long-lost friend
The same thing that makes you live can kill you in the end
Can we get it together? Can we still stand side by side?

Sometimes the beauty of love just comes ringing through

Finding that what you once thought was real

Now that you made yourself love me
Do you think I can change it in a day?
How can I place you above me?
Am I lying to you when I say
That I believe in you?
I feel my doubts
Wishing that maybe in a year or two we could laugh
And let it all out
Now that you made yourself love me
Do you think I can change it in a day?
How can I place you above me?
Am I lying to you when I say
That I believe in you?
Couldn't stop though  so I let the moment last
I'm for rolling  I'm for tossing in my sleep
It's not guilt though  it's not the company I keep
People my age  they don't do the things I do
They go somewhere while I run away with you
And I've got my friends  and I've got my children too
And I got her love  she's got my love too
I can't hear you  but I feel the things you say
I can't see you  but I see what's in my way
Now I'm floating  'cause I'm not tied to the ground
Words I've spoken seem to leave a hollow sound
On the long plain  see the rider in the night
See the chieftain  see the braves in cool moonlight
Who will love them when they take another life?
Who will hold them when they tremble for the knife?

Screaming sirens echoing across the bay

Homeless heroes walk the streets of their hometowns
Rows of zeros on a field that's turning brown
They play baseball  they play football under lights
They play card games and we watch them every night
Need distraction  need romance and candlelight
Need random violence  need entertainment tonight
Need the evidence  want the testimony of
Expert witnesses on the brutal crimes of love
I was too tired to see the news when I got home
Pulled the curtain  fell into bed alone
Started dreaming  saw the rider once again
In the doorway  where she stood and watched for him
Watched for him
I'm not present  I'm a drug that makes you dream
I'm an Aerostar  I'm a Cutlass Supreme
In the wrong lane  trying to turn against the flow
I'm the ocean  I'm the giant undertow

When the winter rains come pourin' down
On that new home of mine
Will you think of me and wonder if I'm fine?
Will your restless heart come back to mine
On a journey through the past?
Will I still be in your eyes and on your mind?
Now I'm going back to Canada
On a journey through the past
And I won't be back 'til February comes
I will stay with you if you'll stay with me
Said the fiddler to the drum
And we'll keep good time on a journey through the past
When the winter rains come pourin' down
On that new home of mine
Will I still be in your eyes and on your mind?
A home away from home and I'm living in between
But I hear some people have got their dream
I've got mine
I hear the mountains are doing fine
Morning glory is on the vine
And the dew is fallin'
The ducks are callin'
They think they got it made
Anything I have to be like one of them
I'd rather start all over again
And I'll stand before you
And I'll bring a smile to your eyes
Motion pictures
Rock and roll is here to stay
It's better to burn out than to fade away
My my  hey hey
Out of the blue and into the black
They give you this  but you pay for that
And once you're gone you can never come back
When you're out of the blue and into the black
The king is gone but he's not forgotten
This is the story of a Johnny Rotten
It's better to burn out than it is to rust
The king is gone but he's not forgotten
Hey hey  my my
Rock and roll can never die
There's more to the picture than meets the eye

Was the best old hound dog I ever did know

Crying on the ground

And the wagons come
And the night falls

Until the end of all time
No one else can kill me like you do
No one else can fill me like you do
Love is a healer
And I love you
No one else can fill me like you do
No one else can kill me like you do
And I love you
With the barkers and the colored balloons
You can't be 20 on Sugar Mountain
Though you're thinking that
You're leavin' there too soon
You're leavin' there too soon
It's so noisy at the fair
But all your friends are there
And the candy floss you had
And your mother and your dad
Oh to live on Sugar Mountain
With the barkers and the colored balloons
You can't be 20 on Sugar Mountain
Though you're thinking that
You're leavin' there too soon
You're leavin' there too soon
There's a girl just down the aisle
Oh to turn and see her smile
You can hear the words she wrote
As you read the hidden note

You can't be 20 on Sugar Mountain
Though you're thinking that
You're leavin' there too soon

Now you're underneath the stairs
And you're giving back some glares
To the people who you met
And it's your first cigarette
Oh to live on Sugar Mountain
With the barkers and the colored balloons
You can't be 20 on Sugar Mountain
Though you're thinking that
You're leavin' there too soon
You're leavin' there too soon
Now you say you're leaving home
Because you want to be alone
Ain't it funny how you feel
When you're findin' out it's real?

Out on the waves in the night
Still the searcher must ride the dark horse
Racing alone in his fright
Tell me why

Is it hard to make arrangements with yourself
When you're old enough to repay
But young enough to sell?
I'll be around for a while
I am lonely but you can free me
All in the way that you smile
Tell me why
Tell me why
Is it hard to make arrangements with yourself
When you're old enough to repay

Is it hard to make arrangements with yourself
When you're old enough to repay
Like a cross of himself and a fox
He's a feeling arranger
And a changer of the ways he talks
He's the unforeseen danger
The keeper of the key to the locks
Know when you see him
Nothing can free him
It's the loner
If you see him in the subway
He'll be down at the end of the car
Watching you move
Until he knows he knows who you are
When you get off at your station alone
He'll know that you are
Know when you see him
Nothing can free him
It's the loner

There was a woman he knew
About a year or so ago
She had something that he needed
And he pleaded with her not to go
On the day that she left
He died but it did not show
Know when you see him
Nothing can free him
 can I have some more?
 the damage done
 the damage done
No one else has your part
All God's children in the wind
Take it in and blow hard
Walking down the avenue?
In the air for you
Come with us to all alone
We will leave you all alone
You can see the dream
Is it what it seems?
There's a world you're living in
No one else has your part
All God's children in the wind
They were planting in the full moon
They had given all they had
For something new
But the light of day was on them
They could see the thrashers coming
And the water shone like diamonds
In the dew
And I was just getting up
Hit the road before it's light
Trying to catch an hour on the sun
When I saw those thrashers rollin' by
Looking more than two lanes wide
I was feeling like my day had just begun
Where the eagle glides descending
There's an ancient river bending
Through the timeless gorge of changes
Where sleeplessness awaits
I searched out my companions
Who were lost in crystal canyons
When the aimless blade of science
Slashed the pearly gates
It was then I knew I'd had enough
Burned my credit card for fuel
Headed out to where the pavement turns to sand
With a one-way ticket to the land of truth
And my suitcase in my hand
How I lost my friends I still don't understand

They had the best selection
They were poisoned with protection
There was nothing that they needed
Nothing left to find
They were lost in rock formations
Or became park bench mutations
On the sidewalks and in the stations
So I got bored and left them there
They were just dead weight to me
Better down the road without that load
Brings back the time when I was eight or nine
I was watching my mama's TV
It was that great Grand Canyon rescue episode
Where the vulture glides descending
On an asphalt highway bending
Through libraries and museums
Galaxies and stars
Down the windy halls of friendship
To the rose clipped by the bullwhip
The motel of lost companions
Waits with heated pool and bar
But me I'm not stopping there
Got my own row left to hoe
Just another line in the field of time
When the thrasher comes I'll be stuck in the sun
Like the dinosaurs in shrines
And they left them lyin' in an open field
Full of old cars with bullet holes in the mirrors
He tried to do his best but he could not
Please take my advice
Please take my
Please take my advice
Open up the tired eyes
Open up the tired eyes
And they left him lying in the driveway
They let him down with nothing
He tried to do his best but he could not
Please take my advice
Please take my advice

Bruce Berry was a working man
He used to load that Econoline van
A sparkle was in his eye
But his life was in his hands
He used to pick up my guitar
And sing a song in a shaky voice
That was real as the day was long

If you never heard him sing

It sent a chill up and down my spine

And heard that he'd died out on the mainline

I used to order just to watch her float across the floor
She grew up in a small town  never put her roots down
Daddy always kept moving so she did too
Somewhere on a desert highway  she rides a Harley-Davidson
Her long blonde hair flying in the wind
She's been running half her life  the chrome and steel she rides
Colliding with the very air she breathes
The air she breathes
You know it ain't easy  you got to hold on
She was an unknown legend in her time
Now she's dressing two kids  looking for a magic kiss
She gets the faraway look in her eyes
Somewhere on a desert highway  she rides a Harley-Davidson
Her long blonde hair flying in the wind
She's been running half her life  the chrome and steel she rides
Colliding with the very air she breathes

I'm a vampire  baby  sucking blood from the earth
I'm a black bat  baby  banging on your window pane

Good times are comin'  I hear it everywhere I go

Looking for something to plant in the lawn
I'm sitting here hoping this water will boil
When I look through the window and out on the road
They're bringing me presents and sayin' hello
Between the lines of age
Between the lines of age
If I was a junkman selling your cars
Washing your windows and shining your stars
Thinking your mind was my own in a dream
What would you wonder and how would it seem?
Living in castles a bit at a time
The King started laughing and talking in rhyme
Between the lines of age
Open up and let the light back in
Open up your heart  let the loving start
Open up and let the light back in
I was thinkin' of you and me making love beneath the tree
And now I wonder could it be?
Guitar fighting the TV
I was thinkin' about you and me
I was thinkin' about you and me
I was thinkin' of you and me
I was thinkin' about you and me
Looking at you just the other night  dancing in the evening light
True love conquers all
When he hears his children call
I was thinkin' about you and me
I was thinkin' about you and me
I was thinkin'' of you and me
I was thinkin' about you and me
