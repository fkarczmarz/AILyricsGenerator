lyrics
"The garbage truck beeps as it backs up
And I start my day thinking about what I've thrown away
Could I push rewind?
Forgive my indecision
11 AM
By now you would think that I would be up
But my bed sheets shade the heat of choices I've made
And what did I find?
I never thought I could want someone so much
'Cause now you're not here and I'm knee deep in that old fear
Forgive my indecision
I am only a man

12 PM and my dusty telephone rings
I hope it's you
It's you
What! What! What! What!
What! What! What! What!
A certain shade of green
All signs around say move ahead
Could someone please explain to me your ever present lack of speed?
Are your muscles bound by ropes?
Or do crutches cloud your day?
My sources say the road is clear
And street signs point the way
Are you gonna stand around until 2012 A.D.?
I think I grew a gray watching you procrastinate
Would a written invitation
Sedate your hesitation
Or inflame and make you stall?
You've been raised in limitation
But that glove never fit quite right
The time has passed for hand-me-downs

Ditch what I read behind what I heard

Nothing else in the world but one another
The 42nd floor on a distant shore
I wonder how we strayed so far from this
May have forgotten how good your world could be  so
Put down your hollow tips and kiss your lover's lips
And know that fate is what you make of it
I wanna stay inside
I wanna stay inside for good
I wanna stay inside
I read the news today and everything they say
Just makes me wanna stay inside and wait
But a part of me knows that waiting in the throes
Is on a par with reading with my eyes closed
What can I do? you say  it's just another day
In the life of apes with ego trips
Put down your hollow tips and kiss your lover's lips

I watch the ships pass and wonder if she might be
Out there and sober as well from loneliness
I picture your face at the back of my eyes
A cloud hangs over and mutes my happiness
A thousand ships couldn't sail me back from distress
Wish you were here I'm a wounded satellite
I picture your face at the back of my eyes
I'm calling your name up into the air
Not one of the others could ever compare!
There is a fire
Illuminated attic
I could care less
Just stay with me a while

De-fragmenting the attic

Oars freed from their holes long ago
Lying face up on the floor of my vessel
I marvel at the stars and feel my heart overflow
Further down the river

Two weeks without my lover
I'm in this boat alone
Floating down a river named emotion
Will I make it back to shore or drift into the unknown
Further down the river

Transmissions will be sent when I am through
Maybe we could meet again further down the river

Because I've only got room for two
Me and my burdened black heart
It's all we know how to do
Yet I look for a bigger bang
Than the kind I continually see
Sick of all this inertia
I want a human being
I'm a child lost in the woods
A black heart pollutes me
And I think
You're a mountain that I'd like to climb
Pulled by a false inertia
Pushed out by circumstance
Pistol firing at my feet
That's coercing me to dance
Yet I look for a bigger bang
Than the kind I'm sorry to know
Watch me go

I'm afraid of what I might say
I bite my tongue everytime you come around
'Cause blood in my mouth beats blood on the ground
Hand over my heart  I swear I've tried
Everything I could within all my power
Two weeks and one hour I slaved
And now I've got nothing to show
From now on I'm going to start holding my breath
When you come around and you flex that fake grin
'Cause something inside me has said more than twice
That breathing less air beats breathing you in
I don't want to talk to you anymore
I'm afraid of what I might say
I bite my tongue everytime you come around
'Cause blood in my mouth beats blood on the ground
Good judgment is once again proving to me
That it's still worth its weight in gold

I've seen that porcelain shell  your exoskeleton
And I feel like we'd walk well
Together
Because in the end
We are friends and lovers

The things that wall us off
From where we belong
What's wrong with you is good for what's wrong with me
And I think maybe we should
Stick together
Because in the end
We are friends and lovers

Pink tractor beam into your incision
Head spinning as free as dervish's whirl

You do something to me that I can't explain
So would I be out of line if I said I miss you?
The empty pillow next to mine
You have only been gone ten days
But already I'm wasting away
But I need you to know that I care and I miss you
Swung from chandeliers and climbed Everest
And none of it's got me close to this
I've waited all my life
If not now  when will I?

Don't hide your eyes  it's time

A line was crossed  a vessel run aground
The boy is gone  let's grieve and let him go
In the company of wolves I sat in silence
Observant and afraid
He was there with the eyes like glowing embers

We'll behave like animals
Swing from tree to tree
We could do anything

Merely a payphone on a 1 am sidewalk
We're all cast aside and we're antiquated
Right as we start to finally figure out what we are
Look at you so bright  state of the art
Is everything they like  but the years have teeth
And sometimes they bite
Look at you  you're falling apart
Built to spill  you're state of the art
Now look at you  well look at you now
Now do you see that smile at the foot of the ladder
Ain't it familiar? That was you only yesterday
But this justice feels more like a poison apple
And inevitably everyone'll bite into it

Full moon illuminates my room
And sends my mind aflight
I think I was dreaming of some thoughts
That were seemingly possible with you
So I call you on the tin can phone
We rendezvous a quarter-to
And make sure we're alone
I think I've found a way for you and I to finally fly free
When we get there
We're gonna fly so far away
Making sure to laugh
While we experience anti-gravity
Anti-gravity

Now potentialities are bound
And living under my shelf
Simply choose your destination from the diamond canopy
And we'll be there

Wash them out with buzzing lights
Pay an audience to care
Impress me personality
Still and transfixed
The electric sheep are dreaming of your face
Enjoy you from the chemical
Comfort of America
Come one  come all
Into 1984
But quick  your time is almost up
Make all forget that they're the moth
Edging in towards the flame
Burn into obscurity
Still and transfixed
The electric sheep are dreaming up your fate
And judge you from the card castle
Comfort of America

Your foundation is canyoning
Fault lines should be worn with pride
I hate to say so much more
You're so much more
But there's a cold wind coming from
The top of the highest high-rise today
It's not a breeze 'cause it blows hard
Yes and it wants me to discard
The humanity I know  watch the warmth blow away
So don't let the world bring you down
Not everyone here is that fucked up and cold
Remember why you came and while you're alive
Experience the warmth before you grow old
So do you think I should adhere
To that pressing new frontier?
And leave in my wake a trail of fear?
Or should I hold my head up high
And throw a wrench in spokes by
Leaving the air behind me clear?
So don't let the world bring you down
Not everyone here is that fucked up and cold
Remember why you came and while you're alive
Experience the warmth before you grow

I'm not dead yet
I'm bent but not broken

Maybe there's a poem in reverse
Spoken and it holds me out forever
That love is like a blind archer tryin' to shoot an apple off my head

There's comfort in my dark seat
And chaos in the aisles
These eyes are not your eyes
And these eyes are not the color
That your arid eyes might be
When those eyes of yours decided so
I refuse to kneel before the sights you choose to see

You stare at me like I'm a vitamin
On the surface you hate  but you know you need me
I come dressed as any pill you deem fit
Whatever helps you swallow truth all the more easily
We orbit the sun  I grow up
My open eyes see a zombified  somnambulist society
Leaving us as vitamins for the hibernating human animal

Into the sleep machine I won't plug in
In fact I'd rather die before I will comply
To you  my friend I write the reason I still live
Because in my mind it's set the vitamin is ripe to give
Coming closer to another two thousand years
You and I will pry the closed eye of the sleep machine

Count your blessings  seduce a stranger
What's so wrong with being happy?

When she woke in the morning
She knew that her life had passed her by
And she called out a warning
Don't ever let life pass you by
I suggest we learn to love ourselves
Before it's made illegal
When will we learn? (When will we learn?) When will we change? (When will we change?)
Just in time to see it all fall down
Those left standing will make millions
Writing books on the way it should have been
