lyrics
" who'd have known?
 it was never plugged in at all
 I hurried up
 I didn't think enough
 rarely came
 too late to try
 we'd survived
 I'll be unknown
 board it up
 rarely came
 too late to try
 we'd survived
 rarely came
 the time goes by
 I've survived
I kinda like the little rush you get
When you're standing close to death
Like when you're driving me crazy
Hold on as we crash into the earth
A bit of pain will help you suffer
'Cause you were driving me crazy
Do you grin inside? You're killing me
All along we talked of forever
I kinda think that we won't get better
Did you know? I'm here to stay
We'll stagger home after midnight
Sleep arm in arm in the stairwell
We'll fall apart on the weekend
These nights go on and on and on
You might also like
I can't keep your voice out of my head
All I hear are the many echoes of
The darkest words you said
And it's driving me crazy
I can't find the best in all of this
But I'm always looking out for you
Cause you're the one I miss
And it's driving me crazy
Do you grin inside? You're killing me
All along we talked of forever
I kinda think that we won't get better
Did you know? I'm here to stay
We'll stagger home after midnight
Sleep arm in arm in the stairwell
We'll fall apart on the weekend
These nights go on and on and on
We'll stagger home after midnight
Sleep arm in arm in the stairwell
We'll fall apart on the weekend
These nights go on and on and on
We'll stagger home after midnight
Sleep arm in arm in the stairwell
We'll fall apart on the weekend
These nights go on and on and on
We'll stagger home after midnight
Sleep arm in arm in the stairwell
We'll fall apart on the weekend
Hope it's not the creatures from above
You used to read me stories  as if my dreams were boring
We all know conspiracies are dumb
What if people knew that these were real?
I'd leave my closet door open all night
I know the CIA would say  What you hear is all hearsay
Wish someone would tell me what was right
Up all night long
And there's something very wrong
And I know it must be late
Been gone since yesterday
I'm not like you guys
I'm not like you
Been best friends and will be 'til we die
I got an injection of fear from the abduction
My best friend thinks I'm just telling lies  alright

Where's my mother? Bio-father?
Up all night long
And there's something very wrong
And I know it must be late
Been gone since yesterday
I'm not like you guys
It all just goes to show how nothing I know changes me at all
Again  I wait for this to change instead to tear the world in two
Another night with her  but I'm always wanting you
We know where we go
We go where we know
With all of this I feel now  everything inside of my heart
It all just seems to be how nothing I feel pulls at me at all

I've been here before a few times
And I'm quite aware we're dying
Always
We'll keep waking up to that light
We'll see rising of a new tide
We are starting up a new life
When your head is hanging too low
When your heart is 'bout to explode
Like a pounding deep in your head
When your job has gone to deep shit
If you've fallen off of that list
When you're clenching both of your fists
Like you aimed and then you just missed
Let the record show that you're fixed
The dreams I gave up and wasted
My old shit ends here tonight

And after you had the time of your life
Flatlined and led toward the light
You'll despair the wreckage and find
No one gave a fuck that you died
The dreams I gave up and wasted
My old shit ends here tonight
If I fall on some nails
If I win or set sail
I won't fail
Fallen to pieces
Earth is dyin'
We need guidance
We've been misled
Young and hostile
But not stupid
Corporate leaders
Politicians
Dults elect them
Laws that rule the
School and workplace
Signs that caution
Sixteen's unsafe
Ah
We really need to
See this through
We never wanted
To be abused
We'll never give up
It's no use

We'll never give up

Run out the back door  he's passed out on the floor
Third time  been caught twice
Forgive our neighbor Bob  I think he humped the dog
But good things come to those who wait  'cause she laid me
And Mom and Dad possess the key  instant slavery
No need explain the plan  no need to even bother
White lies  bloodshot eyes
Breath of alcohol  stole it from the mall
How's Chris marked with lipstick?
Better call their fathers  sleeping with your daughters
But good things come to those who wait  'cause she laid me
And Mom and Dad possess the key  instant slavery
No need explain the plan  no need to even bother
You don't belong  you left the kids to carry on
You planned their fall  too bad you're wrong

You planned their fall  too bad you're wrong
Don't need a mom-dad slave drive song
I wasn't born with the rich blood
I started out with plenty of nothing at all
I got stuck in the thick mud
I was raised on a rerun
I was bored to death  so I started a band
Cut my teeth on a safety dance
My attention span never stood a chance
It's too late
Can you forgive me now?
You could never kill my high
I'm the ink and you're the headline (Oh)
Blame it  blame it on my youth
Blame it  blame it on my youth
You can never block my shine
I've been lost since 1999 (Oh)
Blame it  blame it on my youth

I wasn't made for the good life
I ended up getting stuck on the side of the road
I tripped and fell on hard times
Tough breaks are the only kind I know
I was left on a door step
I was scared to death with nowhere to go
Cut myself on the neighbors' fence
That I hopped as the cops tried to take me in
It's too late
Can you forgive me now?
You could never kill my high
I'm the ink and you're the headline (Oh)
Blame it  blame it on my youth
Blame it  blame it on my youth
You could never block my shine
I've been lost since 1999 (Oh)
Blame it  blame it on my youth
Blame it  blame it on my youth
I was raised on the Ritalin
Ever since I was a little kid (Little kid)
No one ever seemed to give a shit (Give a shit)
And I don't need an excuse
I don't need an excuse
You could never kill my high
I'm the ink and you're the headline
Blame it  blame it on my youth
Blame it  blame it on my youth
You can never block my shine
I've been lost since 1999 (Oh)
Blame it  blame it on my youth
Blame it  blame it on my youth
You can never kill my high (Endless summer)
I'm the ink and you're the headline (Stretching on and on)
Endless summer
Rescuing a nightmare from a dream
The voices in my head are always screaming
That none of this means anything to me
And it's a long way back from seventeen
The whispers turn into a scream
And I...
I'm not coming home
Life is too short to last long
Life is too short to last long
There's a stranger staring at the ceiling
Rescuing a tiger from a tree
The pictures in her head are always dreaming
Each of them means everything to me
And it's a long way back from seventeen
The whispers turn into a scream
And I...
I'm not coming home

Neighbors and friends that you don’t know
It’s what I’ve always wanted
Two little kids out on the lawn
It’s what I’ve always wanted
Beautiful haze of suburbia
Wearing all black out on the beach
Faces I’ve seen in magazines

I never felt so alone again
I stop to think at a wishing well
My thoughts send me on a carousel
Here I am standing on my own
Not a motion from the telephone
I know not a reason why
Solitude's a reason to die
I guess it's just another night alone
Now as I walk down the street
I need a job just to sleep in sheets
Buying food every once in a while
But not enough to purchase a smile
A tank of gas is a treasure to me
I know now that nothing is free
I talk to you every now and then
I never felt so alone again

Ah!
Don't wake me up before you leave
Is there the slightest trace of what you once believed? Woahh
I feel your hand unlock the door
What's the point of saying sorry now?
Lost my voice while fighting my way out
While fighting my way out
What's the point of saying sorry now?
Lost my voice while fighting my way out

And maybe I'll see you at a movie sneak preview

This awkward silence makes me crazy
The glow inside burns light upon her
I'll try to kiss you if you let me
This can't be the end
Tidal waves  they rip right through me
Tears from eyes worn cold and sad
Pick me up now  I need you so bad
Your vows of silence fall all over
The look in your eyes makes me crazy
I feel the darkness break upon her

How would you feel if I should choose to go?
Another guy  you think he'd be unlike me?
Another guy  you think he'd wanna fight me?
She's a dove  she's a fuckin' nightmare
Unpredictable  it's my mistake to stay here
On the go  and it's way too late to play
I need a girl that I can train
I heard it once  I'm sure I've heard it twice
My dad used to give me all of his advice

His issues make my mind ache  wanna make a deal
'Cause I love your little motions you do with your pigtails
What a nice creation  worth another night in jail
He's a player  diarrhea giver
Tried to grow his hair out  friends were listening to Slayer
I would like to find him Friday night
Hanging out with Mom and trying on his father's tights
Life just sucks  I lost the one
I'm giving up  she found someone
There's plenty more  girls are such a drag
So all you little ladies  be sure to choose the right guys
You'll come back to me maybe  I'll shower you with lies
Got a lotta heartache  he's a fucking weasel
Decisions make my mind ache  wanna make a deal
Ease away the problems and the pain
The girl will choose the guy that makes you wanna kick and scream
All along  you wish that she would stay
Fuck the guy that took her and ran away  and

Whatcha say? (Whatcha say?) Wanna play?
They pursued me on foot  but I hid in the crowd
Like a ghost  like a ghost

I fucked your mom
And I wanna suck my dad
And my mommy too
I got no regret right now (I'm feelin' this!)
The air is so cold and null (I'm feelin' this!)
Let me go in her room (I'm feelin' this!)
I wanna take off her clothes (I'm feelin' this!)
Show me the way to bed (I'm feelin' this!)
Show me the way you move (I'm feelin' this!)
I love all the things you do (I'm feelin' this!)
Fate fell short this time
Your smile fades in the summer
Place your hand in mine
I'll leave when I wanna
Where do we go from here?
Turn all the lights down now
Smiling from ear to ear (I'm feelin' this!)
Our breathing's got too loud (I'm feelin' this!)
Show me the bedroom floor (I'm feelin' this!)
Show me the bathroom mirror (I'm feelin' this!)
We're taking this way too slow (I'm feelin' this!)
Take me away from here (I'm feelin' this!)

This place was never the same again after you came and went
How could you say you meant anything
Different to anyone standing alone on the

Look to the past and remember and smile
And maybe tonight I can breathe for a while
But then all that it means is I'll always be dreaming of you

To pick you up on our very first date
Is it cool if I hold your hand?
Is it wrong if I think it's lame to dance?
Do you like my stupid hair?
Would you guess that I didn't know what to wear?
I'm just scared of what you think
You make me nervous  so I really can't eat
Let's go  don't wait
This night's almost over
Honest  let's make
This night last forever
Forever and ever
Let's make this last forever
Forever and ever
Let's make this last forever
When you smile  I melt inside
I'm not worthy for a minute of your time
I really wish it was only me and you
I'm jealous of everybody in the room
Please don't look at me with those eyes
Please don't hint that you're capable of lies
I dread the thought of our very first kiss
A target that I'm probably gonna miss

 I wanna fuck a dog  that's right kids
 tried to fuck your dad in the ass
 we wanna
 we wanna fuck a dog
 arr  me and me
 ya scurvy cur! Tried to fuck a fucking pirate
 we wanna
 wanna fuck a fucking dog
Put blankets on the bed  I won't turn out the light  just
Don't forget to think about me  and I
Won't forget you  I'll write you once a week  she said
Why does it feel the same to fall in love or break it off?
And if young love is just a game  then I must've missed the kickoff
Don't depend on me to ever follow through on
Anything  but I'd go through Hell for you  and
I haven't been this scared in a long time
And I'm so unprepared  so here's your valentine
Bouquet of clumsy words  a simple melody
This world's an ugly place  but you're so beautiful to me
I'll think about the times she kissed me after class  and
She put up with my friends  I acted like an ass  I'd
Ditch my lecture to watch the girls play soccer
Is my picture still hanging in her locker?
I haven't been this scared in a long time
And I'm so unprepared  so here's your valentine
Bouquet of clumsy words  a simple melody

Left looking for an easy way out

Walls of isolation inside of my pain

I wanna feel happy days  happy days
Happy days  happy days
All of this frustration inside of my brain
And I don't know if I'm ready to change
Some nights  you call for the jaws of life
To pull you out of the crash
A forgotten ghost from your past
When enough doesn't cut it
When you're backed up against a wall
Is it the life that you wanted
When you could never have it all?

We chased all of our dreams and

Forgotten seconds out on Sunset Drive
And I hold on tight
But not enough to hold you back
It feels like the moon is spinning off into outer space without you
This room is such a lonely place without you
I wish that we could save today

And I keep pushing you away

Hello  there
The angel from my nightmare
The shadow in the background of the morgue
The unsuspecting victim
Of darkness in the valley
We can live like Jack and Sally if we want
Where you can always find me
And we'll have Halloween on Christmas
And in the night  we'll wish this never ends
We'll wish this never ends
I miss you  I miss you
I miss you  I miss you
Where are you? And I'm so sorry
I cannot sleep  I cannot dream tonight
I need somebody and always
This sick  strange darkness
Comes creeping on  so haunting every time
And as I stare  I counted
The webs from all the spiders
Catching things and eating their insides
Like indecision to call you
And hear your voice of treason
Will you come home and stop this pain tonight?
Stop this pain tonight

I'll keep my eyes patiently focused on you
And if you will keep me from waking to believe this
Are you afraid of bein' alone?

And she doesn't get all jealous when I hang out with the guys
She laughs at my dumb jokes when no one does
She brings me Mexican food from Sombrero just because
Yeah  just because
And my girlfriend likes UL and DHC
And she's so smart and independent  I don't think she needs me
Quite half as much as I know I need her
I wonder why there's not another guy that she'd prefer
And when I feel like giving up
Like my world is falling down
I show up at 3 A.M.  she's still up watching Vacation
I know that everything  know that everything
Know that everything  everything's gonna be fine
I know that everything  know that everything

You're out of line and rarely sober

I'm not bent  I'm not cracked  I'm just broken
I watched the fire burn the sea  I wrapped my car around a tree
Hold me up underneath this heavy burden
There's a halo in the distance
Salvation's barely out of reach
Torn apart like the brokenhearted
Up in smoke with the fire we started
Misery loves company  I don't need anyone
Smash it up like there's no tomorrow
Leave me here with the fear and sorrow
Misery loves company  I don't need anyone
Tied up to a heart of stone  I screamed into a microphone
I burned the bridge  so I won't find my way home
Lay with me  I can't sleep  misery loves company
When I'm bent  when I'm cracked  when I'm broken

Fifteen times a night  when the sun's gone down
In the dark awake  and you're not around
And the closest thought is the edge of oblivion
Fifteen times a day when you check your phone
And I won't be there and you're all alone
'Cause we always lived on the edge of oblivion
Left to find our way through a Hitchcock film
In an empty bed with an hour to kill
'Cause it's only fun on the edge of oblivion (oblivion)
Torn apart like the brokenhearted
Up in smoke with the fire we started
Misery loves company  I don't need anyone
Smash it up like there's no tomorrow

Let's search and destroy all the innocent throats we can step on
You bury your face underneath half-hearted confessions
You poison yourself with the thought I won't love you to death
Black lights across my face!
Words that we'll never write!
Wait for the phone to ring!
Back to the starting line  go!
I don't feel pain  but I feel more than you'd ever know
I feel a bit cursed  I've been numb and sinking down like a stonе
I don't feel pain  but I feel more than you'd ever know
Morе than you'd know!
I shook all the leaves from your tree and left you with nothing
I can't see the colors you see  they won't see me coming
The ivy is starting to creep  it grows through the awnings
It's dawning on me that I shouldn't be trying at all

She has her curlers set  her credit cards are paying the funds
They go out every day  she goes every way
Oh yeah  they don't even care at all
She's open  waiting for more
And I know he's only looking to score
Been starved for attention before
She smokes a dozen and he doesn't seem to notice the smell
He took the seat off his own bike because the way that it felt

From brothers into strangers once again
We saw the whole world  but I couldn't see the meaning
I couldn't even recognize my friends
Older  but nothing's any different
Right now feels the same  I wonder why
I wish they told us  it shouldn't take a sickness
Or airplanes falling out the sky
Do I have to die to hear you miss me?
Do I have to die to hear you say goodbye?
I don't wanna act like there's tomorrow
I don't wanna wait to do this one more time

Don't meet expectations
Everything you wished came true
In the end  we all blamed you
Even though  as they all know
You weren't the only one  two
Three  four...
Why do you still keep it around
When you know it brings me down? I'm hating everything
And I know that you dated other guys
But I got to wonder why you'd leave it out for me (Shit!)
Why am I still hanging around
When I know it brings me down? I'm hating everything

I woke up in the pouring rain
Sleeping by a dumpster to keep me dry
With the radio on and a new black eye
Black sedan ran a red light

Now it's the last thing left on my mind
Afraid of the dark  do you hear me whisper?
An empty heart  replaced with paranoia
Where do we go? life's temporary
After we're gone  like New Year's resolutions
Why is this hard? Do you recognize me?
I know I'm wrong but I can't help believing
It's too late to save me
You're cold with disappointment while I'm drowning in the next room
The last contagious victim of this plague between us
And I dread the moment when you finally come to kill me
This is the first thing I remember
Now it's the last thing left on my mind
Afraid of the dark  do you hear me whisper?
An empty heart  replaced with paranoia
Where do we go? life's temporary
After we're gone  like New Year's resolutions
Why is this hard? Do you recognize me?
Do you wanna come to a party?
My friends picked me up in a truck at 11:30
This thing's at a frat house  but people are cool there
Would be someone there who would catch my attention
I wasn't out searching for love or affection
So I payed my three in and the girls got in free
Shined the beer for tequila and we headed into the party
Someone in the background was doing a keg stand
This place is so lame  all these girls look the same
All these guys have no game  I wished I would've stayed
In my bed back at home  watching TV alone
Where I'd put on some porn  or have sex on the phone
Far from people I hate down from anywhere State
Trying to intoxicate girls to give them head after the party
And then I saw her standing there
With green eyes and long blonde hair
She wasn't wearing underwear
At least I prayed that
She might be the one
Maybe we'd have some fun
Maybe we'd watch the sun rise
But that night  I learned some girls try too hard

(Duh-na-na  duh-na-na)
And the things they suggest to me
(Duh-na-na  duh-na-na)
I couldn't believe what this lady was saying
The names she was dropping  the games she was playing
She dated this guy who now rides for Black Flys
How she's down with the wise well-constructed disguise
Now I'd rather go dateless than stay here and hate this
Her volume of makeup  her fake tits were tasteless
So I said I'd call her  but never would bother
Until I got turned down by another girl at a party
So when you see her standing there
With green eyes and long blonde hair
She won't be wearing underwear
And you'll discover
This girl's not the one
And she'll never be fun
You should just turn and run
Because you'll find out that some girls try too hard
Some girls try too hard
And some girls try too hard to impress

 getting drunk with my best friends
 'cause I think all her friends hate me
 she'll always be there
 I swear
 What? and I told her that I didn't know
 gonna sneak in through her window
 What? and I told her that I didn't know

 I'd still ask her to dance

Cleanse the mind with ketamine
Slide your mom on top of me
Wash yourself with turpentine!
My arms I've raised again
Today I don't feel tethered
I have no path within
Don't know if I'll get better
My own mind's unclean
Can't taste anything
What if I'm not like the others?
What if my heart won't recover?
I'll clean myself with turpentine
Working at the factory
Stick the veins of nicotine
Wash yoursеlf with turpentine!

We're all just lambs to the slaughter
A generation lost and forgotten
Clawing at the lid of the coffin
Your god ain't comin' back this time
Quit your job and have a drink
Take a pound of ecstasy
Wash yourself with turpentine!
What if I'm not like the others?
What if my heart won't recover?
I'll clean myself with turpentine
Like me like a trampoline
Stick your dick in Ovaltine
Snort a bag of dramamine
Douse yourself in gasoline
Throw up in a limousine
Jack off to a magazine
I wore cologne to get the feelin' right
We started makin' out  and she took off my pants
But then I turned on the TV
And that's about the time she walked away from me
Nobody likes you when you're twenty-three
And are still more amused by TV shows
What the hell is ADD?
My friends say I should act my age
What's my age again?
What's my age again?
Then later on  on the drive home
I called her mom from a payphone
I said I was the cops and your husband's in jail
This state looks down on sodomy
And that's about the time that bitch hung up on me
Nobody likes you when you're twenty-three
And are still more amused by prank phone calls
