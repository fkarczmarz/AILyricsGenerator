lyrics
"I heard a cry within my soul
I've never had a yearning quite like this before
Know that you are walking right through my door
All of my life
Where have you been
I wonder if I'll ever see you again?
And if that day comes
I know we could win
I wonder if I'll ever see you again?
A sacred gift of heaven
And I would never let somebody break you down
All of my life
Where have you been
I wonder if I'll ever see you again?
And if that day comes
I know we could win
I wonder if I'll ever see you again?

At every time I've always known
That you were there
Upon your throne
A lonely queen without her king
I longed for you
My love forever
All of my life
Where have you been
I wonder if I'll ever see you again?
And if that day comes
I know we could win
I wonder if I'll ever see you again?
All of my life
Where have you been
I wonder if I'll ever see you again?
And if that day comes
I know we could win
I wonder if I'll ever see you again?

And if that day comes
I know we could win
I wonder if I'll ever see you again

I wonder if I'll ever see you again
I wonder if I'll ever see you again
I wonder if I'll ever see you again
I wonder if I'll ever see you again
I wonder if I'll ever see you again
That your life is a gift
And my mama said
There's much weight you will lift
And my mama said
Leave those bad boys alone
And my mama said
Be home before the dawn
And my mama said
You can be rich or poor
But my mama said
You can be big or small
But I'm always on the run
Always on the run
But I'm always on the run
My mama said
That it's good to be fruitful
But my mama said
Don't take more than a mouthful

Countless sleepless nights
Never ending fights
I'm trying to make your dreams come true
I will sacrifice to find paradise
But I need to know that you're behind me
If you want it you got to believe
Who are we? We're who we are
Riding on this great big star
If you want it you got it
You just got to believe
Believe in yourself
Cause it's all just a game
We just want to be loved
The Son of God is in our face
Offering us eternal grace
If you want it you've got to believe
Cause being free is a state of mind
We'll one day leave this all behind

He died so we could see that was his mission
So don't look back

And maybe we have finally found our common ground
We're the children of one father
If you're looking back  don't bother
We're Black and White America
In 1963 my father married
A black woman
And when they walked the street they were in danger
Look what you've done
But they just kept on walking forward hand in hand

Late night the speaker's pumping
Flesh-to-flesh  grind-n-bumping

Cornrows  bees and arrows
The deepest rose of Nassau
I love the show tonight
Go sister  roll on it

I've ever seen
You shine just like sunlight rays
On a winter snow
I just had to tell you so
Your eyes sparkle as the stars
Your smile could light the world on fire
Or did you know?
Your mind's full of everything
That I wanna know
I just had to let you know
I just had to tell you so
You're my butterfly
Fly high
I need you near to the ground
I miss you dearly
Can you hear me on your cloud?
All of my life
I've been waiting for someone to love
All of my life
I've been waiting for something to love

And I don't wanna be alone
Don't wanna live my days without you
But for now I've got to be without you
I've got a pocket full of money

But then I think of loving
And I just can't get you off of my mind
Yeah
That this is killing me?
And I don't want you to be told

You'll find it coming out the other side
And once you dig in

She gave me a lot
Came up through the inner city
She raised me up
She opened my mind
I got to the nitty gritty
The greatest town that you'll  ever find
She is my heart
She's a queen that stands her ground
Nobody can take her down
And it ain't even a thang
She is a rock
As regal as she is sturdy
(Can't take her freedom)
I love her style
Whether she is clean or dirty

Did you have to fall in love
With a man
That never was
Up to no good
He took your soul
And he stole your only heart
Flipped your wig and left a permanent scar
Sister
Did you have to go away
You left your home
And the things you had to say
It didn't feel good to let you slide
I never got to say goodbye
I miss you girl I think I'm going to cry
If they knock on your door
You already gave
You don't need no more of what's ailing you
Just lean on your soul with all that it takes
May God bring you back home to America
It's just a test of faith
Your heart is pure so the devil's in your face
I'll see you soon
Because they haven't got a case
And you'll be free
