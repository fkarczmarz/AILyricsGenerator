"You give me life
You give me
I've got the time now that you're not here
And I can't deny
As hard as I try
That you give me life
You give me life
And I can't deny
As hard as I try
That you give me life
You give me life
Three hour drive and I'm headin' nowhere
I've got the timе now that you're not here

Heart on my sleeve
It's more than I can take
Down on my knees
Come back to me
It's more than I can take
Heart on my sleeve
It's more than I can take
It's more than I can take
You give me
You give me life
Take me on a cruise around the world
(Baby  you know I'm worth it)
Dinner lit by candles  run my bubble bath
Make love tenderly to last and last
(Baby  you know I'm worth it)
Not just dough  but to show that you know she is worth your time
You will lose if you choose to refuse to put her first
She will and she can find a man who knows her worth
Mm-mmm
'Cause a real man knows a real woman when he sees her (When he sees her)
And a real woman knows a real man ain't 'fraid to please her (Please her)
And a real woman knows a real man always comes first (First)
And a real man just can't deny a woman's worth (A woman's worth)
Mm-hm  mm-hmm

If you treat me fairly  I'll give you all my goods
Treat you like a real woman should

If you never play me  promise not to bluff
I'll hold you down when shit gets rough
('Cause baby  I know you're worth it)
Don't take for granted the passions that she has for you
You will lose if you choose to refuse to put her first
She will and she can find a man who knows her worth
Ohh
'Cause a real man knows a real woman when he sees her (When he sees her)
And a real woman knows a real man ain't 'fraid to please her (Please me)
And a real woman knows a real man always comes first (First  baby)
And a real man just can't deny a woman's worth
No need to read between the lines spelled out for you (Spelled out for you)
Just hear this song 'cause you can't go wrong when you value (Better value)
Yeah

And a real man just can't deny a woman's worth (A woman's worth)
'Cause a real man knows a real woman when he sees her (Nothing like a woman's worth)
And a real woman knows a real man ain't 'fraid to please her (Ooh-ooh)

And even though I married your father

I think you're beautiful

I know how hard it gets
What you do for love
There ain't nothing I won't do for us

I believe love could bring us closer than blood
I remember having four step-moms at nine
Loved Christmas time and birthday was fly
Hit my sister's just for dinner cause the cookin' was bomb
Her mother's supper made me love her like she took me to prom (uh)
And shoutout to my sisters on welfare
And shoutout to the step-sisters and step-brothers
I'm here for you
What you do for love
There ain't nothing I won't do for us
It may not be easy
This blended family but baby
What you do for love
That's just what you do (for love)
For love of the babies (for love)
We're a blended family (for love)
And it's alright (for love)
Said it's alright!
You look surprised  your words don’t burn me anymore
Been meaning to tell you  but I guess it’s clear to see
Don’t be mad  it’s just a brand new kind of me
Can't be bad  I found a brand new kind of free
Careful with your ego  he’s the one that we should blame
Had to grab my heart back  God knew something had to change
I thought that you’d be happy
I found the one thing I need
Why you mad? It’s just the brand new kind of me
It took a long  long time to get here
It took a brave  brave girl to try
It took one too many excuses  one too many lies
Don't be surprised  don't be surprised
If I talk a little louder  if I speak up when you're wrong
If I walk a little taller  I been under you too long
If you notice that I'm different  don't take it personally
Don't be mad  it's just a brand new kind of me
And it ain't bad  I found a brand new kind of free

If your were worth a while  you'd be happy to see me smile
I'm not expecting sorry  I'm too busy finding myself

I’ll never be perfect  but at least now I’m brave
Now my heart is open  and I can finally breathe
Don’t be mad  it’s just a brand new kind of free
That ain't bad  I found a brand new kind of me

Ooh  New York
Grew up in a town that is famous as a place of movie scenes
Noise is always loud  there are sirens all around and the streets are mean
Seein' my face in lights or my name on marquees found down on Broadway

I got a pocketful of dreams (Come on)
Concrete jungle where dreams are made of (Oh  come on)
There's nothin' you can't do (Come on)
Now you're in New York (Oh  yeah)

Big lights will inspire you (Big shine)

She said that she would never leave  continued to torture me
Tellin' me to come with her  underneath my comforter
And she brought a gun with her  pills and some rum with her
Took me on a balcony  tellin' me to jump with her
Yeah  I'm into ghosts  but I ain't doin' stunts with her
I ain't tryna be that  haters wanna see that
But I got 'em aggy  'cause I win the gold like Gabby
She's just a girl and she's on fire
Hotter than a fantasy  lonely like a highway
She's living in a world and it's on fire
Feeling the catastrophe  but she knows she can fly away

The sun goes down over Gramercy Park
And it's become easy to hide pieces away
Making up someone in the hope that you'll stay
'Cause I've been trying to be everything I think you want me to be
I've been doing all the things that I think you wanna see
I've been trying to fulfill you with your every need
Now you falling for a person that's not even me
Said you falling for a person that's not even me (Gimme the beat)
Now you falling for a person that's not even me
I like the attention with your eyes on me
The trouble with the truth is it's so hard to believe
And I've been trying to be everything I think you want me to be

I've been praying but I'm paying for my sins

Every step makes me think that I'm closer
But somehow I just never arrived

Won't you give me a sign before I lose my mind?

We've got it twisted in this lucid dream
So we can hate each other and fear each other
We can build these walls between each other
Yeah we can hate each other and fear each other

What if love was holy and hate obscene
We should give life to this beautiful dream
Cause peace and love ain't so far
If we nurse our wounds before they scar
Some people live just for the fame
Some people live just to play the game

Define what's within
So full of the superficial

I miss someone that I love
Or fell in love with
I don't wanna cry or nothing  but
I'ma just get straight to the story
I'm a twenty-nine year-old addict
What would you know? What would you do
If you had no control over what you pursue?
All that I'm fightin'  I don't wanna resist
And so it persists like a bottomless kiss
An illusion of bliss  an illusion of bliss
And so it persists like a bottomless kiss
Live in prison of blood and flesh
An easy way out is this high  I confess
So what you lookin' at? What you wanna say?

Won't somebody listen before I need help?
I'm sick of being judged  sick of being sick
Tell me  where's the love?
Tired of bein' tricked
Sick of bein' high  sick of being low
Sick of all the lies  puttin' on a show
And so it persists  and so it persists

Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Just lonely feelings
Locked away in my head
I trap myself further
I should start to speak
But I stop and stay silent
And now I've made
My own hard bed
Inside this prison of words unsaid
P.O.W.
That's what I am
Not a prisoner of war
A prisoner of words
Mostly I say what you wanna hear
Could you take it if I came clear?
Or would you rather just see me
Stoned on a drug of complacency and compromise
M.I.A.
I guess that's what I am
Scraping this cold hard earth
For a piece of myself
For peace in myself
It'd be easier if you just put me in jail
I'd have someone to blame
But these bars of steel are of my making
They surround my mind
And have me shaking
My hands are cuffed behind my back
A prisoner of compromise
A prisoner of compassion
A prisoner of kindness
A prisoner of expectation
A prisoner of my youth
Run too fast to be old
I've forgotten what I was told
Ain't I a sight to behold?
A prisoner of age dying to be young
To my head is my hand with a gun
And it's cold and it's hard
Cause there's nowhere to run
When you've caged yourself
By holding your tongue
I'm a prisoner
Of words unsaid
Just lonely feelings
Locked away in my head
It's like solitary confinement
Every time I stay quiet
I should start to speak
But I stop and stay silent
And now I've made
My own hard bed
Yeah  ah
Yeah  ah
Yeah  ah

Sometimes you gotta do it  be willin' to lose it

A river of blood in the streets
No love in the streets
Just another one gone

Another king and queen lost
Another broken promise they refuse to make right
Another reason to get out there and fight
'Cause this could be our final time
And you know I'm horrible at saying goodbye
But I'll think of all you coulda done
At least you'll stay forever young

She was walking in the street  looked up and noticed
He was nameless  he was homeless
She asked him his name and told him what hers was
He gave her a story 'bout life
With a glint in his eye and a corner of a smile
One conversation  a simple moment
The things that change us if we notice
When we look up sometimes
They said I would never make it
But I was built to break the mold
The only dream that I've been chasing is my own
So I sing a song for the hustlers trading at the bus stop
Single mothers waiting on a check to come
Young teachers  student doctors
Sons on the front line knowing they don't get to run
This goes out to the underdog
Keep on keeping at what you love
You'll find that someday soon enough
You will rise up  rise up  yeah

She's riding in a taxi back to the kitchen
Talking to the driver 'bout his wife and his children
On the run from a country where they put you in prison
For being a woman and speaking your mind
She looked in his eyes in the mirror and he smiled
One conversation  a single moment
The things that change us if we notice
When we look up sometimes
They said I would never make it
