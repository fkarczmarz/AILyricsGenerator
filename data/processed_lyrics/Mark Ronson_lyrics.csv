lyrics
"You don't wanna get hurt
So we're sleeping but we never dreamin'
Tryna catch no feelings  oh no
I'm not your lover  but we're making love
And don't blame it on being drunk
Say it's over  but you're in my bed
Walk away  come runnin' back again
Don't say I'm just a 2 AM  2 AM
And you say you're not in love
Sayin' now it's 5 AM
Baby  now we see the sun
Why are you still hitting me up
If you can't call it love?
Yeah  you say you're not in love
Sayin' now it's 5 AM
Baby  now we see the sun
Why are you still hitting me up
If you can't call it love?

I'm not your lover  but we're making love
And don't blame it on being drunk
Say it's over  but you're in my bed
Walk away  come runnin' back again
Don't say I'm just a 2 AM  2 AM
You still awake?
Still down to break?
Open your heart  open the door
Give me some more
Baby  what do you want?
You still awake?
Still down to break?
Open your heart  open the door
Give me some more
What the fuck do you want?
I'm not your lover  but we're making love
And don't blame it on being drunk
Say it's over  but you're in my bed
Walk away  come runnin' back again
Flowers grow through my window and I love you again
Oh I love you oh
When you laid me down into your beautiful garden
Flowers in the love of my arms
Its God shining through to me I guess
Its God shining through to me I guess
I love you Amy
Do you still love me
I go to the places where we used to
I feel sad
I am out here looking for you
Sometimes I pretend
Oh I miss you oh
When you laid me down
Into your beautiful garden
Flowers and the love in my arms
Is God playing evil tricks on me
Is God playing evil tricks on me
Oh I love you Amy
If you apply some pressure
I like to wait to see how things turn out
If you apply some pressure
You know that I would love to see you next year
I hope that I am still alive next year
You magnify the way I think about myself
Before you came I rarely thought about myself
Behind your veil I found the body underneath
Inside your head were things I'd never thought about
You know that I would love to see you next year
I hope that I am still alive next year
I like to wait to see how things turn out
If you apply some pressure
I like to wait to see how things turn out
If you apply some pressure

What happens when you lose everything?
You start all over again
I like to wait to see how things turn out

If you apply some pressure
What happens when you lose everything?
You just start again
You start all over again
What happens when you lose everything?
You just start again
You start all over again
Everything

Everything
You start all over again
What happens when you lose some pressure?
Apply some pressure

You know that I would love to see you next year
I hope that I am still alive next year
You know that I would love to see you in that dress
Look at how lovely (Mark Ron)
What they don't know (Rhymefest) it's bout to get ugly
From the East to the Midwest
Lemme tell ya how we do it here
(It's 'bout to get ugly)
You know we shot till I die
And I'm lovin' the spot
But when I'm up in NY they say the clubbin is hot
They say
You could meet a broad
Take her home on the spot
And that broad could get a broad
Bring 'em home and just watch (Yes!)
They say Club Cheeta'
That's the place where all the niggas gettin' shot in the face
We can hit central fly
Long as the chicks is fly
I need some head no time to waaaaaste
Who that DJ be
They said Ronson
Step in the club with one hand on mah Johnson
That Midwest attitude gettin' 'em respondin
Talkin bout Ohh his accent is so charmin'
Looked around the room
I ain't see no Negroes
Like ahhh niggas don't listen to techno
They got the Cristal
They got the lounge chairs
With the pretty Puerto Rican girls around here (hey baby)
I know its everyday for you
I ain't from round here
What they don't know it's bout to get ugly
What they don't know it's bout to get ugly
Right now it's gonna get ugly
What they don't know it's bout to get ugly
Tell ya right now it's bout to get ugly
Right now 
Music hard got her ass jumpin all night
DJ throwin' out  that's right (No shirt on)
Hold up
Where the hell he get that mix
White boys goin' wild doin back flips
Playin rock n' roll
Mixin' with the black shit
M.O.P AC/DC
That's it! Keep it goin'
Now its Rob Zombie
I never liked rock n' roll
But now its gon' be
Blonde hair blue eyes
Kissin gold chains
I'm Mos Def
She the queen of the stone age
Rhymefest
I'm the king of my own age
Get your motor running
Head out on the highway
The way this DJ like the start to the stop shit
Should we dance?
And let 'em know we just
What they don't know it's bout to get ugly
What they don't know it's bout to get ugly
Right now it's gonna get ugly
What they don't know it's bout to get ugly
Tell ya right now it's bout to get ugly
Right now it's gonna get ugly
Tell me whatcha really want
For me to miss my plane
Stay in NY and do it again
Tell me whatcha really want
Baby who's pullin' your strings
Tell me whatcha really want
The DJ in the booth
Thinking that we not playin the truth
East to Midwest
Mark Ronson's on the cut
And my name is Rhymefest
(Right now it's getting pretty ugly)
A lightning-fork crack in the pearl
A fault in the rock of the island
Leave us lost in the rust and the rubble
Nine exits north of Las Vegas
I was the first one to see her
And you were the first one to fall
Like a half-drunken downhill skier
And she was the oncoming wall
Now I get that it's all gone awry
A joke I might like to take back
Wipe a bright star from the night sky
You and I
And a pair of C-notes
Soft candy betting hard eight
Not quite how you laid it out for me
Coming out of the Sunset Marquis
Before you left to deal the fine white
Is this how you pictured it
Is this how you thought it would be
We got right with the mutual problem
That got right between you and me
I told you the girl would be trouble
I said she was going to break us
Leave us lost in the rust and the rubble
Underbelly of the blue evening
Crank that vapor-wagon
Start that kick dragon beating
Step out on the patio
Follow where your daddy-o's leading
Wrestle with our shadow twins
Hold' em till they're glowin' in warning
Hit that bubble kit now
Drop another daffodil
We can push on through till morning
Drop another daffodil
Sail off the map until morning
Baby just say no to sleep
Bodies got to keep exploring
Sweet volcano violence
Vast new continents spawning
Drop another daffodil
We can push on through till morning
Drop another daffodil
Sail right off the map until morning
You might also like
Put another record on
Maybe Chaka Khan or Rocky
Catch on fire above the
Green empire of the kraken
Flow with the isosceles
To the beat of six knees knocking
Drop another daffodil
We can push on through till morning
Drop another daffodil
Sail right off the map until morning
That’s the whole point
My man John was a fuckin’ diduntdidunt
Holla
You know you got them diduntdidunt niggas in the hood  know'm sayin’?  Niggas who don't mean nothin’ to nobody and shit
Fuckin’ mother don't even like him
You know what I'm talkin’ ‘bout
Shit like…
In junior high  I knew a kid named John
One day John started thinkin’ he could rhyme
He used to see me battle with niggas one at a time (What he do)
He figured he’d test his skills against mine (Look)
He came up to me one day and said  Hey
Niggas saying you mean  lord. Spit sixteen  Gon
I said  No pa  I'm good
Check it: we ride drops  we pop mad shots
We even got 20-inch rims on the yacht
I told him to stop
The nigga ain't listen  he kept goin'
So I punch duke in his mouth while he was flowin' (Aah!)
He got up off the ground and said  Why'd you hit me?
You a diduntdidunt.  Here's a shot to the kidney
The Mike Tyson of the rap shit
I even got a speech impediment—You'th fuckin' lil' bath-tards
(“That's my word  man.  Any fuckin' rapper man
I'll eat his fuckin’ children  man.  Bring him to me  man”)

(You a diduntdidunt) Rappin 'bout ya gun and ya blunt

(You a diduntdidunt) Man  I done been where you from
(A diduntdidunt) You ain't come up in the slum
(You a diduntdidunt) Act like you want beef
I'll knock out ya teeth and you'll be literally bumpin’ ya gums  son
See  see back in the day  I knew a kid named Ray (okay)
He was kind of sweet  so niggas thought he was gay
Every day  little Ray would come around the way
And try to shoot hoops  but dudes wouldn't let him play (no)
I remember it was like the third week of May
Ray came through just like any other day
But on this particular day  he had somethin’ to say
Said if he couldn't play then niggas’ll have to pay
Now me being the man that I am (what you do?)
Threw the ball at him and told a nigga to scram
He reached into the pocket of the jacket he was wearin'
Pulled out a jammy no bigger than his hand
He said  Fuck you Sai! then popped one in the sky
Just started to cry like  Somebody gon' die
Ray  you ain't a thug  you a diduntdidunt
(You a diduntdidunt) Rappin 'bout ya gun and ya blunt
(A diduntdidunt) To you  it ain't nothin' to front
(You a diduntdidunt) A pussy that always talk about pussy
When the pussy prolly ain't had none in a month

(A diduntdidunt) You ain't come up in the slum
(You a diduntdidunt) Act like you want beef
I'll knock out ya teeth and you'll be literally bumpin’ ya gums  son
I've been all over the U.S. of A
Out west with Ronson  down south with Shey (hey!)
And one thing I see everywhere that I be (is what?)
Is a diduntdidunt
I've been on the bottom  been on the top
Been in the club and been on the block
The one thing I see everywhere that I be (is what?)
Is a diduntdidunt
So if you a punk  then say you a punk
Type of nigga that get knocked out and say you was drunk
I don't play that  niggas stay beefin’ on ADAT
See them in the street  like Pat  they don't say jack (Sajak)
My name is Saigon  I dare a rapper to say that
I ain't gon’ run in the booth and get payback
I'mma catch you while you eatin’ lunch
Catch you with a sucker-punch (like umph)
Take that  fuckin' diduntdidunt
(You a diduntdidunt) Rappin 'bout ya gun and ya blunt
(A diduntdidunt) To you  it ain't nothin' to front
(You a diduntdidunt) A pussy that always talk about pussy
When the pussy prolly ain't had none in a month
(You a diduntdidunt) Man  I done been where you from
(A diduntdidunt) You ain't come up in the slum
(You a diduntdidunt) Act like you want beef
I'll knock out ya teeth and you'll be literally bumpin’ ya gums  son
'Cause I've been wandering around in your dark  yeah
I've got way too many questions  always learning lessons
Loving too hard
Give me just a second to breathe
'Cause you've been turning all the tables on me  yeah
Whenever you would get up in your feelings  I would always listen
Now you turn around and leave
Oh  if we fall apart  let's do it in the dark
Hit me in the heart this time
Don't you leave me lonely tonight
'Cause I won't forgive you (Won't forgive you)
Don't you leave me lonely tonight
'Cause I can't forget you (Can't forget you)
I toss and turn alone in my bed
When you should be laying here beside me instead
Oh  don't you leave me lonely tonight
'Cause I won't forgive you  forgive you  forgive you this time
Tell me if this love is a lie
'Cause the ticking time is passing me by  babe
I'm waiting  but the second hand is turning
Burning all the circles in my mind  eh
Anticipating 'cause you know I'm never satisfied

Calling all cars in here  for the Prince of the South

Banana  your watermelon and pomegranate too
Rhymin' kung-fu  that split bamboo
I'm gon' have to fuck you up!
I eat flames up  shit fire out
Don't make me light my butt!
Excuse me  who me!? I got a lot of groupies
Oughta have a fucking doghouse  like Snoopy
Curtains go up! It's going down!

Get down!
Wait a minute now
Give it to them on the one
This the intermission
I'll break it down  so you niggas listen
Take a second to wipe my sweat
Might be the only chance you get  to catch your breath
Don't get too comfortable in here
Niggas know I'm bringing back the rumble in here
Just when you thought you could cool down  and sip some of that water
Shit... A nigga back!
Say it again!

Ladies and gentlemen  one more time
Put your hands together for Mystikal
Don't it feel good?
Ain't he making us feel good tonight?
Thank you Mr. Ronson  for bringing us together this evening
We gon' go ahead  and head over to the after party
We'll see y'all uptown
But they don't have a shot when I compare them to you
Find you again
Walk in the late night
Looking for your eyes
Put up a fight to find you
Lose it every time
You were the last of your kind
All of the blame's mine
And I remember you told me
And now the tears in your eyes make it blurry
I'll try to pass the night away with somebody new
But they don't have a shot when I compare them to you
Find you again

And now the tears in your eyes make it blurry
I'm ready
I'll try to pass the night away with somebody new
But they don't have a shot when I compare them to you

But they don't have a shot when I compare them to you (Find you again)
Tankful of gas and the night is young
Don't know you
Don't care where you’re going
To the Highline or the heart of the sun
My sweet companion is long as the summer
Black as the river and built to glide
Smooth as glass
Smooth as Marcus Miller
Cold as ice when you climb inside
When the city's flowing
I found a way to move my weary soul
Ridin' straight and low
Stay heavy and rolling
You deal in ducats  you deal in illusion
Pay for pleasure with your pretty face
You confuse
War and prostitution
In my starship I sail freely through space
When the city's flowing
I found a way to move my weary soul
Ridin' straight and low
Stay heavy and rolling

I was lost and lonely like you
Hollow-eyed and broken inside
Then I found something lasting and true
A beautiful ride
Might have to wait to start in on your drinking
All of Hell’s Kitchen’s standing in that line
I’ll be here
Living in my Lincoln
Occupying space and conquering time
When the city's flowing
I found a way to move my weary soul
Ridin' straight and low
You said I'd be your lucky lady
I hit those numbers all night
When I'm 'round you
Now that I found you
Ain't no hotter hand in town
Come and stake your love on me
Come lay it on the line
I bet you never felt this way before
I bet you never seen so much action on the floor
Rollin' fever I'm on fire
And tonight I'm going wild
You got to be my ace in the hole
When I'm 'round you
Now that I found you
I bet you never seen so much action on the floor
I bet you never seen so much action on the floor
I bet you never seen so much action on the floor
Action on the floor
Action on the floor
Action on the floor
After all the things that I did my way
I will come back home to my shell
Can I ever break out of this cold cell?
I've just about had it up to here
Can't you leave me alone?
About a thousand years ('cause I'm bored)
And I suck
I suck
What the fuck?
I suck
Just tonight I saw a beauty
Her pigtails could send a shiver through me
But she walked off with some lame guy
Why can't I have someone here to say hi?
I've just about had it up to here
Can't you leave me alone?

Second Adderall
To take the edge off the crazy
Jumped out the window
A human cannonball
Break glass
Don't you look back
In case of fire
Escape plan
Grab what you can
In case of fire
Girl you know you got burned
Last flight to Juarez
Two frozen credit cards
Another borrowed vacation
And twenty thousand short
Belated realizations
Break glass

Of the day we met
Please change the radio station
Break glass

He's been hanging 'round for days

Suckered you but not your friends
And teach you how to be a holy cow

You know I need it much closer
I'm trading just a little more
Step on it  electronic

Waiting for the final trip
I'm on it  get on it
I'm carving through a letter bomb
I need it like potions

I ask myself a million questions in the dark
I lay in silence  but silence talks
It tells me heaven is no closer than it was
My heart keeps pulling in the wrong direction
I'm about to cross that line
Looking for the wrong affection
Night after night
Tryna find a new distraction
Wanna make it last all night

All mixed up inside

That hipster doorman he don't know who I am
But my studied aloofness is proof I belong so I pass
Some girls are pieced like Krylon bombs on the walls
Some cut the line to cut the lines in the stalls
On the floor is the border between paradise and the Fall
I'm leaving Los Feliz
Day after tomorrow
I'm over the scenesters
I'm leaving Los Feliz
Day after tomorrow
I'm leaving Los Feliz
I cruise the room without attracting a glance
My Ksubi jeans are more like armor than pants
But I don't want to go just yet so I suppose I should dance
The music wobbles between rapture and dread
Like a divine name that can never be said
And I shoot a pretend documentary inside my head
I'm leaving Los Feliz
Day after tomorrow
I'm over the scenesters
I'm leaving Los Feliz
Day after tomorrow
I'm leaving Los Feliz

It cuts you deep and leaves a scar
And nothing breaks like a heart
I heard you on the phone last night
We live and die by pretty lies
These silver bullet cigarettes
We got all night to fall in love
But just like that we fall apart
By thunder crashing in the dark
And this broken record
Spin endless circles in the bar
This world can hurt you
It cuts you deep and leaves a scar
And nothing breaks like a heart
You might also like
We'll leave each other cold as ice
Remember what you said to me?
We were drunk in love in Tennessee
By thunder crashing in the dark
And this broken record
Spin endless circles in the bar
This world can hurt you
It cuts you deep and leaves a scar
And nothing breaks like a heart
Nothing breaks like a heart
And nothing breaks like a heart
By thunder crashing in the dark
And this broken record

This world can hurt you
It cuts you deep and leaves a scar
And nothing breaks like a heart
But nothing breaks like a heart

I heard you on the phone last night
We live and die by pretty lies
These silver bullet cigarettes
We got all night to fall in love

The most beautiful thing you can ever spend
But you work in a shirt with your nametag on it
Drifting apart like a plate tectonic
It don't matter to me
'Cause all I wanted to be
Was a million miles from here
Somewhere more familiar
Too much time spent dragging the past up
I didn't see you not looking when I messed up
Settling down in your early twenties
Sucked more blood than a backstreet dentist
It don't matter to me
'Cause all I wanted to be
Was a million miles from here
Somewhere more familiar
I've never been this far away from home
I've never been this far away from home

Wasn't expectin' you  baby
Lock my heart  with a key
Had to take some time for just me
Worryin' about my safety
Thinkin' about you daily
Are you more than a tease?
Got me swingin' from a trapeze
And not just anybody made feel like that
Not just anybody sets me on fire
Gotta be the one to take a risk
Ain't nobody else on my list  just you
So don't go and let me down like that
I don't wanna be the one alone
I never mess around like you  my love
Why must we hide?
Promise you're trying
And look at me in the eye
You're acting just a little bit shady
Feeling cut off from you lately
Need to know you're falling as deep
Please  don't leave me lonely
Please  don't let me down
Will I wake up alone this time?

Promise me heaven

Promise me heaven
I'll wait until you lay me down
I wanna be near you
Every night  I'm thinkin' 'bout you
Why must we hide?
Promise you're trying
And look at me in the eyes
But you don't let it show
You don't say how you feel  how you feel
You don't say what you want
You don't say how you feel  it's no good
Yeah  you don't let it show
You don't say how you feel  I can feel
It's real  it's not even real
You don't say what you want
You don't say how you feel  it's no good
Why must we hide?
Promise you're trying
And look at me in the eye
Or I'll let you go  let you go
And I'll let you know  I'll let you know
I don't wanna let you go  you go
And you don’t think it's enough
I text you like I'm talkin’ to Jesus
And we're stayin' in touch
And I feel like your crutch now
I want you to stop bein' so humble
And start drinkin' at lunch now
And I'll go down for you
When I go down for you
You're a million people at once
And you don’t think it’s enough
I text you like I'm talkin’ to Jesus
And we're stayin' in touch
And I feel like your crutch now
I want you to stop bein' so humble
And start drinkin’ at lunch now

And I'll go down for you
When I go down for you
You're all  I need
To get by  ahhhhh
Shorty I'm there for you anytime you need me
Nuttin make a man feel better than a woman
Queen with a crown that be down for whatever
There are few things that's forever  my lady
We can make war or make babies
Back when I was nothin
You made a brother feel like he was somethin
That's why I'm with you to this day boo no frontin
Even when the skies were gray
You would rub me on my back and say Baby it'll be okay
Now that's real to a brother like me baby
Never ever give my booty away and keep it tight aight
And I'm a walk these dogs so we can live
In a phat-ass crib with thousands of kids
Word life you don't need a ring to be my wife
Just be there for me and I'm a make sure we
Be livin in the effin lap of luxury
I'm realizing that you didn't have to funk with me
But you did  now I'm going all out kid
And I got mad love to give  you my nigga
Like sweet morning dew
I took one look at you
And it was plain to see
You were my destiny
With you I'll spend my time
I'll dedicate my life
I'll sacrifice for you
Dedicate my life for you
I got a love jonz for your body and your skin tone
Five minutes alone I'm already on the bone
Plus I love the fact you got a mind of your own
No need to shop around you got the good stuff at home
Even if I'm locked up North you in the world
Wrapped in three-fourths of cloth never showin your stuff off  boo
It be true me for you that's how it is
I be your Noah  you be my Wiz
I'm your Mister  you my Mrs. with hugs and kisses
Valentine cards and birthday wishes? Please
Be on another level of planning  of understanding
The bond between man and woman  and child
The highest elevation  cause we above"
