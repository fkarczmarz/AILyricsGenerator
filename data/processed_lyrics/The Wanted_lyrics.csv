lyrics
"Drinking won't do it  fighting won't knock you out
Of my head
Hiding won't hide it  smiling won't hide it
Like I ain't tried it  everyone's tried it now
And failed somehow
So when you gonna let me?
When you gonna let me out  out?
And if you know
How do you get up from an all time low?
I'm in pieces  it seems like peace is
The only thing I'll never know
How do you get up  get up?
'Cause driving won't do it  flying won't do it
Denying won't do it  crying won't drown it out
What you said
When I'm standing on the yellow line
Waiting at the station
Or I'm late for work  a vital presentation
If you call me now girl without reservation
I would try to break through
You might also like
And if you know
How do you get up from an all time low?
I'm in pieces  it seems like peace is
The only thing I'll never know
How do you get up from an all time low?
I can't even find a place to start
How do I choose between my head and heart?
How do you get up from an all time low?
Can you hear me?
Can't you hear me?
Can you hear me?
And if you know
How do you get up from an all time low?
I'm in pieces  it seems like peace is
The only thing I'll never know
How do you get up from an all time low?
I can't even find a place to start
How do I choose between my head and heart?
'Til it ceases  I'll never know
How do you get up from an all time low?
I can't even find a place to start
How do I choose between my head and heart?
'Til it ceases  I'll never know
 touch the light  we're together now
 so much better now
 gives me life  we're together now
 hypnotised by drums
 you'll find us chasing the sun
 we refused to run
 you'll find us chasing the sun
 oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
 you'll find us chasing the sun
 oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
 you'll find us chasing the sun
 I will never grow old again
 I'm never down
 staring up  and you're looking down
 I'm never down
 forever with you around
 hypnotised by drums
 you'll find us chasing the sun
 we refused to run
 you'll find us chasing the sun
 oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
 you'll find us chasing the sun
 oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
 you'll find us chasing the sun
 I will never grow old again
 I will never grow old again
 oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
 you'll find us chasing the sun
 oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
I see kaleidoscopes and butterflies
Through the lightning
I feel emotions I don't recognise
You make my darkness bright
Feel the spark at night
And it's something beautiful
When I see you shine
It's like heaven's mine
And it feels so magical
Throw your colours in the sky
They move like waterfalls
Of light we let it fall
I see your colours in the sky
Open your mind up
Let your paradise explode
Let your colours show
(Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
Let your colours show
(Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
You might also like
Then you say
See those places
In the darkest night
I feel the appetite
To release your heart and soul
When I see you shine
It's like heaven's mine
And it feels so magical
Throw your colours in the sky
They move like waterfalls
Of light we let it fall
I see your colours in the sky
Open your mind up
Let your paradise explode
Let your colours show
(Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
Let your colours show
(Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
And we'll dance in the colours together
And we'll dance in the colours together
Throw your colours in the sky
They move like waterfalls
Of light we let it fall
I see your colours in the sky
Open your mind up
Let your paradise explode
Let your colours show
(Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
Let your colours show
(Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
Let your colours show
(Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
Let your colours show
She's got me calling every day
I can't seem to get enough
Could this be love?
Stay up 'til late at night
Watch the stars burst into light
Watch movies all the time
We can't get enough
I'd jump out of a plane
Write your name in the sky
You're shaking my life up
Could this be love?
I'm feeling drifting up
On ceilings with your touch
'Cause when we kiss
My heart drops like a bomb
I'm in pieces when you're gone
Could this be love?
You might also like
Could stay awake all night long
Could this be love?
Walk together through the night
I kiss her lips and hold her tight
Is that enough?
I'd jump out of a plane
Write your name in the sky
You're shaking my life up
Let's take a chance on this time
Could be the best of our lives
I think you already know
Could this be love?
I'm feeling drifting up
On ceilings with your touch
'Cause when we kiss
My heart drops like a bomb
I'm in pieces when you're gone
Could this be love?
Could this be love? (Could this be love-ove?)
Could this be love? (Could this be love-ove?)
Could this be love?
She takes my breath away
She's got me calling every day
I can't seem to get enough
Could this be love?
Could this be love?
I'm feeling drifting up
On ceilings with your touch
'Cause when we kiss
My heart drops like a bomb
I'm in pieces when you're gone
Could this be love?
Could this be love? (Could this be love-ove?)
Could this be love? (Could this be love-ove?)
Won't beg you to stay
Won't kill me this way
At least that's what I'll say
The wounds that hurt me the most
Cos I'll never show
Just how deep they go
That's why I'm telling you
Everytime you have to go
I don't think you even know
It's like a dagger in my heart
Everytime you have to leave
Can't believe it cuts so deep
It's like a dagger in my heart
Dagger Dagger 
It's like a dagger in my heart
Dagger Dagger 
It's like a dagger in my heart
You might also like
These scars will heal before long
I guess I was wrong
And I'm too far gone
To just get on with my life
But it's slipping away tonight
There's some loves you can't survive
The last words I would say
Is there ain't anyone else
Can take this pain away
[Chorus
Everytime you have to go
I don't think you even know
It's like a dagger in my heart
Everytime you have to leave
Can't believe it cuts so deep
Did someone steal you away?
Is there someone else in my place?
I don't like this game
I  I can see the dirt in your hands
'Cause I know the way that you dance
Don't cover up cause it shows  mm
I wish you would
Stop right now what you're doing  I know
I got a needle in my brain and a nick in my bones
I cannot do a damn thing 'cause nobody's home
All my life  I played like a winner
Now all I see looking back in the mirror
All this time  the saint was a sinner
The joke's on me  a stone cold killer
You have a natural sway
And you know how sweet you taste
But I can't take your flame
Like a bullet through my veins
As you scratch beneath my skin
My resistance crumbling
I cover up but it shows
But I guess you know again
You might also like
Stop right now what you're doing  I know
I got a needle in my brain and a nick in my bones
I cannot do a damn thing 'cause nobody's home
All my life  I played like a winner
Now all I see looking back in the mirror
All this time  the saint was a sinner
The joke's on me  a stone cold killer
All this time  I said all this time
All this time  all this time
All this time  I said all this time (Oh)
All this time  all this time
All my life  I played like a winner
Now all I see looking back in the mirror
Demons in my head (Demons in my head)
All this time  the saint was a sinner
The joke's on me  a stone cold killer
All my life  I played like a winner
Now all I see looking back in the mirror
All this time  the saint was a sinner
The joke's on me  a stone cold killer
So turn the music up
I wanna loose control
We’re gonna lose control
We're going out tonight
Going with no invite
I wanna take it home
We’re gonna take it home
And I’ll party 'til the sun comes up
Getting a hangover without a cure
Getting drunk on love
That’s what we do
When I see you dancing
I pour my love all over you
We’re drunk on love

We’re drunk on love
I'm a local celebrity
But not the kind you look to Hollywood for
No flashing lights or autographs
I got no fans hanging right outside of my door
And I hear them whispering when I pass
Saying to each other Is that the man?
With a broken heart
Cause you tore it apart
Now everybody knows my name
Everybody feels my pain
But you don't even care
You're so unaware
I'm left to deal with the shame
Now everybody knows that I'm
Just a bum without you by my side
Welcome to the show
Everybody knows
Everyone but you
Everyone but you
I've got a thousand friends that follow me
Just to read about my misery
I'm popular for reasons that I ha-a-ate
Most time with total strangers
Anyone who will listen to my fate
But they shake their heads and they walk away
And all I'm left with is this fame
And a broken heart
Cause you tore it apart

Now if I die today would you even come?
Written on my grave would say
'Cause she tore it apart
Everybody knows my name
Everybody feels my pain
But you don't even care
You're so unaware
And I'm left to deal with the shame
Everybody knows that I'm
Just a bum without you by my side
Welcome to the show
Everybody knows
Everyone but you
Everyone but you
Everyone but you...
I'm pretty sure you've heard of me
I'm a local celebrity
And all that counts is here and now
My universe will never be the same
I'm glad you came
You cast a spell on me  spell on me
You hit me like the sky fell on me  fell on me
And I decided you look well on me  well on me
So let's go somewhere no one else can see  you and me
Turn the lights out now
Now  I'll take you by the hand
Hand you another drink
Drink it if you can
Can you spend a little time?
Time is slipping away
Away from us  so stay
Stay with me  I can make
Make you glad you came
The sun goes down  the stars come out
And all that counts is here and now
My universe will never be the same

(Oh  oh)
I'm glad you came
The sun goes down  the stars come out
And all that counts is here and now
My universe will never be the same
Still shining with the lights low
Even when the sun goes down
It's the way you shine
Cause it's like
The strobe light's
Not as bright as you are
You're the only one that I can see from afar
And I follow the rays until I get to your heart
I just gotta know who you are
You glow in the dark
You glow in the dark
You glow in the dark
You glow in the dark
(I can see you)
Glow in the dark
Shocked me like electro
The way you put it down
I should've came here with my

Glow in the dark
Live today like it's the last night
'Cause I'm with you and you're with me
But we'll never be as bright as we are now
We're standin' in a light that won't fade
'Cause some days stay gold forever
The memory of bеin' here with you
Is one I'm gonna takе my life through
'Cause some days stay gold forever
Promise me you'll stay the way you are
Keep the fire alive and stay young at heart

It's just another fight to me
If we don't take it on we won't get far
It seems so far away but so close
It's there for us to take when most
Would waste it don't waste it
And we try and we fall
And we live another day
And we rise like a phoenix
From the flames
And it burns but it turns out golden
We loved to dream aloud
With both feet on the ground
But where's the sense in that
We'd never get it back
We'd be wasted we'd be wasted

And went for the sky
And fell down low
And flew too high
But we still survived cos you and I
We turned out Golden
They tore it to pieces
We'll build it again
Ah ah ah ah
Ah ah ah ah
And we try and we fall
And we live another day
And we rise like a phoenix
From the flames
And it burns but it turns out golden
And went for the sky
And fell down low
And flew too high
But we still survived cos you and I
I hear your heart cry for love
But you won't let me make it right
You were hurt  but I decided that you were worth the fight
Every night  you lock up
You won't let me come inside
But the look in your eyes  I can turn the tide
I can tell you can fit one more
I don't care who was there before
I hear your heart cry for love
Then you act like there's no room
Room for me  or anyone
Don't disturb is all I see
Close the door  turn the key
On everything that we could be
If loneliness would move out
I'd fill the vacancy

Ooh
Ooh  ooh-ooh
This ain't the Heartbreak Hotel
Even though I know it well
Those no shows  they sure tell
In the way you hold yourself
Don't you fret  should you get
Another cancellation
Give me a chance  I'd make a
Permanent reservation
I can tell you can fit one more
Open up  make a brand new start
I don't care who's stayed before
I hear your heart cry for love
Then you act like there's no room
Room for me  or anyone
Don't disturb is all I see
Close the door  turn the key
On everything that we could be
If loneliness would move out
I'd fill the vacancy
Ooh
Ooh
When I talk to you on the phone
Listen close
I hear your heart cry for love
Then you act like there's no room
Room for me  or anyone
Don't disturb is all I see
Close the door  turn the key
On everything that we could be
If loneliness would move out
I'd fill the vacancy
Ooh
 it was falling
 it was crumbling
 let it go
 there is no need to hide away
 you and I lay
 everyday
From outta state
The very trip that's you
Were supposed to take a while ago
But it fell through
Thought I'd make the drive
But a free plane ride
Is in the air
Just like that my fear of it disappeared
Like all of you like all of you
And I look high and low
For yesterday
High and Low
For you and I
High and Low
Once I can see straight I might move
Somewhere cold
Seattle or the Bay area
To see your ghost
What's left of you what's left of you
You might also like
And I look high and low
For yesterday
High and Low
For you and I
High and Low
Found a letter from a man I might have met
Addressed to you
And now I'll steal the words
He ended with
I miss you
And I do
Miss you
And I do
And I look high and low
For yesterday
High and Low
For you and I
She's calling me in the dark
She moves us where the room around the lights turn like the sky
Confidence like a rock star
I wanna put my hands on her hands
Feel the heat from her skin
Get reckless in the starlight
I'm moving to the beat of her heart
And your light brought me back again
Found you in the river of pure emotions
The night is getting older
And I can't come off this high
I don't want this here to end
I know she feels the same
'Cause I can see it in her eyes
I wanna put my hands on her hands
Feel the heat from her skin
Get reckless in the starlight
She's moving to the beat of my heart
And your light brought me back again
Found you in the river of pure emotions
We're all looking for love tonight
But sometimes we can't see it
We run blinded by the light
Searching for that peace of mind
Just when I have given up
Looking for some kind of sign
And your light brought me back again
Found you in the river of pure emotions
She's calling me in the dark
She moves  I swear the room around her lights up like the sky
Confidence like a rockstar
I wanna put my hands on her hands  feel the heat from her skin
Get reckless in the starlight
I'm moving to the beat of her heart  I was so lost until tonight Tonight
I found you in the darkest hour
I found you in the pouring rain
I found you when I was on my knees
And your light brought me back again
Found you in a river of pure emotion
I found you  my only truth
I found you and the music played
I was lost
The night is getting older and I can't come off this high
I don't want this here to end
I know she feels the same 'cause I can see it in her eyes
She says  Can we start again?

Found you in a river of pure emotion
I found you  my only truth
I found you and the music played
I was lost
I said  People
We're all looking for love tonight
But sometimes we can't see it
We're all blinded by the light
And we all get low  all get low
Searching for that peace of mind
Just when I'd given up
Looking for some kind of sign
I found you in my darkest hour
I found you in the pouring rain
I found you when I was on my knees
And your light brought me back again
Found you in a river of gold emotion
I found you  my only truth
I found you in the music playing
I was lost
Words like these don't come with ease
You took my heart and kept it low
Now it's time to let it go
Some people fall to hold on to their tears
And if I fall my heart holds on to you
Just one look and I subside
When I'm with you my love can't hide
With every breath I need to say
Some people fall to hold on to their tears
'Cus you're not anywhere near me
All the way on the other side
Wish that I could read your mind
(Verse)
I'm kissing on your shoulder
But you don't wanna turn over
You know I'd rather have another fight
Than be a victim of a silent night
(Chorus)
You can scream and let it out
You can say the words
And I'll be wrong as long as we're alright
This time I'll take the fall
And I'll be wrong as long as we're alright
(Verse)
Did I hurt your feelings?
You should know I don't mean it
Takes my fault whatever you like now
You might also like(Verse)
We could talk about everything
So what's wrong? Let me know
'Cause I can do anything
I'm no good if your heart breaks
So I'll do whatever it takes
(Chorus)
You can scream and let it out
You can say the words
And I'll be wrong as long as we're alright
This time I'll take the fall
And I'll be wrong as long as we're alright
(Bridge)
If we take a minute we can make it all stop
Let me make it better
(Chorus x2)
You can scream and let it out
You can say the words
And I'll be wrong as long as we're alright
This time I'll take the fall
And I'll be wrong as long as we're alright
And I'll be wrong as long as we're alright
As I grew up  I thought the stories were wrong
But to you girl  I am faithful
I've fallen so hard that it's painful
And when it hurts  I know the feelings are real
I'll let nothing in the middle  nothing in the middle
Of me and you  of me and you
Nothing in the middle  in the middle of us
I love the way we fight and stay up all night
And the way you look in the morning light
I'll let nothing in the middle  in the middle of us
I don't know  how the story of us unfolds
Or if when we're old  we'll still be together at all
It's painful
And when it hurts I know the feelings are real
I'll let nothing in the middle  nothing in the middle
Of me and you  of me and you
Nothing in the middle  in the middle of us
I love the way we fight and stay up all night
And the way you look in the morning light
I'll let nothing in the middle  in the middle of us

I'll let nothing in the middle  nothing in the middle
Of me and you  of me and you
Nothing in the middle  in the middle of us
I love the way we fight and stay up all night
And the way you look in the morning light
I'll let nothing in the middle  in the middle of us

Girl I'm throwing away my soul
I'm forgetting everything that's cold
Cause I like it like that
Yeah I like it like that

Tonight I feel invincible

It’s that time when you must hold on
And I won’t let you surrender
And I’ll heal you if you’re broken
We can stand so tall together
We can make it through the stormy weather
I’ll be your strength
I’ll be your strength
I won’t sleep till the sky is calmer
Keep on searching till I find you
And my love will be your armor
In this battlefield around you
We can stand so tall together
We can make it through the stormy weather

I’ll be your strength
So you spend all your time in your head
What’s the point in that
Cause words never last
What you say now it’s not what you said
And I’m okay with that
You’re keeping yourself tied up
So you won’t let me down
I’ll understand you
Just give me the chance to
Love you more than you’ll ever know
Even if it means I gotta let you go
With or without me
Baby you should be happy
If you’re heading down another road
Don’t you leave me with nowhere to go
Don’t let me be the last to know
You take all I have
Still I pour you a half-empty glass
What’s the point in that
And all I ever asked
Is that you tell me when this is not enough
Cause if it’s real love
You might also like
And maybe you’ll find what you really wanted
Cause what you left behind and all your dreams are haunted
Either way
I hope you’ll understand me
If I say we can’t be
So if you wanna go
I want you to know
I’ll understand you
Just give me the chance to
Love you more than you’ll ever know
Even if it means I gotta let you go
With or without me
Baby you should be happy
If you’re heading down another road
Don’t you leave me with nowhere to go
Don’t let me be the last to know
It's got my baby in a fever
And I hope it gets the better of you
With this Morricone music
There's no way you can refute it
But girl you ain't got nothing to lose
Aye aye aye girl oh oh oh
It's not who you know
When I'm what you know
Aye aye aye
Just come and go with me
Don't want a room full of snakes
If the lights are on and
Aye aye aye
Just come and go with me
Will the angel or the devil
Die in ecstasy
There's something coming over you
Come over me
Falling in love is never easy
'Cause they're so good

Got perversions detrimental
But there's times

It's not who you know
When I'm what you know
Aye aye aye
Just come and go with me
Don't want a room full of snakes
If the lights are on and
Aye aye aye
Just come and go with me
Will the angel or the devil
Die in ecstasy
There's something coming over you
Come over me
Falling in love is never easy
'Cause they're so good
It's never easy
The good the bad
The good the bad
Good bad Good Bad
Let's get ugly
Will the angel or the devil
Die in ecstasy
There's something coming over you
Come over me
Falling in love is never easy
'Cause they're so good
Say it  like someone who really means it
Do it  cause if you grow a conscience  now
We fall down
Smiling  like there's nothing wrong
You're good at smiling  so keep it plastered on
Until the morning  cause if you shift to genuine
Then we'll fall out
(We fall out)
And we fall down
Don't say it's all for the better
Oh  I need you to lie  to lie to me
I'll stand for the greatest pretender
I know you won't die for me
But say you will
Just lie to me  to me
So kiss me and tell me I'm the one
There's no other  no other one you want
Baby  kiss me  make sure you close your eyes
Or we fall down
Yes  we fall down

Someone stole all the air so I can't speak now
I know the chase is on
I feel as though my time has come
How many times do I fly through your head space?
Now it's speeding away from the safe place
Yeah  your skin
The touch  the kiss
The rush too much
And here it comes
When your lips touch mine
It's the kiss of life
I know  I know that it's a little bit frightening
We might as well be playing with lightning
We touch like  like it's our first time
I know that it's a little bit frightening
We might as well be playing with lightning now
Just you and me and the coats in the back room
Learning things they don't teach in the classroom
Now  you're here

I've been addicted to you
Since the first hit
Out of control like a surge of electric

But they don't know you
And the scars you bring
'Cause you left a jagged hole
And I can't stand it anymore

But I got something to say (Hold your jars)
May our hearts be full like our drinks tonight
May we sing and dance till we lose our minds
We are only young if we seize the night
Tonight we own the night
And let us wake up inside a stranger's bed
Let us drink until there is nothing left
Tonight we own the night (Tonight we own the night)
Tonight we own the night (Tonight we own)
May our hearts be full like our drinks tonight
May we sing and dance till we lose our minds
We are only young if we seize the night
Tonight we own the night
I'll do what it takes
Just finding a place
Where I belong
Being down not out
Being lost not found
On this lonely track
The wind can roll
The storm can rage
It's all the same
I'm not turning back
I'm on my own and the road is long
I'll do what it takes
Just finding a place
Where I belong
Dusty tracks kicking on and on
Not a coin to my name
Just finding a place
Where I belong

No chains to break
No walls to climb
Just space and time waiting for me
Just stars to guide where I need to be
I'm on my own and the road is long
I'll do what it takes
Just finding a place
Where I belong
Dusty tracks kicking off and on
Not a coin to my name
Just finding a place
Where I belong
Where I belong
Where I belong
I'm on my own and the road is long
I'll do what it takes
Just finding a place
Dusty tracks kicking on and on
Not a coin to my name
Just finding a place
Where I belong
I'm on my own (where I belong)
And the road is long (where I belong)
I'll do what it takes (where I belong)
Just finding a place (where I belong)
Dusty tracks (where I belong) kicking on and on (where I belong)
Not a coin to my name (where I belong)
Just finding a place"
