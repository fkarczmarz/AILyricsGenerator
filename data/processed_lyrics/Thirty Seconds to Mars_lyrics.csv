lyrics
"Not the end and not the start
I believe in nothing
Not the Earth and not the stars
I believe in nothing
Not the day and not the dark
I believe in nothing
But the beating of our hearts
(Oh-oh-oh)
I believe in nothing
(Oh-oh-oh) One hundred suns until we part (Oh-oh-oh)
(Oh-oh-oh)
I believe in nothing (Oh-oh-oh)
Not in sin and not in God (Oh-oh-oh)
(Oh-oh-oh)
I believe in nothing
(Oh-oh-oh) Not in peace and not in war (Oh-oh-oh)
(Oh-oh-oh)
I believe in nothing (Oh-oh-oh)
And think about your life
Do you want to be different?
Try to let go of the truth
The battles of your youth
'Cause this is just a game
It's a beautiful lie
It's a perfect denial
Such a beautiful lie to believe in
It's time to forget about the past
To wash away what happened last
Hide behind an empty face
'Cause this is just a game
It's a beautiful lie
It's a perfect denial
Such a beautiful lie to believe in

Everyone's looking at me
A quiet desperation's building higher
I've got to remember this is just a game
It's a beautiful lie

It's a beautiful lie
It's a perfect denial
Such a beautiful lie to believe in
Did we imagine half of it?
The secret is out
The secret is out
To buy the truth and sell a lie
The secret is out
The secret is out
The secret is out
The secret is out
We faded faster than the speed of light
Took our chance  crashed and burned
No we'll never ever learn
I fell apart  but got back up again
We both could see crystal clear
That the inevitable end was near
Made our choice  a trial by fire
To battle is the only way we feel... alive
I fell apart  but got back up again
And then I fell apart  but got back up again
And then I fell apart  but got back up again
Way  oh
So here we are  the witching hour
The quickest tongue to divide and devour
Divide and devour

My desire
And I fell apart  but got back up again

Surrender to nothing or will give up what I
Started and stop this  from end to beginning
A new day is coming and I am finally free
Run away  run away  I'll attack
Run away  run away  go chase yourself
Run away  run away now  I'll attack
I would've kept you  forever  but we had to sever
It ended for both of us  faster than a
Kill off this thinking  it's starting to sink in
I'm losing control now  but without you  I can finally see
Run away  run away  I'll attack

Your honesty like a back that hides a knife

Tell me did you smell her taste?

I want my message read clear
I'll show you the way  the way I'm going
So I run and hide  tear myself up
Start again with a brand new name

I was almost there
Just a moment away from becoming unclear

The truth comes quickly I found out
The future swiftly
Time runs down
A liar's litany
Without a doubt
Come and hit me
Strike me while Iâ€™m down
Fortunes fade in time

Quiet hands

An old romance
Come and kill me

For the end of all days
The prophets are preaching
That the gods are needing praise
The headlights are coming
Showing me the way
The serpents are singing
A song that's meant to save
All we need is faith
All we need is faith
Faith is all we need
The desert is calling
The emptiness of space
The hunger of a lion

A maniac's new love song
Destruction is his game
I need a new direction

A lifetime of consumption
They've all become the same
I punish them for pleasure
And pleasure some with pain
I punish you with pleasure
And pleasure you with pain

And I've fallen through the air
I used to live out on the moon
But now I'm back here down on earth
Why are you here? Are you listening?
Can you hear what I am saying?
I am not here  I'm not listening
I'm in my head and I'm spinning
Is this who you are?
Some sweet violent urge
A weak fallen man (A weak fallen man)
With the promise of an end?
All the pretty people died
Innocence is out of style
All the whores have gone away
Now there is nothing left for me

The ultimate defense is to pretend
Revolve around yourself just like an ordinary man
The only other option to forget
Does it feel like we've never been alive?
Does it seem like it's only just begun?
To find yourself just look inside the wreckage of your past
To lose it all you have to do is lie
The policy is set and we are never turning back
Does it feel like we've never been alive?
Does it seem like it's only just begun?
Does it feel like we've never been alive inside?
Does it seem like it's only just begun? (it's only just begun)

You slipped a couple times  but it's fine
'Cause if I started pointin' fingers  you would see mine
I don't wanna judge you  oh-oh-oh
You see from the side when I'm blind
You're the one I'm callin' when I need a lifeline
But I don't wanna lose you  oh-oh-oh
Whatever weather  if it rain or shine
Whether it's pain  pleasure  good and hard times
We might go 'round and 'round  but I wonâ€™t back down (Oh)
People  they come  and people  they go
When the leaves change and the colors they show
Can you hold on through the seasons?
Through the seasons  oh
Through every high and through every low
A beautiful lie  it never gets old
Can you hold on through the seasons?
Through the seasons  oh
Whatever weather  if it rain or shine
Whether it's pain  pleasure  good and hard times
We might go 'round and 'round  but I wonâ€™t back down (Through the seasons  oh)
Whatever weather  if it rain or shine
Whether it's pain  pleasure  good and hard times
A cold sweat  hot-headed believer
'Round and around and around and around  we go
Not really sure how to feel about it
Somethin' in the way you move
Makes me feel like I can't live without you
It takes me all the way
I want you to stay
It's not much of a life you're livin'
It's not just something you take  it's given
'Round and around and around and around  we go
Not really sure how to feel about it
Somethin' in the way you move
Makes me feel like I can't live without you
It takes me all the way
I want you to stay

Somethin' in the way you move

Violent inside
Beautiful and evil
One and the same
Just remains of an age
Lost in a daydream
What do you see?
If you're looking for Jesus
Then get on your knees
Enemy of mine
I'm just a stranger in a strange land
Running out of time
Angel or demon
I gave up my soul
I'm guilty of treason
I've abandoned control

Do you live  do you die
Do you bleed for the fantasy?
In your mind  through your eyes
Do you see  it's the fantasy?
Maybe tonight we can forget about it all
It could be just like Heaven
I am a machine  no longer living
Just a shell of what I dreamed
Do you live  do you die

What would you do? (Whoa)
What if I fell to the floor?
Couldn't take this anymore
Come break me down

Out of my head
Stuck in a moment of emotion I destroyed
Is this the end I feel?
Up in the air
Fucked up on life
All of the laws I've broken loves that I've sacrificed
Is this the end?
I'll wrap my hands around your neck
A thousand times I tempted fate
A thousand times I played this game
A thousand times that I have said
I've been up in the air
Lost in the night
I wouldn't trade an eye for your lies
Your lust for my life
Is this the end? (Hey)
You were the love of my life
This is a portrait of a tortured you and I

 built deep inside
 I'm a selfish bastard
 it stays the same
 I've erased
Stay in the shadows and remain in the cold
Places we'll get to in our lowest of moments
Feels like there's no way out of the frozen  so
Run away  run away  we always run away
Nobody wants to see who they really are
We wanna cover the mirrors and paint over the scars
God knows who we are
Life leads us out of the dark
Let there be light
And we'll set this world on fire
Let there be light
And we'll sÐµt this world on fire
Come away  come away  you'rÐµ overthinking it
You gotta stop over complicating the little things
Tangled in wires and they're tripping you up
Stuck in a rut
Everything you gave is never enough
But if we change the way we look at life
The life we look at changes
Every single pair of hearts started out as strangers
