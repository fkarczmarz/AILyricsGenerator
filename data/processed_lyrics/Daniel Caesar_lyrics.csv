lyrics
"Hold it in a sweet embrace
When I enter in that place
I'll sing its praise
If we lift our voices high
Evil forces pass us by
And our cause will never die
There will always be space for you and me
Right where you left it
And just maybe
Enough time will pass
We'll look back and laugh
Just don't forget it
And maybe I'm wrong
For writing this song
Losing my head over you
And I'll be here
'Cause we both know how it goes
I don't want things to change
I pray they stay the same  always
And I don't care
If you're with somebody else
I'll give you time and space
Just know I'm not a phase

The people know your name
They smile when they see you
So why the long face?
It feels so good to hold you in my arms

You need me to see right through you

Today I won't be insecure
You deserve the world and more
Next time I'll knock at your door

When you hold me
You kiss me slowly
It's the sweetest thing
And it don't change
If I had it my way
You would know that you are
You're the coffee that I need in the morning
You're my sunshine in the rain when it's pouring

Starting today
I wouldn't changе
How I feel about you
Settles in the same specific place
Light refused to go
Drink it from a cast and iron plate
Instead of cold milk
Was offered unripe
Instead of silence
Considered craven
Nothing made it seem
Hidden where the aging soil was pure
Pressed against the crease
Mountains become fragrant at the source
So can you stand this
Exotic angle
I read it somewhere
That they would lie still
I remember how cloth hung
Flexing with the forest clung
Half waist and high raised arms
Kicking at the slightest form
I remember my first love
I remember my first love

I don't give a damn 'cause it don't make a difference
I can't get mad 'cause I know I went missin'
Cupid takes aim and puts holes in ambition
Can't go back home 'til I finish the mission
In spite of these complexities
Don't give up all of your smiles
Push away and they'll come closer
Ain't been touched in a while

Please do not lean on me  I'm unstable
Please do not lean on me  I'm unstable
Sex in the air  I'm deep in despair
Could you please act like you're unaware?
But we both know I'm just a dog chasin' his bone
Please understand  I'm just a man that's nearly
Figured out his master plan
Just stick around and you gon' see
I'm worth every pound
Please do not lean on me  I'm unstable

The more that we both try to fight it
The harder it's gon' be
I wish that we could stand united  instead we're crumblin'
I know that you gon' always love me
In spite of things you've seen
In spite of things you've heard me say
No matter how obscene
If I am the sky (If I am the sky)  you are the sea
Starin' back at me

DB9 full throttle
I feel like I'm drifting away
The pseudo life ain't bad as they say
Thinking about fuckin'
I'm dreamin' of a better day
The pseudo life ain't bad as they say
If I should die before I wake
Thank God I left this pseudo place
All I love and all I am
Is not in sync with God's great plan
After all is said and done
I pray that we at least had fun
And if I never penetrate
God take my life for goodness sake
Welcome to my funeral
 start writing
 shorty
 how you doing?
 I can't feel it
Pistol in my palms
Tears soakin' my pillow
As I write this song
I caught my lady being untrue
I had to prove myself a man
Singin'—yes
I shot my baby down that day
Singin'—yes
I stepped inside the room I still have dreams about it
What did I see?
His arms are wrapped around you like he's been about it
I couldn't believe
Expression that I've never seen you wear before
Clothes that I bought strewn on the floor
Quietly I closed that bedroom door
Headеd downstairs to the kitchen drawer

Lately you've been on a wave
Seen you lit up in the place
Sometimes you're sad  I see it on your face
I can tell you're not okay
I know you're only seeking out the beauty
In fulfilling your duty
The answers it seems
Are inside your own dreams
My mortality's staring back at me
Niggas think I'm scared
Niggas think I'm a bitch
Like I ain't come prepared and I ain't know what this is
I've slept like Jacob  a rock for a pillow
Run swift like Elijah  away from the middle
Seen the world  overindulged maybe a little
But now your boy is up  and I'm fit as a fiddle
Bourgeoisie tryna silence me
They don't know what I've been through
Don't know what I pree'd
Seen shit that you see up in your TV screen
Follow me to salvation
Your mind still 'pon plantations
The shepherd  holds information
Gives it out as its taken
How can I change what I've got?
We don't punish the tiger for catching its prey
So how am I the one to blame
If it's in my nature?
And I don't know why I fight it
The least I could do is try
But ego's in the way
I know that you feel mad today
But that anger will fade away
And you'll wish she was here
It's never over until life ends
Lay down beside
It's in my nature and it's okay (it's okay)
And I'll be your goddess and you a part of me

To make you feel a way
From the first time I looked in your eyes
I knew that I would find a way

Might've seen me outside like socially
My words come out clumsy
Make me sound bummy
My thoughts be like poetry
And when it comes down to it separates me from phonies
But sometimes it's lonely
Just a general reminder
Don't no one love you but yo' mama
Why should they?
It's imperative that you remember this
Used to be ugly
Wrapped in a Snuggie
Sometimes I'm funny
But if you study
Then we'll be buddies
