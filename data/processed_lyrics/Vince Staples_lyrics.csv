lyrics
" barrel louder than the motor
 and they tapping Motorolas
 gotta live with paranoia
 where your clout at?
 nines 'round 9 in the A-M
 they killed my bro—that's been the price of bangin'
 baptism for the shooters
 we was crashing shit together
 my neighbors ain't never call police
 spark it if you don't know the call
 the final hours up
 just tryna build my castle up
Hot as 65 hunnid degrees (65 hunnid degrees)
Hard on a ho  drop your drawers to the floor
65 hunnid degrees (Block been hot  'bout)
65 hunnid degrees (Block been hot  'bout)
65 hunnid degrees (Block been hot  'bout)
65 hunnid degrees (65 hunnid)
Running to get to that check  I'm coming
Jumping out of that back seat  busting
Back when Killa Mo had 'em coppin' crystal through the prison door
Birds and the bees  come and fuck with a G
Hot as 65 hunnid degrees (65 hunnid degrees)
Hard on a ho  drop your drawers to the floor
65 hunnid degrees (Block been hot  'bout)
65 hunnid degrees (Block been hot  'bout)
65 hunnid degrees (Block been hot  'bout)
65 hunnid degrees (65 hunnid)

It's time to show how much you love your home
It's one nigga outside  two niggas up inside the store
One nigga gon' die  the other two can come along
Gloves with the disguise  bang the set before you blow
Don't stop 'til he drop  don't shoot for the skies or shoot for his toes
I told you before that niggas gotta die for this shit to survive
Is you with it or not? Get to knocking  then
Problem is  lot of niggas scared of the consequence
Common sense missing from your head when the pressure on
Niggas from my home ain't enroll in the colleges
Gleaming with the tints and the stash  no tags
Bumping poison on the ave  getting cash 'til a nigga gone ('Til a nigga gone)
And ain't shit wrong with the truth
Birds and the bees  come and fuck with a G
Hot as 65 hunnid degrees (65 hunnid degrees)
Hard on a ho  drop your drawers to the floor
65 hunnid degrees (Block been hot  'bout)
65 hunnid degrees (Block been hot  'bout)

Eyes can't hide your hate for me
Maybe you was made for the Maybelline
Spent so much tryna park the car
Barely got a tip for the maître d'
You head straight to the oyster bar
I tread light each time we speak
And them glass shoes ain't made to walk
Morning dew's giving you the coldest feet
Said that you was comin' through after dark
To look at the stars and hardly speak
This thing called love real hard for me
This thing called love is a God to me
And we all just God's property
So feel free to fulfill the prophecy

I ain't tryna be too forward with you  looking forward to you
Tryna split a couple kids  maybe mortgage with you
Do it all to get you  so just lemme know
Pop it baby (Pop it baby)  don't keep me waiting (Keep me waiting)
Be my lover (Be my lover)  be my lady (Be my lady)
Other people (Other people)  drive me crazy (Drive me crazy)
Really got me thinking about your body (About your body)
I'ma let you know that I got that dope
But if you take a toke
You gon' be running 'round tripping
'Til you get your hands on more  yeah
You gotta be certain
Before you consider fucking me
'Cause you hit this shit once
Hey!
Uber driver in the cockpit look like Jeffrey Dahmer
But he looking at me crazy when we pull up to the projects

Finna spaz 'cause most my homies never finna get this chance
Wonder if they know I know they won't go where we kick it at
Fight between my conscience and the skin that's on my body

The police kill us  so we made up our own laws
Been fighting this long war  it's shells in this shore sand
Stacking money and problems as I wait for the Rapture
Everybody bleed
To make it up to Heaven  despite the things I've done
To make my mama proud  feel like her only son
With everything I need  with everything I want
To do it like nobody has ever done

Do doves cry when a Black man die  or do we croak with crows?
The young catch gunshots  the old catch the Holy Ghost
Just bar windows and six-fours with no switches
Was broke with no bitches  she love me  though
You'll kill me if it make you richer  what you screaming you my brother for?
Heart is where the hatred is  the brain'll stain the love below
And life is what you make it  so I'm making money for my folks
To make it up to Heaven  despite the things I've done
To make my mama proud  feel like her only son
With everything I need  with everything I want
To do it like nobody has ever done
I been through Hell and back  I seen my mama cry
Seen my father hit the crack  then hit the set to flip a sack
I done seen my homies die  then went on rides to kill 'em back
So how you say you feel me when you never had to get through that?
We live for they amusement  like they view us from behind the glass
No matter what we grow into  we never gon' escape our past
So in this cage they made for me  exactly where you find me at
Whether it's my time to leave or not  I never turn my back
To make it up to Heaven  despite the things I've done
To make my mama proud  feel like her only son
With everything I need  with everything I want
I can love you

Bitches think they livin' in a dream 'til I wake 'em up
Looking for a nigga with the green shinin' in the club
Trying to trade the hoes life for the red rose life
18 years with a check coming every month
Every step you take will get you closer to the paper
Pay attention to the ones known
The Marilyn Monroes use their wombs as ways to move forward
Fall with the rules to bask in the glory
Bastard child often lost in the story
She don’t want him involved

And your head in the stars

You ain't nothing but a vivrant thing
Ass too thick for your 5'10 frame
Want to spend all night in your nine lives?
Get to purring when that liquor get to burning

She rang the front door  she came commando

No time for conversations  cold shoulders

Gave head  then begged the boy to crip walk
I write the James Joyce  don't need the Rolls Royce
I need the straitjacket  finna go batshit
Sick of these rappers stealin' my swagger

Speaking on the unjust way the justice system is justifying crimes against our kind
Justice is supposed to be blind  but continue to cross color lines
Hands up  don't shoot? You shot
Stand your ground? Blacks don't own no ground to stand on  so we stand on our words.
Black and hooded is the official probable cause for cops to keep weapons drawn
I can't breathe through the chokeholds and gunsmoke
These realities drift in the pen to inform Black boys and men of the dangers outside their doors
They kill and arrest us  transgress and oppress us
Damn  cuz

Sometimes I feel all alone
Sometimes I can't get away
I feel my life is in danger every night when I lay
So can you do me a favor  smile for me?
I know they hoping that it's right back to the ghettos I go
I know my pigment is not that of a businessmen
I know they think I'm ignorant  I'm fucking up my privilege
I know that money come and go so money not my motive no mo’
I made enough to know I'll never make enough for my soul
I turned my back on my friends
I turned my back on my home
I left the streets where I've grown
To chase the yellow brick road
I heard they paved it with gold  I turned around and seen they pissed on it
Just like me
But that's alright because my soul burning  please set me free
I hope to see you in another life time  mines just not for me
Can’t you see?
Every night up on my knees I pray
Smile for me
That everything will change and be ok
Smile for me
Maybe I'll stay  maybe I'll pass away
Smile for me
I'm holding on to what the pastor say
Smile for me

I feel my life is in danger every night when I pray
So could you do me a favor  smile for me?
Wish I felt your body without me getting my feeling's touched
People tell me I'm too young and I should live it up
How could you not feel that? These freaks wanna give it up
Sometimes I feel like giving up

Blood rushing through my brain  sometimes I wanna kill myself
Sometimes I feel like giving up

Motion of the ocean waves capsize me  baptize my frame
Salt water inside my wounds  still don't know who to blame

Do you like the sunshine  do you like the snow?
Do you wanna talk about it  or be alone?
I think that you should know
That this could be forever  baby
Open up your eyes and tell me what you thinking
Open up your mind  and tell me what you seeing inside of me
Why we fussing  fucking up this evening?
I probably couldn't fix it if I knew the reason
Up on the sea  where I see you fallin' in the deep end
Is it love? I would really love to know the meaning
What's the grudge that you're holdin'? Hold my hand
Let me take you to the land where the ocean and the sands are meetin'
Look at the sun  all we need to see to know our freedom
Open up your heart
If we don't love  then we fall apart
This could be forever  baby
I never seen you wetter  baby
I didn't mean harm—don't make me regret it  baby
'Cause if I never knew you  I could never do this to you
Hope you understand
They never taught me how to be a man  only how to be a shooter
I only need the time to prove it
'Cause this could be forever  baby
This could be forever  baby

My teachers told me we was slaves
My mama told me we was kings
I don't know who to listen to
I guess we somewhere in between
My feelings told me love is real
But feelings known to get you killed
I feel as if I'm misconstrued
I spend my moments missing you
I'm searching for atonement
Do I blame my darker tone?
I know somethings are better left unsaid and people left alone
Pick up the phone

Either build or destroy—what you going for?
Just a pawn in the plan  tryna hold on
When the smoke clear  why was the war fought?
'Bout time you abandon the folklore
How you rich  but your bitch in an old Ford?
How you Black  selling crack for the white man?
How you real  wouldn't kill for your right hand?
On the stand  sworn in with your right hand
It was all going good 'til the rave end
Knife scars on your neck from your best friend
Nas talk  keep a Tec on the nightstand
Every nigga dead to the world 'til his life end
You're missin' the target  what more can you ask me for?
You want it  my dearly departed
I cocked back and shot it  what more can you ask me for?
More Black kids killed from a pill than the Feds in the projects
In the Planned Parenthood  playing God with your mom check
You ain't e'en been to prom yet
What he charge for the dream that you bought  girl?
What's the price on a life in this dark world?
Couple hundred where I come from
How you sleep when the sun down?
I ain't really tryna judge
They be lookin' for somebody you can love
He was lookin' for somebody he could fuck
Took your body  wouldn't bother with you none
Spoiled rotten in the bottom of the slums
Caught up in the fun

Niggas emotional nowadays
Cryin' in court when they catch a case
Off of the porch in eleventh grade
Calling her weak when my mama prayed
Prolly why none of my karma came
Just put the Benz in my mama name

Had me up in church at a young age
Should've had the nigga at the gun range
Rich or poor people gon' use the shit
Might as well go and get used to it
But everybody dead (Everybody dead)
Look how far we came
Look how far we came
Found a way to channel my anger now to embark
The world's a stage and everybody's got to play their part
God...with the signal clear as day
Put my Glock away I got a stronger weapon
Put my Glock away I got a stronger weapon
My bitch look like Mona Lisa
Hammers busting like a soda in the freezer
Think of heading to Ibiza
Need a breather from the tripping
Either that or my brains to the ceiling
Ain't a thang to a G
Cold game all came in a dream
Woke up feeling like the walls caved in
Write that on the grave that I get laid in
A wise man once said that a black man better off dead

Learned the power of words when we was younger
Saying fuck the sign on his curb can make him hunt you
Turned the African into the nigga then they hung him
Who the activist and who the Devil's advocate
Or do it matter? Shit
They only fucking with the rapper if the rapper rich
Or got a platinum hit
A chain or two
Seem the music interchangeable
I write directions for the road to let you know
Edgar Allen Poe
Tried to warn 'em of demise and all he seen was crows
All in 'til the lord get me
Put my Glock away I got a stronger weapon
I'm standing here and I ain't got you
As we lay here  lovers in arms
I can feel your fear  can this love be true?
I'm losing faith 'cause you keep stalling
I'm losing faith 'cause you keep stalling
Know that I'm a real one  I don't do no ghostin'
I know that you love me  you don't gotta show me
You know I'm down for whatever  protective of you
I don't wanna use protection with you
But the glove'll keep you safe if you ever get loose
Never put you in a jam  hold whatever for you
When you first shot your shot  I knew you would be the one to hit the spot
Only you can make it clap for the homies  I am not
Tryna make it pop
Put that pussy nigga 'cross the street from Cherry Park
Hope we don't get caught
Don't you break my heart

Nothing I could do for you but sit and wait  contemplate
Did we leave a trail? Did we make mistakes?
Can't drop on your bail  can't check on your case
Know that you won't tell  that's why I'm afraid
You'll probably never get to see the light of day
I'm ashamed to say I think I hate you now
We should've took 'em on a chase 'cause I can't save you now
At least give me a chance to try to lay 'em down
Is you trippin'? You forgettin' that we made these vows?
Still here I am  waiting 'round
I can't wait until you bust it down
Probably go a hunnid rounds
