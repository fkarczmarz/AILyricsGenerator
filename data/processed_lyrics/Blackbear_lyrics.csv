lyrics
"You're too high to realize
I see through the smile that you’re fakin'
And everything's changing  is your heart worth breakin'?
Everything perfect to you
Think you love the idea of us more than the real thing
Hope your heart don't break too much
You’re too busy talking over me to hear what I’m sayin'
You’re too high to realize
I see through the smile that you're fakin'
And everything’s changing  is your heart worth breakin'?
You might also like
I'm missin' the way that it used to be
You say I changed  maybe you changed me
Everything perfect to you
Think you love the idea of us more than the real thing
Hope your heart don't break too much
You're too busy talking over me to hear what I'm sayin'
You're too high to realize
I see through the smile that you're fakin'
And everything's changin'  is your heart worth breakin'?
Is your heart worth breakin'?
Is your heart worth breakin'?
Is your heart worth breakin'?
You know I was down for you  down for you
Now I'm wishin' that I never bowed to you  bowed to you
I'm in this shit I can't get out of  I'm not proud
I hate the sound of all these songs 'bout you  songs 'bout you
You know I was wrong 'bout you  wrong 'bout you
Let you hold onto this cash  let ya hold onto
I'm in this shit I can't get out of  I ain't proud of
I'm runnin' outta time to hold you close
Runnin' outta time to be your man  yeah
I'm just lost in the moment  yeah

Runnin' outta time to be your man  yeah

Oh
What are you yellin' for?
You’re screaming out your lungs all day and night
I can't control a girl like you
She need a Saturday away from home to drink more champagne
I can't mold a girl like you
In all designer to remind ya
You can't buy her  just her clothes
Can't define her  can't design her
In the 90210
I can't find her  I can't find her

Yeah  uh
Reverb on guitar plucks
Cigarettes and Starbucks
And her line of credit's high
High as the line gets her that her credit card cuts
So in love with the scene  uh
So in love with being seen
Probably it's time to intervene
But she doesn't care  so she keep the party goin' in the meantime
'Til it's all over  she can't rewind
If she gets her fix well then she's fine
I should prolly hit her with the peace sign
Says she wants me and I fall for it each time
She's aware she's a bad chick
Studyin' in FIDM cuttin' fabric
I really think her soul's made of plastic
End of the story is inevitably tragic
Uh  yeah
I can't find her  I can't find her
In the 90210
In the 90210
90210  90210
Yeah  yeah
I need you  come get it
I need you  I need you
 this is the end of me
 I do not want to speak
 angels are enemies
 this is the end of me
 this is the end of me
She thinks that ever after she'll be livin' happily
And this sudden curiosity you have for me
Showed me somethin' 'bout your personality
What is it you want out of me?
'Cause maybe it's the SoCo
Maybe it's the Hennessy
Maybe it's the fast life
Maybe it's the limousines
Maybe it's the good weed
Maybe it's the nicotine
Maybe she's a dancer
Maybe she's a beauty queen
All these cars and clothes and calories (Yeah)
She only wants to fuck my ego
We all know everything there is to know about a gold digger
You can be my Christina Milian from 2004
I wanna get you out of that dress
It's all about the way that you move
To make a man wanna spend it on you

Dead to me
Even if you're still alive
It's a mess to me  so rest in peace
You're dead to me
Left me here with nothing  took the best of me
Left my destiny
Six feet under the ground  you turned it around on me
And left me with the cold pillow on your side
No phone call  didn't write
Wrong place  wrong time  let it die
Told my friends wouldn't let it get to me
Now it's pressin' on me
When I open my phone
Somebody that I used to know is dead to me
Think less of me  you're dead to me
I don't want anything to do with you
I'm through with you

Got me sick to my stomach  you got the best of me

Had me thinking that I never really tried
If you told me that you loved me  then you lied
Wrong place  wrong guy  let it die
Told my friends wouldn't let it get to me
Now I see you in my dreams
And the pills won't work
You hate me I'm the worst
It hurt  hurt  hurt
Somebody that I used to love is dead to me
Think less of me  you're dead to me
I don't want anything to do with you
I'm through with you  you're dead to me
And I'm dead to you
You're dead to me  think less of me
You're dead to me
I don't want anything to do with you

And I'm dead to you
You're dead to me

You're dead to me  and I'm still alive
Oh  yeah
I spent another night alone again
Woke up in the coldest  coldest bed
I ran into God at the liquor store
She asked me what I'm always running for
I gotta get out  I gotta get with it
I got too much doubt and I don't know my limits
But I could deny and I could just lie
But I'm forthcoming to you
I'm telling the truth  I cheated on you
And it didn't feel good  promised I'd change
But you see right through (You're seeing right through)
I'm sick of taking flights to see these other girls
I swear I'm gonna change (You're seeing right through)
I'm sick of taking drugs and feeling bad
I swear to God  I'm gonna change
I've been so depressed  can't leave my couch
It's all good  it's not like you're checking up on me
You ripped out the best part of my heart and let it bleed
It's all my fucking fault  I can't blame anyone but me

Too much cocaine
Got cut in Brooklyn
I'm in need of moderation
'Cause I just railed down enough lines tonight
To spell your first and last name
I miss the ocean
And I know it's weird to say
It's only thirty minutes
405 to PCH
But half an hour feels forever and a fucking day
And it's all because I dreamt of you
And woke up alone
What a wonderful tone
To bring you back home
My soul is burning
Need Jesus Christ
My mom’s unhappy with all the choices I’ve been making with my life
I don't even fucking care though
I'm probably gonna die
Like everybody else
Is that such a fucking lie?
And I swear to God
If the alcohol and drugs don't kill me
I don't know what will

Sniffing yak out a dimebag

But they don't get me high

And maybe it's time for divine intervention
But fuck it  I'll die how I want to

And lately  I've been going to sleep with my head fucking pounding  ow

I've been worrying about you lately  man
I was lookin' at some of your pictures
You was lookin' a little crazy  man
Your eyes was hazy  man
And it's cool to have fun
But maybe think for just once
How your girl would feel if she lost her baby  man
You know  we need you 'round for a while
You really make fly music
Psh  I used to hide my pain in drugs
I hope that's not what you're doin'
You should maybe try somethin' different
Other than prescriptions
Like findin' religion or designin' a vision
It's your decision  just my opinion
Like we all do
Get high if I want to
I'm worried about you  Bear
Fly where I want to  I do

But we go dumb  yeah  we go stupid
We go stupid  we go stupid  we go—
And you want me to change? Fuck you!
Fuck you  and you  and you
I hate your friends and they hate me too
I'm through  I'm through  I'm through
This that hot girl bummer anthem
Turn it up and throw a tantrum
Fuck you  and you  and you
I hate your friends and they hate me too
Fuck you  and you  and you
This that hot girl bummer anthem
Sleeping in your day again
Your ghost keeps me lonely
All the while  I'm burning for you
For you  oh
And this could be just what you need
Just dim the lights  cut your ties
Break down this line  the mood is right
You burn inside of me
You're burnin' inside of me
You burn
And I'm still alive in you
I'm still alive
I'm still on fire for you
It's burning inside
No use in thinking 'bout it now?
And I'll be what you want
I'll be what you need
I can love you more
So what could be better  she tries to remember
A time when the weather was warm enough
To swim in September  got sick and got better
By middle November  it tore me up
It's not worth the work  we put in what we have
After that dysfunction between us was getting to me
But maybe dysfunction is just what you need
And maybe there's comfort in rippin' the seams
You can't reap what you sow 'til you learn what you teach
So you left out of spite and my pride watched you leave
And conjunction dysfunction was the greatest disease
The greatest
The greatest you ever had
The greatest in the world

You gave me too much to feel
I don't wanna feel this much
You gave me too much pain
It does not feel the same
I don't wanna hurt this much
It's nothin' but pain in the mornin' when I wake up
Shame in your tone when you're sayin' that you're sorry

And if I die before I wake
I pray the Lord my soul to take

I ain't lookin' for lookin' for love
Just want you to want you to know
I'm just lookin' for lookin' for somebody to fuck
I swear
If all you want is a quick fuck
Then let's go
Then let's go
Then let's go
Then let's go (then)
Then let's go
'Cause I can't wait for you
And I don't want the same things as you
But I don't want the same things
No I don't want the same things
I don't want the same things
I ain't lookin' for lookin' for love
I'm just lookin' for lookin' for drugs
Just lookin' for lookin' for drugs
Just lookin' for lookin' for drugs
Lookin' for lookin' for drugs
Say what's on your mind verbatim
Tell me that you're mine
Show me what you're made of
Say what's on your mind
Say that shit verbatim
'Cause I've been second-guessing everything
You know that I'ma be the one that's there for you
You know that I'ma be the one that keep it real with you
Them Xans make you look tired
I ain't tryna piss you off
You know that I ain't biased
You smellin' like Jameson
And you've been on too long
That cocaine make you crazy
Almost every night it seem lately
And I want you and that's so true
But I'ma cut you off if that's what I gotta do
So say what's your mind

I will show you what I'm on
It's not the beginning of something unwritten
It feels like we're living too fast to fall asleep
Take a little hit of this  girl
I will show you the world tonight
And I promise
That this could be everything you needed
This could be everything you dreamed of
And I  won't waste a minute  of time that we're livin'
I won't waste a day 'less I'm wasting my days with you

Take a hit and let it out
'Cause there's a method to my madness
All you need's a little practice

Keep your eyes closed  we can live in a reverie
Breathe just a little deeper
There's no better feeling than now

Oh
Give it a rest  my love  let's take this slow
We both need some room to breathe
And if you know what's best for you and me
You should leave  baby
So weak when you're around me
Weak when you're around me  baby
A cigarette between her lips
She knows how to work a man like me
And she knows she gets exactly what she needs
I'm so weak  baby
So weak when you're around me
So weak when you're around me  oh
'Cause we're two little people in this big old world
I could make a living  baby  you could be my girl

Just used my last one percent to text you  that shit wasn't worth it
LAX to JFK  I probably miss on purpose
Funny how when I don't care  these feelings all resurface
2016 was catastrophic  I deserved it
Just thankful that it's over
Just grateful that it's through
She got a runny nose
I don't think that it's the flu
I got a table at the Nice Guy
Got a bottle of this Ace
You and your girls drank all my liquor
And y'all ain't even say thanks  hoe
I would wish you the best but you already had it
You already had it  baby
I wish you the best but you already
Uh  you already had it  babe
(Ohh  ohh)
Uh  lately I been feeling so dead in my own skin and it's a problem  I admit it
When I look into the mirror  that ain't me  that's someone different
Reminiscing  had a vision
Getting married  having kids
And let's be honest  only thing I'm raising is these fucking digits so
And all these rumors that you bitches start are probably true  I did it
Feeding lines of blow to models off a mirror in the kitchen
It's ironic and specific
Can't say they never saw themselves
Starting up problems with addiction  oh
