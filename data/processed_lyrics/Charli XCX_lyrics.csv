"Fast like a Nascar  never touch us
Got visions  levels  they don't get me
Quiet  no discussions  please hush
I pull up  roll up  fuck up
Don't make decisions for me  you don't know nothin'
I pull up  roll up  fuck up
Fast like a Nascar  never touch us
Got visions  levels  they don't get me
Quiet  no discussions  please hush
I pull up  roll up  fuck up
Don't make decisions for me  you don't know nothin'
Ooh  I'm zooming like a jet ski  zoom zoom
Little dose of napalm  blow it up  yeah
Don't care what she talk about  nah
All she wanna do is my style  yeah
No one on my level
I play nice 'cause I'm too clever
I'm way up  way better
She might pop  but it's whatever
She might sell  but what's she selling?
Does she last long?
I know they write about me (Yeah)
I know that they all see me (Yeah)
Too scared so they don't play me
Some people tried to save me

Ooh  but I'm feeling so good
Better than I ever could
Had bad people in my business  gone now
Cage  prison  now it's gone away
They wanna listen what I say
Think I care about the fame?
Na-na-na-na
I pull up  roll up  fuck up
Fast like a Nascar  never touch us
Got visions  levels  they don't get me
Quiet  no discussions  please hush
I pull up  roll up  fuck up
Don't make decisions for me  you don't know nothin'

'Cause I've been looking at you so long
Now I only see me
I wanna throw the apple into the sky
Feels like you never understand me
So I just wanna drive to the airport
I guess the apple could turn yellow or green
I know there's lots of different nuances
To you and to me
But I can't help but get so angry
I think the apple's rotten right to the core
From all the things passed down
From all the apples coming before
I split the apple down symmetrical lines
And what I find is kinda scary
Makes me just wanna drive

Go fuck your prototype
I'm an upgrade of your stereotype
Don't come with a guarantee
I'll use you up like you're my battery

You know the place I run to hide
I take my problems there to work ’em out

Things that you say when I make bad decisions
Things that we do by the sink in my kitchen
I remember our first date
No chocolate and no bouquet
But the way that you kissed me
These are the things that could make us official
Look at us  isn't it obvious?
Is it so dangerous? Is it so complicated?

One voice tells me that they laugh
George says I'm just paranoid
'Cause I couldn't even be her if I tried
I feel all these feelings I can't control
All this sympathy is just a knife
Why I can't even grit my teeth and lie?
I feel all these feelings I can't control
Why I wanna buy a gun?
Why I wanna shoot myself?
Volatilе at war with my dialogue
I'd say that there was a God if thеy could stop this
Wild voice tearing me apart
I'm so apprehensive now
Don't wanna see her backstage at my boyfriend's show
Fingers crossed behind my back
I hope they break up quick
