" and I put that on the gang  let's get it
 all ass  fuck you throwin' shade for?
 she been on her do too much shit
 lil' baby  where's the function?
 I'm not toxic
 you in my top six
 yeah
 I leave you in vein  we treat 'em the same (Yeah)
 my Hallе Berry  one of 'em married
 think your bitch gon' wanna stay
Don't tell nobody that you was abandoned
I'm the only one that know about your tragedy
I can't feel sorry when you lost random
I can't feel sorry  you're a lost ransom
Drown yourself in expensive fabrics
I think you picked up a lot of bad habits
Just appreciate yourself
Won't you think about you and I?
Just grab my hand and look me in the eye
But this ain't something you should decide
This ain't something that you should decide
Won't you think about you and I?
Just grab my hand and look me in the eye
But this ain't something you should decide
This ain't something that you should decide
Born into status  tell nobody that you never had it
Don't tell nobody that you was abandonеd
I'm the only one that know about your tragedy
I can't feel sorry 'causе your trust random
I can't feel sorry  you're a lost ransom
Drown yourself in expensive fabrics
I think you picked up a lot of bad habits
Just appreciate yourself

My mama mad at me  I know I fucked up big
My girl mad at me  I know I fucked up big
What's love? I guess I'll never understand
Every time I say sorry  I do that shit again
That I would never leave you stressed  I would be honest
I should have never sent that text  I will be honest
I'm sorry for the things I said  I will be honest
Won't you think about you and I?
Just grab my hand and look me in the eye

 South Africa
 then I re-up
 what the fuck you think about me?
 South Africa
 then I re-up
 South Africa
 then I re-up
 your calendar refreshin'
 nobody says shit
 prayin' on this plane
 trademarkin' my brand-new bitch
 huh (LLC)
 type of money dyin' rich
 I don't tolerate force
 I am the one
 take off with the drawer
 you're passin' the torch
 go
 could I say it more?
 E38
 had to go and switch plates
 don't think shit sweet
 now I'm back with the Wraith
 I quit being nice
 now I gotta fight
 quick to make moves
 a big appetite
 they not at your shows
 they Oprah white
 this shit is abrupt
 precise in the cut
 don't worry 'bout me
 my memory deep
 I'm Baby Hykeem
 I pray in my sleep
 I never had dad
 I had to be tough
 turned to other things
 I was sixteen
 I was sixteen
 I was sixteen
 I was sixteen
 bitch
 ho
 huh
 mm
 mm
 huh
 bitch
