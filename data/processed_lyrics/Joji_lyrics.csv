"But you can't make it alone
You know you can make it
But you can't make it alone
I've been writing letters on the wall
I hope one day you'll see them all
And that you're not alone
I've been playing memories in my mind
Wishing you were there like all the time
So I'm not alone
And I'm tired of this madness
Tired of being stranded
I don't wanna be alone
You know you can make it
But you can't make it alone
And I'm tired of this madness
Tired of being stranded
 no  no ties
 you waste your time
 no  no lies
 are you leaving right now?
 so don't annoy me
 you can blame it on me
 you can blame it on me
 live fast  drive fast like two hundred on the dashboard
 live fast  drive fast like two hundred on the dashboard
 drippin' tears on my shirt)
 ayy
 yeah (We don't know)
 no
 please don't stay out
 are you leaving right now?
 so don't annoy me
 you can blame it on me (Blame it on me)
 you can blame it on me (Ooh)
 live fast  drive fast like two hundred on the dashboard
 live fast  drive fast like two hundred on the dashboard
If I hurt you  I'm afraid God's gonna teach me a lesson
Now would you hate me if I said goodbye
So quick you could eat my dust?
Now would you hate me if I ran like hell
In the wind from dawn 'til dusk?
When you cry  you waste your time
Over boys you never liked
Can you not be so obvious?
So keep it light
So keep it light  no
I thought I'd vocalize my troubles  but nobody will listen
I know I'm cryptic and I'm weird  that shit comes off as indifferent
I don't wanna die so young
Got so much to do
I don't smile for the camera
Only smile for you
Smile for you

When you cry  you waste your time
Over boys you never liked
 smiles fade to grin
 just as I feared
 and I was hoping this time
 we were feeling bliss
 there's no time for tricks
 I expected this
 let me in before the day is over
 we might lose it all
 let me in before the day is over
 let me in
 let me in (I know it won't be long)
 let me in
I shed my skin for everybody else
You made me sad and you made me mean
'Cause I'm a bitter fuck
'Cause I'm a bitter fuck
You made me a bitter fuck
Now I'm a bitter fuck
They call me a bitter fuck
Because of you
Because of you
They call me a bitter fuck

Can’t get over you

Highlights in the limelight
Can you show me to the nightlife?
I don't have no social cues
I'm all for you (Ayy)
Can't get over you
I could be the one
That I could be the one
But I won’t be no fun
Water on me
We gon' walk right through
And I'm swimming like Nemo
And I don't really like people
But you're better by default
You can open your eyes
Make you so blind (So blind)
It weigh tightly on my neck until it break
The reflection never point the same way
Won't you come through?

Almost like we left it all on read
Couple feelings never laid to rest
Didn't know that the party was over
And it's true that I need you here closer
Burning photos
Had to learn to let go
I used to be
Somebody in another skin (Another skin)
I heard that you're happy without me
'Cause I'd die for you
You know I'd still die for you
I hopе you're getting evеrything you needed
Found the puzzle piece and feel completed
Just wanted you to know every reason
Hope you really know that I mean that

Do I still wish that it was you?
Perfect don't mean that it's workin'
So what can I do? (Ooh)
When you're out of sight
In my mind
And that's where I find a glimpse of us
And I try to fall for her touch
But I'm thinkin' of the way it was
Said I'm fine and said I moved on
I'm only here passing time in her arms
Hopin' I'll find a glimpse of us
Tell me he savors your glory
Does he laugh the way I did?
Is this a part of your story?
One that I had never lived
Maybe you'll start slippin' slowly and find me again

And everyone else
They don't matter now
You're the one I can't lose
No one loves me like you do

All the gloomy days just seem to shine a little more brightly
Consider what we've got
'Cause I can never take you for granted

And I hope this is the hardest part
We try  we try
And when they say they're satisfied
They're lying  they're lying
Do forgive me  I've seen the treasure's in the bloom
But right now  I'm just not strong enough for you
Sorry  you can see it in my retina
Focus in and out  I'm doing better
Artificial ghost with no perception
I don't feel the way they programmed me to feel today
Some pieces falling from the waist up
I'm so sorry for delays
Just need one moment to erase
That burning pain before the rage

Will you let me win a fair fight?
Can't think right now
I can't lie  on my mind
I feel right  I feel right
I can't lie  on my mind
I feel right
I don't wanna live like that no more  L.A
Only when we sleep
A promise that you'll keep
That you will never weep
Until you fail to breathe
So sleep tight
You were right all my life
Falling for your red eyes (Red eyes)
Both dying right now (Right now  right now)
Got me back on my old life
You're not my gal
You're not mine  you're not mine
I'm not cool  you're not fine
Like they can't die (They can't die)

And my eyes get low in that all-white truck  I can barely see
(Girl  I might be)
And I overflow like mercury
Glowing with uncertainty (Glowing with uncertainty)
Circles at the Chevron (Girl  I might be)
I might be forever gone (Bitch  I might be gone)
And my eyes get low in that all-white truck  I can barely see shit
Hit the gas like you wouldn't believe it
Thank God I was always healing
In a time so slow  I was thinking 'bout us rearranging pieces
Speeding up on that all-black Demon
Going west  I don't got no reasons
I was throwing stones at Hercules
Throwing them so perfectly
Circles at the Chevron
I can't be forever young
Empty choir  operated from above
My voice will be their voice until I'm free
But I'll admit that I'm afraid
Let these moments go to waste
Excuse me for my plastic taste
Excuse me for my plastic taste
Excuse me for my plastic taste
Excuse me for my plastic taste
Excuse me for my plastic taste
Let these moments go to waste
Aaah  aaah
