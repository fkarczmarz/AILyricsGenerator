"Oh my  oh my  oh my
It ain't my fault your man's callin’ my phone
It ain't my fault you can't keep him at home
It ain't my fault I give him what you don't
No  it ain't my fault your man's callin’ my phone
I can't talk right now  he's on the other line
He's on his way to my house right now
'Cause I'm hot right now
All the boys coming so I gotta  so I gotta get mine right now
Oh  my God  what is this?
Your problems ain't my business
I can't help you out
'Cause I’m not the guy that made my girl false promises
No I-I-I-I  can't be responsible
If your-our-our man don't love you anymore
See  he-e-e-e's the one you gotta call
Yeah  that's for sure
'Cause if he hits me up and he wants to come through
Then he's the one you should be talking to
No I-I-I-I  can't be responsible  responsible
It ain't my fault

It ain't my fault he likes spending time with me
He could be with you but he leaves you lonely
Looks like he got you in a sticky situation
If you were putting it down this wouldn't be a conversation
He's at mine right now
We doing things that you wouldn't dare to believe right now
Stop wilding out
If he wanted to he'd be with you right now
Oh  my God  what is this?
Your problems ain't my business
I can't help you out
'Cause I’m not the guy that made my girl false promises
No I-I-I-I  can't be responsible

Cause if he hits me up and he wants to come through
Then he's the one you should be talking to
No I-I-I-I  can't be responsible  responsible
It ain't my fault
Baby  calling me asking where is he
It doesn't matter where's he at
It's where he's at is where he wants to be
It ain't my fault
'Cause if he hits me up and he wants to come through
Then he's the one you should be talking to

Body hotter than a summer

Called my friends like  What you caught last night?
If the ass right and you ask right  you might spend the night
Sitting so informal with the Sailing Team
And we just might start a dinner fight
Need a white chick that's Kylie Jenner right
Need a black chick that cook my dinner right
I can't kick it with no side hoe
I need that Lambo
Come through bustin' like I'm Rambo with heavy ammo
And I'm lit just like a candle
Stock up like sandals (Lil Boat!)
Your body's callin' me
And I know wherever you're at is exactly where I wanna be
But don't blame me

Getting high and I'm up on the ceiling
I don't know what you're doing in New York
All I know is you ain't on my bedroom floor
I'm seein' you undressed in my room
Are you in your house? Are you going out?
Are you going crazy like me?

Washing you down like a waterfall

Sometimes you need someone to carry you home
When it hurts like you've crashed from above
When it's true love

With waters too deep and too cold
Sleepless so many nights
With a broken heart running wild

Disappointed when she caught her
Sneakin' out the windowpane
End up at someone's party
Got too drunk and fucked somebody
Didn't even know his name
I grew a little older
Switched schools  it got colder
It's mostly grey in Stockholm city
Got into strangers' cars and
We'd go to secret bars and
Lie about my age to get in
So I walk myself down memory lane
I still hold on to all the joy and the pain
So I sing a little louder  get carried away
And I thank myself for who I became (Mm)
Big dreams  confidence
Tryna make the world make sense
Who to trust and who to brush aside?
I think about them sometimes
All my friends that went on separate paths
Wish them all the best along the way

But I'm never gonna change
We are a secret  can't be exposed
That's how it is  that's how it goes
Far from the others
Close to each other
In the daylight  in the daylight
When the sun is shinin'
On a late night  on a late night
When the moon is blindin'
In plain sight  plain sight
Like stars in hidin'
You and I burn on  on
Put two and together  forever
We'll never change
Two and together
We'll never change
Nobody sees  nobody knows
We are a secret  can't be exposed

Then it grew to be a siren
I'm a fire and I'm coming undone
Thought that love was made for someone else
But you have changed me
My body and my mind agree
That you have rearranged me
I can't stop this overwhelming feeling
You got me fallin' in love
And everybody here can see us
My world is upside down
