lyrics
" but she thinks I know her
 that’s over
 girl
 if it was you
 every memory fades away 'til it’s gone
 went from everything to nothing
 she’s a stranger that I used to know
 these photos of us
 so in love
 it's not fair
 if it was you
 every memory fades away 'til it’s gone
 went from everything to nothing
 she’s a stranger that I used to know
 oh-oh
 if it was you
 every memory fades away 'til it’s gone
 everything to nothing
 she’s a stranger
 every memory fades away 'til it’s gone
 everything to nothing
 she’s a stranger that I used to know
 see ya
 I need ya
 see ya
 I need ya
Heart on a string
A string that only plays solos
Rain made of echoes
Tidal wave rushing on and on
But I hear it loud and you fall in the deep and I'll always find you
If my red eyes don't see you anymore
And I can't hear you through the white noise
Where they find us no more
On that blue ocean floor
On that blue ocean floor
On that blue ocean floor
On that blue ocean floor
On that blue ocean floor
Shell made out of gold
Rain washed out its glow
Heartbeat steadily leads me down below

On that blue ocean floor

On that blue ocean floor
On that blue ocean floor
On that blue ocean floor
If my red eyes don't see you anymore
And I can't hear you through the white noise

On that blue ocean floor
On that blue ocean floor
On that blue ocean floor
On that blue ocean floor

Know y'all been waiting but
Hey  girl (Hey  girl)
I bet you I talk you right out them drawers
I bet you I talk you right out them drawers
I bet you I take you right out them drawers  ha ha
I was a boxer 'til I knocked that out
I played a doctor 'til I made that house call
I had a shy little quiet girl but now she sings opera loud
But my train is on your track now
So watch out
With the music in the lights in the middle of the night
I’m gettin’ my way like a kid in a candy store
I think you got what I want
And by the end of the night  when you hot like a light
It'll be 'cause you and me burned up the floor
And if you're on what I'm on  then you already know  c'mon

Waitress 'til she got that tip
Sailor 'til I sunk that ship
Yeah  I had a hot little fire girl
But now she just smoke  that’s it
And I ain’t gon' stop 'til I get you out on top of this list
With the music in the lights in the middle of the night
I’m gettin’ my way like a kid in a candy store

We're havin' too much fun right here  uh
She's got a secret  but I know
She wanna break it down for me like she tryna get some paper
Who needs a stage with the lights low?
'Cause you already dropped the bullet  turned it into somethin' major
Now  can we discuss how fast you just got undressed?
Girl  if sex is a contest  then you're coming first (And)
Don't rush  go slow  I-I can't lie  I'm impressed
Standing ovation  encore  when love curtains close
It's a cabaret  oh  oh (Put on a show  get on the floor)
'Cause even though I'm a professional  I like to do my work at home

So long 'til you get off from work  but listen
I got some better positions for you to take in so long
Always strap up just for safety then go long
Do my touchdown  dance in it  no clothes on
We might fuck around and slip tonight
You're Kryptonite  should probably have a cape to throw on
On my Eddie Murphy Boomerang for ya
Got a bunch of old girls that I threw away for ya
I been in the gym doing two-a-days for ya
So I can lift ya up when I do the thang to ya
D-do do the thing to ya  girl  truth be told
You set the pace then you ride it like cruise control
The shit feel so right gotta tell somebody
I just can't decide who should know  I'll keep a secret for ya
I'm tryna ease your mind  word to Boosie
Pole in my bedroom  that was there when I moved in
Okay  fine  I'm a terrible liar
Girl  what difference does it make if it was there  or it's mine?
You the girl that's gon' be there when it's marryin' time
And I'ma fuck you like we havin' an affair
I swear it's like I'm undercover  way I'm cuffin' you  though
Presidential shit  girl  you up on the poles
Sayin' this a private show  ooh  boy  don't start
Keep this whole stripper thing secret in a pole vault
North pole boy from the T.O
They ain't really ready for me and that J.T.  though
Cook for ya  then I break it down like a kilo
Got a camera watchin' every single move like casinos
Cabaret  oh  oh (Put on a show  get on the floor)
'Cause even though I'm a professional  I like to do my work at home

Feel it in my brain  tall shot of pain
Pour a little out now for the love that we've made

The bottom of the bottle to fill this empty heart up
I can't drink you away
But I can't drink you away
All these rocks  I can't swim outta this skin I'm livin' in
Got that poundin' on my brain  so I drowned it away
When the sun comes up tomorrow  you can find me doin' the same

The air's so thin  but we don't give a damn
The starry sky across the land
Where we pretend it's our last chance to dance
It's in the air  hospitality
Anything you want  what's mine is yours
But don't you worry about the way I talk  woo
Hey  all of the locals are happy to get out and meet a new face
We dance in circles  on and on in do-si-do and then we sway
Even the old folks'll come out and rock
And we just hopin' the music don't stop 'til the next day

Feels good
'Cause your shine is somethin' like a mirror
And I can't help but notice
You reflect in this heart of mine
If you ever feel alone and
The glare makes me hard to find
Just know that I'm always
Parallel on the other side
'Cause with your hand in my hand and a pocket full of soul
I can tell you there's no place we couldn't go
Just put your hand on the glass
I'll be tryna pull you through
You just gotta be strong
'Cause I don't wanna lose you now
I'm lookin' right at the other half of me
The vacancy that sat in my heart
Is a space that now you hold
Show me how to fight for now
Comin' back here to you once I figured it out
You were right here all along
It's like you're my mirror (Oh)
My mirror's staring back at me  (Oh)
I couldn't get any bigger (Oh)
With anyone else beside me (Oh)
And now it's clear as this promise
That we're making
Two reflections into one

I see truth somewhere in your eyes
Would look at us all the time

If they saw what I saw
They would fall the way I fell
But they don't know what you want
If they knew what I know
They would never let you go
So guess what?
I ain't ever lettin' you go
'Cause your lips were made for mine
And my heart would go flatline
If it wasn't beatin' for you all the time
Glad your mama madе you
You must be an angel

The 21st night of September?
Love was changin' the minds of pretenders
While chasing the clouds away
Our hearts were ringin'
In the key that our souls were singin'
As we danced in the night
Remember how the stars stole the night away
Ba de ya - say do you remember
Ba de ya - dancin' in September
Ba de ya - never was a cloudy day
My thoughts are with you
Holdin' hands with your heart to see you
Only blue talk and love
Remember how we knew love was here to stay

Red was the color of her eyes
When she put me in a meditation state
Her skin is white  so white
Looked like it had no expiration date
Black is the color of the night
When it's time for feeding and her body wakes
There's just something 'bout the demon that she brings out in me
When we raise hell  I can't stay away
Aw  give it to me now
(So evil in the dress)
It circulates  you start to feel it
(Devil in the flesh)
Once she starts to evoke the spirit
(Got you on the floor)
Ooh  she comes alive when you look killing

Make me wanna build a coffin for two

But baby  I just do it for the thrill out of you

Now  I feel my fever on the rise
And the bones in my body start to quake
Straight up from my toes to my mind
She controls me but I don’t want to escape
All of you ones that have tried
Find out that they have made the final mistake
But when she got a bite of my type
She told me that she found her perfect bloodmate

Maybe it's this ocean view  I'm so emotional
And all these thoughts been dancing on my head
I wrote a song for you  I wanna sing to you
But every time I'm close to you
The words wanna come out  but I forget
It might seem like I’m catching something
That’s because it’s true
I can't deny it  and I won't try it
But I think that you know
I look around and everything I see is beautiful
Cause all I see is you
And I can't deny it  and I stand by it
And I won't hide it anymore
