lyrics
"I just wanna take you higher
Throw your hands up in the sky
Let's set this party off right
Players
Put your pinky rings up to the moon
24-karat magic in the air
Head to toe so player
Guess who's back again? (Brrah)
I bet they know as soon as we walk in (Showin' up)
Known to give the color red the blues
I'm a dangerous man with some money in my pocket (Keep up)
So many pretty girls around me and they wakin' up the rocket (Keep up)

Put your pinky rings up to the moon
24-karat magic in the air
Head to toe so player
Bad bitches and your ugly ass friends (Haha)
Can I preach? (Uh-oh) Can I preach? (Uh-oh)
I gotta show 'em how a pimp get it in
Spend your money like money ain't shit
Ooh-ooh (We too fresh)
Got to blame it on Jesus (Hashtag blessed)
I'm a dangerous man with some money in my pocket (Keep up)
So many pretty girls around me and they wakin' up the rocket (Keep up)
What y'all tryna do? (What you tryna do?)
Head to toe so player (Ooh)
Put your pinky rings up to the moon (Ooh)
Head to toe so player (Hands up)
Head to toe so player (24-karat)
Thinking what else could go wrong
Would of stayed in bed
How can a day be so long?
Never believed that things happen for a reason
Do it all over again
So I'd do it all over again
For you
(Little did I know)
Guess that's what I waited for
Never believed that things happen for a reason

Could turn out so lovely
Even though the day went so wrong
I wouldn't change a thing
Do it all over again

Do it all over again
I would do it all over again
I would do all over again for you
So I would do it all over again
Whoever thought a day gone so wrong
Whoever thought a day gone so wrong
Is a song that it means a lot to me
I will leave my heart at the door
I won't say a word
So why don't we just play pretend
Like we're not scared of what is coming next
Or scared of having nothing left?
I know there is no tomorrow
All I ask is
If this is my last night with you
Hold me like I'm more than just a friend
Give me a memory I can use
Take me by the hand while we do what lovers do
It matters how this ends
Cause what if I never love again?
No one knows me like you do
And since you're the only one that mattered

Let this be our lesson in love
Let this be the way we remember us
I don't wanna be cruel or vicious
And I ain't asking for forgiveness
If this is my last night with you
You better hold me like I'm more than just a friend
Give me a memory I can use

We love you Adele
We love you BBC
Go pre-order the album right now

These are the Hooligans
Too many on my team for you to act so mean
All the -eeshas waitin' on me
So why you contemplatin'? Playa hatin'?
If this is how it's gonna be

If you ever find yourself stuck in the middle of the sea
I'll sail the world to find you

When we are called to help our friends in need
And I know when I need it

More beautiful than words could say
They said it wouldn't work but  what did they know?
'Cause years have passed and we're still here today
Never in my dreams did I think that this would happen to me
As I stand here before my woman
I can’t fight back the tears in my eyes
Oh  how could I be so lucky?
I must've done something right
And I promise to love her for the rest of my life
Seems like yesterday when she first said hello
Funny how time flies when you're in love
It took us a lifetime to find each other
It was worth the wait 'cause I finally found the one
Never in my dreams did I think that this would happen to me
As I stand here before my woman
I can’t fight back the tears in my eyes
Oh  how could I be so lucky?
