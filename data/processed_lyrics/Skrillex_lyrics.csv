lyrics
"I've fallen asleep with my head pressed against your flaws
Oh my love (Oh my love)
And something got in the way
And your soul turned black as the sun grows somber
Just open up a little bit more
Just open up a little bit more
Just open up a little bit more
Just open up a little bit more (A little bit more)
Just open up a little bit more
Just open up a little bit more
Just open up a little bit more
Just open up a little bit more (A little bit more)

Still ain't got my marbles

Cause it only fuels the fire
I'll be what you fear
I'm the answer of your desire

Gone with the wind

Let it fade into grey
Burst through the seams

Talk shit with the prettiest lips
Blow a kiss  kick a hole in your speaker  and then split
Do it just for fun  I come second to none

Kept you hidden  here with me
Was not prepared  for a dead end
Take me  take me downtown
Tonight  I want to forget
I want lights to  blind me
I want peace  want to disappear (To disappear)

Whose will is out of spite
We pile into separate agendas
With the songs of defeat playing in our minds
My unhappiness in color
For the abandoned hearts to see them
To bloom into your world
Binded to your perfect lands
To live like somber cattle
And we're gathered as seeds
To sprout mid Sahara
My unhappiness in color
For the abandoned hearts to see them
To bloom into your world
My unhappiness in color
For the abandoned hearts to see them
Find me on Broadway
Under the bitter sky we play?
Be the concrete floor or this cougar whore
You can't trust the dust that's been given
Bring me close to love
Would you give me a reason to believe?
Trapped by the world
Would you give a reason to believe?
Father said
Father told me
So many ways to flip our heads upside down
It's a fellow eclipse of a bit fist
We cry wolf under the hemorrhaging crown
Our lips are not to be closed under the shade of your sniveling
Taking in all the wind of your jump-cliff and whisper ever so

Now wring me out like you would your bastarding father
Swallow a little of that sea
Now taste a little bit of that salt in me
Throw up a little of it on your knees
Now doesn't that bring you back to the beginning?
Before you poured your elements away
Now sink back to the bottom of it all
Seal your lips with the black stitch of a secret
Parade with that speechless dryness of the desert air
Between the bleak deep of your dirty hands
