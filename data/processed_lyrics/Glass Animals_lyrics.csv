"What a nice rocket
Wait a second
 do you want love? Do you want lust?
 like it all cold
 like ya like you're drugs
 like ya like you're (drugs)
 but it's not enough
 from airlock one
 running down my face
 running different ways
 like a billion waves
 just a tear in space
 running down my face
 running different ways
 like a billion waves
 just a tear in space
 but you aren't sure
 so in love
 no-no-no-no-no
 running down my face
 running different ways
 like a billion waves
 just a tear in space
 running down my face
 running different ways
 like a billion waves
Why don't you light that cigarette and
Calm down now  stop and breathe a second?
Go back to the very beginning
Can't you see what was different then?
You were just popping Percocet
Maybe just four a week at best
Maybe a smoke to clear the head
Your head is so numb  that nervous breath you try to hide
Between the motions  that trembling tender little sigh
And so it goes  a choking rose back
To be reborn  I want to hold you like you're mine
You see the sad in everything
A genius of love and loneliness and
This time  you overdid the liquor
This time  you pulled the fucking trigger
These days  you're rolling all the time
So low  so you keep getting high
Where went that cheeky friend of mine?
Where went that billion-dollar smile?

Guess life is long when soaked in sadness
On borrowed time from Mister Madness
And so it goes  a choking rose back
To be reborn  I want to hold you like you're mine
You're gone but you're on my mind
I'm lost but I don't know why
You're gone but you're on my mind
I'm lost but I don't know why
You're gone but you're on my mind
I'm lost but I don't know why
You're gone but you're on my mind
I'm lost but I don't know why
You're gone but you're on my mind
I'm lost but I don't know why
You're gone but you're on my mind
I'm lost but I don't know why
You're gone but you're on my mind
I'm lost but I don't know why
You're gone but you're on my mind
Whispers sloth in curls of smoke
Take a back seat  or play pharaoh
Dance with me and shake your bones
Slow down  it’s a science
He’s been waiting to bring you down
Snake eyed with a sly smile
He can hold you and shake you child
Leopards laze each on plush pillows
Slender capes of red and chrome
Paperback dreams in their deep doze
Twitch their toes to black mambo
Slow down  it’s a science
He’s been waiting to bring you down
Snake eyed with a sly smile
He can hold you and shake you child
Wanna play cheat now? says the sloth
A domino flush to his nose
Tickle that cheek and take your throne
Pump your veins with gushing gold

He turns his leather gripped cane
Those times you clapped and called for quiet
He packs a fat oom paul to
Jib and make home-baked perfume
Snug eiderdown bedclothes
Come on you hermit
You never fight back
Why don’t you play with bows and arrows?
Why don’t you dance like
You’re sick in your mind?
Why don’t you set your wings on fire?
You slick back that wiry mane
A neat tucked slice
Deep trees sleep on the dank lawn
And scratch the slate
You finger down that waxen line
Between your breasts
A squeaky pain upon each breath
The plumbers left
You know the way that I feel

Why don’t you play nice?

Why don’t you stare back
Into my huge eye?
Laid on the floor of your apartment
Bird's eye view of the two of us
Face in make-up and cheap fake blood
What do you think about when you think about love?
I'm dumbstruck when you're tender  but
It's three in the morning  be in the moment
Here in the moment  free in the moment
It tears through my head  does it haunt you too?
Diamonds in the dark in your old bedroom
You held me like my mother made me just for you
You held me so close that I brokе in two
It tears through my head  does it haunt you too?
Nеver really said that I loved you too
Lucky  lucky you 'cause I'm fortune's fool
Such small words but they hit so huge
I don't think I realize
Just how much I miss you sometimes
We were young and so in love
We were just creatures in heaven

For a moment we were just

I don't see the point in a subtle romance
Ten tonne heartache sitting on your back
Scared of the crack where the light comes through
I'm only really me when I'm here with you
And it gets into your head like a cosmic zoom
Coat on the door like an old space suit
Cash in hand with a memory of you
I don't think I realize
Just how much I miss you sometimes
We were young and so in love
We were just creatures in heaven
I don't think I realize

You've had too much of the digital love
You want everything live  you want things you can touch
Make it feel like a movie you saw in your youth

You were ten years old  holdin' hands in the classroom
He had a gun on the first day of high school
You want something bizarre  old conceptual cars
You want girls dressed in drag  you want boys with guitars

You float in the pool where the soundtrack is canned
You go ask your questions like  What makes a man?
Eager-eyed and the milky haze
Scampers round  heavy feet
Spinny legs and knobbly knees
Twitching tail and tongue-in-cheek
She munches fruit from harlot trees
Looking smug and fresh and pleased
She wanders so sloppily and eats
She puts her hands up to the sky
She puts her hands up and she's icing her lie
She puts her hands up to the sky
It makes her well up  it makes her well up
She puts her hands up to the sky
She puts her hands up and she's icing her lie
She puts her hands up to the sky
It makes her well up  it makes her well up
She feels a lick  down her nape
It looks up with a fair glass face
The peeling palms of dirty hands
Jointed thumbs with drumstick ends
Yellow nails from pinching fags
A slimy creature lacking clad
He pulls his fingers from her mind
And lets her see  just like she was blind!

Look him in the eye  and he won't dare to follow
If you need to  hook him with your right
Hook him with your right till he wiggles and wallows
He sleeps atop a bag of raven's legs
Curled up rats napping by his head
Takes his eye out with a ball point pen
And makes nunchaku with his torn off legs
You wake up with a hatchet over your head

Open your eyes choking on his breath

Take a toke of his wet cigarette

Tie his arms with hair from his head
And roll him 'round like a rusty can

Running through my head with a bolo knife
Chopping up the threads made up from looms
Of love and blood and hate and some empty tunes
Eyes killer cold and black and bare
Freaky little tooth hanging solo
Sucking at the walls like a rolo now
Making a cocoon where my brain fits
I wanna go back with a club and attack
I wanna take to my guns and break you
I gotta make my little foe take his own
I wanna go back with a club and attack

There was a crowd of seeds
I must have done a dozen each
It was the height I grew
I've been around a few
Now tell me what you saw
I'll tell you what to
All dressed up in white
Now how can he smile
With a face of all eyes
He wanders the night
Through sneers and words snide
Spinning round and round
His precious mind
Like dizzy neon lights
Can anybody find out
Any other way
It's choking up his throat now
And dripping out his mouth
Like liquified and dying sparks
Like burning butterflies
These creatures are vampires
They're killing by the night
They're falling from the dead trees
To silhouette your life
He sees his white face
Brains limp grey and cold
Trees grow in their throats
And crystals ignored
His cellophane mask
Has filled up with smoke
Look through the holes in his eyes
And see his red righteous soul

And made him go to Neverland
He was something  my old husband
He had all you'd ever want
Did you say something? What'd you say?
Was that your voice or was that me?
Little voices buzzing poison
Backward noise from everything
Dr. Swango says I'm psycho
Says they all from Neverland
They'll never ever let me be
Was that your voice or was that me?
Dirty Dustin  said he saw him
Playing ball with Dizzy Jim
Dizzy Jim had never spoken
Whispered back  You murdered him
My heart strings broke and it was me
I pull  they stretch infinitely
In the summer silence  I was getting violent
In the summer silence  I was doing nothing

Somewhere in Southend when you were fun
You took my hand and you made me run
Up past the prison to the seafront
You climbed the cliff edge and took the plunge
Why can’t we laugh now like we did then?
How come I see you and ache instead?
How come you only look pleased in bed?

Back to the house with your arms round my neck
We drank pork soda with tangled legs

I know I'm no sweet prince of love
Those times that we got drunk
Maybe Jamaica rum
Maybe some Jonnie Dub

Left to be a rock and roll star
Wise little smile that spoke so safely
He booked a one-way ticket
Out west  that's where they make it
Six kids stuck in a bedsit
To sunswept poolside riches
He met a girl who wore Versace
Pink feather coats and jumbo jewellery​
Gonna be a hoop phenomenon
He's gonna be Hakeem Olajuwon
He's got a gold Camaro
He said over the payphone
I try to keep my cool but
My life turns in slow motion
Bye-bye baby blue
I wish you could see the wicked truth
Caught up in a rush  it's killing you
Screaming at the sun you blow into
Curled up in a grip when we were us
Fingers in a fist like you might run
I settle for a ghost I never knew
Super paradise I held on to
But I settle for a ghost
