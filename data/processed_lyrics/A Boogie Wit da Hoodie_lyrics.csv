lyrics
" I wanna—
 it's way different every time it's me and you
 get your pretty ass right here 'cause I miss you
 turned sherm 'causе you said I wanna fuck all day
 ain't hurt no one in so long
 I wanna see you
 baby)
 got you swimming pool
 got you shakin' too
 look what you make me do
 ain't no Wi-Fi
 got a real nigga in they feelings
 not to mention
 she comfortable
 who was fuckin' you
 baby)
I woke up to like ninety-nine missed calls
That's like ninety-nine people I probably pissed off
Like damn  nigga  I was on a jail call
Damn  niggas make me hate my cell phone
Like damn  my nigga  I'm in the studio
Last time I dropped an album was like a year ago
Yeah  you tellin' me you starving  but I been there though
Like growin' up  breakfast  lunch and dinner wasn't cereal
I know what's up
You just wanna be all in the videos and smoke it up
I know you ain't really with the shits but you just throw it up
Pretty bitches in my city litty  they just going up
Nigga  you just wanna be around me 'cause my money up
Heard them goofy niggas tryna line me  they don't want smoke with us
Most my niggas dogs  I hit up bitches that my homies fucked
I hear too much me in niggas' songs  so I had to switch it up  I had to switch it up
Pick out diamonds in particular 'cause I'm just rich as fuck
Rest in peace to that boy Trayvon  I got my hoodie up
They know exactly how we give it up  shoot a bully up
And you bitches know that I cannot waste no time
Bitch  I'm really grindin'
If I ever said  I love you  never mind it
Especially when I feel like you out here thottin'
I threaten you  but I fuck with you  let's be honest
I hide the fact that I love to smoke on exotic
Flowers  I give you all my hours
I fuck around  I miss you though  I promise
Bonnie and Clyde issues  guns around us
No bozos in my circle  they get cut quick
We can't even get around  I got my hoodie on in public
House arrest in Florida  they always checked up on me
So when I was in the studio I said I was in Publix
If you could walk in my shoes  you could walk on water
Percocets like NyQuil  got me buying sawed-offs
Since I been in high school  I been feeling heartless
I swear I was like you  now look at me ballin'
10K on one fit  fly like I departed
Stay with that rocket  ooh  I go J. Harden
Can't tell if I got it  but I stay on it
And they stay frontin'  but it ain't nothin'
'Cause I make money  talkin' big money
Mmh  if I go broke  stay away from me
I might go broke in my late hundreds
It's hard not to talk money 'cause I got money now
And these chains around my neck over two hundred thou
And Puma just gave me a budget  I should say  Fuck it
And give it to the schools 'cause they need it more than I need it now
Swear I paid my dues  I should speak up more though  I'm playin' quiet
Tryna keep it cool like the time I was in the studio with Future and his goons
Sittin' next to my favorite rapper  actin' scared to say it to him
Used to bump March Madness  poppin' Addys because of you
After you and Drizzy dropped  then I got in tune (Yeah)
First time in the Garden  it was all because of you  yeah
I probably was OD-in' to do a song but I was new  yeah
Right when I thought viral was viral  Tekashi blew  yeah
And that's my nigga too  I fuck with you  I swear to God
Type of nigga keep that shit a hundred  cameras off
And I'm the type of nigga you might see in Saint Laurent
With different bitches  denims lookin' like they painted on
Listenin' to D.T.B  yeah  that's our favorite song
I don't trust bitches
But you're just like me  that's why I don't trust bitches
This your favorite song
I don't love bitches
This your favorite song
When you're home  all alone
Reminiscin' my Dior cologne
No going back  I really took your soul
I know  yeah
Woke up with the chills  oh  oh
Took a pill with my milk  oh  oh
Like it's not a big deal  oh  oh
Free all of my bros  whoa  oh
Free my nigga PeeWee  free my nigga Skills  now
Man  you gotta see me  see how I came up now
Used to wear the same shit  I ain't lookin' like no bum now
I'm a New York nigga  hangin' laces off my Uptowns
Grew up in the jungle where they rumblin' for dust now
Runnin' 'round the BX  RIP to Big Pun  now
And I don't know why
I feel like they wanna take my life
And it's all

I go hard and I'ma rocket
I spent 13 on a wallet just a black card in the wallet
Fuck a car key push the start it
Thought I told y'all I'm an artist
Got a baddie in the valley out in Cali pushing gardens
Can't fuck with the extra shit
Every time I go out it's an extra bitch
Tryna get in my bed to have sex and shit
I just wanted some head like the exorcist
I got 99 problems and messages
Don't be asking me why I won't text you bitch
Wrap your legs around me like we wrestling
Get on your knees don't you be so damn hesitant
When I get your body I'ma be alright
And when I get a 'Rari you can be inside it
I'ma get another one and let you drive it

I know you need somebody
And I really need somebody

You gon' wish you can go back and do it twice

Get high on the way to a flight
Would you ride for me? Would you lie for me?
When you come around good vibes with me
I swear other bitches do not get me
Don't be scared baby this is my city
But just in case I keep a .9 with me
I was hoping you can grind with me
It gets lonely on this side baby
But can you stay the fuck off my Instagram
I don't know why my phone's always in your hand
Baby I try to get you to understand mind your business

She hate it when I call her my bitch but she mine forever
Wrote you cause I just wanted to see you
Once you turn into someone they wanna be you
I grew up bumpin' Cassidy and Beanie Siegel
Watchin' crack heads squeeze up on that needle
I said I'm sorry for makin' you feel I need you

Cause it make her feel special
Hit that thing raw just to make her feel special
Several phone calls just to make her feel special

And she always on time forever
That's why she my ride or die
She hate it when I call her my bitch but she mine forever
Ah! Girl pull up on me
You know I wanna know if you could pull up on me
Can I put it in your spine while you kissin' on me?
Cause I know how it feels for someone to be fake with you
Don't worry 'bout them niggas and don't worry 'bout them bitches
And that's just how it's 'posed to be
And I could tell you want me by how you approachin' me
I will show nobody nothin' that you show with me cause

And she always on time forever
That's why she my ride or die
And Whenever The Time Is I Make Time Whenever
If I was invited
She said she wanna be mine
She wasn't with it to ride
I had to kick her aside
I know it just ain't right
But baby you was invited
I promised you would've liked it
She know I be on my grind
So I don't really have time
To hit you back on time
I would've been in your life
But I just wasn't invited
I think that I would've liked it
You were really wastin' my time
But damn I can't lie
She ride the pipe like she bike it
You was the rock to my diamond
The way we could've been shining
We would've been fine
But girl you had to decide
I thought that you was my type
I wish that I could rewind it
But I guess I'll never mind it
Tell me what you want
Tell me why you frontin'?
Is this really what you wanted?
Keep it a hunnit
Every time you started fussin'
I changed the subject
Every time you hear this song is gon' get you upset
You gon' hear it in they headphones on the buses

Cop another pair of Mains then I go to London
Would've put you on a plane in some Red Bottoms
