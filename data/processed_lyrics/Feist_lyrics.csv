lyrics
"Sleepless long nights  that is what my youth was for
Old teenage hopes are alive at your door
Left you with nothing  but they want some more
Oh  oh-oh  you're changin' your heart
Oh  oh-oh  you know who you are
Sweetheart  bitter heart  now I can't tell you apart
Cozy and cold  put the horse before the cart
Those teenage hopes who have tears in their eyes
Too scared to own up to one little lie
Oh  oh-oh  you're changin' your heart
Oh  oh-oh  you know who you are
Money can't buy you back the love that you had then
Money can't buy you back the love that you had then

Who you are (Woo-ooh)
For  for the teenage boys
They're breakin' your heart
For the teenage boys
A song is a promise
If a man is just his song
Then the song is beyond us
And it sends in deep elation
Eventually it could let you down
By believing in standing ovation
'Cause a man is not his song
And I’m not a story
But I wanna sing along
If he’s singing it for me
That filament that flies by
And it brings yellow light from those yellow summers back
I’ve heard years pass through my ears to hear otherwise
We all believe in old melodies
Carry tunes around like they carry me

A man is not his song
Though we all wanna sing along
We’ve all heard those old melodies
Like they’re singing right to me

They always get away with attitude
But they'll try to convince you of your mood
And what you want they'll give it to you
And for a year
She was anti-pioneer
Singing sappy songs
About what went wrong
Two years before
But even now when the false is true
When I call me you
When the flag changes colours the language knows
When the month changes numbers it's time to go
When the flag changes colours the language knows
When the month changes numbers it's time to go home

When the flag changes colours the language knows

That someone is talking about someone we used to know
I think that I know what’s gotta be done
I’ll take a minute alone and decide what to do
You know I’d leave any party for you
'Cause no party’s so sweet as a party of two
You planned meeting me on your way home
And I tried reaching you on your new flip phone
That a stranger is here looking for a reunion
You know I’d leave any party for you
'Cause no party’s so sweet as our party of two
I’m getting tired of these clowns and balloons
I won’t lead you astray

That’s my way in
I saw an old sign
When my world was way down
Quiet on the streets
So I climbed the stairs
To the rarified air
I’ve been on fire
Made from my thoughts
I thought up my life by
Out then back in
That’s the way to begin
But I had to climb down
Into today
And give up the pain
I held myself up by
Be simple
Be simple with me
That’s no way to begin
Come with your true arc
To fall all the way down
Like an empire
Into a kingdom of guts
To become a rooftop
I built me from the bedrock
Made me right up
Ignited little tunes
While the wind was still
Trying to find a way to tell you
If I'm not the true arc
Is even there
Or on a pillow of air
Rip me apart by the lore
To become that rooftop
Had to fall all the way down
You might also like
Be simple
It happens at the break of day
Before your wits are gathered
Even before you are awake
Your thoughts will find a clock to wind
And put dissent into your ear
Even before your eyes are open
The plot has thickened round your fear
We borrow trouble
Seems we all know how
It's an expression from the old days
But even more true now
We borrow trouble
We even borrow timе
Like you don't have enough of your own
Now you want somе of my–
Trouble!

I dropped like a stone
Like a bag of dead weight
So good at picturing the life that I was gonna be left out of
Rather than the one I'd made
They gather heavy on my mind
Knitting thoughts like they're my destiny
Like they're the measurement of time
(Huh!)
I borrowed trouble
I lived on borrowed time
It's a poor skill to get so good at
Making wrong what is all right
We all borrow trouble
It seems we all know how
It's an expression from the old days
But even more true now
Trouble!

And cross the sea and land for him
On milky skin my tongue is sand until
The ever distant band begins to play
He's my Brandy Alexander
Always gets me into trouble
But that's another matter
Brandy Alexander
He's my Brandy Alexander
Always gets me into trouble
But that's another matter
Brandy Alexander
Though I know what I love most of him
I'm walking on needles and pins
My addiction to the worst of him
The low moon helps me sing
I'm his Brandy Alexander
Always get him into trouble
I hide that I'm flattered

Unlock the lock inside of me
Where will you go to keep yourself afloat?
Feeling old until the wing unfolded
Caught me a long wind
Where will we go
To keep ourselves afloat?
I caught a long wind
Long life wind
I got to know the sky
But it didn't know me
I got to see the land
And land on top of the sea
Be the bird  be the key
And now the current tells
What the wave withheld
And the lightning sang
Of where the light would land

Where will you go

Sad sparrow
Good morning bird
Good nightingale
I took a deep breath
Could've been easier like a decade of days
Then wrote that letter that had nothing to say
Staccato vision like a kingdom of days
But still a vision as if help's on its way
Someone who will lead you to someone
Who will lead you to someone
Who will lead you to the one
At the end of the century
The air is clearer a decade away
Singing to a mountain that was empty all along
She wanted feelings that got in her own way

At the end of the century
Century. How long is that?
Almost as long as one of those endless dark nights of the soul
Those nights that never end
(Century)
When you believe you'll never see the sunrise again
When a single second feels like a century
A century
A century
A century
A century
A century
A century
A century
A century
A scrape on the hull
The land and the sea
Are distant from me
I'm in the sky
Thoughts are like pearls
When flags are unfurled
When we're in the dark
I'll ride you like the ark
Because you're mine
Maps can be poems
When you're on your own
And distance is Braille
And all that entails
I'm in the sky
I'm in the sky
Empty as a page
As high as the stage
As full as the room
No matter what we find there
Come back in through the eyes there
Sole and born creation
The lion's in the house
Flowers are up in the air
Crashing against the dark
Fire in the water
Is the body of our love
Nobody should see this
The freeness of the light
Fire in the water

 seasons wait for your nod

 gatekeeper
That made me close my eyes  so then I opened my eyes
Like living in a dream
As long as I stay closed like that
Secretive to stay intact
Well that is not fun
That’s why I couldn’t trust anyone at all
And I got high
And I got low
So I got high
I was bright as the sun
Then Saskatchewan
Then I laid low like the tide
Then Bay of Fundy high
I was living in extremes
And everything that that means
And I got high
And I got low
So I got high

The only age
The beating heart

Lonely and last

Bring 'em all back to life

But who's got the guts to sit with it?
Everybody's on their own
So that way we're never alone
But the mirror in another's eyes
That'll get you every time
There are a thousand different ways to hide
Hiding out in the open
Maybe I'm gonna let you down
Nothing's gonna make us new
What's done is not gonna undo
Hiding out in the open
Maybe he's gonna let me down
Love is not a thing you try to do
It wants to be the thing compelling you
What we should probably say
Let's put off for a few more days
Until you whisper it in my ear
Would change the context
I want you warm as a loaf of bread

Love is not a thing you try to do

Lead them out to sea by the east
In the Doldrums thinking of me
Me on dry land thinking of he
Even if he wanted to
Even if he wanted to
Even if he wanted to
Do you think he'll come back
Would he come back
Honey honey out on the sea
In the Doldrums waiting for me
Me in my boat searching for he
Woah  woah  woah-oh
How come you never go there?
How come I'm so alone there?
Woah  woah  woah-oh
Woah  woah  woah-oh
How come you never go there?
How come I'm so alone there?
I went up to the window
Lightning banging on the cymbals
I ripped into the night
Came storm into your eyes
My horse had worked the fields too long
My bear had lost his innate calm
It's true enough we're not at peace
But peace is never what it seems
Our love is not the light it was
When I walk inside the dark I'm gone
While we look for where it went
It's only echoes in the valley of love
Woah  woah  woah-oh
Woah  woah  woah-oh

We waste time on blame and weak revenge
Waste energy on projections
We're living proof we've gotta let go
And stop looking through the halo
We carry on as if the time is through
You carry on as if I don't love you
And so we find the way is out
To cut the heart out of the doubt now
The room's full but hearts are empty
Like the letters never sent me
Your words are like a lasso
But you're an instrumental tune
Woah  woah  woah-oh
Woah  woah  woah-oh
How come you never go there?
How come I'm so alone there?
Woah  woah  woah-oh

And what grew and inside who
First so simple was the vow
Then the chorus sang about
Your shoulder
The mooring for me
Like water lost in the sea
The cold heart will burst
If mistrusted first
And a calm heart will break
When given a shake
I'm a stem now
Pushing the drought aside
Opening up
Fanning my yellow eye
On the ferry
That's making the waves wave
Illumination
This is how my heart behaves
The cold heart will burst
If mistrusted first
And a calm heart will break
When given a shake

I feel it all I feel it all
The wings are wide the wings are wide
Wild card inside wild card inside
Oh I'll be the one who'll break my heart
I'll be the one to hold the gun
I know more than I knew before

I didn't rest I didn't stop
Did we fight or did we talk

I'll end it thought you started it
The truth lies
The truth lied
And lies divide
Lies divide
I’m also in the mind to just let it go
How to reach out my mind if I can’t think straight
With the goodness so gone I feel to isolate
Until you spoke to me with another voice
You sent in spiders to fight for you
I was so disappointed I didn’t know what to do
I wish I didn’t miss you
I wish I didn’t miss you
I wish I didn’t miss you
I wish I didn’t miss you
Wasting so many hours away
So many ways to waste a day
In this same city I hope you’re not
'Cause the town has shrunk to the size of my thoughts
It was so mystifying to see you so changed
I felt some certainty you must have died
Because how could I live if you’re still alive?

 I'll never give in  our love has got the power
 I'm the girl who loves you inside and out
 we won't ever feel the storm
 I'm the girl who loves you inside and out
 I can't hear a line
 all my laughter and my sorrow
 I will burn again tomorrow
 I will love you till I die
 I'm the girl who loves you inside and out
 I'm the girl who loves you inside and out
I won't have to be shown
The way home
And it's not about a boy
Although although
They can lead you
Break or defeat you
A destination known
Only by the one
Whose fate is overgrown
Piecemeal can break your home in half
A love is not complete with only heat
And they can tease you
Break or complete you
And it came a heat wave
A merciful save
You choose you chose
Poetry over prose
A map is more unreal than where you've been
Or how you feel
A map is more unreal than where you've been
Or how you feel
And it's impossible to tell
How important someone was
And what you might have missed out on
And how he might have changed it all
And how you might have changed it all for him
And how he might have changed it all
And how you might have changed it all for him
Water is running like I stay
Constant growing up
I’m not making this up
It got hard for me to believe in true love
Constant growing up
I’m not running away
I’m not running away
Wouldn’t be telling the truth
If I don’t admit that I depend on you
Constant growing up
The difference between night and day
We watch the moon rise and all that indicates
I’m not running away

Or hear ear to ear
Don't you wish that we could forget that kiss
And see this for what it is
That we're not in love
The saddest part of a broken heart
Isn't the ending so much as the start
It was hard to tell just how I felt
To not recognize myself
And after all it won't take long to fall (in love)
Now I know what I don't want
I learned that with you
The saddest part of a broken heart
Isn't the ending so much as the start
The tragedy starts from the very first spark
Losing your mind for the sake of your heart
The saddest part of a broken heart
To my left they rose and leaf
To my right cross seven seas
Mmmm...
Maybe  maybe they'll stay true
My seeds will cross and then take root
And leave you to an empty room
Lonely lonely  that is you
Lonely lonely  that is you
Paper  paper obsolete
How will you reach out to me
I thought you'd ask me not to leave
Lonely lonely  that is me
Lonely lonely  that is me
Distance makes the heart grow weak
So bad the mouth can barely speak
Except to those who hide their needs
And I have read the golden seal
That tells of how the seedlings feel
Reminds my heart what love can yield

Haven’t got a clue when
I’ll see you again
And when that day comes
And all I shouldn’t say runs
Out before I stop it
Cause I felt it as I thought it
We will struggle with the truth
That sometimes we don’t get to
Love who we are meant to
Love who we are meant to
Drafting as I drift
I cannot write nor reckon it
So will I let it wreck me
Or wreck my dream of family?
Even denial is romantic
And that’s romance’s disadvantage
That sometimes we don’t get to
Love who we are meant to
Well maybe that you’re a real man
Is what is in the way
Cause the idea of the man I love
He’s always loved me
In his lonely way
Is also love
And they listen to teeth to learn how to quit
Tied to a night they never met
You know it's time that we
Grow old and do some shit
I like it all that way
I like it all that way
Now
All these people drinking lover's spit
Swallowing words while giving head
They listen to teeth to learn how to quit
Take some hands and get used to it
All those people drinking lover's spit
They sit around and clean their face with it
You know it's time that we
Grow old and do some shit
I like it all that way
I like it all that way
Such a loveable lamb to me
My care  my coat leave on a high note
There's nowhere to go but on
Heart on my sleeve  not where it should be
The song's out of key again
My moon's white face  what day and what phase
It's the calendar page again
Take it slow  take it easy on me
And shed some light  shed some light on me please
Take it slow  take it easy on me
And shed some light  shed some light on me please
My moon and me  not as good as we've been
It's the dirtiest clean I know
My care  my coat leave on a high note
There's nowhere to go
There's nowhere to go
Take it slow  take it easy on me
And shed some light  shed some light on me please

For I've lost the last love I should ever win
And at last I see how my heart was blind
To the joys before me that I've left behind
When the wind was fresh on the hills
And the stars were new in the sky
And the lark was heard in the still
Where was I? Where was I?
When the spring is cold
Where do robins go?
What makes winters lonely?
Now at last I know
When the wind was fresh on the hills

My guesses were true
You saw me see you
That something you said
The timing was right
The pleasure was mine
The time and the place
The look on your face
Sincerest of eyes
If you're ready or not
The state of our hearts
There's no time to take
When we started
Both brokenhearted
Not believing
It could begin and end in one evening
We were caught by the light
Held on to the day
Till it became hours
The minutes went by

Old teenage hopes are alive at your door
Left you with nothing but they want some more

Those teenage hopes who have tears in their eyes
Too scared to own up to one little lie

They're breaking your heart

Because they're right in front of you
Because they're telling you the truth
So much present inside my present
Inside my present and
Inside my present inside my present
Feeling it from dark to bright
When a wrong becomes a right
When a mountain fills with light
So much present inside my present
Inside my present and so
So much past inside my present
Inside my present inside my present
And so
So much past inside my present
Inside my present
Inside my present
And so
So much past inside my present

And still it's a mysterious thing that I want
So when I get it
I make sense of a mysterious thing
'Cause I've taken flight on such a serious wing
Either fiction or dreaming
We know enough to admit
We know enough to admit
We know enough to admit
It's my pleasure
And your pleasure
It's my pleasure
And your pleasure
An indication of time
Our togetherness
That is how we evolved
We became our needs
Ages up inside
Escaping similar pain
Dreaming safe and secure
Generations in line
Old and then the youth
Come to meet or fade
A chromosomal raid
Built by what we got built for
As much as what we avoid
So the mystery lifts

Admitting that you just can't go through it alone?

Let him in on your secret heart
This very secret that you're trying to conceal
Is the very same one you're dying to reveal
Go tell him how you feel
This very secret heart
Go out and share it
Two words I always think
After you're gone
So selfish
Two words that could describe
When patience is in short supply
We don't need to say goodbye
We don't need to fight and cry
We're so helpless
We're slaves to our impulses
We're afraid of our emotions
And no one knows where the shore is
We're divided by the oceans
And the only thing I know is
That the answer isn't for us
You might also likeI'm sorry
Two words I always think
When I realize I was acting all wrong
We don't need to say goodbye
We don't need to fight and cry
We could hold each other tight
Tonight
Tonight..
Tonight...
But didn't see
He acted that way and held me like a cup
Fill me up
Then pour me out
Therein lies the doubt
We had the same feelings at opposite times
When a good man and a good woman
Can't find the good in each other
Then a good man and a good woman
Will bring out the worst in the other
But what and how
To find us now
When we've become two
Fluorescently blue
Down the neon river
The sadness canoes
Either without or with her
When a good man and a good woman
Can't find the good in each other
Then a good man and a good woman
Will bring out the worst in the other

Living in the past begins the ending first
All I want is a horizon line
Get some clarity following signs
I'll keep on the path that leads up to the clearing
Keep some distance while the words comes in so near and
Then I'll head out to horizon lines
Get some clarity oceanside
Realize what you know that you know by now that
First light was
Last light was
Alright when
The circle married the line
First light was
Last light was
Alright when
The circle married the line
Even from away he is near me
Making me unendingly teary
Makes me remember the things that I forgot
It's as much what it is as what it is not

There's a limit to your love
Like a waterfall in slow motion
Like a map with no ocean
There's a limit to your love
There's a limit to you care
So carelessly there
Is it truth or dare?
There's a limit to your care
This dream of going upstream
The trouble that you give me
That only I can save me
Right down the road

I can't read your smile
It should be written on your face
I'm piecing it together
There's something out of place
Oh
This dream of going upstream
The trouble that you give me
That only I can save me
Out on the road
Because there is no limit
There's no limit
It's not him who'd come across the sea to surprise you
Not him who would know where in London to find you
With sadness so real that it populates the city
And leaves you homeless again
Steam from the cup and snow on the path
The seasons have changed from the present to past
The past
The past
Turns whole to half
The past
Why would he come back through the park?
You thought that you saw him  but no you did not
Who can be sure of anything through the distance
That keeps you from knowing the truth
Why would you think your boy could become
The man who could make you sure he was the one
The one
My one
And deliver it quietly
'Cause some don't get much company
The harbour becomes the sea
And lighting the house keeps it collision free
Understand the lay of the land
And don't let it hurt you
Or it will be the first to
Didn't realize its dangerous size
Came to recognize its steep and rocky sides
More than realized
Pale as a pile of bones
You hope for your babies
And this is how they grow
The teeth by the shoulder
Watching the grey sky
That's acting like a good guy
Came to realize its dangerous size
Came to recognize its steep and rocky sides
Came to recognize its steep and rocky sides
Out to you
Is a wind that gets singing
Whipping at the tune
The same wind comes rushing
That later lays low
And it pulls at my edges
Then continues to blow
Keep on the horizon
Keep on my horizon
Keep on the horizon
It brings hail from old water
And a storm on its knees
And flags from a revolution
That brought us some peace
And the trees for their hundred years
Lean north like calligraphy
And I’m shaped by my storming
Like they’re shaped by their storming
Keep on my horizon
Keep on my horizon
Keep on my horizon
You found you
Keep on the horizon

As strong as that wind
That blew us round the island
Is a wind that has lasted
Longer than the past has
It’s a wind that will keep on
Lasting beyond ever after
It’s a wind that will keep on lasting
Train wheels beating  wind in my eyes
Don't even know what I'll find when I get to you
It's so many miles and so long since I've left you
Don't even know what I'll find when I get to you
But suddenly now  I know where I belong
It's many hundred miles  and it won't be long
Nothing at all in my head to say to you
Only the beat of the train I'm on
Nothing I've learned all my life on the way to you
One day our love was over and gone
It's so many miles and so long since I've met you
Don't even know what I'll say when I get to you
But suddenly now  I know where I belong
It's many hundred miles  and it won't be long
What will I do if there's someone there with you?
Maybe someone you've always known
How do I know I can come and give to you
Love with no warning and find you alone?

Were clear open eyes
Bright blue
Vision not of a light
Carrying pictures
To lay on you
Close up eyes
Let them in
To a mind opening
It's the edge of love
You can't unthink a thought
Either it's there or not
Shadows of the mountain
Don't tell of what's on earth
The breadth and the height
Of an undiscovered first
Now hopeful mountaineers
Climb up to eclipse
The light of the old sun
Cause it's been said
The two would know
Once the two'd been told

Is this the right mountain
For us to climb?
Is this the way to live

Is this the right river
For us to forge?

When I was a young girl  I used to drink ale
Out of the ale house  down into the jailhouse
My body's salivated and hell is my doom
Come sit you down by me and pity my case
My poor head is aching  my sad heart in breaking
My body's salivating and hell is my doom
Please send for the preacher to come and pray for me
And send for the doctor to heal all my wounds
My poor head is aching  my sad heart is breaking
My body's salivating and I'm bound to die
I saw this young lady all wrapped in white linen
All wrapped in white linen
Will I say that I died already
Years ago?
I got so stuck in my ways
That’s no way to behave
Got so tired before I noticed I was done
I felt like I covered my tracks
Like no one had my back
Just so you know
All of this battling goes so slow
Young up
Ya’ young punk
The end is coming
And fear not
Ya’ young pup
That everything that falls is falling
Was I just making it up
Pushing my luck
I got tired before I noticed
You might also like
If I’d corrupted the core by asking for more
Just so you know
All of this battling goes so slow
So I looked into your eyes and said
Then I looked into my own eyes and said to myself
Young up
Ya’ young buck
The end’s not coming
Fear not
Ya’ young punk
That everything that falls is falling
Even if you don’t have your own back"
