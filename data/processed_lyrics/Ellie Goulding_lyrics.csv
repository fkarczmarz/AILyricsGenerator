lyrics
"Do I get the best of your love?
Even when our bodies are drunk
Is it me you're stumbling from?
Forget the words that you said
With your fingers spell out my name
Take away the sky in our breath
I know there's nothing that I can do to make you stay
But one thing I know that will always remain
And that's the aftertaste
The aftertaste
The aftertaste
The aftertaste
The aftertaste
In the midst I'm seeing your face
And I can't believe this is fake
Blow the blossom into your room
As you throw me in disarray
There's a button that I need to press
There's a face that I need to kiss

I know there's nothing that I can do to make you stay
But one thing I know that will always remain
And that's the aftertaste
The aftertaste
The aftertaste
The aftertaste
The aftertaste
I know there's nothing that I can do to make you stay
But one thing I know that will always remain
And that's the aftertaste
The aftertaste
The aftertaste
The aftertaste
The aftertaste
The aftertaste
The aftertaste
The aftertaste
Cover your eyes so you don't know the secret
I've been trying to hide
We held our breath to see our names are written
On the wreck of '86
That was the year I knew the panic was over
That anything could happen  anything could happen
Anything could happen  anything could happen
Anything could happen  anything could happen
Anything could
After the war  we said we'd fight together
I guess we thought that's just what humans do
Letting darkness grow
As if we need its palette and we need its colour
But now I've seen it through and now I know the truth
That anything could happen  anything could happen
Anything could happen  anything could happen
Anything could happen  anything could happen
Anything could

Baby  I'll give you everything you need
I'll give you everything you need  oh
I'll give you everything you need
But I don't think I need you
Stripped to the waist  we fall into the river
Cover your eyes so you don't know the secret
I've been trying to hide
We held our breath to see our names are written
On the wreck of '86
That was the year I knew the panic was over
That anything could happen  anything could happen
Anything could happen  anything could happen
Anything could happen  anything could happen
Anything could
I know it's gonna be  I know it's gonna be
I know it's gonna be  I know it's gonna be
I know it's gonna be  I know it's gonna be
(But I don't think I need you)
(But I don't think I need you)
(But I don't think I need you)
You never let me give up
All the nights and the fights
And the blood and the breakups
You're always there to call up
Yeah like no one can
I know that we don't look like much
But no one fucks it up like us
16 and you never even judged me
Matter of fact I always thought you were too cool for me
Sitting there in the caravan
All the nights we've been drunk on the floor
And yeah you understand
Yeah like no one can
We both know what they say about us
But they don't stand a chance because
When I'm with you
When I'm with you
I'm standing with an army
I'm standing with an army
When I'm with you
When I'm with you
I'm standing with an army
Standing with an army

I'm amazed by the things that you would sacrifice
Just to be there for me
How you cringe when you sing out of tune
And yeah it's everything
So don't change a thing
We both know what they say about us
But they don't stand a chance because
When I'm with you
When I'm with you
I'm standing with an army
I'm standing with an army
When I'm with you
When I'm with you
I'm standing with an army
Standing with an army
Standing with an army
Standing with an army

(I'll be yours)
Standing with an army
Standing with an army
I'm standing with an army
Yeah you understand
Yeah like no one can
We both know what they say about us
When I'm with you
When I'm with you
I'm standing with an army
I'm standing with an army
When I'm with you
When I'm with you
I'm standing with an army
They don't have a chance either
Standing with an army
Standing with an army
Standing with an army
Standing with an army
Standing with an army
Standing with an army
Standing near you
Standing with an army
Standing with an army
Standing with an army
Standing with an army
Standing with an army
Standing with an army
When I'm with you
With wounded lips and salted cheeks
To the departure lounge of disbelief
And I don't know where I'm going
But I know it's gonna be a long time
And I'll be leaving in the morning
Wanna hear your beating heart tonight
Before the bleeding sun comes alive
And hear my beating heart one last time before daylight
I fell for you like autumn leaves
And I don't know where I'm going
But I know it's gonna be a long time
'Cause I'll be leaving in the morning

Here's hoping we collide

Wanna hear your beating heart tonight
Before the bleeding sun comes alive
And hear my beating heart one last time
It's looking so much brighter now
I was lost and now I'm found
Fell off the merry-go-round
I was into politics
Obsessed with things I couldn't fix
Kissing bigger with a fist
Addicted to the thrill of it
And with these
Faking some kind of love
Feel new life rush into my blood
See the future when I look in the sky
When I look in the sky

There's no blue in the odyssey
Even in the calmest seas
Now it's all I wanna be
A semi-precious mystery
Doesn't mean I can't be true
Slip into the blue lagoons
I could be your muse
We don't know if we're gonna fight
We just came along for the ride
See the future when I look in your eyes
'Cause you've given me
Don't you worry about the future
'Cause this is the blue evolution
I don't think this love's an illusion
So let's wake up
Don't you worry about the future
'Cause this is the blue evolution
I finally see you're my greatest
You're my greatest revelation
We don't have to worry 'bout nothing
'Cause we got the fire
And we're burning one hell of a something
They
Light it up
When the lights started out
They don't know what they heard
Giving love to the world
We'll be raising our hands
Shinin' up to the sky

We'll be raising our hands
Shinin' up to the sky
When the lights started out
They don't know what they heard
Giving love to the world
Shouldn't need a riddle to unlock your heart
So  say what's on your mind
We got other things that we could do with our
Time  we could rule the world
Know you say you never need another girl
But  you're not making sense
Trying to keep it moving while you're on the fence
Tell me black and white
Why I'm here tonight
I can't read the signs
Stop talking in codes  stop talking in codes
Let me know what's up  can't do it no more
I need a love to celebrate
Stop talking in codes  stop talking in codes
Let me know what's up  can’t do it no more
So baby  take it all the way
Stop talking in codes
It's a mystery
I know that something happened in your history
Oh  it's too much to risk
You give me some  but you've been holding most of it
Back  so it's no surprise
Everything you do  I over analyze
Breathe  in and out
Baby  give me something new to think about

So baby  take it all the way
If I was not myself
And you were someone else
I'd say so much to you
And I would tell the truth
'Cause I can hardly breathe
When your hands let go of me
The ice is thinning out
And my feet brace themselves
I'm there in the water
Still looking for ya
I'm there in the water
Can't you see? Can't you see?
You've seen this all before
A life left on the shore
But smiling all the same
You sail away again
I'm there in the water
Still looking for ya

Show the bruises on your skin
Let the fires all burn out
I can hear the silent shout in you
Let it go don't be so scared
Find the love you lost again
Let the chaos disappear
Don't you know I'm always here for you?
You're the only one I see
Floating in your gravity
I'm the one who drives to you at night
And maybe we'll fall a little deeper
I think our little hearts will be alright
Cause this is devotion

Let the chaos disappear

I think our little hearts will be alright
I'm just a victim of the weapon in my hand
So many casualties of love
I was the one you took home
Never a flame to burn slow
But I was hoping you'd see me a different way
So many bodies I've touched
Crushing around me like dust
You are the realest thing I've never had to fake
I'm just so used to emptiness
Can't feel your heartbeat when I'm lying on your chest
You're different from the ones before

Take another sip
Stop checking your phone
Looking for the answers
Mind running obsessed
Feeling paralyzed
Let me watch you undress
Fall into the night
And we don't know who we are
So we just keep breaking hearts
Why you wanna ruin a good thing?
Can we take it back to the start?
When love's not playing out like the movies
It doesn't mean it's falling apart
Don't panic

Going to make you feel good

Can we take it back to the start?
When love's not playing out like the movies
It doesn't mean it's falling apart
Don't panic

I got big dreams baby

So don't you over complicate it
I got big dreams baby

If you never  if you never
Oh
If you never  if you never
Oh
If you never  if you never
Oh
If you never  if you never
Here it is  in my hands
In my veins and over lands
It spreads like fire seeking air
To pull me in my own funfair

If you never held me under
If you never hear my thunder
If you never  if you never
Oh

Oh

When you've given all you've got to each other
And then every time  it's harder to recover
We are only young  we are only young
It was never easy  lover
I just wanted you to hold  hold me closer
Yet you always seemed to go even further
We are only young  we are only young
And I've been walkin' in a straight line  fightin' this again
But every time I lеave  you pull me back in
Easy lover

Don't be cruel to me

Captions be about me but not at-ing me
Don't understand these type of things (What?)
I don't understand these type of games
And I know they say that
Everything that's easy ain't worth it
And everything that's worth it ain't gon' be easy
I made mistakes you can't say that I repeated
I wouldn't still be here if I didn't need you (Needed you)

(Easy  easy lover)
'Cause I know you've done it before
And I gave in
I lacked the things you need the most
You wasted all that sweetness to run and hide
I wonder why
I remind you of the days you poured your heart into
But you never tried
I've fallen from grace
Took a blow to my face
I've loved and I've lost
I've loved and I've lost
Explosions
On the day you wake up needing somebody
And you've learned
It will never be the same
You left my soul bleeding in the dark
The rules you set are still untold to me
And I've lost my faith in everything
You might also like
The nights you could cope
Your intentions were gold
But the mountains will shake
I need to know I can still make
Explosions
On the day you wake up needing somebody
And you've learned
And as the floods move in
And your body starts to sink
I was the last thing on your mind
I know you better than you think
I gave you a warning
Now everything you own
Is falling from the sky in pieces
So watch them fall with you
In slow motion
I pray that you'll find peace of mind
And I'll find you another time
I'll love you another time
Explosions
On the day you wake up needing somebody
And you've learned
Breathe your smoke into my lungs
In the back of the car with you
I stare into the sun
Still not too old to die young
But lovers hold on to everything
And lovers hold on to anything
I chase your love around a figure eight
I need you more than I can take
You promise forever and a day
And then you take it all away-way-way-way-way
And then you take it all away-way-way-way-way
Place a kiss on my cheekbone
Then you vanish me
I'm buried in the snow
But something tells me I'm not alone

And then you take it all away-way-way-way-way-way-way
When I think of you now  I just think of the day we met
Don't forget me  like I didn't care
Yeah  I stole from myself just to make you complete
(Flux  flux)
I don't think you have the patience
I don't think you know the difference
(Flux  flux)
And I don't want cute imitations
I know you wanted to save me
And I'm still in love with the idea of loving you
It's a state of flux  but it's not enough
And I'm still in love with the idea of loving you
It's a state of flux  I just keep holding on
Would you be taking me higher?
Would we be living as liars?
I wanna know  I wanna know
When the memories pack up and leave  it will set me free
All those days on the beach will be washing away from me
I will keep you secretly just to keep the peace
Keep steering this ship through the dark and the stormy seas

Swore upon the sun I'd save you for a rainy day
I keep calling your name (Keep calling your name)
So I keep calling at night (Keep calling at night)
Calling it off just to keep crawlin' to your arms
Calling it off just to keep crawlin' to your arms
I found the weakness and put it to play

Shake my head dizzy so I'll never know

I was just lonely
I was just in need of a friend
Spend your days
Thinking if only
Thinking if only you and me made sense
For any love
Quit the pain you feel
You won't let it go
You won't let it heal
You don't know me
You don't know me
And I don't have the heart that you think I do
You know I'm not the one
I can't show you my love that you showed to me
You know I'm not the one
Let it heal

You know I'm not the one

You lit the fire and you held it in your hands until it flickered out
You lit the fire and you held it in your hands until it flickered out

There's something in the way  love is never enough
I see your sorry hand putting down the gun
With a war in your mind that never wants to be won
I catch you in a light no one else can see
I know you see her  and you'll never see me
She makes you feel the most  keep your souls aligned
But what we had  it never really died
And this is what I'll say if I had any words
Wish we hadn't messed up  now your heart is with hers
And I know that your love wasn't here to stay
I gave you all of mine but you gave it away
And now you're the one who hurts
You had to love someone else just to know your worth

But here's to us

Part of you  bittersweet
But now you tell me lies
Up and down  cold and hot
Swear to God  got to stop
Because I can't sleep at night
If you wanted love like this
Blowing up with every kiss
Should've known better
Because you find yourself alone
Chilling you right to the bone
No  should've known better

Chilling you right to the bone

You like me in a mess 'cause I always come back to you
You cast me in your thriller just to cut the scene out
Sowing all the seeds  just to bring me a drought
You wanna wash me off  but you want me as your tattoo
'Cause I’ve been holding it down  holding it down
Waiting for the blood to rise
And you've been keeping me 'round  keeping me 'round

Waiting for another one you don't have to love

You were like home to me
I don't recognise this street
Please don't close your eyes
Don't know where to look without them
I'd never heard them until now
I know you care
I know it has always been there
You are just saving yourself when you hide it
I see it in the way that you stare
As if there was trouble ahead and you knew it
I'll be saving myself from the ruin

To the door when I thought you were there
Too shaped to the comfort of us

Running from the truth because the truth's too much to take
I keep raising glasses cause I only got today
Baby I keep
I just keep on dancing

You can come ride shotgun with me
Every time I look at those stars
Know they ain't got the answers for me
Baby I keep
I just keep on dancing
I just keep on dancing
Losing it all on my own
I had a heart then
But the queen has been overthrown
And I'm not sleeping now
The dark is too hard to beat
And I'm not keeping now
The strength I need to push me
You shine it when I'm alone
And so I tell myself that I'll be strong
And dreaming when they're gone
You shine it when I'm alone (Home)
Noises
I play within my head
Touch my own skin
And hope that I'm still breathin'

My brother and my sister slept
In an unlocked place
The only time I feel safe

Near the countryside but I just forgot

And I walked a thousand miles to prove it
And I'm caught in the crossfire of my own thoughts
The colour of my blood is all I see on the rocks as you sail from me
Alarms will ring for eternity
The waves will break every chain on me
So help my lifeless frame to breathe
And God knows it's the only way to heal now
With all the blood I lost with you
It drowns the love I thought I knew
The lost dreams are buried in my sleep for him
And this was the ecstasy of a love forgotten
And I'm thrown in the gunfire of empty bullets
And my blood is all I see as you steal my soul from me
Alarms will ring for eternity
The waves will break every chain on me

Oh  oh  oh
All this time  I felt completed
All this time  I felt I needed you by my side
Even if we'd fight and fight again
The nights with you were so disarming
Taking all my weapons from me
I found myself powerless with you
I tried to be just like those other girls
Accepting situations  stopped the search
For something brighter  got to stay excited
Your love will always be my validation
Float in permanent vacation
I'd close my eyes to shut out the sky
Reaching these new heights
Love without someone else feels right
Love for myself in this new light
There's something much deeper inside
Something died the day I fell for you
Pourin' vodka in my apple juice
I smoked the night away
You were my escape
To what I thought was everything
Find someone to lose myself with
But I'm not buying it
And you're not either
Everything is beautiful
Maybe 'cause we're doomed  we're whole

Not asking any questions

Heart still thumps as I bleed
And all your friends come sniffing
Triangles are my favourite shape
Three points where two lines meet
My love  it's very late
Till morning comes
Let's tessellate
Go alone  my flower
And keep my whole lovely you
Wild green stones alone  my lover
And keep us on my heart
Three guns and one goes off
One's empty  one's not quick enough
Search the graves while the camera spins
Chunks of you will sink down to seals
Blubber rich in mourning
But it's fair to say you will still haunt me
Triangles are my favourite shape
Three points where two lines meet
My love  it's too late
Till morning comes
Wild green stones alone  my lover

Look out on a summer's day
With eyes that know the darkness in my soul
Shadows on the hills
Sketch the trees and the daffodils
Catch the breeze and the winter chills
In colors on the snowy linen land
Now I understand
What you tried to say to me
And how you suffered for your sanity
How you tried to set them free
They would not listen  they did not know how
Perhaps they'll listen now
Starry  starry night
Flaming flowers that brightly blaze
Swirling clouds in a violet haze
Reflect in Vincent's eyes of china blue
Colors changing hue
Morning fields of amber grain
Weathered faces lined in pain
Are soothed beneath the artist's loving hand

Now I understand
What you tried to say to me
And how you suffered for your sanity
And how you tried to set them free
They would not listen  they did not know how
Perhaps they'll listen now
For they could not love you
But still your love was true
And when no hope was left in sight
On that starry  starry night
You took your life  as lovers often do
But I could've told you  Vincent
This world was never meant for one as beautiful as you
Starry  starry night
Portraits hung in empty halls
Frameless heads on nameless walls
With eyes that watch the world and can't forget
Like the strangers that you've met
The ragged men in their ragged clothes
The silver thorn of bloody rose
Lie crushed and broken on the virgin snow
Now I think I know
What you tried to say to me
And how you suffered for your sanity
And how you tried to set them free
They would not listen  they're not listening still
I think I know what you're trying to say
Honey  it's fair play
Why try to win when I know I've lost?
We don't have to spell it
I think I know what you're trying to say
Just because I think this could break me
It doesn't mean that it will at all
Love to the lovers
Hate to the haters
Love to you  babe
Do what you have to
What a shame
What a loss
The winner takes
She takes it all
What a shame
What a loss
But I can see why
Because she's beautiful
What a defeat
To say the least
But thank God
The love is free
And maybe it's good for you
It's good for me

Let's call it a day  babe
I think I know what you're trying to say
And honey you're so right
There's so much to lose  but so much to learn
Let's call it a maybe
But we both know you're already gone
And just because it feels like I'm breaking
It doesn't mean I will fall apart
Love to the lovers
Hate to the haters
Love to you  babe
Do what you have to
What a shame
What a loss
The winner takes
She takes it all
What a shame
What a loss
But I can see why
Because she's beautiful
What a defeat
To say the least
But thank God
The love is free
And maybe it's good for you
It's good for me
Love to you  babe
Love to the lovers
Hate to the haters
Love to you  babe
Do what you have to
What a shame
What a loss
The winner takes
She takes it all
What a shame
What a loss
But I can see why
Because she's beautiful
What a defeat
To say the least
But thank God
The love is free
And maybe it's good for you
I'm not one of those who can easily hide
I'd buy a big house where we both could live
So excuse me forgetting  but these things I do
See  I've forgotten if they're green or they're blue
Yours are the sweetest eyes I've ever seen
And you can tell everybody
This is your song
It may be quite simple  but
Now that it's done
I hope you don't mind  I hope you don't mind
That I put down in words
How wonderful life is
Now you're in the world
Or a girl who makes potions in a travelling show
I know it's not much  but it's the best I can do
My gift is my song and this one's for you
You might also like
Ah  ah
Ah  ah
Oh  oh
Oh  oh
And you can tell everybody
This is your song
It may be quite simple  but
Now that it's done
I hope you don't mind  I hope you don't mind
That I put down in words
How wonderful life is"
