"You got me spinnin' 'round and 'round
'Round and 'round and 'round it goes
Where it stops nobody knows
Every time you call my name
I heat up like a burnin' flame
Burnin' flame full of desire
Abra-abra-cadabra
I wanna reach out and grab ya
Abra-abra-cadabra
Abracadabra
You make me hot  you make me sigh
You make me laugh  you make me cry
Keep me burnin' for your love
With the touch of a velvet glove
Abra-abra-cadabra
I wanna reach out and grab ya
Abra-abra-cadabra
Abracadabra

I feel the magic in your caress
I feel magic when I touch your dress
Silk and satin  leather and lace
Black panties with an angel's face
I can see magic in your eyes
I hear the magic in your sighs
Just when I think I'm gonna get away
I hear those words that you always say
Abra-abra-cadabra
I wanna reach out and grab ya
Abra-abra-cadabra
Abracadabra
Every time you call my name
I heat up like a burnin' flame
Burnin' flame full of desire
I heat up  I can't cool down
My situation goes 'round and 'round
I heat up  I can't cool down
My situation goes 'round and 'round
I heat up  I can't cool down
My situation goes 'round and 'round
I heat up (I heat up)  I can't cool down (I can't cool down)
My situation goes 'round and 'round ('Round and 'round)

We are children of the future
Wonder what in this world we are going to do  going to do
When they get high
They can see for miles and miles
When I get high
I can see myself for miles
You know I've got somethin' that you can use
It takes a little bit of lovin'
A little bit of huggin'
A little bit of lovin'
A little bit of huggin'

He's still alive
My grandma  she's 92
She loves to dance
And sing some  too
I don't know
But I've been told
If you keep on dancing
You'll never grow old
Come on  darling
Put a pretty dress on
We're gonna go out tonight
All night long
I'm a hard-working man
I'm a son of a gun
I've been working all week in the noon day sun
The wood's in the kitchen
And the cow's in the barn

Take my hand  come along
Let's go out and have some fun

Billy Kid and all the rest
Supposed to be some bad cats
Way out in the West
If those cats could have dug me
And my gangster ways
They would have hung up their guns
And dug into their graves
'Cause I'm a gangster
A gangster of love
I'm a gangster
A gangster of love
Now look here
When I go into a bar
Girls from near and far
Say I'm a gangster
A gangster of love
I jumped in my white horse Cadillac
I rode across the border line
I roped 55 girls
I kissed them all at the same time
There was a million dollar reward for me in each and every state
I can't help it
I'm a gangster
I can't help it
Don't be too slow
A long time ago
Left you flat
And split for Mexico
Don't try to stop me
You are a thing in my past
You're much too slow
I'm goin' to Mexico
I've got four or five hundred miles to go
Down that southbound highway
'53 Studebaker goin' for broke
I'm pushin' it night and day
I've had enough of your lies
You're like a nursery rhyme
You're much too slow
I'm goin' to Mexico

About the world
We got to build it up
Stop tearing it down
We got to build it up
Knowing how it's been
Living for today
I swear I do know how
To go back is pointless
Understand this now
It all seems to drift away
That I'm living for today
And if it's not getting you
Wherever you need to go
There's still a place in my heart
If you did not know this is so
In my first mind
You are so fine
All the good things you do
Are in my own time
In my second mind
I can see you grow
Feel you flow
Doesn't really help when I read Time magazine
Cause they only distort the scene
The sky is so hazy I can't even see the sun
Livin' here is like livin' under a gun
I really do wonder 'bout the United Nations
Why don't they face the situations
I'm a troubadour
Lookin' for a dream
I'm a troubadour
Lookin' for some dream
From Sunday to Sunday all I hear is bad news
Tired of the war and those industrial fools
Got to make it better cause I've got nothin' to lose
Ain't too clear to pay my income taxes
'Specially when I know it goes to kill the masses
Love to hear the President make it perfectly clear
How the donkeys and the elephants are police up here
I'm a troubadour
Lookin for a dream
I'm a troubadour
Lookin for some dream
From Sunday to Sunday all I hear is bad news
Tired of the war and those industrial fools
I've got to make it better cause I've got nothin' lose
Won't somebody help me cause I've gotten in my shoes
Headed for Ohio when I read the news
'Bout the people demonstrating against the President's views
Four were shot down by the National Guard troops
School shot down 'cause there's no more to lose
Now we're headed to D.C. two by twos
Lookin' for my Congressman to make it all well known
But the politicians already won't answer his telephone
Making in his office while they're shooting kids down at home
Worried about the voters but he won't be worried long
Silent majority still glued to the tube
Shot some more in Jackson just to show the world what they can do
While we're marching to D.C. 'cause there's too much to do
Give peace a chance
Always give peace a chance
There's no turnin' back
There's no turnin' back
There's no turnin' back
When the President said that the tear gas is gone
The army's pulled out leavin' blood on the ground
The streets are empty and the crying's died down
You can be President if no one's around
Space Cowboy's back to tell you the score
Nothing any good is gonna come from a war
Give peace a chance
Give peace a chance
Give peace a chance
I've been down before
Ridin' along on this big ol' jet plane
I've been thinkin' about my home
But my love light seems so far away
And I feel like it's all been done
Somebody's tryin' to make me stay
You know I've got to be movin' on
Don't carry me too far away
'Cause it's here that I've got to stay
Goodbye to all my friends at home
Goodbye to people I've trusted
I've got to go out and make my way
But my heart keeps calling me backwards
As I get on the 707
Ridin' high  I got tears in my eyes
You know you got to go through hell
Before you get to heaven

You thought you had known me before

Jungle love in the surf in the pouring rain
Everything's better when wet
It's making me crazy
It's making me crazy
I never see you alone
But we need some definite answers
So I thought I would write you a poem

Together they'd go for a ride
As they travelled with a heavy load
They came across a dead horse
At the side of the road
With two generals standing at each end
Fighting over whose fault it had been
And all that's left was this war
And they couldn't get things back together
Like they were before

I mean the kind of a girl that make a fool of you
She make a young man old and an old man pay
The way she took my money was a crying shame
She took the keys to my Cadillac car
Jumped in my caddy and she drove afar
Put a detective on her trail
The post office thought they'd chase her by the mail
She got picked up and then was put in jail
Stroked the judge just to go home bail
She left Detroit to go to Kalamazoo
Made her a fortune out of fools like you
Met her a rich man who was married and had some kids
Stroked that cat until he flipped his lid

Still can see your pretty hair
When I come back will you be there
You flew away like a kite
I hope you find your light
I pray they treat you right
What a sacrifice
Miles and miles I have roamed
Looking for that home sweet home
Thought I had the love with you
But I found out that you weren't true
You made me feel so nice
Ready for wedding rice
Then you said no dice
What a sacrifice
Looking back on time that's gone
I realized I might have been wrong
But Macon took you for a ride
They broke us up for their own pride
But you were young and didn't understand
That you had found your lifetime man
Maybe someday you'll see
It gets so lonely being free
So don't be wrong twice
Of the seasons I will sing
To help you through your birth
As you spend your time on Earth
In the wind
The summer song won't last long
When this warm old man has gone
I'll sing your of your birth
As you spend your time on Earth
In the wind
And so it goes  as the wind blows
The seasons will flow
To help you through your birth
As you spend your time on Earth
In the wind
A mother's child  a father's son
In this crowd  I'm only one
To tell you of your worth
As you spend your time on Earth
In the wind

A serenade from the stars
Wake up and look around you
We're lost in space
And the time is our own

Don't you know that I'm a gangster of love?
Let me tell you people that I found a new way
And I'm tired of all this talk about love
And the same old story with a new set of words
About the good and the bad and the poor
Of every bat cat who walks through my door
I'm a space cowboy
Bet you weren't ready for that
I'm a space cowboy
I'm sure you know where it's at
I was born on this rock
And I've been travelin' through space
Since the moment I first realized
What all you fast-talkin' cats would do if you could
You know I'm ready for the final surprise
That's gonna satisfy my soul deep inside
All the prayers and surveyors
Keep the whole place uptight
While it keeps on gettin' darker outside

A-lookie here (Hey)
I was walking down the main track one night
She stopped when I flashed my roll
I told her she could have all of my gold
She turned around and with a frown
Your cash ain't nothing but trash
Your cash ain't nothing but trash
Your cash ain't nothing but trash
And there ain't no need in your hanging around
I tried to get a Cadillac right quick
Had nine hundred bucks and some change

I was walking into town in my white bucks
He got me and took all of my dough
I heard him shout as he cut out
Your cash ain't nothing but trash
Your cash ain't nothing but trash
Your cash ain't nothing but trash
And he took my watch and I passed out
I woke up in the arms of a big cop
A twenty dollar fine cause you're drunk
Dig up the dough and you can go
All I had was a buffalo
Your cash ain't nothing but trash
Your cash ain't nothing but trash
Your cash ain't nothing but trash
As I sail from season's four
To join some crazy ladies
In a game upon the shore
None of them with broken wings
But still refuse to fly
So with sweetness on my lips
I smile a last goodbye
Goodbye
And now I spend my life
On the velvet side of hell
Aimlessly here searching
The quietness is terrible
It's more than I can stand
But thousands now stand cheering
As my blood flows in the sand
In the sand
(Child)
You're not the child you thought you were
You wake up in the night and know you're blind
And yet they keep on pushing
Trying the insides of your mind
Until the emptiness of heaven welcomes your weary soul

You got to need a little lovin'
