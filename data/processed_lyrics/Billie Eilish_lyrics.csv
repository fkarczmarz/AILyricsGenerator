lyrics
"Your eyes are shut
I won't get to tell you what
I needed you to know
It's dark enough
The moonlight doesn't show
And all my love
Could never bring you home
There's no more stars to find
And I'm too far behind
And I'd love to let you go
I'd love to let you go
You're all that's on my mind
I called a thousand times
And I have to let you go
But I love you more and more than you could know
I sat alone
Awaited your reply
Was driven home
When I started to cry
I should've known
I should've said goodbye
I only hoped
I would've had more time

There's no more stars to find
And I'm too far behind
And I'd love to let you go
I'd love to let you go
You're always on my mind
When I called a thousand times
And I have to let you go
But I love you more and more than you could know-oh
Oh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh
We're both too young
To live and die this way
A sunny summer day
With so much left to say
Not 21
The 18th hell to pay
The day you couldn't stay
You made me wanna pray
But I think God's fake
There's no more stars to find
And I'm too far behind
And I'd love to let you go
I'd love to let you go
You're all that's on my mind
When I called a thousand times
And I have to let you go
But I love you more and more and more and more and more
You will never know
I know you don't care
But can you listen?
I came committed  guess I overdid it
Wore my heart out on a chain
Da-da-da-da-da-da (Hmm)
So I think I better go
I never really know how to please you
You're lookin' at me like I'm see-through
I guess I'm gonna go
I just never know how you feel
Do you even feel anything?
Da-da-da-da-da-da-da

You said  Don't treat me badly
But you said it so sadly
So I did the best I could
Not thinkin' you would have left me gladly

Why should you be?

When your love never is for me?
Me

Love when it comes without a warning
'Cause waiting for it gets so boring
A lot can change in twenty seconds
A lot can happen in the dark
Love when it makes you lose your bearings
Some information's not for sharing
Use different names at hotel check-ins
It's hard to stop it once it starts (It starts)
I'm not sentimental
But there's somethin' 'bout the way you look tonight  mm
Makes me wanna take a picture
Make a movie with you that we'd have to hide
You better lock your phone (Oh)
And look at me whеn you're alone
Won't take a lot to gеt you goin' (Oh)
I'm sorry if it's torture though

And I think that we're in between everything I've seen
Keep it briеf
I'll wait in the suite
You seem so paranoid
I'm looking at thе boys
I've never filled the void
Out of spite
You seem so paralyzed
It's so romanticized
If this is how I die
That's alright
I've been overseas
And I think that we're in between everything I've seen
Keep it brief
I'll see you in the suite
We can be discreet
But I've been overseas

(And I know it seems like something even bitter)

Birds of a feather  now I'm ashamed

You were born bluer than a butterfly
Beautiful and so deprived of oxygen
Colder than your father's eyes
He never learned to sympathize with anyone
I don't blame you
But I can't change you
Don't hate you (Don't hate you)
But we can't save you (But we can't save you)
You were born reachin' for your mother's hands
Victim of your father's plans to rule the world
Too afraid to step outside
Paranoid and petrified of what you've heard
But they could say the same 'bout me
I sleep 'bout three hours each night
Means only twenty-one a week now  now
And I could say the same 'bout you
Born blameless  grew up famous too
Just a baby born blue now  now
I don't blame you
But I can't change you
Don't hate you
But we can't save you

I'm happier than ever
Wish I could explain it better
I wish it wasn't true
Give me a day or two to think of something clever

Do you read my interviews?
Or do you skip my avenue?
When you said you were passin' through
Was I even on your way?
I knew when I asked you to (When I asked you to)
Be cool about what I was tellin' you
You'd do the opposite of what you said you'd do (What you said you'd do)
And I'd end up more afraid
Don't say it isn't fair

Drivin' home under the influence
'Cause you only listen to your fuckin' friends
I don't relate to you

And I don't talk shit about you on the internet
Never told anyone anything bad
And all that you did was make me fuckin' sad
So don't waste the time I don't have
And don't try to make me feel bad
I could talk about every time that you showed up on time
But I'd have an empty line 'cause you never did
Shut 'em all out for you 'cause I was a kid
You ruined everything good
Always said you were misunderstood
Made all my moments your own

Tastes like she might be the one
And I could never get enough

Said  I bought you somethin' rare
And I left it under 'Claire'
So now  she's comin' up the stairs
So I'm pullin' up a chair
And I'm puttin' up my hair
Baby  I think you were made for me
Somebody write down the recipe
Been tryin' hard not to overeat

You were scared
And so was I
In a standstill on the 5
Thought it was unusually early traffic
Usually  I don't panic
I just wanted to be on time

I didn't even think of pullin' over

I wish this moment would stay with the Earth
Some primal paradise
But there you go again  saying everything ends
Saying you can't depend on anything  or anyone
If the end of the world was near
Where would you choose to be?
If there was five more minutes of air
Would you panic and hide
Or run for your life
Or stand here and spend it with me
If we had five more minutes
And we would live again
In the simplest of ways
Living day after day
Like some primal animals
We would love again
Under glorious suns
With the freedom that comes with the truth  mmm

Armageddon

It's not what he's made for

Think I forgot how to be happy
Somethin' I'm not  but somethin' I can be
Somethin' I wait for
Somethin' I'm made for
And time breaks your heart
She was your girl
You showed her the world
But fell out of love and you both let go
She was cryin’ on my shoulder
All I could do was hold her
Only made us closer until July
Now I know that you love me
You don't need to remind me
But I see her in the back of my mind all the time
Did I cross the line?
(Mm) Hmm
And life moves so fast
I'd never ask who was better
'Cause she couldn't be
More different from me
Happy and free in leather

Creepin' around like no one knows

Bruises on both my knees for you
Don't say thank you or please
I do what I want when I'm wanting to
My soul? So cynical
So you're a tough guy
Like it really rough guy
Just can't get enough guy
Chest always so puffed guy

Make your girlfriend mad tight
Might seduce your dad type
