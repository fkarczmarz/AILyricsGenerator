lyrics
"Ain't no good life
Not the one that I lead
It only seems the more that I grieve
As some lost part of me
I want to know
Just because I'm alive
That don't mean I'm making a living
I'm gonna get myself together
I'm gonna try a dying attempt
Talking 'bout the good times slipping by
I don't even know where last month went
And I know where it went
I said it went on that damn rent
I need folding money
Said I don't need a buddy

Ain't exactly my idea
Just don't let nobody tell you
There ain't no place I ain't never gone
But its kind of like the saying that you heard so many times
Well there just ain't no place like home
Did you ever see a she-gator protect her young
Or a fish in a river swimming free
Did you ever see the beauty of the hills of Carolina
Or the sweetness of the grass in Tennessee
And Lord I can't make any changes
All I can do is write 'em in a song
I can see the concrete slowly creeping
Lord take me and mine before that comes
Do you like to see a mountain stream a-flowing
Do you like to see a youngun with his dog
Well you better listen to my song
And Lord I can't make any changes
All I can do is write 'em in a song
I can see the concrete slowly creeping
Lord take me and mine before that comes

I'm not trying to put down no big cities
But the things they write about us is just a bore
Well you can take a boy out of ol' Dixieland
But you'll never take ol' Dixie from a boy
And Lord I can't make any changes
All I can do is write 'em in a song
I can see the concrete slowly creeping
Lord take me and mine before that comes
Because I can see the concrete slowly creeping
 Lord  I always had a good time
 I can't go back again
 won't you tell me how I've sinned?
 Lord  you just can't tell
 let me tell you why
 won't you tell me how I've sinned?
 they'll blame you
 my friend  that has really changed
 such a shame
 Lord  I don't understand
 Lord  it can sure hurt a man
 Lord  is the most important thing
 won't you tell me how I've sinned?
I keep blowin' down the road
Well now they call me the breeze
I keep blowin' down the road
I ain't got me nobody
I don't carry me no load
Ain't no change in the weather
Ain't no changes in me
Well there ain't no change in the weather
Ain't no changes in me
And I ain't hidin' from nobody
Nobody's hidin' from me

She'll leave your heart so lonely

Well I can't stand the pain no more
She don't want my love for sure
She don't want poor me
Knocking on her front door
Why did you make me love you sister
When you knew you was untrue
You loved every man with pants on
Yes a dozen for you is too few
Well I'm gon' get my pistol girl
I'm gonna shoot you and end your world
Then you won't bother poor me
Won't bother poor me no longer
Cheating woman - gonna shoot you
Oh woman why you do me
Oh Lord the way you do
I done everything I can baby
Seem like nothing reaches you
Well I'm gonna get that pistol gal
I'm gonna shoot you and all your pals
Another day might be too long for me
Traveling around I've had my fill
Of broken dreams and dirty deals
A concrete jungle surrounding me
Many nights I've slept out in the streets
I paid my dues and I changed my style
Seen hard times all over now
I wanna come home
It's been so long since I've been away
I'll be coming home soon to your love to stay
I miss old friends that I once had
I don't know why the thought came to me
And now

Never met a man who's stranger
He lives his life for a dollar sign
And to deal with him is dangerous
Well  he knocked me down but I'm on my feet
Now I'm so much wiser
I'd rather quit and go back home
Than to deal with the money miser
Let's cry for this bad man
I sing a song for the bad man
Well  you treat me right baby  I'll treat you right
That's the way it's supposed to be
I put my faith down in my friend
And he almost put an end to me

Eight when I am able

Do some down south juking  looking for peace of mind
Now put your Sunday pants on  lets get out on the road
We've been workin' all week and I think it's time we let go (Woah)
We got three fine mamas sitting all alone
Gonna sip our wine  gonna get it on
And do some down south juking  looking for a peace of mind
Now come Monday morning  we'll be headed out to the the field
We'll be doing our thing for Papa and old Uncle Bill
Well  come Friday night  we'll be headed to town
Trying to pick up any woman hanging around
Sometimes I wonder  is this the end of the line
No one should take advantage  of who they are
No man has got it made
If he thinks he does  he's wrong
Every mother's son  better hear what I say
Every mother's son  will rise and fall someday
I've seen it happen so many times  so many times before
Some man's got so much money  he doesn't worry no more
Or he's got such a pretty woman  that'll treat him fine
Well my friend has been a fool
It happens everytime
Every mother's son  better hear what I say
Every mother's son  will rise and fall someday
I'm not trying to preach to no one  to no one at all

Floyd never hurt no one in his life

Doing three to five hard labor  for armed robbery
I had two years behind  but I could not wait the time
Every time I thought about it  well I died some more inside
And I had stripes on my back  memories that hurt
For the only time I seen sunshine is when I hit the dirt
Digging ditches for the chain gang  sleeping in the cold
Oh Lord please forgive me for I could not wait no more
And I coming home to see you Jesus
Well it feels so close this time
Please take mercy on this soldier
From the Florida-Georgia line
When they find me they must kill me
Oh Jesus save my soul
I can't go back down to Raiford
I can't take that anymore
Well these last few years behind me
Oh Lord  have been so sad
I fought proudly for my country when the times were bad
Now they say I'm guilty  when they find me I must die
Only me and Jesus know that I never stole a dime
Well when Vietnam was over there was no work here for me
I had a pretty wife awaiting and two kids I had to feed
Well I'm one of America's heroes and when they shoot me down
Won't fly old Glory proudly  put my medals in the ground
Would you still remember me?

With a girl named Linda Lou
When in walked a man with a gun in his hand
And he was looking for you-know-who
What you trying to prove?
'Cause that's my woman there and I'm a man who cares
And this might be all for you
I was scared and fearing for my life
I was shaking like a leaf on a tree
Don't want no trouble with you
And I know you don't owe me but I wish you would let me
Ask one favor from you
Gimme three steps towards the door?
And you'll never see-a me no more
For sure

As I was headed out towards the door
Gimme three steps towards the door?
And you'll never see-a me no more
Liked his plans  but they came undone when he got around to God and guns
I don't know how he grew up
But it sure wasn't down at the hunting club
'Cause if it was  he'd understand a little bit more about the working man
God and guns
Keep us strong
That's what this country
Was founded on
Well  we might as well give up and run
If we let 'em take our God and guns
Out here in my neck of the woods
Where God is great and guns are good
You really can't know that much about 'em
If you think we're better off without 'em

Lord  there's so much that's been stolen
I guess I've lost everything I've had
But I'm not dead  at least not yet
Never captured  never tamed
Wild horses on the plains
You can call me lost  I call it freedom
I feel the spirit in my soul
I'm never giving up while I'm still breathing

Before the rooster crowed
Searchin' for soda bottles
To get myself some dough
Brought 'em down to the corner
Down to the country store
Cash 'em in and give my money
To a man named Curtis Loew
Old Curt was a black man
When he had a fifth of wine
He did not have a care
He used to own an old dobro
Used to play it 'cross his knee
I'd give old Curt my money
He'd play all day for me
Play me a song
Well I got your drinkin' money
Tune up your dobro
People said he was useless
Them people all were fools
'Cause Curtis Loew was the finest picker
To ever play the blues

He looked to be sixty
And maybe I was ten
Mama used to whoop me
But I'd go see him again
Try to stay in time
He'd play me a song or two
Then take another drink of wine
Play me a song
Well I got your drinkin' money
Tune up your dobro
People said he was useless
Them people all were fools
'Cause Curtis Loew was the finest picker
To ever play the blues
On the day old Curtis died
Nobody came to pray
Ol' preacher said some words
And they chucked him in the clay
Well he lived a lifetime
Playin' the black man's blues
And on the day he lost his life
That's all he had to lose
Play me a song
I wish that you was here
So everyone would know
People said he was useless
Them people all are fools
'Cause Curtis you're the finest picker
As a soldier climbs in the saddle for one last ride
As the rain pours off his hat
You can see the shadows of the past written in his eyes
Now the cannons are silent
If he ever wants to find his way home
He's the last rebel on the road
Just a boy with his old guitar
Can't change him
No use in staying where you don't belong
Now he's rolling down the highway
No one will ever find him
He'll never look back
'Cause he's the last rebel
And he's all alone
He's the last rebel
His friends are all gone
He's the last rebel
The last rebel on the road
