"Does it enter your mind?
Have I already blown it?
Somehow in my head  it's overgrown
It's made me question everything I know
Did what you say contain an undertone?
It goes on and on and on
It keeps turning up  it won't leave me
Our time together become too short
Did I say enough? Speak freely
Did my words destroy?
Or was it just an afterthought?
Was it just an afterthought?
Was it just an afterthought?
Was it just an afterthought?
Oh  was it just an afterthought?
Was it just an afterthought?
Was it just an afterthought?
Was it just an afterthought?
When you're so hard to read
I wonder what you're hiding
Lying under the leaves
I'm not someone you confide in

Is this how you survive?

Make the memory the reason
Remembering the time when you and I fell behind
But found a way to justify
We cannot replay
The aesthetic or feel
We had our brighter day
Was it synthetic or real?
I'll protect the memory
If baby you can’t recall it
You can’t recall that
22nd January
If baby you can’t recall it
I won’t forget that
Was it just as real as you expected?
Does looking back give you a chill?

That amnesia gave you freedom
Or maybe you’re the kind who tells a lie just to lie
And never have to say goodbye

I'm not looking for the words to say
What you've already heard a hundred times
I'm disregarding the rules
Whether you know or not
I ain't strong
And it's something in you that I'm dependent on
Worth a shot
Even though I've lost the plot
I know it's wrong
But it's something in you that I'm dependent on
Not going out tonight
Stay home until daylight
I'm hanging on for my life
I know myself far too well
Set myself up to fail
Is that what the future entails?
You give nothing to me
Still why do you feel like someone I need
I've been thinkin' 'bout us
And I've given enough
With you here by my side
It seems like I can't do anything right
I've been thinkin' 'bout us
And I've given enough

Time for me to make a change
With what you've shown
Maybe you're just another stepping stone
Lost my name
Trying to put out this flame

My hope is  descending like the sun
Try to tell myself there's freedom in the loneliness (Oh baby)
Always restless  story of my life
Disconnected  body clock's not right
Try to tell myself that I'mma get some sleep tonight
Found myself where I started  this isn't where I want to be
The time that I find hardest  always comes eventually
My shadow doesn't show in the dark
The night time is inclined to my heart
The emptiness I felt from the start
Will follow me 'till I fall apart
My demons are blocking out the light
And my mind is about to lose the fight
Why can't I find peace  when a caracal could sleep tonight? (Yeah)
Your absence isn't something that I choose (choose  choose choose)
Spending half my life just tryna get away from you (Oh baby  oh)

I was blinded  I'd not envisioned
The same face in a different frame
It's an omen  caught my baby crying
Saw the silver lining
It must be an omen
Needed you to show me  without you I am lonely
My mind would rule my heart
I didn't pay attention to the light in the dark
It left me torn apart
But now I see your tears as an omen
