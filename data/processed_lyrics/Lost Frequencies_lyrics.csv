" but the clock is ticking
 closer
 closer
 you don't get to choose again
 closer
 you don't get to choose again
 you don't get to choose again
 you don't get to choose again
Not if we all hold each other as we roam
And if we all stand together  we can't fall
Not if we all hold each other as we roam
(Oh) One by one  one by one
All together  all together
(Oh) One by one  one by one
All together  all together
What if all this world is in a dream
And real is just behind the door?
So if everything is energy
Does not matter what you take from me
Well  I know you need it more
So I give it up (So I give it up)
And it raises us (And it raises us)
One by one (One by one)
And if we all stand together  we can't fall
Not if we all hold each other as we roam
And if we all stand together  we can't fall
Not if we all hold each other as we roam

(Oh) One by one  one by one
All together (All together)  all together
(Oh) One by one  one by one
All together (All together)  all together
What if all this is a memory?
What if we've been here before?
Understanding gives us empathy
Like a voyage to the shore
After everything you've given me
I'm not hurting anymore
So I give it up (So I give it up)
And it raises us (And it raises us)
One by one
And if we all stand together  we can't fall
Not if we all hold each other as we roam
And if we all stand together  we can't fall

El cariño que te tengo
No te lo puedo negar
Se me sale la babita
Yo no lo puedo evitar
Cuando Juanica y Chan Chan
En el mar cernían arena
Como sacudía el jibe
A Chan Chan le daba pena
Limpia el camino de pajas
Que yo me quiero sentar
En aquél tronco que veo
Y así no puedo llegar

Carrying his worldly treasures in his empty hands

We could laugh until we cry
Just come with me
Looking back when we get old
The greatest story ever told
We could move in time to our beatin' hearts
We could chase the highs and chase the stars
We could lose ourselves in memories
Leave it all behind and dance with me

Greater than God
Should reevaluate our thoughts

If I'm still on your mind
I'm running the streets so wild
And I'm sick of the silence
I wonder where you are tonight
If I'm still on your mind
I'm running the streets so wild
And I'm sick of the silence (Breaking with it)
Breaking with it

 we can’t go wrong
 I wanna seize the day
 we can’t go wrong
 I wanna seize the day
For nights and days
Going silent they say
I'm running
It's like your voice I hear
Wind in my face
Keeps drying my tears
I am climbing mountains high
No clouds in sight
Say my morning prayers
Please love me again
My heart is aching
St. Peter shaking his head
St. Peter shaking his head
I can't see clear
The memory of you keeps blurring my view
The mountains hide
They're playing tricks on my mind
You're not here by my side
And I keep trying to forget
The racing youthful mind leaves nothing behind

Now I found myself
On my knees and then
I'm begging plead
Forgive my sins amen
I can't bear it anymore
Hanging for plans
Let me go
But St. Peter shaking his head
St. Peter shaking his head
Glory  Glory - Hallelujah
I'm alive and I'm feeling  feeling fine
How many more days can you hold out
How much longer can you wait? she asked
There was a time I thought I  I could answer
But my tongue gets tied as my thoughts drift away
Glory  Glory - Hallelujah
The sun is shining  shining down
Glory  Glory - Hallelujah
I'm alive and I'm feeling  feeling fine
And I'm feeling  feeling fine
How many more days
I'm alive and I'm feeling  feeling fine

I'm drowning  God can you hear me up above?
Like an old ghost you'll never go
Like an old ghost you're staying close
But I can feel that down low
I fight for hope
But I can feel it that down low
I fight to let go
Oh I need your love
And I know that you're missing mine
Oh I need your love
And I know that you're missing mine
Sweet dreams  I keep on crawling back to you
And I feel  I'll never make it without you
And I never thought that I would be safe and sound
Oh darling your words have kept me underground
Oh I need your love
And I know that you're missing mine
Oh I need your love
And I know that you're missing mine

Where lovers fight like children play
There's a shadow in your house
The words are running 'round your head
Over things you never meant to say
And things you wish you would have said
You can make a deal with the devil or a deal with the Lord
Just two notes ringing on the same passing chord
Say that I'm wrong or just let me be
Never lie to me
