lyrics
"Trouble times destroyed my smile
No change of heart  no change of mind
You can take what's yours but you gon' leave what's mine
I'd rather die than go home
I'd rather die than go home
And I ain't leaving without my forty acres
Unpolished  unapologetic
This cocaine cowboy pushed it to the limit
You thought Tony in that cell would've made us timid
Anything Spanish  got me speaking Spanglish
Money's universal  that's the only language
The dream ain't die  only some real niggas
We was born to mothers who couldn't deal with us
Left by fathers who wouldn't build with us
My better half chose the better path  applaud him
Younger brother me a spoiled child  I fought him
I heard that the Devil's new playground is boredom
The California top just falls back like autumn
And they say I'm on the verge of winnin'
I claim victory when Malice on the verge of sinnin'
Old habits die hard  that rainy day bag buried in the backyard
It's heaven for a hustler  no graveyards
'Cause stand-up niggas don't lie on no floors
Much rather burn us  ashes to ashes
Mix us with the powder  sell us to the masses
We gon' keep it tight  rip it off the plastic
Push

Trouble world  trouble child
Trouble times destroyed my smile
No change of heart  no change of mind
You can take what's yours but you gon' leave what's mine
I'd rather die than go home
I'd rather die than go home
And I ain't leaving without my forty acres
Unpolished  unapologetic
Might have broke a heart or two but gave an honest effort
My nonchalant attitude is always F it
Thirty-five years of marriage and my mama left it
You shouldn't question if you ever stood a chance with him
The better question is  did you enjoy the dance with him?
You know this money grew your hair out  switch
All that shit I bought you wear out
Rich  and I'm the only one I care about
Place none above me  God don't like ugly
Hate me or love me  only He can judge me
Unpolished  unapologetic
School of hard knock  I attended
Selling hard rock  fuck who I offended
I was a goner  punished by karma
Called him tar baby  now he's transcending genres
The 911 came with the ass shots
A toothless crackhead was the mascot
The owner of the key to that padlock
I'm Jordan verse the Cavs for the last shot
I need all mine  reparations
We growin' poppy seeds on my forty acres  Push
Trouble world  trouble child
Trouble times destroyed my smile
No change of heart  no change of mind
You can take what's yours but you gon' leave what's mine
I'd rather die than go home
I'd rather die than go home
 I let you see the higher me
 I am Siamese
 entrada
 that's one saga
 I'm Harold Potter
 I swear them Vegas nights was fucking awesome
 I blow my own dice before I toss 'em
 some other niggas double crossed 'em
 I blew a small fortune
 we was like the four horsemen
 I'm motherfucking Gorgeous (Woo!)
 tires double tread
 that gets me double head
 tryna keep a level head
 look at what the devil did
 gave a fuck if I'm famous
 partied nights with the A-list
 you're on your 25th hour
 I'm steppin' out the bleachers
 yuugh!
 upstage them
 Pagans
 I ran contraband
 gave a fuck if I'm famous
 partied nights with the A-list
 Fear of God niggas
 this the realest shit I ever wrote
 yeah
 haha
 hope I ain't get you in no trouble with that shit
 you know? Haha
 my nigga
 is you ready?
A positive sight can be blurred
And the visions that we thought were good
Seems to let evil occur
While still possessing our human form
We live life searching for greatness since the day we was born
Forgiveness for our sinful ways
Amen
Yeah (amen) you like that right? (amen)
I wrote it myself by the way (amen)
Fuck the goddamn shit (amen)
Lord forgive my sins and all my friends

Nigga you'll get it when pigs fly
In Egypt they fightin’ for freedom
See the first they roll around and their bills they cannot pay
Amen
I got them units packed in that black van like the A-Team
Even seen 'em come 2-tone like a Saleen (Saleen?)
Instead I bought a half a block and tried to sew up half the streets
Guess who’s pickin’ up a trey? Just an ordinary day
See the first they roll around and their bills they cannot pay
Amen
All dem a gwaan dem heart softer than clay
None ah dem have the guts to rise it and spray
None ah dem have the guts to bust the SK
I got diamonds on my blocka
Serve it to my flocka

I’m just tryna find my way out this fucking kitchen
A birds eye view got me channelling my vision
Turn one to two now the kilo’s got a sibling
Father knows best  wash my hands all's forgiven
We kicking up dust like the colosseum floors
Walls full of safes like they mausoleum doors
Pussy getting wet as she walking through my morgue
Yeh  the fear of God’s in you muthafuckas
This art imitate my life
Your World Star Hip Hop fame based off imitation white
Eliminate the fool's gold and imitation ice
My music for your soul  inspiration for your life
Every dime I made in this life wasn't disastrous
Help my young bitch see my way through the Bachelors
Sent my old bitch right back to get her Masters
Same graduation I was clapping in the rafters
The truth hurts everytime it’s revealed
What goes around comes around  this is life's ferris wheel
Grab hold and reverse the steering wheel
As I parrallel park  Kentucky Derby on the grill
The fact that I’m free lets me know God is great
Ten year marathon of me selling concentrate
These rappers talk crowns but I’d rather talk fear
Villain like Candyman  say my name and I’ll appear
No weapon formed against me shall prosper
Hakuna matata  feet up sipping java
Strolling up the totem pole  what’s my only problem?
Scrolling through my Rolodex  who shall bear my toddler
So many hands raised as the band plays
I’m here now  watch how many nigga's plans change
First class flights  Ciroc soaked nights
Why would I wanna?
We was out in Brambleton after Pooh got hit
Club Entourage in that new drop six
Ice that'll snag any new hot bitch
Beach niggas wanted work that they could move out quick
(Why would I wanna?)
We was both hurt when we see how Q dropped Bish'
Who knew your face bеin' all across the news outlets
Would mean forever I would never talk to you 'bout shit?
Huh
Why would I wanna hold you down
(Why would I wanna?)

Huh
Why would I wanna hold you down
(Why would I wanna?)
It was sad watching dude in Vlad interviews
Why Michael kissed Fredo in Godfather II
This that no-witnesses-wrapped-in-duct-tape shit
Needed all my niggas just to move your brick
That had me on Brambleton back when Pooh got hit
Huh
Why would I wanna hold you down
The pull-up's like a FedEx truck
I can send some niggas 'round there right now
1-800 Call-My-Bluff
Wake your ass up where you rest
On time like a Amazon truck
I can send some niggas 'round there right now
1-800 Call-My-Bluff
Buffalo shrimps from Mahi Mah's
Coke deals upstairs at the Ramada
The oceanfront motels was popular
And crack was cemented phenomenon
Elected Presidential was on my arm
Red stripe Pradas and on and on
We only in the sport to be LeBrons
Your favorite rapper's dressing like Comic-Con
These necklaces is different from charm to charm
Buried drug money from lawn to lawn
We learned from the wizards and Poppa Ron's

Service with a smile when I hand out halos
Rather watch the sunset in Turks and Caicos
Eating conch fritters with chips and queso's
Don't make me call my TTG's with Draco's
Who all got amnesia until the case closed
Sometimes I wish my fanbase was more like J. Cole's
But dope boys gotta be the man like they know
How many more car faxes must get exposed?
You should listen to them on the platforms they on
Everything don't need to be addressed
The pull-up's like a FedEx truck
I can send some niggas 'round there right now

Wake your ass up where you rest
On time like a Amazon truck

That's got yourself a great big Jones
An' you done tried all the methadone
An' you just can't leave that heroin alone
They say don't let money change you
That's how we know money ain't you
Never have I been locked up in a world of misery
I need you darlin' to set me free

Who else got the luxury to drop when he want
'Cause nobody else can fuck with me? What a show-off
If we go by connections made
I can still climb ladders when complexions fade (Yugh)
See these diamonds in this watch face?
All that shit came from pressure
They don't miss you 'till you gone with the wind
And they tired of dancin' like a Ying Yang Twin
Real niggas bring balance to the game I'm in (Yugh)
Can't escape the scale if I tried
Interstate trafficking's alive
Push
Never have I been locked up in a world of misery
I need you darlin' to set me free
I can't—
Don't make me super-soak niggas
It's really just momma's fallin' out on the reverend
I play musical chairs with these squares
Rich flair before they was Ric Flair's
Stood the test of time like Dapper Dan
Season my sauce like Zatarain's
Is he still in the caravan? (No)
It's a mil' in the caravan? (Whoa)
Richard Mille on a leather band (Ooh)
Behind the wheel like an ambulance (Go)
On my way up to Maryland (Gone)
Never have I been locked up in a world of misery
I need you darlin' to set me free
I can't—
Even if you got money  still lookin' for more
Why am I buyin' Rollies? I got 20 for sure
Still connect witchu  it's still hid in the drawer
With no Js on  I'm still lookin' to score
You see they gave us crack  then started wagin' a war
Uh  all these lies  they steady tellin' me
Before Obama  we had Eric B. (Woo)
Or Tony Lewis out in D.C.
The '80s kingpins  gotta free them
All these faces  they ain't believe in
If no child's left  then how can we leave them?
When love is gone  you hold onto anything
Some do wrong  just to feel anything
But when the void is filled  you stand up to anything
When love is real  you can do anything
(You can do anything)
Uh  I do it for my big Benz drivers (Drivers)
For my street-corner survivors (Survivors)
For my niggas that miss The Wire (Woo)
And throwback mamis  that won't retire
Reminiscin' on the days
When the trips was Cancún and the bottles got sprayed
You can't relate 'cause you wasn't there
Nah  you wasn't hot  let me make it clear
Y’all was breakin' into cars  we was breakin' bad
When y’all was fightin' dogs  we was racin' Jags
This the life for the fast
Ain't no future  ain't no past  we won't worry 'bout the crash  uh
Now it's jail poses and club pictures
Airbrush backdrops and jail visits
This the dope boy song for the dope boys gone
Let 'em know it's still snowin'

I'm speakin' to the soul of my black native bros
Who ain't get to go to school like a J. Cole
Who ain't have a silver spoon or a bankroll
Who weren't taught the golden rule  but they made do
Free lunches and apple juices  uh
Food stamps  ashamed to use 'em
You ever lived with the user?
Shared a bed with abusers  that's the worst way to lose 'em
New plan  but it's a new day
Black people past their due date
Settin' the captives free in a new way
I'm coming home  I'm coming home  I'm coming home
I'm coming home  I'm coming home  I'm coming home
It's a new day  Black people past their due date
Settin' the captives free  in a new way
Said it's not over  it's not over
Yes  it's just started  it's just started
When love is strong  you can do anything
Things go wrong  but you'll stand up to anything
(But you'll stand up to anything)
'Cause when the void is filled  you can do anything
(When the void is filled)
Uh-huh
Beautiful evils
Yeah

All I see is victims

I just get back their jewelry if I’m fuckin’ with ‘em
Your man crush Mondays be owin’ niggas
Take my time to craft shit
‘Cause I don’t like back and forths with Puff about rap shit
All I see is victims
Rappers is victimized at an all-time high
In ya thousand dollar joggers as you rhyme about ya dollars

Mildred’s in the Bahamas for the month
She’s probably sitting in her pajamas having lunch
Banana clips for all you Curious Georges
Old niggas slapping young niggas

Renegades
I don't give a fuck what you say about me
Broke nigga two cents don't matter

Broke bitch two cents don't matter
There's a meaning to the kissin' of the ring
The gods don't mingle with the mortals
Peasants ain't sittin' with the kings
Goliath ain't worried 'bout your sling
And Cassius ain't bothered by your swings
50 birds waitin' in the wings
Let's talk about the cars and why mines shaped funny
Lets' talk about the fact you'll never take nothin' from me

The nerve of you
He’ll sit and clip at your lines like he ain’t heard of you
I seen it happen before  that man will murder you
The lowest form of a thief is a cat burglar
Tiptoe-in' but the whole while cloning
The elephant’s in the room  the bitch glowing
Like a ghetto girl with the good weave sewn in
She walk like its her's but the whole world knowing
Told niggas it’s the new god flow
It’s that New Testament and the old God knows
And you new niggas don’t get to pass go
I’ll monopolize Boardwalk Empire flow
So don’t mention me in the same breath  I’m Genghis
Just venting I never wished to be famous
Truth told I’d much rather be strangers
Before it leads to me turnin’ niggas to angels
Local niggas hatin’ but I can’t blame ‘em
Clear the road to the riches but I can’t pave ‘em
Put Trey up on your hook  still couldn’t save ‘em
Better chance with a snowball hitting Satan

Chappelle Show  all of you Neal Brennans
Sketch comedy  who was for real pennin'?
The talk don’t match the leather
The swag don’t match the sweaters
And wolves don’t walk with shepherds
These Margiela verses all you mall dwellers
Off-the-rack suits looking like pallbearers
Coffins for my old bitches’ orphans
Daddy’s MIA like a dolphin
Play the Fendi bucket like a shark's fin
Cool J-ing on you bitches but I’m dark-skinned
We walked in  seats courtside
Dap Diddy  Will Ferrell on my walk by
At the US Open  there’s much more to Queens

Chains on my niggas like slave runners
Drug dealers anonymous
How many Madonnas can that Mazda fit?
Blonde mohawk the collection I’m Dennis Rodman
The money count is the only moment of silence
Cause hush money balances all this drugs and violence
Hat trick under my mattress
Date I stop still has an asterisk after it
After all I can make a call
I can baptize a brick
As I wash away my sins like a catholic
Who the fuck ain't mastered this
America’s nightmare's in Flint
Children of a lesser God when your melanin’s got a tint
And I can’t even mention what I sent or what I spent
'Cause my name in 18 wheelers is evidence
I put my boos in those cruise collections
Life’s a bitch
Let he without sin cast the first stone
So I built that all glass quad level first home
Shatter all of your misconceptions
Hold all of them missing weapons
You thought I would miss my blessing
The ultimate misdirection ya

Rarely do you see the Phoenix rise from the ashes

If Hov's still forever young
Then I'ma somersault backwards through these chapters
It's the grown man in me

Harold Melvin without the Blue Notes
Then side step back into the duo

Books and the lawyers  I done paid for my friends
Still held back  I done paid with my skin
The only thing missing is a cape on me
You niggas wanna tag a late  great on me
Put the fears in my peers  heard my footsteps coming from the rear
Now it’s murder was the case homie
I’m watching this three ring circus 
Old lions don’t roar  so the clowns ain’t nervous
Even you fools serve purpose 
Let ‘em run amuck until the king resurface
Then it’s off with your heads
Wear your little jewels  you could floss when you’re dead
They take samples of ‘em  I make examples of ‘em
It’s the thrill of the hunt  I keep my mantle covered
Ask ‘Ye who’s loyalty more realer
Ask P  who’s core’s a drug dealer
Me and Tim  it's coming  it’s gonna kill ‘em
The only great I ain’t made better was J. Dilla
Now we breaking new ground
Get ready for the placing of the crown
King Push nigga!

Millionaires were made out of middlemen
That hole in the attic was not for a ceiling fan
And army fatigue when I talk pyramids

You got that thing that'll make a girl feel high

Boy  let me love you
I know that you think I'm the one  but who doesn't?

A ball player sold you a dream  ain't do nothing
A couple rappers under your belt  but who's judging?
I ain't trying to guide you  hand on Bible
But Instagram pics show more than side views
Thirty-dollar nude catsuits is not cute
And fifty comments on ass is not fluke  so
No cuffing  no buns in the oven

Yuugh  this is drug dealer brilliance
Pyrex on the platter like hot sex

Trey-eight on  could've been Trayvon

Powder-face like a geisha
Arm & Hammer for the breakup

I just sit and wonder  play it by the numbers
When you ride like lightnin' then you crash like thunder
Seen your baby mama  she ain't even know if she should speak
What the fuck is there to say knowing her king's now weak sayin'
Sorry  nigga  I'm tryna come home
Sorry  nigga  I'm tryna come home
Well  the walls are talkin' to me and I know you think I'm wrong
Let's talk real niggas  let's speak real  nigga
How many niggas you knew snitchin' you ain't killed  nigga?
Covered his own tracks  he didn't care that
We had a legacy he killed  I got to wear that
Every move we ever made is gettin' stared at
I bet the man inside his mirror doesn't stare back
Break your heart when the man you call your brother
Be the same one that set in motion all them undercovers
Called my mom mother  was at my graduation
When I signed my record deal you was my motivation
Uh  from great friends now it's no affiliation
Divided by the time he was facin'  once he told me that
Sorry  nigga  I'm tryna come home
Sorry  nigga  I'm tryna come home
I think the Feds are looking through me  can't you hear it in my tone?
Let's talk this payola (Payola)
You killed God's baby when it wasn't his will
I am just a short stone's throw from the streets
At the Kremlin
Presidential tint on this shit that I am driven in (Woo!)
I just place orders and drop dollars
The three of y'all too accessible
Santería!

America  you need a miracle
Beyond spiritual

I hold a mirror to it
These ain’t new problems  they just old ways
I see one time turn sunshine into Freddie Gray
Just another nigga dead  just another nigga dead
Send another to the FEDs  send another to the FEDs
Not guilty  still I’m filthy
In FOX eyes  we the dark side
So they tell you lies
Through a TV  C-N-B-C
In order to be me
You gotta see what Chief Keef see
Brenda’s baby next door to the candy lady 
Same project as Candy Man where they still doing hand-in-hands
Sunday to Sunday  pastor only want one day
Grandma praying someday

Funeral flowers  every 28 hours
Being laid over ours
Sworn to protect and serve  but who really got the power?
Looking over their allowances 
Building prisons where the mountains is
Laptops is for the county kids
Metal detectors is where ours is
They’ll never re-write this  like they re-wrote history
The fact that the Statue of Liberty was black is a goddamn mystery
And so it goes  every truth don’t get told
All these cops get cleared  and lives are stole
Every goose don’t lay gold whoa
Just another nigga dead  just another nigga dead
Send another to the FEDs  send another to the FEDs
They call in the National Guard
Public Enemy  I am Chuck D

Let's have a heart-to-heart about your pride
Let's examine why
Your music for the past few years been angry and full of lies
You mention wedding ring like it's a bad thing
How you a winner but she keep comin' in last place?
A Steve Harvey-suit nigga made him
Afraid to grow it 'cause your 'fro wouldn't nap enough
Since you name-dropped my fiancée
Let 'em know who you chose as your Beyoncé
Sophie knows better as your baby mother
Adonis is your son
How dare you put Ye in my verses?
The only ones I chase are two ghosts
And you don't really want it with him

Every street tax gotta come with an audit
From the village where the thugs from

Glance at the ceiling

The final trilogy of Jaws
The grills like  interior gauze
It feels like  still white
Matching Missoni looks African on me
They tryin’ pin this trafficking on me like Mano and Tony
My thoughts spilling over
The soft ceiling’s open  I Cross-Fit the coca
