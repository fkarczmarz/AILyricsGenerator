"2021  will you think about me?
I could wait a year  but I shouldn't wait three (Boy)
I don't wanna be (Boy)
2021  will you think about us?
Copper goes green  steel beams go rust (Boy)
It's a matter of (Boy)
Boy  boy
Boy  boy
2021  will you think about me?
I could wait a year  but I couldn't wait three (Boy)
I don't wanna be (Boy)
2021  will you think about us?
Copper goes green  steel beams go rust (Boy)
The Hudson River all filled with snow
She spied the ring on His Honor's finger
A thousand years in one piece of silver
She took it from his lily-white hand
In the young men's wing at Sloan-Kettering
Down to the pueblo huts of New Mexico
Cut his teeth on turquoise harmonicas
I saw Johanna down in the subway
She took an apartment in Washington Heights
Half of the ring lies here with me
But the other half's at the bottom of the sea

Can't speak when the waves reach our house upon the dunes
Time cannot be trusted
Life felt like heaven today
Like a foreign car though we are American-made
I thought I'd probably stay
My Christian heart cannot withstand
The thundering arena
I'll see you when the violence ends
No signs of injustice
Fire cannot be trusted
My Christian heart cannot withstand
The thundering arena
I'll see you when the violence ends

The thundering arena
I'll see you when the violence ends

Never really heard you speak that way  it's unworthy of
Funny how that little college girl called language corrupt
Funny how the other private schools had no Hapa Club
Someone took a trip before you came to ski in the Alps
Your father moved across the country just to sunburn his scalp
Living like the French Connection  but we'll die in LA
Blasted from a disconnected light switch
Through the condo that they'll never finish
Bounced across a Saudi satellite dish
And through your brain to California English
No one sits inside a freezing flat and stays there 'til May
Leafing through a stack of A-Zs to surf the UK
Waiting with the wind against your face and gel in your hair
Shivering in little undershirts  but don't seem to care
Blasted from a disconnected light switch
Through the condo that they'll never finish

I've got to leave here  before I go
I pull my shirt on  walk out the door
Drag my feet along the floor

Cruel professor  studying romances
How am I supposed to pretend
I never want to see you again?

You found a sweater on the ocean floor
They're gonna find it if you didn't close the door
You and the smart ones sit outside of their sight
In a house on a street they wouldn't park on at night
Dad was a risk-taker  his was a shoe maker
You  Greatest Hits 2006 little list-maker
Heard codes in the melodies  you heeded the call
Oh  you were born with ten fingers and you're gonna use them all
Interesting colors I discovered myself
If your art life is gritty  you'll be toasting my health
If an interest in culture should be lining the walls

With the light from the TVs buzzing in the house

In the dark  when the wind comes racing off the river
Young bloods can't be settling down
Young hearts need the pressure to pound

Saw crawling vines and weeping willows

To change their names again

We laughed and asked him for his name

You spend a week in Old San Juan
Spanish brownstone with chairs of leather
And Spanish waves to roll along

Lovelier now  but dressed for a funeral
Begging you to sit for a portrait on the wall
To hang in the dark of some parliamentary hall
Elegant clothes you want to be seen with her
Under your tweeds you sweat like a teenager
Begging you to sit for a portrait on the wall
To hang in the dark of some parliamentary hall
Today is for you
They laid it out for you  for you
There will be six bells a-ringing and white women singing for you
All of the cards and all of the time it took
Soon it's all lines of red in a leather book
Begging you to wait for a minute by the door
Your creeping feet where they've never been before
Today is for you
They laid it out for you  for you
There will be six bells a-ringing and white women singing for you
I've seen those English dramas too  they're cruel
So if there's any other way to spell the word
Why would you speak to me that way?
Especially when I always said that I
Haven't got the words for you
All your diction dripping with disdain
Who gives a fuck about an Oxford comma?
I met the highest Lama
Why would you lie 'bout how much coal you have?
Why would you lie about something dumb like that?
Why would you lie 'bout anything at all?

And I’m the one
A hundred to one says I wouldn't react
But I'm the one in a hundred who would swing right back
Thousands of steps and staircases to climb
Thousands of men you'd most likely decline
And yet I'm the one
I'm compelled by your love and I haven't lost yet
One in a million don't mean what it meant
And these millions of gold coins don't gleam when they’re spent
You’re left with none
Ten million dollars could win the whole lot
But if ten million dollars is all that you got
You won't be the one
Hundreds of millions of papers to sign
Hundreds of millions of souls left behind
To be one in a billion's a terrible trick
You're the wretched one
One rich man in ten has a satisfied mind
And every morning hurts
We mostly work to live
Until we live to work
She said
You know
There's nowhere else to go
But chang-

It struck me that the two of us could run
Worlds away from cars
And all the Stars and Bars
Where a little bit of condensation means so much
And a little bit of change is all your little fingers touch
I said

 Mmm
 Nothing gold can stay
 skippin' town up on these coupe seats
 What's your name  boo?
 I can't do it alone
 back  way back I used to front like Angkor Wat
 Anchorage and Dar es Salaam
 but girl  that was back then
 the wisdom teeth are out
 I'm ready for the house
 she's tougher than leather
 they didn't know how to dress for the weather
 huddled on Astor
 the wisdom teeth are out
 I'm ready for the house
 but you'd trade it for youth
 it's still not the truth
 the true way of all flesh
 but girl  you're not old yet
 the wisdom teeth are out
 I'm ready for the house
 the wisdom teeth are out
 I'm ready for the house
Standing in the garden
All before you wake
No power can compel you
Out into the daylight
Let that evil wait
Strange thought upon the pillow
What day demands a date?
Sunflower in the evening
Standing in the garden
Taking up that space
No power can compel me
Back into the daylight
Let that evil wait
Strange thought upon the pillow
What day demands a date?

Sure of myself  sure of it now
But you were standing there so close to me
Like the future was supposed to be
In the aisles of the grocery
And the blocks uptown
I remember  remember it well
But if I'd forgotten  could you tell?
In the shadow of your first attack
I was questioning and looking back
Like a real aristocrat
Compound to compound  lazy and safe
Wanted to leave it  wanted to wait
When the taxi door was open wide
I pretended I was horrified
By the uniform and gloves outside
Of the courtyard gate
You're not a victim  but neither am I
Nostalgic for garbage  desperate for time
I could blame it on your mother's hair
Or the colors that your father wears
But I know that I was never fair
You were always fine

All the way from France
A shirtsleeve to enhance
The pin-striped men of morning

With pure Egyptian Cotton
The kids don't stand a chance
You criticize the practice
By murdering their plants
Ignoring all the history
Denying them romance

And pulling away has been unbearably buff
I ran up the mountain  out of your sight
The snow on the peak was just unbearably white
The city was freezing  an elegant floe
The wind at the doorway was unbearably cold
You walked to the bedroom and sat down to write
The page in your notebook was unbearably white
There's an avalanche coming
Don't cover your eyes
It's what you thought that you wanted
It's still a surprise
It's hard on the body
It's hard on the mind
To learn what kept us together  darling
Is what kept us alive
Sooner or later  the story gets told
To tell it myself would be unbearably bold
Presented with darkness  we turn to the light
Could've been smart  we're just unbearably bright
