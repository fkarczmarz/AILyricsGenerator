lyrics
"When I read your letters
But I just had to know
If you still miss her
'Cause you feel far away
When I kiss you
And every word you say
Sounds so confused
I don't wanna hold you
If you don't wanna stay
No matter what I'm feeling
I won't hide it
And know that you can tell me
Every secret
'Cause I'm no good at guessing
I just need to know

All of you (You)
All of you (You)
All of you (You)
All these years gone by
Now you're asking me to listen
'Cause this is a battle and it's your final last call
But why aren't you sorry? Why aren't you sorry? Why?
You've got them on your side
And they won't change their minds
Now it's over and I'm feeling like we've missed out on everything
I just hope it's worth the fight
Cause this is a battle and it's your final last call
(Why'd you have to let it go?)
(Can't you see you've hurt me so?)
But why aren't you sorry? Why aren't you sorry? Why?

(Can't you see you've hurt me so?)
But why aren't you sorry? Why aren't you sorry? Why?
And it's your final last call
And it's your final last call
You keep on looking back at what you knew
When will you come closer?
Closer to the one that's good for you
'Cause you're still going back to that life
And I refuse to stand on the side
By sparing her from heartache
Don’t you know you end up hurting me?
I see your head spinning right around
She makes you fall hard and hit the ground
When you ever gonna let her go?
I see the way that she breaks you so
All I’m asking is for you  please
To take control and be set free
Make the space so we can grow
Save us before I let you go
So you say this will get better
Well  I don’t know what to tell ya
It’s not my fault that I don’t believe
'Cause you're still so stuck in that life
And I refuse to stay on this ride
'Cause we’re going 'round in circles
Aren’t you tired of never having peace?

Oh no  oh no
I can't get you out of the rain
I can't get you back to that one time
'Cause you and me are still recovering
So let's just try to cool it down
And let's just try to slow it down
We crash when we race
It's the way it should begin
It's the way it should begin again
Never wanna break your heart
Never wanna let you break my own
That we probably didn't mean
But it's not too late to take them back
I should probably let you know

Swear you hit me like a vision
But who am I to tell fate where it's supposed to go?
With it
Don't you blink  you might miss it
You find it and keep it
'Cause it ain't every day you get the chance to say...
I'd never seen it
You better believe
I'm gonna treat it better than anything I've ever had
'Cause you're so damn beautiful
Marley and reggae
And everybody needs to get a chance to say...

You've got me feeling like a child now
'Cause every time I see your bubbly face
I get the tinglies in a silly place

Parties never had to end
Life was always like a vacation
Building castles in the sand
Showing off a seamless tan
All day long be cruisin' 'round naked
In an endless summer vibe
We'd be cruisin'
We ain't got nowhere to go
Only thing we know is
We're cruisin'
Running free on island time
Every day and night
We'd be cruisin'
We'd be cruisin'
Cannonballs into the sea
Everything is make believe
Pirates sailing underneath rainbows
Rope swinging from tree to tree
Ever after happily
Frolicking wherever the sun goes
In an endless summer vibe

There's burning in your eyes
Cravin' I can't hide
That's raging through the heart of me
Just like a wild fire
I wanna touch the spark
But I'm safer in the dark
I'm scared to see what happens if we let it go too far
I don't wanna miss you  I don't wanna wish you
Always were around every time I’m without you
I don't wanna see you inside every dream
You're never gonna make come true
I don't wanna love you
I don't wanna love you
But I do
Is the pleasure worth the pain?
Is sunlight worth the rain?
Is silence worth the sound of our hearts?
Screaming while they break
Is surrender worth the fight?
When the battle leaves you blind?
And if you never see me
Will I still be on your mind?

Shrouded beneath my fear and doubt

My head is in a cloud of rain
So you left a mark
And I wear it proudly on my chest
Above my heart
To remind me that I feel the best

And everything is effortless
You know it's true

Red like sunrise
Kisses from the hot summer morning
Live the good life

 the way I see you
 wide awake in the middle of my dreams
The world would still be so small
There'd still be four walls
I wouldn't stand so tall
If I hadn't met you
I wouldn't know love again
Hearts can break and they mend
How things end and begin
And everything that happens ain't for nothin'
You were meant for me to find
Meant for me to touch
Meant for me to learn from
Meant for me to trust
Meant for me to hold

Make it real
On the corners of my dreaming eyes
A one way ticket takes me to the times we had before
When everything felt so right
If only for tonight
From all these feelings driving me insane
I think of you and everything's all right

Got a midnight bottle
Drifting off into the candlelight

I found a boy who had a dream
Makin' everyone smile
He was sunshine
I fell over
My feet like bricks underwater
And how am I supposed to tell you how I feel?
I need oxygen
I would make you happy
I am going crazy for you
And so I found a state of mind where I could be speechless
I had to try it for a while to figure out this feeling

Pretend we didn't do it all wrong
Let's act as if we didn't quit
Let's pretend you gave me your all
Pretend I didn't need more
And that we're still sittin' in a countryside kitchen
Red dog sleepin' on the floor
Guess I still got some feelings
Of that first summer night in the back of your truck
Dancin' in a field with the radio on
The moment we found our favorite song
Burnin' like a fire that would never go out
Heartache wasn't somethin' we were thinkin' about
That forever kind of feeling that we found back then

I'm tired of the angry hangin' out inside me
So I'll quiet down the devil
I'm gonna knock him with a shovel
And I'll burry all my troubles underneath the rubble

I have to tell myself to...
