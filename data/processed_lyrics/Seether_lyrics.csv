"There are pads everywhere
Chafing straitjacket
I won't die in there
I don't care if I'm lost
Don't tell me that you're all better
I don't care if you are
Don't tell me that you're trendsetters
I don't care if you are
Lowly with my head bowed
There are rats everywhere
Feed me bread and water
I won't die in there
I don't care if I'm lost

Don't tell me that you're all better
I don't care if you are
Don't tell me that you're bedwetters
I don't care if you are
Say you will
Take my pills
Say you will
Faking ill
Say you will (Say you will)
Take my pills (Take my pills)
Say you will (Say you will)
And run across the sun
With nowhere to turn to
And if I dare to believe at all
It leaves me deflated
My mind begins to stray
And my thoughts begin to run
Don't let this concern you
So will you catch me if I fall
And keep me elated?
It's not complicated
And if I knew I could change it all
I'd hope that you waited
(Can't be broken down)
And if I knew I could change it all
I'd hope that you waited

She's feeling like she's already won
I believe it's gonna end again
All for naught
My philosophy is things are just as wrong as they seem
I believe it's gonna end this way
Atrocity
Do you believe in love
Like I believe in pain
Nobody died for you
Somebody pray for me!
When you see me cut me down
And I will force it underground
There's no one left to hurt but me
And it's because of me
Right!
There he walks away
He's feeling like he's having them on
I believe he's gonna bend again
And all for naught
My philosophy is things are just as wrong as they seem
I've gotta get you off of me!

And the pain is overwhelming
It's a faultline
That I should be kinda happy
It's a fault of mine
With all the tension
You still keep me second-guessing
'Cause I'm so benign
It's kinda hard to let it go
It's all so asinine
We have to figure out another way to go
We have to figure out another way to go
Betray and degrade me now
I'll savour how this emptiness defines you
And take from this tortured sound
My hands are bound
Your shallowness confines you

Words are spaces between us
And I should have been drowned
In the rivers I found of token lost
And I should have been down
When you made me insecure
So break me down if it makes you feel right
And hate me now if it keeps you all right
Because I'm so much more
Than meets the eye
And I'm the one you can never trust
Because wounds are ways to reveal us
And devoted my life to both of us
But what a waste of my time
When the world we have is yours
So break me down if it makes you feel right
And hate me now if it keeps you all right

Feel safe in the knowledge that you’ll save yourself with prayer

If I beat myself it seems like you just don’t care at all
It’s really fucking pitiful
I’m not asking to pray about
Parade around
Or save somebody
Lost the courage I’m craven now
You’re way too proud
All bruised and bloodied
Conceit so lovely you’ve led me into despair
This rape and pillage of all things that I hold dear
Deface my body with gifts that you now bestow
When I need somebody it seems like you’re just not there at all

I'm never gonna dance again

I know you're not a fool
I should have known better than to cheat a friend
And waste the chance that I've been given
So I'm never gonna dance again

Ignorance is kind

But I'm never gonna fade away
There's a saying it's now or never
And this is never gonna wash away
So don't you wear that frown
And don't you be forlorn
There's a break in the weather
And it's sure nice not to feel
So take heed of voices that conspire
Make me walk this path alone
My sanity keeps unraveling despite this
I'm burning in the fire
I'm labeled as a liar
From today I will do better
Because I never want to feel the shame
With every vein that I have severed
I have struggled with what I became
I will not let you down
I won't be cause for harm
So today I will do better
And I sure hope this can heal

She used her body to sell her soul
Every town they'd break her and pay
Tear out her heart and leave her in pain
I never found out how she survived
All of the sadness she kept inside
I never found out how she could lie
With a smile on her face and the scratches she'd hide
You could have her everyday
Down on her knees she bled on the floor
Dead in her eyes and cold to the bone
She opened her eyes and saw she was alone
She never found out how much I tried
All of the sadness she kept made me blind
She never found out how much I cried
The rope so tight on the night that she died

Storming in a teacup

And you don't even heed me
Treat me as an enemy
See me as a failure and see me as dumb
You don't even need me
To keep it all in harmony
I am disappointment and I am no fun
How could this be misunderstood?
No one will tell you why they smile as they berate you
They keep saying it's gonna be fine
No one will help you as they constantly sedate you
They keep killing the grape on the vine
Singing your own praises
Constantly amazes
I don't wanna hear the words you're saying to me
How can I rephrase this?
You're all rats in mazes
Constantly you're fighting over scraps of the cheese
Observing all your weakness
Puddles have more deepness
Empty vessels clamouring across the sea
Revel in your genius
Eating clean and meatless
I'll be in the corner with my dignity
