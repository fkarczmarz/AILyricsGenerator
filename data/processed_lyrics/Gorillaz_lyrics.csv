lyrics
"I'm buying lead Nike shoes
To keep myself tethered
To the days I've tried to lose
My mama said to slow down
You must make your own shoes
Stop dancing to the music
Of Gorillaz in a happy mood
Keeping my groove on
They do the bump
They do the bump
They do the bump
They do the bump
They do the bump
They do the bump
They do the bump
Here you go! Get the cool
Get the cool shoeshine
Get the cool
Get the cool shoeshine
Get the cool
Get the cool shoeshine
Get the cool
Get the cool shoeshine

There's a monkey in the jungle
Watching a vapor trail
Caught up in the conflict
Between its brain and its tail
And if time's elimination
Then we got nothing to lose
Please repeat the message
It's the music that we choose
Keeping my groove on
They do the bump
They do the bump
They do the bump
They do the bump
They do the bump
They do the bump
They do the bump
We goin' back out
Get the cool
Get the cool shoeshine
Get the cool
Get the cool shoeshine
Get the cool
Get the cool shoeshine
Get the cool
Get the cool shoeshine
They do the bump
They do the bump
They do the bump
Magic makes no sound
It good for me
It good for me underground
Magic on me
Really got me down
Invade the city
It made my heart beat no sound
Beat no sound
Beat no sound
Beat no sound
And let me tell myself
Tell on
She turned my dad on
Magic for me
With magic money
People seem to walk through you
Magic's funny
All good for me

I'm looking out at a volcano
Trying to read the world today
And see where you're at
I never do that
I'm a model that is uncomplicated
You can play a happy tune on me
But don't turn me off
'Cause then I am silent
I'm standing on a beach in the distance
And even though you're far away
Can you see my red light?
It's waiting to turn green
'Cause I feel so isolated without you
I can't play a happy tune on my own
So stay by my side

Come in black or red
I've seen their worlds
Inside my head
They connect
With the fall of man
They breathe you in
Then dive as deep as they can
There's nothing you can do for them
They are the force between
When the sunlight is arising
There's nothing you can say to him
He is in outer heart
And the space has been broken
It's Broken
Our love
It's Broken

Our love
It's Broken

They are the force between
When the sunlight is arising
There's nothing you can say to her
I am without a heart

When everything was outside
Busted and blue
How in the universe?
Through the lithium
Busted and blue
I was asked by a computer
A shadow on the wall
An image made by Virgil
To rule over us all
So amplify the sirens
And to find real amends
I'm through the echo-chambers
To other worlds I went
All my life
All my life
Beam a light
And I can't get back without you
Be my love
Be my light
Be my love

In the end  I had to pay (I purged my soul)

Bring it back  got to hold it back
To let you do that  yet you don't want me back
Falling down to go far from the sun
In these demon days  we're so cold inside
It's so hard for a good soul to survive
You can't even trust the air you breathe
'Cause Mother Earth want us all to leave
When lies become reality
You numb yourself with drugs and TV
Pick yourself up  it's a brand new day
So turn yourself 'round
Don't burn yourself  turn yourself
Turn yourself around to the sun
In these demon days  we're so cold inside

I need a gun 'cause all I do is dance
'Cause all I do is dance
And your result weaken with anger and discontent
Some are seekin' and searchin' like Nimoy
Orders given to me is strike and I'm thunder
With lightning-fast reflexes
On constant alert from the constant hurt
That seems limitless with no drop in pressure
It seems like everybody's out to test ya 'til they see you break
You can't conceal the hate that consumes you
I'm the reason why you fill up your Isuzu
Chill with your old lady at the tilt
I got a ninety-day extension and I'm filled with guilt
From things done and seen
Out in the desert with my street sweeper
With the flight suit on
So he can advance
Remember when I used to dance?

Sailing out the doldrums of the week
The polyphonic prayer is here  it's all around you
It's all around you  out here
And if the whole world is crashing down (on you)
Fall through space out of mind with me
Where the emptiness we leave behind on warm air rising
Blows all the shadows far away
The falling of the whole empire  is here to hold you
Rolling out and haunted till it sleeps
Little memories  marching on
Your little feet  working the machine
Say will it spin  will it soar?
My little dream  working the machine
Soon  like a wave  empires will fall
And closing in on you  they're going on

But God only knows it's

I love you
But what are we going to do?
Down to the sleepy glow
Time is a low
Don't you know?
What are we going to do?
When we go down
For all the sacred selfless days
Only left with heartache
I want to see you again
I love you
But what are we going to do?
Feel good
City's breaking down on a camel's back
And you won't get out the county 'cause you're damned and free
A melancholy town where we never smile
And all I wanna hear is the message beep

There was a town where the people known as Happyfolk lived
Their very existence a mystery to the rest of the world
Obscured as it was by great clouds
Innocent of the litany of excess and violence
That was growing in the world below
To live in harmony with the spirit of the mountain called Monkey was enough
Falling out of aeroplanes and hiding out in holes
Jump out from behind them and shoot them in the head
And it was there that they found the caves of unimaginable sincerity and beauty
And soon they began to mine the mountain
Their dreams invaded by shadowy figures digging away at their souls
Why was it bringing darkness into their lives?
Bringing with them a cold and bitter wind that chilled the very soul of the Monkey
For they knew that soon the Monkey would stir from its deep sleep
So immense that it could be heard far away in space
The mountain called Monkey had spoken

There's nothing you believe you want
But where were you when it all came down on me?
My face will be painted in these white brick lines
'Cause all my fears invaded
All the crazies put on buses and sent up here to find you
Living on the limits
And if you say goodbye too many times
The sentinels will find me and switch me off this time
'Cause all my fear's evaded
All the crazies put on buses and sent up here to find you
Living on the limits
If all you ever get from the sonnet is the count of the fallen man
Every call and cost made to your heart
You were in the kind of game that put the force in me
I was ever chasing fireflies
Sometimes I follow a firefly
It takes me into the night
Am I losing you?

And when you go to bed
Scarecrows from the far east
Come to eat its tender fruits
And I thought the best way to perfect our tree
Is by building walls
Walls like unicorns
In full glory and galore
And even stronger
Than the walls of Jericho
But glad then my friend
What we have always dreamt of having
Are now for the starving
But not our tree
For trusting me

See  everything in life ain't silver and gold

I asked her where it goes 'cause I really want
I wonder if she knows that we're underwater
That's the way it goes in this city wonder
Moved to the spot  I'm one of a few
A whole lot of everything  but nothin' to do

Girls' trip  Miami at the end of the year
Polluted-filled skies  tryin' to think clear
I heard the bad news while I was sheddin' a beer
Watch out from the coast  Paul Revere
We all play a part in the devil's cheer
Run to the hills 'cause the end is near
But in the magic cove  there's a pretty one

Yo  a desolate city where it hurts to smile
Ran into the Reverend  says it's been a while

Gave ourselves a handout when it's too much to bear

Now he's singin' like a birdy  pullin' on his hair
Trendin' on Twitter's what some of us live for
Friendship's here  but now fuckin' revolving door
All of this a joke? Pauly Shore
Bullshit keeps comin'  maybe I'm a matador

They will be here just in time
Your replacement is here to stay (Ah-ah-ah-ah)

Your gold hits sound dumb  hold it now  crown 'em
Where you found them at?
Got 'em 'round town  could've drowned in it
Would have floated  bloated  voted
Sugar-coated  loaded hip shooter
Draw for the poor  free coffee at the banks
Hit through the straw  none more for me  thanks
That blanks the raw  that dank sure stank lit
Sank past the pit for more hardcore prank spit
Crank it on blast  roll past Front Street
Blew the whole spot like some old ass with skunk meat
These kids is too fast  juiced off a junk treat
Who could get looser off a crunk or a funk beat?

Don't desert me now
Bring me back to Fallen Town
Where someone is still alive
Fighting for something new in this
When no one needs the heart of me
And I'm looking out somewhere I've never been before
Been before
O  green world
Don't desert me now
Made of you  and you of me
But where are we?
Oh no  sells to lie
From the darkest stars that force you
Down when you’re in first
Does it seem so little to you?
I know you now
I know you know me too
You know me too
It feels holy

Are you here with me?
Just looking out on the day of another dream
'Cause you are my medicine when you're close to me

We're here tonight for a very special offering
An offering of our spirits this evening in unison
But first  a word of instruction
Hello  hello
Please leave all your belongings at the door
You can sit or stand  we can take a vote
And just tiptoe to the centre of the circle
While we unveil the ropes
Still a little room left to hang your clothes
Some of us are new here  we'll take it slow
Ready  set  go
I lock hands with yours
We dive into the floor (drop)
When we reach the core
Then we stomp some more (drop)
I lock hands with yours
And then we dive down into the floor
Seven thousand miles 'til we reach the core
And then we circle back and we stomp some more  got it?
It's just like that
You promise all your life  then you turn your back
You glide across the space  and diagonal past
Then you kick  and you jump  and you arch your back
You move your hips and your arms like a cat
Spin three times  and you're back where you're at
Does anybody catch what any of this is about?
No? Well  work it out

Keep it flowing like the rivers do
You gotta pay attention to the motion of the fish
Stay within the school or you're surely gonna miss
And if you lose your way  it's a cold black abyss
Don't take the chance  not worth the risk

That you made with plastic power
Your rhinestone eyes are like factories far away
When the paralytic dreams that we all seem to keep
Drive on engines 'til they weep
With future pixels in factories far away
So call the mainland from the beach
All parties now washed up in bleach
The waves are rising for this time of year
And nobody knows what to do with the heat
While rain is falling like rhinestones from the sky
Uh
Mmm
I can't see you now my heart is frozen
All the verses and the corrosion
Have been after native in my soul
I prayed on the immovable
Yet clinging to the atoms of rock
Seasons see adjustment signs of change
Now that light is all I can take
This dawn brings strange loyalties and skies
I'm a scary gargoyle on a tower
That you made with plastic power
Your rhinestone eyes are like factories far away

Felt like my soul in handcuffs
Got questions with no answers

It's like a cycle that never ends
I can't contend with no handlin'
I can't take care of no grown man
But won't get saved by no Superman
All comes down to the mighty dollar
Makes me wanna throw my hands and holler

I tried to tell you that I love you but I'm choked up
You forgot and that makes me feel like no one (Summer lines)
Were you ever really there? Did you ever really care?
Long summer nights (Summer lines)
Refresh your memory of where you wanna be
I tried to get to Atlanta
On a peach blossom highway
I tried to put these pauses out of mind
In a sky made of diamonds
Where the world fell silent
I'll be waiting for you on the other side

The phantom is coming

She's crossing over the line
(She’s comin’ down the street)
Passin' by the hills 'til I hear the name
I'm looking for a saw to cut the chains in half and all I want is
Someone to rely on as thunder comes a-rolling down
Someone to rely on as the lightning comes a-staring in again
I'll wait to be forgiven  maybe I never will
My star has left me to take the bitter pill
Just don't know if I could roll into the sea again
Just don't know if I could do it all again  she said—it's true
Waiting in my room  and I lock the door
I watch the coloured animals across the floor
And I'm looking from a distance and I'm listening to the whispers
And you're falling in and caught again
Cau-au-au-aught again
I'm caught again in the mystery
You're by my side  but are you still with me?
The answer's somewhere deep in it  I'm sorry that you're feeling it
But I just have to tell you that I love you so much these days

Do you dance like this forever?
Do you dance like this forever?
(Do you dance?)
(Do you dance?)
(Do you dance?)
No matter what happens
We've got the power to do that
We got the power to be
Ringing the great bell out there above us
We got the power for that
We got the power to do that
No matter what I'm told how impossible it seems (We got the power)
We did it before and we'll do it again
We got the power to be loving each other
No matter what happens
We've got the power to do that
We got the power to be
Ringing the great bell out there above us
We got the power for that
We got the power to do that
You might also like
Get yourself up to the silent altar and call me
But don't forget the machines
'Cause if your choice is chipping it down on the M1
Then you'll wake up in the morning
We got the power to be loving each other
No matter what happens
We've got the power to do that
We got the power to be
Ringing the great bell out there above us
We got the power to do that"
