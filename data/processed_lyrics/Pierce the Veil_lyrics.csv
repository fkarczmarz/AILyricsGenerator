lyrics
"In the dead of the dark  would it even exist?
Or is it hard to tell you treat me like a cheap motel sometimes?
But nevertheless  I was prepared to die
For that thing in your chest  fuck your money
I fantasize about those nights you held me down
And sewed your lips to mine
Now I miss the pain sometimes in this so-called life
There wеre shortcuts into heaven through your еyes
We emptied our wrists on the dotted line
Now I stay on my side of the city
A refugee  no MTV
Oh well  thank God for THC
There were shortcuts into heaven through your eyes
Da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da
Da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da

Now I
Yeah I miss the pain sometimes  in this so-called life
There were shortcuts into heaven through your eyes
(Ba ba)
Am I the taste that you watered down
Or am I the dust on your candy?
You wash me off  then spit me out
I kissed the scars on her skin
I still think you're beautiful
And I don't ever want to lose my best friend
Bring her back or take me with her
I wanna see what sound it makes
I hate this flavor with a passion
And I fucking hate the aftertaste
How does it feel? (How does it feel?)
The chemicals will bring you home again
Pretend like I don't entice you
I've seen you circling the sky above my head
You traitor! I will never be taken for granted again
(Keep digging holes in the desert)

We will bring the tidal wave
We will bring the tidal wave
We will bring the tidal wave
We will bring the tidal wave
We will bring the tidal wave
We will bring the tidal wave
We will bring the tidal wave and nothing will remain
She's mine
Until she's satisfied
The chemicals will bring you home again
Go!
And whenever you're breezing through
Keep tearing my world apart
She fell victim to a violent wave
And died on the jagged rocks
But don't believe
It's a never-ending summer
'Cause they don't exist
Tied around your tongue in all
The rage and spit
So why am I the one falling apart?
'Cause you don't even know you're an angel
Foolish am I for the times I come and go
And sleep inside your worn-in bed outline
Splash over your body while you drown on me
Of our sober demise
To the young and without type (Oh-oh-oh)
You smiled dressed in Coppertone tan lines

So long
Let's go and play those games you like
Let's go and play those games you like
(Oh)
But don't believe
'Cause yesterday I found her with her
Clothes still wet
Crying in the shower on her
Why the fuck am I falling apart?
'Cause you don't even know you're an angel
Foolish am I for the times I come and go
And sleep inside your worn-in bed
And it woke me up like a heart attack
(You know the only real way to cure pain is to add a little more)
(Because everything new distracts the old)
A violin with no hands plays
Symphonies with no words (With no words)
A drowning boy with no voice prays
Someone up there's telling me
You'd better not get back up
I spit my heart into this red cup
And she said
I woke up without a single drop
I told myself
I'm tired of holding up your backup plans
Go down your list and be satisfied
If all you have is not enough
(True love comes from more than just the heart)
She said paint a picture on me
Throw your dress up and your heart away
These strangers at the party never paid
And if that doesn't turn you on
I'll keep talking 'til something does

I'm tired of holding up your backup plans
Go down your list and be satisfied
It's all you have
And until that day (That day)
Red rose of the dead
How does it feel to breathe oxygen inside her head?
Said you just got fired and you don't have a backup plan
So don't expect me to understand
A diamond bullet and a gun made of gold
(We all break down)
Sometimes the bedroom walls become my only friends
But they were there from beginning to end
(There from beginning to end)
I'm tired of holding up your backup plans
Go down your list and be satisfied
It's all you have
You know I've never held a gun in my life
But now I carry one around in case I see you tonight
(Hate)
 into the wasted nights
 but now I sleep alone
 I'm gonna break my wrists (Break my wrists)
 I'm gonna join right in
 but I'm barely hanging on
 I'm barely hanging on
 but you're the one who shot me
 I can barely say your name
 I'll try to write it and fill the pen with blood from the sink
 oh
 but I'm barely hanging on
 I'm barely hanging on
 but tear my voice apart
I count your heartbeats before you sleep?
I bite my fingernails to bone
And now I crawl back under the stairwell
To a place I call my home
I really hope you enjoy the show
You need people like me to feel
Maybe we're just having too much fun
Maybe you can't handle yourself
Staring at me with your lips and tongue
You'll never know
I don't know where I'm going to sleep tonight
She said hotels are cheap and there's one down the street
Maybe we're just having too much fun
Maybe you can't handle yourself
Staring at me with your lips and tongue

And if I mean anything to you

Staring at me with your lips and tongue
I've been having this dream that we can fly
'Cause you're about to miss everything
(About to miss everything)
About to miss everything
There ain't a thing that you can do that's gonna ruin my night
(But there's just something about)
This dizzy dreamer and her bleeding little blue boy
Licking your fingers like you're done and
You've decided there is so much more than me (oh)
I brought a gun and as the preacher tried to stop me
Hold my heart it's beating for you anyway
What if I can't forget you? (oh)
I'll burn your name into my throat
I'll be the fire that'll catch you
What's so good about picking up the pieces?
None of the colors ever light up anymore in this hole
Oh
Nobody prays for the heartless (No!)
Nobody gives another penny for the selfish

You can't just throw me away!

I'd better learn to live alone
What's so good about picking up the pieces?
What's so good about
What's so good about
Everyone is watching you
Told you why I see no need for the sun
(I've found a reason to say)
A love you light is a love soon gone
When every vein is red out of the blue
I held a diamond to the sun
To count the moments on account of the way you
But I still hold your breath so you won't leave
Pastel-red and porn star-white
Say that the night sings alone
Raise my hands
At the thought of you leaving me alone
Don't torture me or beg me
Can you make me believe in tiring?

Of the slow symphonies behind me
(They sing along)
All the nightmares you'll see tomorrow
All the stars on your ceiling
You pretend to close your eyes  don't breathe in
Pieces of candy and leaks of light (Leaks of light  light)
Paint the floor 'round me  then without hesitating (Hesitating)
You took my hand and then we both started running
Both started running  there's no place to go
Another bullet and we both started running
Both started running too (Whoa-oh-ooh-whoa-oh)
Save yourself  don't ever look back (Whoa-oh)
Nowhere to go and so we both spin around in circles (Circles)
Whoa-oh-oh-ooh-whoa-oh
Creeping through these labyrinths
I find another dead end to the weekend  but is this real life?
Paper hearts turned ash begin to fly (Over our heads  I begin)
Screaming while the exit signs read Heaven's waiting
You took my hand and then we both started running
Both started running  there's no place to go
Another bullet and we both started running

What a shame I heard the understudy died under the knife
Crying backwards under bedroom lights
The operation  congratulations
I don't think you'll ever want to love me
You'd better listen to your doctor  doctor
Sober up and bury the empty cup
In a backyard of Seattle  we used to lie
When I sew you up
Don't let me stop bleeding
Tiny stitches that you placed into my skin
And they're ruining the mood
So I'll toast every beat of my heart like a miracle
And I don't think you'll ever want to love me

The moment you've all been waiting for
Tonight  join us as we explore the spine-chilling mystery of death!
And the miracle of resurrection!
Please understand me when I'd rather see you dead
Than live without me  so thirsty for more
Beyond the sea blue light  I met the love of my life
She'd rather see me dead than face me
I'm in love  but not for long
Our operation  call off the operation
Another wave has turned its back on me
Crashed back on the eyes of the first I see
Can't count on anything (If your delicate eyes don't blink someday)
For you  I'd count the salt under the sea (They might as well be gone)
 now we're fast and light

 I drank the poison and then I passed the fuck out
 we can travel through time

Blow the smoke through the hole in my chest
Still choking on the bed
Found your waste while the ember red
Keeps falling down and burning holes
Until the pillow and the mattress glow
Now I wanna be the tattoo ink
That swims down through the needle in your skin
And I wish I was poisonous
Like a bottomless sound  like a violent drug
Do you remember the knife I kept?
The sharper it got  the more you wanted me to use it
I was lying to you (Oh)  but you were lying too
So what's left to do?
What's left to say?
Stop making friends  just us
I'll decompose with you
So light the fuse inside your brain and we
We will detonate (Yeah)
You threw your drink at the wall
It started raining wine and glass so
Stay and warm me with the Gentlemen Jack
Gold locks on the cage  turn your diamond keys
Open the door  you'll see me digging out my getaway
Hang the stars
Who pulled the pin out of my heart?

We're only dreaming  what's your problem baby?
Don't mean to break your heart

In area code six-six-six  oh

Does not mean I will waste my time

Nothing can stop them
Nothing

I know that it's not safe here
You did this to yourself but have no fear
Than learning to enjoy again
Hope you get the message
Nobody's shatter-resistant (Shit)

 but I don't remember what we talked about
 that's a waste of time
I close my eyes and take a breath real slow
But what's the difference when you beg for love?
'Cause I run through glass in the street
Kerosene hearts carry the name that my father gave me
And take the face of the wolf
I met a girl who never looked so alone
Like sugar water in your mouth lukewarm
She tied a cherry stem for me with her tongue
We fell in love and now we're both alone
'Cause I don't need any more friends
And another kiss like a fire on pavement
We'll burn it down 'til the end

Paralyze me
One million branches and she loves everyone
Mom and dad  did you search for me?
I've been up here so long  I'm going crazy
And as the sun went down
We ended up on the ground
I heard the train shake the windows
You screamed over the sound
And as we own this night
I put your body to the test with mine
This love was out of control
Been in a touring band for going on ten years
I only said it 'cause I know what it's like to feel burned out
It gets you down  we've all been there sometimes
But tonight  I'll make you feel beautiful once again
And as the sun went down
We ended up on the ground
I heard the train shake the windows

I'll draw the shades and close the door
Everything's not alright and I would rather
And as the sun went down
We ended up on the ground
I heard the train shake the windows
You screamed over the sound
And as we own this night
I put your body to the test with mine
This love was out of control
Put me next to the open window  promise me a second time
Cause I don't wanna leave without you buried by my side
I'd rather kill the one responsible for falling stars at night
Cause they fall all around me
The night can be deadly
And they'll never take us alive
(Can you chase away the darkness?)
To live and love and die
Last night she recited every reason she's fine
So if we're heading there together at the same time
You sing while I drive
Move like a fugitive tonight
Dance on the ambulance
Cause I'd rather spend my life  vacations
In bed with you like drunken summer kites
And this is only a test
Sober and scaring me to death
They'll never take us alive

Would somebody make me go blind for the rest of my life

I join the party for the recently blind
So if we're heading there together you can sing all night
I'm gonna tear out the thread one by one from your skin
Till your bones feel embarrassed from all the attention
Tried  but the taste of blood remains (Taste of blood remains)
Cold  empty mattresses and falling stars
My  how they start to look the same
So keep in happiness and torture me
While I tell you Let's go in style
A million hooks around  a million ways to die
Darling  it's cold outside
No  no more eyes to see the sun (To see the sun)
You slide into bed while I get drunk
Slow conversations with a gun mean more
Than I've ever said to anyone  anyone

While I tell you Let's go in style”
A million hooks around  a million ways to die
But last night
You said you ended up in Palm Springs dancing on tables
Almost fought some bitch at the club (Yeah!)
Got kicked out of your hotel and lost your shoes
You're just another set of bones to lay to rest
I guess it's time to say goodnight
Hope you had a really good time

But last night
I bet you never had a Friday night like this
Red for the drink that's mixed with suicide
Everything red
Please won't you push me for the last time?
Let's scream until there's nothing left
The thought of you's no fuckin' fun

We'll start a new revolution now
Now!
Now terror begins inside a bloodless vein
I was just a product of the street youth rage
Born in this world without a voice or say
Caught in the spokes with an abandoned brain
Blow the smoke in diamond shape

Imagine livin' like a king someday
A single night without a ghost in the walls

Your face is the first thing I see
The first time I've seen love
And the last I'll ever need
You remind her that your future would be nothing without her
Better think of something good to say
But it's all been done more than once
So I'll keep on trying
No! At the top of our lungs
When second chances won't leave you alone
Then there's faith in love
She was always the one
I'll repeat it again—the one
No such thing as too young
Red lights flash in the car we're kissing in
Call me crazy
I've always tried to remind her that the future's
Just a few heartbeats away from disaster
I'm afraid that I've thrown it all away

May the poison set me free
But this is just me disguised as me
I'm the killer who burned your home
This home
What the fuck is this home?

I'm painting houses for the rich old folks
I'm gonna make a million dollars
For diamonds and gold

I've broken bones for you

Sat on the couch under the chandeliers
You said you're having a baby and before I could cry
You're leaving me just when I thought you were mine
But I don't see your face
Taken by the one-hearted race
I got a hell of a plan
Failing lights amass one hundred sleepless nights
And I might be holding on too tight
But there's a beast in my heart and he won't let you leave alive
Nightmares no longer wait for sleep (No!)

Just like a lion and you're the queen of the pride

Thoughts in your head that will never die
So don't you forget what we had
It's like I was never even there
Sink until you're unimpaired
Slow motion like a rolling eye
We can hear you loud and clear

I set fires ablaze inside
And stepped into the light to blind you

Devoured while the walls grow hands and teeth
I cried and listened to the rain in a rental car
But now I don't know what to say
Shall I deny my lungs their breathing rights?
Your beat's too obvious
But I don't even care anymore
I won't pay for sanity 'cause I don't wanna know

Come at me with everything you've got
Burst into flames  scream in the dark
I'm gonna light up this place and die in beautiful stars tonight
Does it even make a difference?
When I'm sober  I feel pain
As we run under the stars through cemetery backyards
Celebrate the way the night hides scars
So dance if it moves you
Jump in the fire if it burns you
I'll throw my arms around you  darling
And we'll turn to ashes  drown me in the flames

Scream in the dark!
I'm gonna light up this place and die in beautiful stars!
But if these demons keep falling from the sky  (It's alright)
'Cause sometimes I love the way you swing the blade at everything in sight!
Separate me from my own two hands  I've killed so many times
But I can't save the world from the creatures that don't die
I need you here right now
I'm crying in the water so you don't hear the sound
Burst into flames (What do you do when you're out of time?)
Scream in the dark (Where do you go when they're right outside?)
Gonna light up this place (And how do you scream when there's no one around?)
(No one around?)
And I will be the only light
You get away with whatever you want
What are you bitching about?
Well  all I'm saying is that if I ever start referring to these
As the best years of my life
Remind me to kill myself
When the wildfire is over
And everything is gone
Incinerate my tires
While we race into the wide open
See  I don't really wanna think about it
Or how it all went wrong
Houston  there's a problem
Someone sucked out all the sun
But I'm  I'm better tonight
Don't waste that hand
Non-operational for anything else
You're jealous of my resilience

When the royal crown is gone
And everything is ours
Regenerate that kind of power
Reserved for the Marvel Gods
See  I've been coming to the realization
That all you do is shine
Black lights to my problems
Swallow dirt  you rotten swine
But I'm better tonight
Don't waste that hand
Non-operational for anything else
You're jealous of my resilience
And it's odd that I've
Been running into spider webs at night
And it's odd that I

I'm better tonight
Don't waste that hand
Non-operational for anything else
Jealous of my resilience
My resilience
As you cry in silver rings and pose
In a second you'll be high and in the clouds alone (Alone)
I never thought I'd see the day
But I see stars around your face
This was never my intention after all
We're made to destroy
Tell me what you want until it hurts
I'll hang myself in lights and I will glow for you
Spinning on this circus ride
You're further than you've ever been
I think we're in over our heads
I can't deny it's getting worse
Go back home

'Til fireworks and palm trees almost look alike
She looks up to me and whispers
I won't be here in a year
So I take the long road
To think and wonder why
I can't sleep with all this sunlight
If there's still evidence of us
Why can't that be enough?
I don't mean to drag you down
You taste just like you always do
I'd give anything just to surround your dreams
Oh-oh-oh
The envy of the dead
The sound of scissors and sleep
I can't believe you dreamed
And pulled all of your clothes off
You're not supposed to drink
With what's inside your purse
I'm guiding your chin to my lips
Using only my fingertips

And everything fades away
The stars awake
Is there a train
That travels back to yours at 5 AM
Or are we walking?
Car alarms and leaves that blow
They're calling out our names
But it's gone too far
Your butane mouth
Will spit me into flames
Why!?
I'm an anarchist in love
And I forgot to call you
I can't break you down while I
Think about honey and the sweet New York sounds
Why!?
The temperature rises to this boiling heat
The chlorine and wine found

As Saturday burns away
Why!?
I'm not a kid anymore
Back in the days when I was young
I'm not a kid anymore
It's cold but you pretend that you are warm with me
Before I get you home you're nearly frozen
But I'll never let you freeze without me
Through stained glass eyes and colorful tears
I cherish my American girl
She holds them down while I destroy the world
Now we live like we should

I've been inside your bedroom a thousand years
That I want you in the most unromantic ways
A penny in the couch and a diamond ring
'Cause I need them to carry me
And you can listen to glass hearts shattering
I don't know how you get into me
Down my throat and made a home in my veins
They used to be the rivers that would take us away
Now you only call me every Christmas and my birthday
I still can't believe how you look next to me
Just like a strip club bedroom scene
'Cause I need them to carry me
And you can listen to something that you've never heard before

 don't you say that had a part of it?

 I'll never wander again
 oh
 no no no no
 great escape
 yeah
Can you tell that story? It's my favorite one
These stupid states of mind
Everyone punishing me all the time (Why?)
But don't cross your boundaries and think that it's cool
Misguided by darkness and lost on the road
But I'm such a sucker for the rain
Here we are
Crashing once again into the center of your moonlit face
Our caved in ribs
And our lips are letting go
As we laid on the side of the road (Go!)
Pull the trigger tight and watch our distances explode (Explode)

It feels so early but I promised I would bring you to your door
Now our lips are numb as we walk sharing warm alcohol
That kiss tastes like summer
I hope you like the stars I stole for you
One hundred million twinkle lights in neon blue
I'll be the brightest someday
I'll be the brightest someday
Don't rain on my parade
It's gonna glow in the dark
I like it better when you can't keep warm
The boy on the blue moon dreams of sun
(Now as the rain)
Now as the rain falls like shattered pieces of glass from the sky
We bleed like water colors and drunken pastels down the stairways
When will it end? And who fucking cares?

I pretended everything was fine
I'd rather be dead

Look into my eyes and look at the words you say
Blood on your tongue with a crass embrace
I found a kiss on the day we met and said
This will be a night we won't forget
Speak slow now  I don't want to miss when you cry
Glass over diamond blue eyes
And it's good enough to make me wanna fall in love
So move a little bit closer  hear the sound of your voice
We're screaming  Why can't we just be friends?
It's not that easy  but it's half of the fun
To see you throw the first punch now
Such a shame you had to go and run your mouth
Life is what you make it  but at least I've got real friends
Can you hear me now  now that I'm a big star?
Fuck you and your new love for yourself

Sparks over your carpet while I chase you through the darkness

I was biting the curb
Your sick entertainment
But I'll bet it feels good when you're coming down
Can't bear to wash out the wasted time
