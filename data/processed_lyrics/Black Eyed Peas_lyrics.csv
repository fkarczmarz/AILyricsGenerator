lyrics
"Children hurtin'  I hear them cryin'
Can you practice what you preachin'?
Would you turn the other cheek again?
Can we all just get along?
Send some guidance from above
'Cause people got me  got me questioning
(Where's the love)
(Where's the love)
Yo  people living like they ain't got no mommas
(Where's the love)
I think they all distracted by the drama and attracted to the trauma  mama
(Where's the love)
I think they don't understand the concept or the meaning of karma
(Where's the love)
(Where's the love?)
Over here on the streets  the police shoot
The people put the bullets in 'em
(Where's the love?)
But if you only got love for your own race
(Where's the love?)
Then you're gonna leave space for others to discriminate
(Where's the love?)
See Black Eyed Peas LiveGet tickets as low as $42You might also like
And to discriminate only generates hate
And when you hate  then you're bound to get irate
Madness is what you demonstrate
And that's exactly how hate works and operates
Man  we gotta set it straight
Take control of your mind  just meditate
And let your soul just gravitate to the love
So the whole world celebrate it
People killin' people dyin'
Children hurtin'  I hear them cryin'
Can you practice what you preachin'?
Would you turn the other cheek again?
Can't we all just get along? (Mmh)
Send some guidance from above
'Cause people got me  got me questioning
(Where's the love?)
It just ain't the same  old ways have changed
(Where's the love?)
New days are strange  is the world insane?
(Where's the love?)
Nation droppin' bombs killing our little ones
(Where's the love?)
Ongoing suffering as the youth die young
(Where's the love?)
Where's the love when a child gets murdered  or a cop gets knocked down?
Black lives  not now
Everybody matter to me  all races
Y'all don't like what I'm sayin'? Haterade  tall cases
Everybody hate somebody  guess we all racist
Black Eyed Peas do a song about love and y'all hate this
All these protest with different colored faces
We was all born wit' a heart  why we gotta chase it?
And every time I look around
Every time I look up  every time I look down
No one's on a common ground
(Where's the love?)
And if you never speak truth  then you never know how love sounds
(Where's the love?)
(Where's the love?)
Where's the love y'all? I don't  I don't know
Where's the truth y'all? I don't know
People killin' people dyin'
Children hurtin'  you hear them cryin'
Could you practice what you preach?
Would you turn the other cheek?
Send some guidance from above
Cause people got me  got me questioning
(Where's the love  where's the love)
Love is the key
(Where's the love?)
Love is the answer
(Where's the love?)
Love is the solution
(Where's the love?)
They don't want us to love
(Where's the love?)
Love is powerful
(Where's the love?)
My mama asked me why I never vote  never vote
Cause policemen want me dead and gone  dead and gone
And the weed man still sellin' dope  oh no
Somebody gotta give these niggas hope  please hope
All he ever wanted was a smoke  my gosh
Said he can't breathe with his hands in the air
Layin' on the ground died from a choke (Where's the love?)
I feel the weight of the world on my shoulders
As I'm gettin' older y'all people gets colder
Most of us only care about money makin'
Selfishness got us followin' the wrong direction
Wrong information always shown by the media
Negative images is the main criteria
Infecting the young minds faster than bacteria
Kids wanna act like what they see in the cinemas
What happened to the love and the values of humanity?
(Where's the love?)
What happened to the love and the fairness and equality?
(Where's the love?)
Instead of spreading love we're spreading animosity
(Where's the love?)
Lack of understanding leading us away from unity
I wanna let you know how I feel
And it's true that I love you
And it's true  you're the only one
And I do  I adore you
And it's true  girl
You make me feel alive
You make me feel alive
You make me feel alive
You make me feel alive
You say  you say  you say that I'm the only one
You say that I'm your number one
Now you're gone  and I feel numb
Tell me where did we go wrong
You were my best friend  then boyfriend
Now it seems like you're my worst friend
I gotta do soul searching
Without you I'm a whole different person
I ain't acting like I used to
I don't feel loved like I used to
It was your love I was used to
Why did I have to lose
Your love  your love  your love?
Your love is what it was
That had me feeling buzzed
You are my true love

Hey  girl  you're the only one
Supposed to be my number one
Now you're gone  I feel so numb
Tell me how did we go wrong
First friends  then we became best friends
Used to be my girlfriend  now you're my worst friend
Yeah  I gotta do a little soul searching
Without you I'm a whole different person
I don't even act like I was used to
I don't even feel loved like I used to
I guess it's your love that I'm used to
Damn  I feel bad I had to lose you
I got so many things I wanna say
I guess this mean that I'm missing you
Sorry for the things that I did to you
I'm so lost without you
And it's true that I love you
And it's true  you're the only one
And I do  I adore you
And it's true  girl
You make me feel alive
You make me feel alive

La di di di  da di di di  da la la la
And it's true  girl
You make me feel alive
You make me feel alive

So easy to fall in love with you
And all the things that you do
Baby girl  you're so remarkable
So special  so wonderful
So special  so wonderful
So special  so wonderful
Baby girl  you're so remarkable
Turn around and bitch slap somebody
Anxieties bash my mind in
Terrorizing my soul like Bin Laden
Shackled and chained
My soul feels stained
I can't explain got an itch on my brain
Lately my whole aim is to maintain
And regain control of my mainframe
My bloods boiling its beatin' out propane
My train of thoughts more like a runaway train
I'm in a fast car drivin' in a fast lane
In the rain and I might just hydroplane
I don't fear none of my enemies
And I don't fear bullets from Uzi's
I've been dealing with something that's worse than these
That'll make you fall to your knees and that's
The anxiety
The sane and the insane rivalry
Paranoia's brought me to my knees
Take away my anxiety
The sane and the insane rivalry
Paranoia's brought me to my knees
Take away my anxiety

Gotta get myself back now
Tell my enemy is my own
Gots to find my inner wealth
Gots to hold up my thoughts
Emotions are trapped set on lock
Got my brain stuck goin through the motions
Only I know what's up
I'm filled up with pain
Tryin' to gain my sanity
And its weighin' me down
Knees to the ground
I don't fear none of my enemies
And I don't fear bullets from Uzi's

Paranoia's brought me to my knees
Everyone from Oregon to Melbourne
That the funk phenomenon has been reborn and transformed
You coulda sworn that you wasn't warned 'cause we was
Trapped in the box that rap had spawned
It was a square until we kicked it to an octagon
We gotten strong from the pain it's undergone
Whereupon we kill the beat when the mic ain't on
That's my motherfuckin' procedure
I'm cold with the flow I will freeze ya
I'm the emperor  I'm Caesar
Can somebody tell me where the MCs are?
I violate over guitars  annihilate and operate like I'm on ER
Lyrically gang bang 'cause I'm behind bars
And rearrange DNA  play like God
I bring it back
Back to life  back to life
Back to life  back to life
Back to life  back to life
Back to life  back to life
Send a million decibels of sound through your physical
Alligator ritual turns out it was the visual
Proficient with the lyrical  a vision like a miracle
Damage all you mumblin' MCs rhyming 'bout decimal
Increasing no residual  why you still remain minimal
Do not try to bite because my shit is not edible
Rhyme unforgettable like Nat King Cole
You can feel it on your neck like you in a chokehold
Unfold the mystery  unload the BEP
Bangin' on your speakers while you haters wait impatiently
What would be the next step? Next move on set?
Betting that it's over  but we haven't even started yet
Resurrect the bitch and bring it back like this

Face to the flo'  gonna hit 'em with the payload
MOAB got 'em runnin' like Usain Bolt
Started lowdown  now I'm in they download
Slice through you slo-mo's like a Lambo
Runnin' through these levels like I'm playing with a cheat code
Stop  roll back on my dope shit
Pablo  white Esco mine shinin' like I'm Destro
Back to life with this death manifesto
(Back to life)
Fat boy had a nigga makin' noise 'til midnight
Then that 'gac poison and got us a fist fight
Hat low in a Regal  crack sold in that diesel
Can't afford a funeral never
Mortician have your man face lookin' like leather
Have you walkin' out the wake shook and shiverin'
Lookin' so different from when he was just livin' man
Another 40-side killin'  man
North side in the sixteenth building and
I'm on the corporate side  still pull off a New York walk by
Keep tryin' talk fly
I talk fly  verbalize a pilot
Poetic fertilizer that's lyrical shit
Hip-hop die but we resurrect it
Yeah bring it back  that mystic linguistic
Bring it back

Reassemblin' bringing it back with the pen  yeah
It all depends how I be feelin' when I descend
I'm prolly gonna go Kamikaze like Eminem
Look at them tremblin' when I stomp in Timberlan'
Boots  I come through and scoop you feminine
Vibration  we penetratin' your skeleton
Reanimation we bringin' it back again
Son of a bitch  they wanna take what I made from nothin'
Then the struggle to erase any proof that I came from sufferin'
Now they hate I survived every trick by hustlin'
Get your whole family hogtied
Nigga  you small fries
And you never should have started beef
You know I can't fall back like Ferrari seats
Strap with the fully  dutch full of bud
I'm on that Hpnotiq and Goose
And I ain't gotta shoot
Be nice
Be nice
Be nice
I just wanna be happy
I don't wanna feel nasty
I'm tryna turn my vibration around so I can feel fantastic
I'm talking to myself in the mirror
Everyone around got tears of a clown
And it's so cold like Siberia
But I do not want negative energy
The love you give is the love you get
So be nice and change your life

If we could all just find a way to fly away

Better beware  spiritual warfare
Spread the love  northern and southern hemisphere

Don't be upset when B-E-P out

Around the globe that's just how we go

Ladies dancing to the jam  acting naughty  man  oh man
Got me in the mood again  after-party partying
Yeah  I keep it happening  taking shots whatever  man
Party like a veteran  music is my medicine
You won't find me settling  can't be stopped  I'm steppin' in
Keep it going till the end  yeah  that's right  here we go again
I'm that one that lights it up  we red-hot like firetrucks
Burn that book cause that's whassup  tell that DJ turn it up
We dropping  that music  for people all around
Keep rocking  head knocking  cause they can't shut us down
And ain't no stoppin'  we gon' keep on rocking
Baby  ain't no stoppin'  you can not stop us now
I ain't gonna stop until I'm done (Don't stop it)
I ain't gonna quit until I've won
Now  baby  don't you stop it  stop it

Big old house and an alligator

He's singing songs about material things
And platinum rings and watches that go bling
But diamonds don't bling in the dark
'Cause his fans can't relate to his newfound art
He ain't doin' what he did from the start
And that's putting in some feeling and thought
He decided to live his life shallow
Cash in his love for material
And it's gone

Question for the ages: What's going on with my rap pages?
Rappers wanna be down  but listen-listen
You got to feel it within your body and your spirit
When you listen to the rhythm  come on
It's the Abstract  Will is on the beat
Change your history  categories
Different people in the same territories
Hip-hop in the form of Black Eyed Peas
'Cause they gonna rumble and shake the ground
Break atoms  break a sound
Thunder and bass'll pound streets with the things profound
If you wanna do to help you out
Make it cool around your friends without smoking now
Play the song kinda loud  it can help you out
It's like that  and a—

From El Segundo to Toronto
I once hit a girl up in Chicago
But I'd never say who unless my name was Tonto
Yup  you know how the date rape go
Kobe showed the classic example
Now they know the Peas collect the dough
So they knocking on our door like we Wells Fargo
Yup  they see me in a Will.I.Am suit
But I wasn't that cute when I didn't have the loot
And I don't smoke herbs  but I'm still real nice with the verbs

On the mic somebody might get killed
So many dead rappers there's a cypher in heaven
When this Brooklyn MC come after you
You be running like a herd o'cattle down Myrtle Avenue
To be at Fight Club  even Brad had to crack a tooth
Stare into the Sun  they try to copy
Let your eyes get used to the light because you gotta watch me
Sneak up on you like Sake
My lyrics get out a split atoms like Hiroshima and Nagasaki
It's the apl.de.ap in the lab with the rap
Demonstrate how we act  we attack any track
It's the Black Eyed Peas  and we back with the facts
Start with the fat skills that rose in the past
We got it like how you know how to beast rocks
Entertain you  see you soon at the next spot
The crew got you bouncing and dropping your eye
Making nah hot shish and be shocking them out
Tss tsss tsss  I'mma roll with the hot
I'mma flow from the soul when you can't hold me back
Ke-ke-keep on  keep on rolling the track
I'ma simply  simply always attach
Jeepny music from by apl.de.ap

What does it cost to let a nigga breathe?
They robbed you blind and knowledge is a crime
This shit's designed to keep you on a grind
Rise and shine 'cause now it's the time
We all God body if you open up your mind
(Wake up!)
Revolution time has come
Tell the people here come the storm
(Wake up!)
Revolution time has come
Pt.3
Is out there and plotting those plans
To stop me and put me in a hospital bed
I'm down with Jesus and I roll with apostles
You cannot penetrate me with the hate
We got that good vibration on vibrate
Stay on that way up 'cause we elevate
That's the motherfucking gospel
That's the motherfucking gospel
The movement's unstoppable
So I sit back and listen to audio
We Zulu-kill zombies in chronicles
We ain't falling 'cause we ain't dominoes
That's the motherfucking gospel
That's the motherfucking gospel

Livin' in the streets
Street livin'  caught in the trap
Guns or books  sell crack or rap
Be like kings or be like pawns
They called us coons  now they call us cons
Street niggas be packing pistols
Terrorists be blasting missiles
Crips and Bloods and retail thugs
CIA planes bring Colombian drugs in
Don't push me 'cause I'm close to hell
The teachers in my neighborhood can hardly spell
And compared to them  prison guards get paid well
Ten years no bail is four years at Yale
So  forget about the statue of General Lee
Because the status of blacks are generally
Gonna end up in some penitentiary
Systematically  that's how they made it to be
Listen  they derailed the soul train
And put a nightmare in every Martin Luther King
And privatized prisons are owned by the same
Slave masters that owned the slave trade game
And racists no longer have to be racist
'Cause niggas kill more niggas than the KKK did
Now  every time I hear a new def jam
Niggas killing niggas like they Ku Klux Klan
I understand what's a nigga to choose?
Be the killer or be the dead dude in the news
I get it  what's a nigga to do?
No education in the hood got a nigga confused

Double cross love lost no religion

Another cop got off with no charge
If you black in the hood  you at large
You're guilty until you prove you're innocent
If you're ivory  they treat you different
If you're ebony  they assume your temperament
Will be vigilant and they call you militant
And you'll get shot and they'll say the incident
Is 'cause you're belligerent  what a coincidence?
Born and bred but you're still an immigrant
And if you ain't dead  you gon' see imprisonment
There's more niggas in the prisons than there ever was slaves cotton picking
There's more niggas that's rotting in the prisons than there ever was slaves cotton picking
So  how we gon' get up out the trap?
Guns or books  sell crack or rap
Street livin'  hustle or hoops
Guns or books  get shot or shoot
Street livin'  ain't no rules
Break the law  make the breakin' news
The life you choose could be the life you lose
Niggas getting stuck for them Nike shoes
Street livin'  ain't no joke
It's a cold world  better bring your coat
Revoke 'cause the streets are broke
And now they wanna take away our dreams and hopes
Street livin'  no economics
No way out of the Reaganomics
Infected by the black plague  new bubonic
No comprende  we speak ebonics

You can get fucked by the system

We don't want war  imagine if any prophet was alive
In current days amongst you and I
You think they would view life like you and I do?
Or would they sit and contemplate on why
Do we live this way  act and behave this way?
We still live in primitive today
‘Cause the peace in the destination of war can't be the way

Why do we keep missing the point on our mission?
Why do we keep killing each other  what's the reason?
God made us all equal in His vision
I wish that I could make music as a religion
Then we could harmonize together in this mission

But two of us could help an’ rearrange this curse
Utilize all the power in our voices
Together we will unite and make the right choice
And fight for education  save the next generation

Rentin' or you leasin' or you buyin' on your own and
You either smilin' or you frownin'
You either serious or clownin'
You either swimmin' or you drownin'
Standin' in the valley or you towerin' the mountain
You either lazy or you hustlin'
Practice honest business or you shady and you fuckin' 'em
You either hatin' or you lovin' them
Smilin' or you huggin' or your anger mean muggin' 'em
You either first or behind
You either comin' late or you're showin' up on time
You got vision or you blind
Make up your mind
Are you ready on the right? Yes
Ready on the left? Yes
Ready on the right? Yes
Are you ready?
Two plus one is three
One plus two is three
One plus one plus one is three
I wanna go back to yesterday
I wanna go back to yesterday

Yesterday
We going back to the front  give them what they want
Back to the past  retro glass
Back to the leader  back to reviews
Take 'em back to the future  take 'em to the true school
Cause we was breaking atoms  live at the barbeque
Now we reminiscing  pumping Audio Two
Listening to niggas  niggas with them attitudes
Apl was a Black Sheep screaming out
You can get with this or you can get with that
Smoke emcees  or you could smoke crack
You can sell dope  or you can sell raps
I sell dope raps cause that's where it's at
Now I'm back on the scene  crispy and clean
Hip hop fiend  Source Magazine
World Famous is the Supreme Team
SP-1200 drum machine
Hail to Latifah  she be the queen
DMC and Run be the kings
King of Rock! My nigga Ice-T killed a cop
And we be to rap what key be to lock
I'm cool like that  I'm cool like that
I move like that because I'm smooth like that
I rap like that because I'm phat like that
I rock like that because I got it like that
And I'm ill like that  skilled like that
Phil-i-ppines  cause I feel like that
I'm real like that  yes  I'm chill like that
You gots to chill
I got pounds and pounds of peas  you know
I'm not Large Professor but I'm an extra pro
Punks jump up to punk rock'n'roll
The Master P-nut is a pistachio
The Peas peak past the pinnacle plateau
Posses a fresh Porsche  I don't push Peugeot
Packing out paper in a pass I was pulled
Get paid to rock mics and used to call the show
Check the flow yo  'cause this retro
It's my classic mani-fucking-festo
Lyrically  I'm magic  fucking presto
Insuring hip-hop like gecko
Making sure it won't stop  baby  heck no
That's a what  that's a what  the scenario
Reminiscing while I listen to the stereo
See Black Eyed Peas LiveGet tickets as low as $42You might also like
I reminisce  I reminisce

When it's sounding like this
Downtown  go round

Shimmy shimmy ya  shimmy yam  shimmy yay
Comment allez-vous  parlez vous francais?
Adiós  motherfuckers  bon voyage
Home of the liquid flows and Liquid Swords
Black-Eyed Killer Peas on the swarm
Coming to your college and disco dorm
Y'all can't touch my skills
I can switch it up  Das EFX  and get iggity-iggity-ill
Yiggity-yes  rapper  my style is unique
Iggity-ice on my teeth so it's cold when I speak
Word to mom  I'm in my own world
Galaxy rays! Powerful
I wanna go back to yesterday
I wanna go back to yesterday
I wanna go back to yesterday
So I can hit you with the bass  how low can you go?
I get lower than a midget doing limbo
I got shit that you haven't heard a while ago
'88-'92 the style'll go
Way back  rocking on the A-track
Memorex  TDK  all of that
Throwback before all the Nazareth
Willy is his name and the boy's coming
Straight Outta L.A! A crazy motherfucker named Willy
I'm so cold  my flow stay chilly
I got a laser aimed at them haters
And I'm cutting motherfuckers with my razor
You too  boy  if you fuck with me
I'ma dice you up  slice you up quickly
I signed to Ruthless when Dre dropped Dre Day
That's why I do this  to bring you back to yesterday
(Yesterday  yesterday  yesterday)
Tiger style
There's no place to hide as I step inside the room
Dr. Doom  prepare for the boom
You fucking with will.i.am!
Cause I'm torching and scorching  my style is awesome
Cracking motherfuckers' skulls like it's porcelain
Aiyyo  let's save hip hop from Dr. Kevorkian
Bring it right here  right back to its origin
Aiyyo  I'ma hop in my motherfucking DeLorean
So I can go back and fucking perform again
Aiyyo  I did some windmills on some fucking linoleum
MC mic controlling them  I was like
(Woop-woop!) I was steady policing them
Killing emcees  I was straight deceasing them
(Woop-woop!) Compute-deleting them 'til them niggas don't exist
Because Black Eyes Peas is hard as hell!
Battle anybody  I don't care if you tell
I excel! They all fail!
I told them motherfuckers I'mma take them—
Back to yesterday
I'm taking you back to yesterday
I'm taking you back to yesterday
I'm taking you back to yesterday
I took you back to yesterday
I took you back to yesterday
I took you back to yesterday
I took you back to yesterday
And now I'm taking you to the future
I'm taking you to the future
I'm taking you to the future
I'm taking you to the future
I'm taking you to the future
Taking you to the future
Take you to the future
Take you to the future"
