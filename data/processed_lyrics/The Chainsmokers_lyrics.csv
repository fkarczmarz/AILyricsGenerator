lyrics
"I kept on seeing him look at me when he was with that other girl
Do you think he was just doing that to make me jealous?
And I don't know if it's a booty call or not
So... like what do you think?
Did you think that girl was pretty?
How did that girl even get in here?
Did you see her?
Who wears Cheetah?
Let me take a selfie
Can you guys help me pick a filter?
I don't know if I should go with XX Pro or Valencia
I wanna look tan
What should my caption be? I want it to be clever
I only got ten likes in the last five minutes
Do you think I should take it down?
Let me take another selfie

What a creep!
Is that guy sleeping over there?
That's so ratchet
That girl is such a fake model
She definitely bought all her Instagram followers
Who goes out on Mondays?
Let's go dance
There's no vodka at this table
Do you know anyone else here?
Should I go home with him?
I guess I took a good selfie
Let me take a selfie
Let me take a selfie
Hang onto burning wires
We don't care anymore
Are we fading lovers?
We keep wasting colors
Maybe we should let this go
'Cause this is all we know
This feeling's all we know
I'll ride my bike up to the road
Down the streets right through the city
I'll go everywhere you go
From Chicago to the coast
Blow the smoke right through the window
'Cause this is all we know
'Cause this is all we know

Never face each other
We don't care anymore
Two hearts still beating
On with different rhythms
Maybe we should let this go
'Cause this is all we know
This feeling's all we know
I'll ride my bike up to the road
Down the streets right through the city
I'll go everywhere you go
From Chicago to the coast
Blow the smoke right through the window
'Cause this is all we know
'Cause this is all we know
Woke up on the West side
She's just my type
Then I start to think
As she pulls me on the bathroom floor
I feel so alive with you in my bed
On a train through Japan
I keep her real close 'cause she knows who I am
Red pill in my hand
It’s that type of thing
When she feels like the girl next door

And then I start to think as I lift her on the sink
That I've been here before
Not the type you can ignore
As she closes the door
I feel so alive with you in my bed (You in my bed)
Where have you been?
Where have you been?
Where have you been?
Where have you been?
Spent all my money on a fleeting moment
I thought I-I-I-I-I-I can shake this off
Now I-I-I-I-I-I can't make this stop
When I was living how I wanna on my own
And I thought I-I-I-I-I-I don't need that much
I guess I-I-I-I-I-I was out of touch
I'm so complicated
Those things that I said
They were so overrated
I gave up three times this week
Went through those feelings
Like I wasn't worth nothing

She wants to break up every night
Don't wanna wait until she finally decides to feel it

Then tries to fuck me back to life
How can I help it if I like the way she makes me feel it?

I drink too much and that's an issue  but I'm okay
Hey  you tell your friends it was nice to meet them
But I hope I never see them again

This is how the song starts
She's got a new song
Yeah  I just wanna drink tequila with my friend
She says she cheated 'cause she's tryna get ahead
The more I read it  yeah  the more I take offense
I'm so defeated  I can't get outside my head
I post a picture of myself 'cause I'm lonely
Everyone knows what I look like
Not even one of them knows me
Yeah  I just wanna drink tequila with my friends
I'm so defeated  I just want this shit to end
So I walk into the club like everybody hates me

Why do I still have to mean everything I ever said?

A confession of me
I've been led astray
Tried so hard to change
But I'm set on my ways
My words mean nothing again

The last day alive
The last day alive
All that you paid for
Did you get what you wanted?
You loaded a gun with all you were made of
When you're alone
Are you better than me?
It's not up to say it's all that you wait for
Now I'll find a way
While we're alive
How will I let you go?
You will always be the one that I regret
How will I let you go?
You're here in the way
How could you stay after that I paid for
How could you be assured?
You're holding out hope
I've been through hell and back again
I've come to understand that when
You tell me that I can't pretend
I either care about your stuff
Make the most of the things that might be rough
I let you go

If my life was fiction
I'd finally make best friends with my addictions
I'd get things done and not blame it on my conditions
I'd build a world not filled with contradictions
And build it up so high
Think I wanna twist the plot this time
I'm gonna go to Italy
Find my Maradona energy
I'll spin life to a fantasy
Like no one's home  so I play god
Befriending all my enemies
Way more room for activities now
I'm building up my mind
Think I wanna twist the plot this time
No one's home  so I play god
I had an epiphany
I'm not gonna throw it all away this time
Better than telepathy
I'll show them what's inside my mind

I heard you moved in with your boyfriend in New York
What's his name? I heard he works downtown in finance
Is he just as good at romance as we were?
I started acting out when you moved on
I tried to call you to eliminate the distance
I cared about you once and always will
And I tried my best  crossed my fingers for the rest

And now we're strangers again
And now we're strangers again
You were just a downtown socialite
Ship I pass on summer nights
Shadow that I can't define
Turned into a gaslight kerosene
Love that felt like seventeen
Hurt me 'til I feel alive
Isn't it strange how we're strangers again?
Now both of us know we were better as friends
Something that I used to have
Something that I used to have
Something that I used to have
(I go through your iPad looking for)
And now we're strangers again
Something that I used to have
(Oh-woah)
You were just a downtown socialite
Ship I pass on summer nights
Shadow that I can't define
Turned into a gaslight kerosene
Love that felt like seventeen"
