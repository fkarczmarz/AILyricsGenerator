lyrics
"And your nights turn into morning
Now you see the sky's falling
And your thoughts are runnin' wild
It's a masquerade
Can you hear the angels calling?
There's a fear inside the warning
And you're feelin' like a child
Thanks so much for letting me know
That you're finally letting me go
Ripped my heart right out of my soul
And you left it out on the road
I've been up for twenty-four hours
Dancing with the silence
I've been up for twenty-four hours
Dancing with the silence

Thanks so much for letting me know
That you're finally letting me go
Ripped my heart right out of my soul
And you left it out on the road
When you sign your name
And your nights turn into morning
Now you see the sky's falling
And your thoughts are runnin' wild
It's a masquerade
Can you hear the angels calling?
There's a fear inside the warning
And you're feelin' like a child
I've been up for twenty-four hours
Dancing with the silence
I've been up for twenty-four hours
Dancing with the silence
I've been up for twenty-four hours
Dancing with the silence
I've been up for twenty-four hours
Dancing with the silence
Block one way  I’ll find another
You know you’ll always be discovered
If it’s me  you choose  I can’t lose
I’m in love with you if you love me too  yeah
Don’t ever change  and I’ll stay the same
We’ll be swimming in the same direction
And we’ll never lose this connection
Nothing they can do can stop this army of two
We’re marching to the future  yeah  it’s me and you
So just follow my lead  repeat after me
Our faith is the bullet  hope is the gun
And love is all we need
Now fear’s on the run  we’ve already won
Now march with the band  raise your right hand
We’ve only just begun
I took a vow to never let you down
When it’s us  there ain’t no competition
I could be the star  on which you’re wishing
I never doubted for a moment it’s true
I love all of you if you love me too  yeah

Oh oh
Puts her armour on when she steps outside
She lives in black and white
And I try and try again to bring some light to the dark
You know everyday's a battle and it tears her apart
And I don't know why
And I'm picking up the pieces when they fall to her feet
You light the sky just like a star
I don't care what you see
And it feels like rain on a perfect night

Day by day
And I don't know why you're stuck in my mind

Backs on the grass  heads in the clouds  we close our eyes
Enjoy the view
And we don't wanna hear
The real world passing by
Saying that we're crazy
We spend all our time lying side by side
Going nowhere  it's really something
Getting busy doing nothing
We spend all our time running for our lives
Going nowhere  it's really something
Getting busy doing nothing
No magazines or DVDs
We both got better things to do
I'll hold your hand
Or shall we dance together
It's just so hard to choose
Every time we hear
The whole world rushing by
I know that we're not crazy

And I don't miss the rain  used to feel it all the time
Put away my troubles  I left them all behind
Now every time I look up  clear blue skies
Here you come again like a cloud in my view
Blocking all of my light like only you could do
'Cause every time we end up in the same silly situation
And did you really think that you could walk and I'd be here waiting?
Your turn to cry your heart out
Let me stop before you start out
Don't need your explanations  no
'Cause I don't really wanna know
About the way you're feeling now
'Cause you're the one who got time out
So go and you can cry your heart out

I’m gonna call my friend Olly up here to sing to you ladies
Olly!
Let’s go man
Look around  there’s a whole lot of pretty ladies
I was wondering if you and me could spend a minute
On the floor up close gettin' lost in it
I won’t give up without a fight
I just wanna  oh baby
I just want you to dance with me tonight
So come on  oh baby
I just want you to dance with me tonight
We’re getting sweaty  hot and heavy in the crowd now
Loosen up and let you hands go down  down
I feel the music moving through your body
Lookin' at you  I can tell you want me
When I saw you there
Sittin' all alone in the dark acting like you didn’t have a care
I knew right then  that you’d be mine
And we’d be dancin' the whole damn night right

But I'm only living half a life
Stuck behind the glass and the walls are closing in

Nothing ever lasts for a prisoner
And I'm in chains while you're breaking free
And it's killing me
I got flaws I can't disguise
And you tried to pull me to the light
I can't go back and make it right

Then I spill my drink tryna cover it up
Hey señorita in her beautiful dress
Do you wanna dance? She's tellin' me yes

I risk it all
When it comes to call
Tell me now did I get your attention?
Did you get the answer to your question?
Everybody cries
Cause I won't let ya

Or if you’re somewhere listening to Bob Marley

When that old guy gave us all those drinks for free
Do you still get knocked down by that Bacardi breeze

(Oh yes you are)
Then I know that you’re somewhere thinking of me
(oh uh yeh yeah)
No point regretting that it didn’t last
No point regretting that it went so fast
Time that we had was like sand in our hand
But when I look behind
I’m so glad that you were mine

I remember taking you home on that 86
Standing in your doorway where we used to kiss
Then your Dad came out and chased me down the street
If you remember just how scared I used to be
Then I know that you’re somewhere thinking of me
I know wherever you go
That you’ll be thinking about me now
I know wherever you go
That you’ll be thinking about me

Maybe that's what makes it fun
We don't know what comin'
Oh oh
But you got me and i got you
Couldn't stop this if we wanted to
You got me and I got you
I like us when we're unpredictable
Cause that's why love is so phenomenal
It's better when there's no one in control
We don't know which way it's gonna go
It drives me crazy
We go to bed at night in love
You wake up and hate me
Oh oh
But I just can't fight it
Other people might break up  but thats how I like it

Right on your window pane
Waited for your reply
Here in the pouring rain
Just breathe against the glass
Leave me some kind of sign
Just tell me it's not the end of the line
Just tell me it's not the end of the line
I never meant to break your heart
And I won't let this plane go down
I never meant to make you cry
I'll do what it takes to make this fly
Hold on to what you're feeling
That feeling is the best thing
I'm gonna place my bet on us
I know this love is heading
In the same direction

There's no way that I can disguise
All these crazy thoughts in my mind now
(There's just something about you)
You got the lock
I got the key
You know the rest
You know just where I wanna be
Don't ever stop controlling me
You got me wrapped up
Around your finger
I'd do anything for your love now
I don't ever wanna give up
All this spell you got me under
I see fireworks when we touch now
Your body fits on mine like a glove
Let them say whatever they want
It's too late 'cause you're in my blood now

You kinda turned my world upside down (Upside down)
And I don't really mind Spiderman kissing you
As long as you're planning on sticking around
The happiest boy in the world award goes to me
I kinda knew you was troublesome
You got me wrapped around your finger like bubblegum

I paint a picture inside my mind
Of all the things that I wanted
But I never thought I would find
And it blows my mind
Because there you are  by my side
Maybe you know  maybe you don't
But it's a question I have to ask
I know we're young and we got life
But life always goes so fast
But while you're mine
Yeah  it feels like time's on our side
Years and years  forever young
Years and years  yet to come
I take every second of every minute
Long as you're in it  you know I'm winning
Years and years  we won't forget
The time and place that we met
And I remember it all so clear
You signed your name on my heart
Saying you were here
No  we're not at the end
But we came close  maybe once or twice
We got burned  but we learned not to listen to bad advice
Now I know you're mine
'Cause it feels like time's on our side
This feeling will never get older
Will never be over while you're still mine

Pick me up whenever you want it
Throw me down when you're through
'Cause I learned more from what's missing
It's about me and not about you
I know I made some bad decisions
But my last one was you
You don't know love till it
Tears up your heart and cuts in it
Leaves you with scars you're still feeling
You say I can't do better
Better than someone like you
