lyrics
"For leasing myself out
Not ready to go up for sale
Can't seem to give it up
Stubborn  so selfish
I'm showing off the worst in me
The return of Saturn
Assessing my life
Second guessing
I'm full of artificial sweetener
My heart's been deceitful
It's all artificial sweetener
I'm faking I love you's
You're forcing me to
Ooh  you really deserve love
I want to love you
But I can't seem to find myself
My wilting effort
Our progress report
I'm only sure that I'm not sure
You might also like
I shudder to be honest
Who's behind it all now?
Who's the author?
I'm full of artificial sweetener
My heart's been deceitful
It's all artificial sweetener
I'm faking I love you's
You're forcing me to
I'm stuck on this page
I was born two weeks late
Is that why I hesitate?
I'm on the fence  push me off it
I want to be on your side now
And keep a promise
I'm full of artificial sweetener
My heart's been deceitful
It's all artificial sweetener
My heart's been deceitful
I'm faking I love you's
You're forcing me to
I'm faking I love you's
You're forcing me to
I'm faking I love you's
You're forcing me to
I'm faking I love you's
The precious collection you've housed in your covers
My simpleness threatened by my own admission
And the bags are much too heavy
In my insecure condition
My pregnant mind is fat full with envy again
But I still love to wash in your old bathwater
Love to think that you couldn't love another
Wanted and adored by attractive women
Bountiful selection at your discretion
I know I'm diving into my own destruction
So why do we choose the boys that are naughty?
'Cause I love to wash in your old bathwater
Love to think that you couldn't love another
I'm on your list with all your other women
But I still love to wash in your old bathwater
You make me feel like I couldn't love another
You might also like
Why do the good girls always want the bad boys?
So I pacify problems with kisses and cuddles
Diligently doubtful through all kinds of trouble
Then I find myself choking on all my contradictions
'Cause I still love to wash in your old bathwater
Love to think that you couldn't love another
I still love to wash in your old bathwater
Make me feel like I couldn't love another
Yeah
Do-do-do
Do-do-do
Do-do-do
I can't help myself
I still love to wash in your old bathwater
Everything else is a bore
I've got myself snagged on you
No self-control now
Now all that I want to do
Sleep in the shadow of you
For the rest of my life
Now we can chisel
Chisel off built up walls
Of pain deposited
From past lovers
Memories they can sleep
And we can live comfortably
For the rest of our lives
Wrong or right
Shipwrecked into you
Situation is foolish
Put up a fight
You're my big distraction
Obvious companion
I'm falling fast
Like an avalanche

Indentured servant
A slave to a slave
Thank God for my hopeful heart
And for mutual feelings
Look how it's balanced now
Maybe we'll just settle down
For the rest of our lives
Wrong or right
Shipwrecked into you
Situation is foolish
Put up a fight
You're my big distraction
Obvious companion
I'm falling fast
Like an avalanche
Look how it's balanced now
Maybe we'll just settle down
Wrong or right
Shipwrecked into you
Situation is foolish
Put up a fight
You're my big distraction
Obvious companion
I'm falling fast
Like an avalanche
You're my big distraction
Obvious companion
I'm falling fast
Like an avalanche
You're my big distraction
Obvious companion
I'm falling fast
Like an avalanche
You're my big distraction
Obvious companion
I'm falling fast
Like an avalanche
You're my big distraction
Obvious companion
I'm falling fast
Now I'm not myself
Found this place to hide
Come seek me
So back and forth
So insecure
Can't get this taste out of my mouth
Swallow it down
Pretend
Let it build up
Clear it all out
Just end it
I'm just a normal person
Without those problems
When did it change?
Admissions so embarrassing
I'm on the verge of tears again
You might also like
I'll let it build up
Clear it all out
Just end it
Did I take it off too soon?
Hysterical confession
My big courageous move
Don't gasp at the predictable
A comforting lie can't last
Preordained checklist of this awkward love
It's so sad
Let it build up
Clear it all out
Just end it
I'll just give it back
No thank you
Eliminate
Just give up
This tug of war
I'm sorry you've had some scary days
And it's too bad you're so sad
I wish you could have had what I had
I'm loathing most of your history
Violent timing explains the aftermath
And it's too bad you're so sad
I wish you could have had what I had
And it's so sad it's too bad
Maybe I can make you feel better
Oh maybe I'm supposed to make you feel better
I want to comfort you
I want to comfort you
I want to comfort you

Unlike you I had it easy
You're dark blue
Stained from previous days
And you're so sad

I'm sorry
I'm sorry
I want to comfort you

Peek in  sneak about
Peek in  sneak about
Your broken hearted detective
Hey girl  save the liar
Can’t you see his pants on fire?
Hey girl  save the liar
Can’t you see his pants on fire?
My back it hurts again
It aches like history
Cottonmouth and all lit up
You’re smiling back at me
But I feel you must have failed me
Once again  you’ve let me down
My confidence below my knees now
I need to find you out
Peek in  sneak about
I’m gonna snoop and call you out
I caught you  your hands are red
Now I’m your broken hearted detective

Hey lover  why the gun?
Hold on  I’m almost there
It’s too late  you killed the trust
Don’t act so unaware
So why are you so destructive?
Do you realize what you've done?
You can’t bring it back to life now
What are you running from?
Peek in  sneak about
I’m gonna snoop and call you out
I caught you  your hands are red
Now I’m your broken hearted detective
I don’t like the way I feel
I just want you to be real
Hey girl  save the liar
Can’t you see his pants on fire?
Hey girl  save the liar
Can’t you see his pants on fire?
I’m rummaging through your closet
Imagining all the worst thoughts
Peek in  sneak about
I’m gonna snoop and call you out
I caught you  your hands are red
Now I’m your broken hearted detective
Peek in  sneak about
I’m gonna snoop and call you out
I caught you  your hands are red
Now I’m your broken hearted detective
Peek in
Peek in
Peek in
Peek in
Peek in  sneak about
I’m gonna snoop and call you out
I caught you  your hands are red
You don't have to be a famous person just to make your mark
A mother can be an inspiration to her little son
Two sisters only have their parents to blame
It's rare that two can get along
The sky is full of clouds
And my world's full of people
You got the different kinds
With different ways
It would take a lifetime to explain
Not one's the same (Eee)
'Cause one can teach the other one what she doesn't know
While still the other fills a place inside

The sky is full of clouds
And my world's full of people
You got the different kinds
With different ways
It would take a lifetime to explain
And think about the planet
To kick back and think about how massive it all is
I often think about the world in which I live today
Of animals and plants and nature's gifts set on display
But the most amazing thing that I've seen in my time
Are all the different people
And different ways
It would take a lifetime to explain
Not one's exactly the same
So many different people
So many different kinds
So many different—
So many different people
So many different kinds
Walk in the park under sapphire skies
Oh  I can’t believe that you’re still around
I almost forgot how you let me down
Crying so deep that I  I think I might die
Your mistakes I keep in the back of my mind
So hard to let go  but I’m coming ‘round
The scars are still fragile  don’t let me down
So don’t blow it
No  not a little bit
'Cause now you’re all mine  don’t you forget it
Don’t blow it
Even a little bit
'Cause now you’re all mine  don’t you forget it
Don’t let me down
Don’t let me down
Don’t let me down
Time after time it’s just too much to take
I’ve waited so long just to get to this place
And finally it feels like the lost was found
You’ve got me filled up now  don’t let me down
Don’t let me down

We used to be together
I really feel
That I'm losing my best friend
I can't believe this could be the end
It looks as though
You're letting go
Don't speak
I know just what you're sayin'
So please stop explainin'
Don't tell me 'cause it hurts
Don't speak
I know what you're thinkin'
I don't need your reasons
Don't tell me 'cause it hurts

I thought that we would last  become a little family
And it's my gut feeling  it's not happening for me  so
Let's end it on this  give me one more kiss
Let's end it on this  let's end it on this
You see it's hard to face the addict that's inside of me
I want to fill my glass up with you constantly
I've been here before but I've never ever felt this sure
And now I know I've been dreaming  and your actions have inspired me
So let's end it on this  give me one more kiss (It's over)
Let's end it on this  let's end it on this (It's over)
Just one more wish  one last kiss (It's over)
Let's end it on this  let's end it on this
I open up  you ignore me
Oh  you're not the same at all  nuh-uh
And if I could turn back the pages of time
I'd rewrite your point of view  uh-huh

I kinda always knew I’d end up your ex-girlfriend
I kinda always knew I’d end up your ex-girlfriend
I hope I hold a special place with the rest of them
And you know it makes me sick to be on that list
But I should have thought of that before we kissed
You say you’re gonna burn before you mellow
I will be the one to burn you
Why’d you have to go and pick me?
I kinda always knew I’d end up your ex-girlfriend
I kinda always knew I’d end up your ex-girlfriend
I hope I hold a special place with the rest of them
I kinda always knew I’d end up your ex-girlfriend
I’m another ex-girlfriend on your list
But I should have thought of that before we kissed
Your wildness scares me
So does your freedom
You say you can’t stand the restrictions
I find myself trying to change you
If you were meant to be my lover I wouldn’t have to
‘Cause I’m about to give you away

We keep repeating mistakes for souvenirs

And I know that when I see you I’m going to die

It’s going to kill me to see you with the next girl
‘Cause I’m the most gorgeously jealous kind of ex-girl

I'm holding signs up on your street corner stops
Like most  you try not to see me
Stare straight ahead  ignore the responsibility
Excuse me (Excuse me  mister)
Well I've been waiting in line
And I'd like to buy some of your time
So please excuse me  mister
You've got things all wrong
You make it feel like a crime
So don't confuse me  mister

All I need is a little of your time
They don't pay the high cost of mental custody

I've known you way too long  boy
All I need is a little of your time
What should I do? I'm about to crack
And there's a force that comes over me
It's almost as if I'm tied to the tracks
I'm waiting for him to rescue me
The funny thing is  he's not going to come
He's not going to find me
This is a matter of fact  the desire you lack
This is the way I guess it has to be
A little of your time
I need a little of your time
So please excuse me  mister
You've got things all wrong
You make it feel like a crime

'Cause dependency might interrupt
Idealistic will  so hard to please
Put your indecisive mind at ease
You broke the set
Now there's  there's only singles
There's no looking back
And this time I mean it
Are you happy now?
Oh  tell me how you're happy now
Are you happy?
The uncertainty you had of me
Brought clouded  shady company
The tenderness habitual
A seldom-fading ritual
You killed the pair
Now only one is breathing

If you feel you just might want me
That's too bad  I'm not that easy
The contemplator all those years
Now you must adhere to your new career
Of liberation  you've been cast
All by yourself  you're free at last
You broke the set
Now there's  there's only singles
There's no looking back
This time I mean it
Are you happy now?
Tell me how you're happy now
Are you happy?

How is it now? Are you happy now?

Oh  you're by yourself
All by yourself
You got no one else
You're by yourself
All by yourself  all by yourself
All by yourself  all by yourself
No one else  no one else
But your love keeps on comin' like a thunderbolt
You got me feelin' hella good
So let's just keep on dancin'
You hold me like you should
So I'm gonna keep on dancin' (Keep on dancin')
A performance deserving of standing ovations
And who would've thought it'd be the two of us?
So don't wake me if I'm dreamin'

You hold me like you should

Made of white chiffon blowing in the wind
Well hey you  with the dreams in your head
You've been so misled by your heart's pull
I know you're waiting for your ship to come in
You anxiously wait for such a long time
You're just like my Ken and Barbie Doll
You dress up  you play the game
You're just like my Ken and Barbie Doll
Your name will never change (Your name will never change)

I'm hanging out with me
And you're a vacant chair
A chosen compromise
This space we rarely share
And if you lived here you'd be home now
So what you givin' up for me?
And what shall I give up for you?
Aimless expectations passing by
If you lived here you'd be home now
If you lived here you'd be home now
And to make it real
I need to have you here

I need to see you
Supervision is what I need
Some casual light days
Part of the furniture
I want to take you for granted
And see you regular
So what you givin' up for me?
And what shall I give up for you?
And to make it real
I need to have you here
I need to have you
It can't be sincere
Unless you spend time here
I need to see you
I need you...
When it gets bad
You got to think about something
To keep from going mad
I try to think about big fat roses
When the ship starts going down
But my head is wicked jealous
Don’t want to talk about it right now
The past
(Only in my head)
(Only in my head)
There’s just something about you
That gets me in a twist
And sometimes I think that Cupid
Is just taking the piss
It only takes one word or idea
To send me in real deep
So if you think you’re clever
Use the right words when you talk to me

In love with you
If I could buy my reasoning
I'd pay to lose
One half won't do
I've asked myself
How much do you
Commit yourself?
Don't you forget
It's my life
It never ends (It never ends)
Funny how I blind myself
I never knew
I was sometimes played upon
Afraid to lose

Convince myself

But I want to be myself
A counterfeit disposition
Can't be good for my health
So many different faces
Depending on the different phases
My personality changes
I'm a chameleon
There's more than one dimension
I can fool you and attract attention
Makeup's all off
Who am I?
The magic's in the makeup (Magic's in the makeup)
Who am I?
If you bore me then I'm comfortable
My attraction paralyzes me
No courage to show my true colors that exist
But I wanna be the real thing
The ones I loathe are the ones that know me the best

I’m on the second floor with a lock on my door
I’m looking at a picture of your face
But somehow pictures fade
And that just ain't good enough
I go around the world to see your face
'Cause this just ain’t good enough
I'm really missing it in so many ways
I anticipate us making out

And I wouldn't mind if my name changed to Mrs
An attraction to tradition
My vintage disposition
My sincere architecture
And I want to cook him dinner
But I'm more indecisive than ever
And who believes in forever?
Who will be the one to marry me?
A girl in the world barking up the wrong tree
A creature conditioned to employ matrimony
The ceremony makes me zealous as the past quickly ceases
Fear from being neutered
Quickly I'm altered and tempted by new love only rented
Do you believe you'll marry me?

This feeling has got to stay
Don’t let it go away
This feeling has got to stay
And I can’t believe I’ve had this chance now
And I never had this taste in the past
My normal hesitation is gone
And I really gravitate to your will
Are you here to fetch me out?
‘Cause I’ve never had this taste in my mouth
And you’re not familiar
Recently discovered and I’m learning about you
And you’re consuming me violently
And your reverence shamelessly tempting me
Who sent this maniac?

And he never had no trouble 'til he started up his Oi band
Safe in the garage or singing in the tub
'Til Haji went too far and he plugged in at the pub
It was a cold Christmas eve when Trevor and the skins
Popped in for a pint and to nick a bag of crisps
He unwound Haji's turban and he knocked him to his knees
If God came down on Christmas Day
I know exactly what He'd say
But Oi to the world and everybody wins
Trevor called his bluff and told him where to meet
Christmas day on the roof down at 20 Oxford Street
If God came down on Christmas Day
I know exactly what He'd say

But Haji had a sword like that guy in Indiana Jones
Haji was alone and abandoned by his band
Trevor was there fading and still so full of hate
But then Haji saw the north star shining more then ever
So he made a tourniquet from his turban saving Trevor
They repelled down the roof with the rest of the turban
And went back to the pub where they bought each other bourbon
If God came down on Christmas Day
I know exactly what He'd say

And they're calling out murder
But I'm underneath the covers
And who's fooling who with this mood like a train

Yeah
You've been a juvenile
With a dolphin smile
With no elbow room
With your body in bloom
You've had your little backyard
Protected by big walls
You didn't dare look over
'Cause you've been too small
Now you're finally sixteen
And you're feelin' old
But they  they won't believe
That you got a soul
No  whoa  oh  no

And you're feeling real
But you  you can't seem to cop a feel
No  whoa  oh  no
Why do they have to force us
Through this metamorphose?

Whoa  oh  no
These children  they're not really bad  most of them
Just products of rough neighborhoods and bad family situations
You know you can't forsake it
So sit back and take it
You see  you're not just ripe
So don't try and fight
That you're only sixteen
Wanna catch a peek
But they  they look at you
Like you're such a freak
Whoa  oh  no

With a lot to say

The time of day
Whoa  oh  no
Well you're only sixteen (You're only sixteen)

Once was a magical place
Over time  it was lost
Price increased the cost
Now the fortune of the kingdom
Is locked up in its dungeon vaults
The castle floor lies in traps
With coiled wires set back
Decoyed by old cheese
Now the drawbridge has been lifted
As the millions  they drop to their knees
They pay homage to a king
Whose dreams are buried in their minds
His tears are frozen stiff
Icicles drip from his eyes
The cold wind blows as it snows
On those who fight to get in
On heads that are small
Disillusioned (Disillusioned) as they enter (As they enter)
They're unaware what's behind castle walls
But now it's written in stone
The king has been overthrown by jesterly fools
And the power (And the power) of the people (Of the people)
Shall come to believe they do rule

They pay homage to a king
Whose dreams are buried in their minds
His tears are frozen stiff
Icicles drip from his eyes
Welcome to the tragic kingdom
Cornfields of popcorn have yet to spring open
Have they lost their heads
Or are they just all blind mice?
We've heard all their stories
One too many times
Hypnotized by fireflies that glow in the dark
And midgets that disguise themselves as tiny little dwarfs
The parade that's electrical
It serves no real purpose
Just takes up a lot of juice
Just to impress us
They pay homage to a king
Whose dreams are buried in their minds
His tears are frozen stiff
Icicles drip from his eyes
Ooh  they drip from his eyes into the night (Tragic kingdom)
They drip from his eyes (Tragic kingdom)
They're paying homage to a king (Tragic)
A king who's buried  buried in their minds (Kingdom)
They drip from his eyes (Tragic kingdom)
Welcome to the tragic kingdom
Cornfields of popcorn have yet to spring open
Welcome to the tragic kingdom
Welcome to the tragic kingdom
Welcome to the tragic kingdom
Welcome to the tragic kingdom
Welcome to the tragic kingdom
Welcome to the tragic kingdom
Welcome to the tragic kingdom
 it closes my eyes
 four walls as sky
 use the box as my guide
 trapped in a box
 trapped in a box
 how to die
 trapped in a box
 trapped in a box
Someone more like me
There's times when this dress rehearsal
Seems incomplete
But you see the colors in me
Like no one else
You're something else
And you're really lovely
Underneath it all
And you want to love me
Underneath it all
I'm really lucky
Underneath it all
You're really lovely
You know some real bad tricks
And you need some discipline
But lately you've been trying real hard
And giving me your best
And you give me the most gorgeous sleep
That I've ever had
And when it's really bad
I guess it's not that bad

You're really lovely

Underneath it all
I'm really lucky
Underneath it all
And you're really lovely
And so many moons that we have seen
Stumbling back next to me
I've seen right through and underneath
And you make me better
I've seen right through and underneath
For real
You've used up all your coupons
And all you got left is me
And somehow I'm full of forgiveness
I guess it's meant to be
And you're really lovely
Underneath it all
And you want to love me
Underneath it all
I'm really lucky
Underneath it all
And you're really lovely
You're really lovely
Underneath it all
And you want to love me
Underneath it all
And I'm really lucky
Underneath it all
And you're really lovely
Underneath it all
Underneath it all
Underneath it all
I guess I'll have to wait a while
I wanna play this game
Call me up if you know how to dial
You always had my number
You need to be my lover
If we both want the love and I wait long enough
Then the ground that we're on might be common
All I can do is wait for you
All I can do is wait for you
I'm all alone in the waiting room
I'm all alone in the waiting room
When you’re burning solitude
It can get real thick
If desire is your only food
It can get you sick
You might also like
You know you're so fine (so fine)
I'm over here standing in this line
(Just a-wait) Just a-waiting in the waiting room
If we both want the love and I wait long enough
Then the ground that we’re on might be common
All I can do is wait for you
I'm all alone in the waiting room
While I'm in the waiting room
A thousand thoughts I think of you
Whatever you did has got me glued
You're the one I’m dreaming of
Why does this feel like wasted time
(What a price) What a price this traveling love (Travelin' love)
You and me trapped between these lines
If we both want the love and I wait long enough
Then the ground that we’re on might be common
All I can do is wait for you (I'm just waiting for you)
All I can do is wait for you (You know I want you)
All I can do is wait for you
All I can do is wait for you (You know you need to be my love)
All I can do is wait for you
All I can do is wait for you
All I can do is wait for you
All I can do is wait for you
I'm all alone in the waiting room
I'm all alone in the waiting room
I'm all alone in the waiting room
It seems we forget how to live
The old blueprint no longer manifests itself
As the correct way to exist
So wipe the grime off the view hole
And please take a closer look
Environmental bandits up to their shenanigans
Crooks disguised as crooks disguised as...
We gotta find another way to make the world go 'round
We gotta find another way to make the world go 'round
Individual roles we think
Not so important to the plot
Destroyed and overwrought
There's no need to point the finger
We understand who takes the blame
Delinquents caught red-handed in the act
Crooks disguised as you and I

And I'm not sure if I like what I've heard
I'm not sure if I like what I'm doing myself
Unexcusable (Exploitation) exploitation
It's the dawning of a new era
People consciously don't care
How unfair
And find another way to make the world go 'round
We gotta find another way to make the world go 'round
We gotta find another way to make the world go 'round
And find another way to make the world go 'round
You got to send me another way
(Find another way to make the world go 'round)
So find another way to make the world go 'round
Since you've been unglued
It's hard to figure out
Your next move
One minute here
The next you're gone
Let's make an end
For you it's hard to take
Cause the pill has an awful taste
Just open up and swallow down
Once it hits bottom
Things may turn around
Unfortunately this is the case
You've got to catch up
And win the race
Straighten yourself out
You can do it
One minute here
The next you're gone
Let's make an end
They can't understand
That you mean to do good
I guess you could say
You're misunderstood
I know you're meaning well
But you've been shot to hell
Just come back and join us now
'Cause I know that you know how

Unfortunately this is the case
You've got to catch up

You can do it
I know it seem they're messing with your mind
But you don't have to go
Forward blind
So let the bygones be bygone
And let's make an end
Unfortunately this is the case
You've got to catch up
And win the race
Straighten yourself out"
