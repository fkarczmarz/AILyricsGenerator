lyrics
"I break 'em for the better
The two of them are always walking me
Into the stormy weather
Change it all together
(I bet you don't feel lighter)
(So there's a little left over)
I take a pistol and I blow my brain
I blow it out the window
The little thing was always acting strange
And thinking like a devil
Zeroing my levels
I get the feeling that it will not be
(I bet you don't feel lighter)
(So there's a little left over)
Oh...
I gotta get away
From myself
I gotta get help
Oh...
I got the government
I got the old Prime Minister
And I put it on a tether
Spin it around 'til the bomb goes off
(I bet you don't feel lighter)
(So there's a little left over)
Yeah there's a lot left over
(I bet you don't feel lighter)
 it was nice
 it was nice
 it was nice
 and you're alive
And I know what he came here for
The kind of fun that I adore
I let him enter to make some more-
Fire  it burn my skin
But I still want to play with it  like a
Shark fin in the swim
I cut myself and jump on in
Baby boy  baby brother
We’re losing you to the gutter
A woman  she at my door
And too bad it’s my best friend’s girl
She’s cooking up a civil war
I’m dumb enough to storm the shores  yeah
There’s a red-light up ahead
I drive my car into it
I’m a little kid with a big death wish
I bite the lips  the lips that kiss
Baby boy  baby brother
We’re losing you to the gutter
Baby boy  baby brother
We’re losing you  is it forever?
Baby boy  baby brother
We’re losing you to the gutter
Baby boy  baby brother
We’re losing you  is it forever?

Would you feel alright? Would you be alright?

Would you bring me back to life?

Up top on a pretty little mountain
Fuck off all you people on the ground  yeah

Maybe just a good book and a heart to break
I'll make a mistress of a little Wiccan thing

If it is a place we need to go
Ask me if I’m happy
I don’t care
Maybe I’d be happy if you disappeared
Maybe I’d be happy if you give me drugs
Drugs can make a fuck last all night long
'Cuz nothing makes me happy about getting off
Reaching for the saddest little cloth
Reaching for the water on the sill
Water with the saddest little film
Ask me if I’m happy
What does it mean?
I’ll tell you that I am if you tell me I’m dreaming
To wake up in a place I’ve never been
Wake up with a face I’ve never seen
Wake up with the purest sense of being
Happy is a pill for the faint of heart
Happy is a place in the dark
(Yea-yeah-ah)
Ask me if I’m happy one more time
I’ll give you a reply if you give me your eye
I'll leave you with an itty bitty hole
Well it’s nothing like the one inside my soul
It’s nothing like the canyon of my heart
Well at least I got some room to fall apart
Happy is a diamond in the rough
Happy it ain’t enough
One got shot and the other got lost in
Drugs and punks and blood on the street
Blo-blood on her knees  bloody history
Whatever happened to the hayloft?
Burnt to the ground  and what about Pop?
He took his ass back to the crack shack
With his long johns on  singing that old song

I want roses set on fire
And I  well I want what’s best for me
And I  I think I know just what that means

Today I coo  today I caw
I have a pistol party and I kill ‘em all

And I  well I lose my mind

I dance (a-shoop shoop)

I didn’t know how to treat them
Maybe if I believed them they’d have stayed
I hope they’re somewhere safe
Living in a daydream
Singing to a song I couldn’t play
But if I saw them on the street I’d say
“My baby’s come back to me”
I’ve got to keep my love in my heart
I’ve got to keep my love in my heart
I’ve got to give my love to my soul
I’ve got to give my love to my soul
And let go
My angel flew away
I didn’t know how to keep her

I hope she spreads her wings
Slouching on a sunbeam
And dancing to a song I couldn’t sing
But if I saw her on the street I’d say
