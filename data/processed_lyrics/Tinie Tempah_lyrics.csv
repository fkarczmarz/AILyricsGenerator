"I might go to the bank and just take out 100k
Hit the club and roll around up in 100k
How many views you think I’ll get that day? 100k
100k  100k
Praise the lord I thought I’d never ever see the day
Everywhere I go my niggas know it's me that's paying
So much money coming in  I think I need a safe
I was like 21 sitting at my mums house when I counted out my first hundred
Slanging to the fiends  now I mastered the cream
All these bitches want to queue for my cumber
More money  more problems so imagine all the stress I'm under
With these sparklers we make lightning
Cause' I can't let them steal my thunder
Because there's ten yellow bottles sitting on a wall
So we bought them all
Five for the mandem  two for the bitches
And then three for the floor
With no security I feel safe
Fresh Prince  I fill banks
And I’m still tryna to Bill Gates
And I ain't talking making doors fam
Urgh

Praise the lord I thought I’d never ever see the day
Everywhere I go my niggas know it's me that's paying
So much money coming in  I think I need a safe
Strides!!
100k and that's on a couple chains
Open shirt from Vivienne Westwood might see me on a yacht with Jay
White car with a black top  Beemer
R8 might cop me a two seater
Mazel Tov  cash in hand Bar Mitzvah
You ain't never seen 100k
Label paying a whole heap even before they’ve listened
And then we toast champagne on the Roleys
Because they’re water resistant
Catch flights  private j-e-t
Blue marli with R.S.M.D
100K  old moneys great
It’s only right that the trips on me
Ah huh
100k  100k
I might go to the bank and just take out 100k
Hit the club and roll around up in 100k
How many views you think I’ll get that day? 100k
100k  100k
Praise the lord I thought I’d never ever see the day
Everywhere I go my niggas know it's me that's paying
So much money coming in  I think I need a safe
Press a button in mi car it speaks for itself
If you don’t think that money talk then speak for yourself
Top floor up in the Maurice  the suite’s something else
I got so much presence bitch I think I need some help
Yea motherfucker MVP of the year motherfucker
Suddenly a nigga got shares motherfucker
All I see is yachts and lears motherfucker
Billionaires motherfucker
Sipping champagne like I sip beer
Niggas thought they ran tings tort’s and hair
Nigga oh yeah
When money talks I listen
That's why the UK rap scene got another millionaire
100k  100k
I might go to the bank and just take out 100k
Hit the club and roll around up in 100k
How many views you think I’ll get that day? 100k
100k  100k
Praise the lord I thought I’d never ever see the day
Everywhere I go my niggas know it's me that's paying
So much money coming in  I think I need a safe
A 100k  a 100k
99 problems  a 100k
Views in a day on the YouTube vid
YouTube money in your head  YouTube hits
For the love of the dough niggas stuck on the road
With some dubs from the ol’  trying move food quick
Put some Uggs in a hole I ain't loving the dough
Want a 100k and a big new crib
With 100 bags  who need a suitcase?
Time is money and you neeks are too late
Married to the money all I needs a bouquet
Get money all week we don’t need to chose days
Selfish I don’t need to move bait
Got the game covered you can keep your duvet
Birthday cake hip hip hooray
30 bags in my room no room for room mates
I’m calm
I looked at Konan  like I ain't got 100k yet
He said look at your income you probably will in about 100 days Krept
He can see the future That's So Raven
I got money in-dian  like I’m Asian
Don’t sing to police how I get cake in
Because I’ll rap a singer Drake him
I-I-Im not slow g but I love p and get dough
So I’m dopey
Bags in my hand motherfucker no groceries
I’m not grumpy but I get moaney
A lot of girls for the money and the fame ting
I had two chicks Holly and Caitlin
They said they wanna try angles
If you're on board
Fasten your seatbelt
If you're on board
Fasten your seatbelt
If you're on board
Fasten your seatbelt
If you're on board
All we got is five minutes 'til we all go
All we got is five minutes 'til we all go
All we got is five minutes 'til we all go
Wake up in the morning and I smell my breath
I send a picture to my niggas of the girl in bed
On the chimney tops of the prison world's address
But I fuck with BBC like Fearne and Reg
Bought a pair of Jordan 3s with a firm cement
Slagging on a hundred damn trillion percent
Even in my skinny jeans I still walk like this
And 007 make me talk like this
That anybody my age should drive a Porsche like this!

Bloody crazy roast on Sunday
Got mash-up on Monday
Real twisted on Tuesday
Woke up wasted on Wednesday
Got completely trashed on Thursday
Fucked up on Friday
Bad money from Saturday
I got adults acting like a bunch of boys and girls
She asked me why I never let a woman try on my shades
Don't want her fucking hair on my tortoise shells
I get the citizens cane like Orson Welles
My number even had to change cause some annoying girl
It's like fucking Babestation on my voicemail
All these swagger-jackers getting me annoyed as hell
You ain't never seen talent on The Voice as well!
London Fashion Week made me walk like this
And Stephen Fry made me want to talk like this
Che Guevara made me want to break the law like this!
Fasten your seatbelt
If you're on board
Fasten your seatbelt

All we got is five minutes 'til we all go
All we got is five minutes 'til we all go
All we got is five minutes 'til we all go
Wake up in the morning and I smell my breath
I could have had to be going to work instead
I seen your pussy game made me walk like this
And Star Wars made me use the force like this
When you're fucking busy having dinner with stars
You better start eating with your knife and fork like this!
Man is on auto (Gas)

I praise the lord like 40 times a day
He said it's time to regulate
Rappers be stuck in a pickle
They suck when they dribble
Malcolm got stuck in the middle
With two models up in the limo
Should upload the video
Heard my man's got dough online but no real dough in his pocket
Tell me if you're naughty
I know black girls don't like white boys
White boys don't like white noise
You didn't buy Pass Out or Wifey

And now these droppers wanna love me
I knew we'd run the city someday
Mess around with who? It's gunplay
Now they know me in another country
She gave her number even though I'm ugly
Vibing and I'm feeling bubbly
Motherfuck my teacher cause she never liked me (fuck her)
I swear I've been living grimy
I'm with a white girl and she's popping molly (molly)
In Saint-Tropez and I'm all in the white
My niggas do UFC 9 till 5
Didn't even know she's a whore on the sly
Girl telling lies when she swore on her life
Dom Pérignon in the morn in the sky
Told her that she can have more if she likes
Told her she buff but she know that she nice
I've got balls of steel
I am the militant black guy
Salute the magpie
I'll high-five man's face
If a nigga don't act right
Bomb has landed
Pain and base: my branding
I'm sitting in the captain's cabin
Man's confused like how did this happen?
I am (the true Aladdin)
Bottle of Henny and ready to go
Base Defence League all in my zone
I smoke zoots and roll
Take man's chain and go
I paid that iron price
Came from the iron life
Only kings wear gold
There's no game to the thrones
It's peak for the metal may fly
Only God knows this life I chose
And rose my soul to fry
It's skull and bones
 Gyal think you owe em something cousin when you’re fucking it
I know white girls with black features
I know white girls who go to black church
With their black friends and play Black Jesus
That turn up and burn up
Get grounded if their Dad sees this
I've got a new album with mad features
With no game and no chain
My mandem said no way
Know that she nice
Even when I was in the pram
Way before your Insta bang
Furthermore  before that Instagram
I'm just tryna get love  when I'm in Japan
I make the girl dem sing for man
Every MC wanna spin the man
But I kill a soundboy like I'm Ninjaman
Look  rudeboy  I've been the man
Even way before Twitter  fam
Act like you ain't been a fan
You get a déjà-vu when I rinse a man
And get messy when I Lionel twist a man
Bare likes on my Insta jam
Thug life when I spit on the cam
I tell a man sit down  ain't taking a jab
Cuh man are hot for the EP  hot for the radio
Mind that you don't get boxed in your rave clothes
I was on my boss' yacht after the Spain show
Ask Sony why they dropped the potato
How comes I always hear my name on Not For The Radio
When man ain't never been on Not For The Radio?
If them man are pagans then I've got a halo
Better than me? Yeah  go on then  say so
Cause you ain't Dizzee or Will or Kano
Don't care if you got tats  OK bro
And the very first mixtape manaman's heard is all mine
Said in '06  '07 what I said in '09
Now it's 2015 and man are still winning
You man are just fakes  them man are just kidding
Shout out to them man Disturbing London  you know how we living
Have I gotta tell man six times on a one

Man ripped up the Ts and Cs
In my black hoodie and my off-white tee
With my black gums and my off-white teeth
Vegan  I don't chat about beef
Cause I know beef is bull and I'm not a chief
If I catch man moving backwards
Punch man in all of his chakras
Yeah  sorry  I don't rehearse
Fuck a soundcheck  it only gets worse
Man Don't Care  end up in a hearse
If you don't reload Giggs' verse
Good guy but I'm not a saint
Thought I was coming offstage but I ain't
Them two girls at the front gonna faint
Set gets cancelled  still get paid (raggo)
Everyone's got ideas
Force them on me  it will end in tears (raggo)
Everyone's trying to get to the top of the stairs
But it's bless down here (raggo)
Fuck am I meant to do  blud?
Spitting from 2002  blud

When I say he wan' lick the pearl
And I heard them girls been talking shit
Your track sounds like a hit and miss
Yeah  I MC but why would I make a diss?
Fuck the track  I'll spin your wig
'Nough chat when they're online
Real life  cool  fine
I'm pretty  looking like I'm from Ice City
But I'll scrap  I ain't got a nine
So just fall back  take time
I spit crack  sniff lines
That raw  uncut  leave your mind fucked
I'm en route but he missed the sign
I'm en route to the money
Yardie man say I'm tunny
Bad but I can't be bummy
Shit ain't funny  I've been out there till it's sunny
Tryna get a bit of cheddar for my mummy
Tell a man be easy
They wanna touch me  tease me
You little niggas can't please me
You mandem are sleazy
You need to go to the GP
About your talking greazy
I tell a man just dead it
Better nuh bring to life if I said it
You know you ain't fucking with us so don't beg it
Anytime I spit  I deliver  I'm so fearless
I've had enough  in my hood  we never had much
Moving grub to fill up my cup  so tell me what's up
Like a bandage  we in the cut
We don't hurry we got all this time
We don't hurry
We ain't worry we just wait and hide
And who cares what's going on
Just put on my favorite song
Gonna dance for you in slow mo'
We don't hurry we got all this time
Chasin' flies
You've got me in another state of mind
You know I'd rather chose faith than the money and the fame combined
Skip an Uber we could take the underground we could waste some time
May play some grime
You know I love it when you wake up high
Know you're down for that G-shit
I was all in some deep house
You was all in some deep shit
That was part of my weakness
And I give you anything you're wanting
Show you that I'm never on a long ting

Now we've got our clothes on a mannequin  we don't need no comparison
I overdosed on extravagance  we went for gold and got platinum
I told my bro to get an ambulance cause I caught a cold and went spaz on them
How can home be where the heart is when your shadow even fucking leaves you when you are in darkness?
Still get stopped by Sergeant Pepper  looking for that Ziggy Stardust
After a lifetime of regret  I'm just looking for some answers

Put me through Amaro when you Instagram on your iPhone
Look at all the rappers we outsold so (Shh) keep your mouth closed  yeah
How did I become so jaded? Maybe all these insecurities are making me feel naked
Feel like Harry did in Vegas  had my privacy invaded
That's a liberty a pity  the epitome of what fame is
Priest up in my parish  keep on putting me in their prayers
We rarely ever get those second chances
After a lifetime of regret  I'm just looking for some answers

I know one day our time will come
Bought a camera to capture these cinematic nights
Still don't satisfy my appetite for this lavish life
Like Michael said  it doesn't matter if you're black or white
Look at the colours that's under the sun above us
All we have is each other  in case you happen to wonder
Let's go
Lay down your head  you're not alone
Anywhere you go  I'll follow
We are the children of the sun

Lay down your head  you're not alone
Anywhere you go  I'll follow

Yeah we all learn to fly away
No tears when the sun goes
Cause heroes never die no way
Here everyone’s a hero
We all got a second chance
And heaven plays piano
Cause heroes love to dance
Victory is ours
Mystery and power
History is sour
The future smells sweet
Tryna get into heaven racing through hell's streets
Dancing with the devil with my two left feet
Laughing with the rebels up on New Year’s Eve
65432
As the devil in the red white and blue dress leaves
She says I’m a motherfucking C U N T
Say hello to everybody’s favourite new MC
Loving the alphabet except these two NV
Some of these motherfuckers getting too friendly
Why the fuck am I sitting next to two MPs?
Bullshit and politics tryna find out where knowledge is
Cause it ain’t in a scholarship
Or these schools and colleges
Studied by psychologists
Quality in my qualities
Tryna disturb the whole wild world with no apologies

Kickers from Ann Summers and mad La senza bras
Are we any closer to God if we’re the stars?
I think it's time to show everyone who we are
Here everyone’s a hero

No tears when the sun goes

Looking in the barrel of a 12 gauge magnum
I ain’t never done nobody no wrong but me
Stolen from the wild and released into captivity

But was welcomed with open arms like the statue that's in Brazil
Mummy knew I’d be expensive so she nearly called me Bill
Daddy thought the stress would kill him so he nearly called me Will

Them Jordan Spizikes on my feet looking spotless
I be on that heavy metal wave and that rock shit
Bitch I’m thirty thousand feet meet me in my cockpit
I be in the middle of a motherfuckin’ mosh pit
Living kinda lavish
Fashion week in Milan  fashion week in Paris
Everyday I’m fucking some one different on my mattress
I be one night standing I ain’t tryna be romantic
Yeah they call me Tinie but I’m bout to be gigantic
It’s a madness every single time I’m landing back in Stanstead
Did my thing up at the Brits and now I’m eyeing up the Grammys
The music got me moshing like I’m angry

I’m running this game what the hell are you playing

And my crew come through balls on parade
And you don’t wanna be brave  you just wanna behave
And all I wanna do is kick back in the Caymans
But I don’t mind killing you for entertainment
Nobody can save ya  call Jesus Christ or just change your life
You ain’t playing alright cos you ain’t the type
Don’t know why you wanna be up in the hype
When I’m in the mosh pit all day and night
Don’t chat to me if you ain’t ready to fight  alright?

Yeah  yeah (ah)
I tell these stunners I'm stone cold and Austin Powers
Too busy working  all my niggas talking about power
I made a vow that I won't end up like Kenny Powers
When the money goes and friendships turn sour
Still rapping with soul cause I never sold mine
For the whole time did it without a co-sign
They can't approach their shit the way I approach mine
Dumi knew that he stumbled on a goldmine
They think you bust and it's all roses and daffodils
I could have moved off ends  but I'm in Hackney still
I could have S-curled my hair  my hair is nappy still
I showed you the most how to make the most out of crappy deal
Opened doors everybody getting signed now
I'm having dinner with greatest of all times now
I never do it off of the top  still gotta write it down
Ask the hackers  all the bars is on my iCloud
Still fresher than Brooke Beckham and Ash Ketchum
Took my 'ghini back to Plumstead and back to Peckham
Today's beef then tomorrow your friends
Don't let no writers in my ghost sound borrow no pen
I tell him a man his face I got a problem with him  straight
Uh  I can take your girl in woven sandals
And turn her to Naomi Campbell
Horror stories  I'm so weary of divorce
I might move to North Korea because my career is headed north
You ain't see us in the wagon then I swear it was the Porsche
Take my niggas to LA where this ain't against the law

They’re always on the run
But you keep on working for your place in the sun
When the lights go out in London
Your work has just begun
Someday you will find your place in the sun
Find a place in the sun
Find a place in the sun
Thanks to the spectacular raps that I’m scribbling
It’s ‘Bachs that I’m driven in
Plaques in my living room
Mama look we made it out the flats we was living in
Times I nearly thought I would collapse living in Britian
Smiling in pictures
Flying to fixtures
Never in denial cos the Nile is a river
Rappers on the sly try’na eye my elixir
Jealousy’s a crime bet your pride won’t resist ‘ya
To get to where I am I cried like I was injured
Bled like a soldier perspired like a sprinter
Brother said T keep an eye out from them rinsers
People that you hang with are trying to lynch ya
Never break down
I’ll be there to lift ya
You’re perfect how you are so why they trying to fix ya

On the road to success but feeling like I’m stranded
Started with a goal and then I ended with a hat-trick
Selling out arenas think it’s time to do a new tour
Pennies for the thoughts that I’m about to give you food for
Never show emotion even on a mood board
Sold my bandwagon then I went and bought a two door
Dizzee made me rap and rider made me get my groove on
I just wanna hit a billion views and do a tune Sean
Thinking ’bout life listening to too short
One day they’ll have a statue of me in Madame Tussauds
For that spot I’ma use Cruella Deville power
Or do a Willow and Jaden and use my willpower
Victory is the sweetest defeat is real sour
Together we can move mountains rebuild towers
A lot of hurt still waiting for God to heal ours
Stand up and rebel again the real cowards
They never have time to give you
They’re always on the run (on the run)
But you keep on working for your place in the sun
When the lights go out in London (Disturbing London)
Your work has just begun (we’ve just begun)
There’s no more regrets
Your shadows I follow
But it’s like no one's there
But my tears run dry
But my tears run dry
Oh my fields won't die
When you're not there
So I go
Head first into your puddle of tears
Heart first into the tunnel of fear
Had your very first son at 21
Only old enough to be my mum by a couple of years
Cuddled all of your kids
Soon you’ll be cuddling theirs
And we always hear our names when you mumble your prayers
Maybe it's God disguising a blessing
I’m stuck in the fucking middle on either side of the fences
I think we should live and just let it die
I’ll just put on my fucking shades to hide the pain in my eyes

I won't even listen to this song cause it makes me depressed
Cause I didn’t ever do anything to hurt you
Feels like I don’t have anybody to turn to
You were the only woman I let into my circle
Closer than Celie and Nettie in The Color Purple
Gave me her BBM and said we should keep it virtual
But I think we should just live and just let it die
I’ll just put on my fucking shades and pretend everything’s fine
The pot can’t call the kettle black
Gave your sister my number if you ever wanna chat
Said there was too much on your plate but it wasn’t that
Read your article and didn’t even need to diss you
She was on my tour bus for a month and didn’t even miss you
After the shit we did it's crazy even if she kiss you

Listen babe we need to talk  cause I'm feeling sort of
Like leaving off cause like we resort to some endless arguments
Of which I feel insulted  so I feel we ought to just
Leave this now cause if secret rows
Ever leave this house
We'd be the talk of the town like Harvey and Aleesh
And believe me girl  I don't need this now
So crazy in love and so sprung
It's overwhelming and babe
I just need space to breathe like both lungs
Don't ask for no chances  I won't run
Don't ask me to link  cause I won't come
It's done but it still depends

Don't need them anyway
I know a girl from the ends
She likes to take it down low
She said she wanna let me inside
But her daddy said no
I know a girl with a woo
I call her Paris in my phone
I know a girl from the southside
Told the one I love  I’ll be back one day
Through the fight  through the pain  booked a flight  took a plane
Told her not to cry  I’ll be back one day
Been dreaming this since I was young
So baby girl I’ll be going 'til I’m gone
'Til I’m gone  'til I’m gone
I buy time in Switzerland  I drive round in Monaco
I shook hands with Royalty I make songs that monarchs know
Ti ti ti la so fa  mi mi mi mi re do
Call me Aloe Blacc cause I need that dollar yo
Hic-hic-hiccup  blame it on the liquor
I came through like a stick up now I’m balling like a kick up
I be cutting off these bitches like an episode of Nip Tuck
And yes I am the best man  I’m so sorry 'bout the mix-up
Come out and play  pour out another bottle
Let's do it all today and worry 'bout it all tomorrow
I do it for the thrill  you know I love the rush
And once you get me going I can never get enough
I grew tired  of the same  then one night  packed my things
Told the one I love  I’ll be back one day
Through the fight  through the pain  booked a flight  took a plane
Told her not to cry  I’ll be back one day
Been dreaming this since I was young
So baby girl I’ll be going 'til I’m gone
'Til I’m gone  'til I’m gone

And some friends that playing cricket
And a mistress that is fine like a fucking parking ticket
Haha  I said I’m in it  I’m in it 'til the finish

Leave my iPhone on silent or vibrate

Hold tight all the wifeys
Hold tight all the females that stuck by their man
Through thick and thin
You know we ain't always our best  init
And I know you had to put up with a lot of shit  d'ya know what I mean?
Hold tight Flukes on productions
Yeah  alright  lemme tell you ‘bout someone real special
Ay! Listen  yeah...
You ring me often  nightly
At precisely nine tight
Nigga  never off
But you were one time like 10 o'clock
But that's life  B
And you are my wifey
You look right with your hair to the side
Blue jeans  nice shoes and a yellow top
Likes tunes from bashment to mellow rock
You're a real chick
That's why I moved to you real quick
This is the real shit
I'mma settle with a real chick
Anytime you call  I'll be there quicker than Dorothy's heels click
Look  'cause you make me feel shit
I've never felt in my life
If ever I see my life
I'd wish forever you'd be my wife
'Cause girl whatever you'd be I'll like
And I mean anything
I plan to give you many rings
Look and I don't mean phonecalls
I mean any bling
Anything you want  I'll try and make it possible
'Cause I got fame and fans
But without you  it's like I lost it all
Your sexy Jamaican roots
Make you cook that hot
And not just only that 'cause
Your South American side brings out your backoff
And I would advise those other guys to back off
'Cause you'll be pissed when I can't have a hold of the backoff
Or take them tits to a tax off
Your chick's like a Porsche  she can wax off
Look  she's rideable
But my chick has wax neons and tints
She's brideable
I'm getting sick of making love tunes to make love to
So I'm gonna do this one more tune and send it out to the thugs  too
It's for the wives

You just excite me
Yeah  look  when you say there's no breh like me
Check  I didn't believe in the 'one'
But this female just might be
Look  she's like me: she likes a slice of mango in her ice cream
And dress all smart with the right jeans
So me and her are a tight team
I'm feelin' her and it might seem
Like I'm in love B
When she gets moved in a rave
She's like See him? Yeah  that's my hubby
And trust me we have many plans
So I don't care for any man
Which breh can move to ma chick?
I don't think any can
This chick is like my Nite Nite
And you know how Kano spoke about her
I like her too much to leave  'cause I feel like there's no hope without her
See this chick is my baby girl
And you might find us one day in Sainsbury's holding a baby girl who's
Calling me (d-d-d-d-d)
The sunshine is among us
Let's leave others in the rain
I like it when you come and close the colour of your name
But I'm sick of makin' love tunes to make love to
So I'm gonna do this one more tune and send it out to the thugs  too
The forces of evil could never destroy
The power of the Wonderman
And though the most formidable journey lies ahead
Only one will prevail
Uh  my uncle used to drink a can of Kestrel when life got stressful
Uh  what kinda person should you be when you wanna make people accept you?
Uh  what does it really mean when you dream of being famous and successful
When you were born to be special?
Uh  yeah and I went from the kid in class
Texting radio DJs so they could big me up
To the young rapper everybody's ringing up
Got 'em looking for a sprinkle of that pixie dust
Mad thoughts in my head when it's blowing up
Like  Are you really big enough?
I traded friends for fans  cement for sand
Raise your hand  the Wonderman
Can't you see the bright lights shine in your face?
I'm counting on you to take it all away (The Wonderman)

Bored of being nameless  bored of feeling awkward
When you walk up in the mall and can't afford a pair of trainers
Imagine when it changes  imagine satisfaction when you make it
It's more than being famous
More than the applause and more than any form of status
More than the performances in twenty foreign places
Yeah  and when the fans start grabbing you
Show gratitude with a little braggin' too
Who can say they ran all the obstacles I ran
Raise your hand  the Wonderman
Can't you see the bright lights shine in your face? (Yeah)
I'm counting on you to take it all away (The Wonderman)
I saw the chosen one  they're calling your name (Oh)
Are-are you-you  are-are you-you the Wonderman? (Oh)
There's no turning back from here
Can't you see the bright lights shine in your face? (See the bright lights)
I'm counting on you to take it all away (The Wonderman)
Are-are you-you  are-are you-you the Wonderman?
A million miles away
A message to the main  oh
Seasons come and go
But I will never change
And I'm on my way
(Let's go!)
Yeah  you're listenin' now
They say they ain't heard nothin' like this in a while
That's why they play my song on so many different dials
'Cause I got more fuckin' hits than a disciplined child
So when they see me everybody brrrap  brrraps
Man I’m like a young gun fully black Barack
I cried teardrops over the Massive Attack
I only make hits like I work with a racquet and bat
Look at my jacket and hat  so damn berserk
So down to earth  I'm bringin' gravity back
Adopted by the major  I want my family back
People work hard just to get all their salary taxed
Look  I'm just a writer from the ghetto like Malorie Blackman
(Where the hell's all the sanity at?) Damn
I used to be the kid that no one cared about
That's why you have to keep screamin' 'til they hear you out

Oh  written in the stars
Seasons come and go  but I will never change
And I'm on my way
Because we needed the change  I needed a break
For a sec  I even gave up believing and praying
I even done illegal stuff and was leaded astray
They say that money is the root to the evilest ways
But have you ever been so hungry  it keeps you awake?
It feels like a long time coming  fam
Since the day I thought of that cunning plan
One day I had a dream  I tried to chase it
But I wasn't going nowhere  running man
I knew that maybe someday I would understand
Tryna change a tenner to a hundred grand
Everyone's a kid that no one cares about
You just gotta keep screaming 'til they hear you out
Oh  written in the stars
Seasons come and go  but I will never change
And I'm on my way
Oh  written in the stars
Seasons come and go  but I will never change
Let's get more number 1's and more plaques this year
I say a lotta blurry lines  let's talk facts this year
I might even try goin' back to mass this year
Yeah  told bro that I ain't jokin' this year
Told wifey I might even give up smokin' this year
Told Dumi I'ma rap with more emotion this year
Keep the doors wide open this year
I been coastin' but the last few years have been weird
I'm either self-assured or I'm scared  and that's how I deal with the fear
People speakin' on my name
If you could feel the burnin' in my ears  type of pain that can bring a man to tears
But I'm 'ere still
Rock in a hard place  label tryna make us do it their way
We tellin' them we wanna do it our way
Everythin' is homegrown  comin' like Agave
Young Rico Suave
Everythin' to me is blasé
Told the architect to make the whole thing parquet
3 piece on  Prince of Wales check
Freddy on the boat sayin' Where we gonna sail next?
Where I come from  we talk about Who's goin' jail next?
Not everyone's a shotta  but everybody's runnin' from a coppa
And nobody wants to bait the block up
Aftershock days  Saint James on the block days
Nu Brand Flexxx days  Morley's on the estate
All these memories  these memories I hold
Then next thing I know I end up on the road
Then I give a girl my soul
And next thing you know I'm turnin' 28 years old  woah
Gettin' older  things I seen make me turn colder
Top down  sittin' in this roadster
In these funny times  it's important that we're closer
Started meditation and I started doin' yoga
Killin' all these rappers I'm the scene's Keyser Söze
Ring up for Benz and make him drop it on my chauffeur
We about to get this bread poppin' like a toaster
