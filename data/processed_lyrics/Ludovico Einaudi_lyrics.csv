lyrics
"Can you feel the flame her fading glow
You know
We are slowing down
I can hear your footsteps drowning up
We're burning down
We're burning down
We're the ashes on the ground
We're burning down
We're burning down
We're falling underground
You are
You singing now a song
But you heard it somewhere else I know
We are
We're trying to belong
Pick up the pieces left of us
We're burning down
We're burning down
We're the ashes on the ground
We're burning down
We're burning down
We're falling underground

You know
I've been running in circles around you
If you could tell me I was back in time
You know
I've been running in circles for you
We're burning up
We're burning down
We're the ashes on the ground
We're burning up
We're burning down
We're falling underground
The lie has fallen from the stars
Now your sinking through the night
Out of sight we're falling underground
Pick up the pieces left of us
If you can see me running up to you
We know ...
I've been running in circles around you
If you could tell me I was back in time
You know ...
I've been running in circles for you
We're burning up
We're burning down
We're the ashes on the ground
We're burning up
We're burning down
We're falling underground
We're burning up
We're burning down
We're the ashes on the ground
We're burning up
We're burning down
We're falling underground
You know ..."
