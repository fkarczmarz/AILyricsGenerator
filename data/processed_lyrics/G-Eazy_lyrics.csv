lyrics
"I was skippin' school to get my sack right
My bitch text me and ask why I don't text back
My dog got outta prison and went right back
I'ma hit that if she let me
I'ma hit that if she let me
I don't follow rules and they don't like that
Hit the three twice and ran it right back
I'm only here tonight 'cause in the morning got a flight back
And her booty so big you could park a bus on it

I'ma hit that if she let me
I'ma hit that if she let me
They don't like how I talk that
I don't follow rules and they don't like that
I was skippin' school to get my sack right
My bitch text me and ask why I don't text back
My dog got outta prison and went right back
And I got it out the mud
I'ma hit that if she let me
They don't like how I talk that
I'ma hit that if she let me
They don't like how I talk that
Baby hit my line because she see them stars in the roof
Another man safe from another drive-by
A 100K just off two shows spent that in a day
I'ma hit that if she let me
They don't like how I talk that
I'ma hit that if she let me
They don't like how I talk that
Stunt on everybody just so you can hate
If you just heard about me then you're stupid late
Notice how you stop touching bread like you're losing weight
One day you will see why I'm truly great
I be on the road till I'm old like Willie Nelson is back
20k for a verse you need some help on a track
And I swear I've been all the way to hell and I'm back
Without a cosign at all I put myself on the map
I was chilling with a girl that I just met
Mid conversation got impatient
So I asked her can we fuck yet?
Guess that she was upset
She was bad but I just let
In the summertime? You're a nerd bro
Never leave work never furlough
Ready all times say the word go
Bob Dylan told me don't trust no one over 30
Amount of money that I spend on what I want is obscene
All surreal how we live this good off of a dream
And I swear I do it all for the team
Drunk off of the Heem
Truly feel I'm the coldest alive
Grab a glimpse I'm as rare as it gets
Forget whoever else you might've thought was apparently next
Out here and I'm blessed
I come to town and every girl in the city's at my show and all the parents get stressed
I'm maneuvering with flair and finesse
Working out so I could carry the west
I'll prepare for the test and I'm ready after 5 sets
Lift the whole bay with my biceps
Caution if you try to follow my steps
You will trip and fall get exhausted and collapse
Most of these haters carry germs so I'm cautious giving daps
I just can't fuck with everyone my circle stays the same size
Enjoy the lifestyle that fame buys
After party is at Drai's in Vegas where they have the view
Chasing nobody marathon my own race
I do it for the bay area that's home base
They try to run next to us but there ain't no space
I feel like life just switched to hyperspeed though as of recent
The difference between yourself and me is you're just decent
A garden full of flowers grew its way up through the cement
If I ever said I'm never scared just know I really mean it
I dreamed about the top I had a vision and I seen it
If you know the work comes first then you and I are in agreement
And it's a long haul but I work harder than them all
So come back in 5 years and we can talk about achievement

: Hey let me ask you something. Do you worry about achievement? Does it worry you or do you just do your own thing and say here it is you either accept it or not?
They say I'm next to get it
They bring your name up last
And while I made it splash  rappers came and passed
But still I ask myself
How long does famous last? (Yeah  but I ain't worried about it tonight)
How long does famous last? (Blow all this cash  I might)
How long does famous last? (Tell them welcome to the good life)
How long does famous last?
How long does famous last?
I'm addicted to this lifestyle
Never going back to no basic shit
When we on tour every night's wild
Thinking about the days we weren't making shit
Spending everything just to make it back
Saying everything never take it back
So if you don't fuck with me I'm okay with that
I'm okay with that (okay with that)
In a black shirt and some faded jeans
Been around the world in these APC's
Working non stop trying to take the keys
Off the lot next week spending 80 g's
Intro my floor to your lady's knees
Always on tour cause I'm making cheese
Michigan in February is 8 degrees
And the fans waiting outside could maybe freeze
Yeah  smoking on killa
Never going on unless your team is strong
Yeah  finally making skrilla
Everywhere I go bring my team along

Still right here with the oldest faces

They bring your name up last
And while I made it splash  rappers came and passed

I'm trying to marry Kate Upton
Blow this money too quickly
To them squares who trying to hate: fuck them
You can't catch me  I move too swiftly
I'm always going through customs
When I leave I'm knowing you miss me
We run through bottles like nothin'
Like I'm tryna drown in this whiskey
Indulge in everything we wish
We drink it straight with no mixers
Got bitch drinks if you squeamish
At the after parties  no pictures
My bag of trees looks greenish
Got a bad bitch to roll swishers
This lifestyle's the sweetest
Man I'm shining now just like fixtures
Yeah  do it for my city
Everywhere I go bro  I rep the Bay
Yeah  tell you it's a pity
But hating fucks always got shit to say uh
Cause I'm almost famous
Still right here with the oldest faces
Swear I came up from the coldest places
Young man gets everything  he goes and chases
Aw man
Young with too much cash  watch how I came up fast
They say I'm next to get it
They bring your name up last
And while I made it splash  rappers came and passed
But still I ask myself

 New York City
 it was ridiculous
 just really do that shit?
 nobody can get control of me
 get over me
 you're mad that you're not as big as me
 mad you're listening to Halsey sing to me
 I'll be here until infinity
 and all of my shits go platinum
 I'd hurt you if I start braggin'
 no one gives a fuck about him
 heard you opening up for Fall Out Boy
 usually I don't do this shit
 though
 you're mad about it so
 it's keeping New York's shit alive
 and you ain't have no problems
 whatever happened we forgot it (Fuckin' punk)
 talkin' 'bout me
 it’s just a bluff
 but respect to the OG
 what's up with you? This behavior is nothing new
 tell me why doesn't Puff fuck with you
 I ain't want to do this ether
 I don't understand your issue
But nothing you've been dropping yet astonishes
Yeah  next shit I'm about to say is obvious
But criticism's worth some more than compliments
Yeah  we're living at a different speed
Trying to sprout a money tree  we started out with just a seed
Always working  never hindered by a little fatigue
Rapping in arenas  I'm still playing in a different league
Yeah  you still playing wiffle ball
Dropping opportunities I'm picking up a different call
Holding out for bigger checks to lift us all
Never kept a safety net to catch us even if I fall
Rather risk it all than play it safe
You like to sprinkle salt and player hate
My team can eat  I'll share a plate
I had the black on black  I swear you're late
Everyday I got some fly shit on
Keeping all black outfit on
I already bagged most the chicks
That you out here trying to get on
You just catching up to what I've been on
Yeah  that's what I've been on

That's the shit I've been on
I be thinking forward though
Thinking quick and making plans  y'all be thinking sort of slow
You be thinking more bitches  I be thinking more dough
Showed them all I do this shit but trust me  I got more to show
And I'm always snatching chicks
Flier than Aladdin's whips
Haters on the sideline bitter  hella fucking mad he's rich
Took your darling off your arm  now she just wanna be daddy's bitch
They can't even find me where I'm chillin' like my addy switched
Dreaming about these M's  told my team let's all get 'em
Make a classic song  last as long as raw denim
Every track's a problem  what I spit is all venom
Everyday I got some fly shit on
Keeping all black outfit on
I already bagged most the chicks
That you out here trying to get on
You just catching up to what I've been on
Yeah  that's what I've been on

My love is  working hard yadadamean?
I've been sitting on the charts like a beach chair
My last album spent 52 weeks there
Almost finished with the second  you should be scared
Storms coming you should go inside and prepare
No shortcuts there ain't no cheats there
I brought the whole city out like a street fair  yeah
And fuck it I'm the coldest white rapper in the game
Since the one with the bleached hair
Yeah  you love it when I talk shit
I get around  yeah I'm on my 2Pac shit
I kinda feel there's no girl I could not get
I'm not found at the function if it's not lit
Yeah  it's nothing that no one can tell me
I made it here dolo  nobody to help me
From the Bay  the birthplace of the hyphy
So bitch  come and say to my face you don't like me

So there's one left watch me go get her
Yeah  they tell me calm down
Fuck that I'm too lit can't calm down
I'm so drunk right now I might fall down
And I don't give a fuck how boring do y'all sound
Up and down on a Wednesday
Then we do the same shit the next day
The next star out the Bay is Eazy

500 dollar limit dreaming about a black card
 with a rocket in the back yard
 not trying to play that card
 even sweats you look attractive in
 and you been down for too long
 that's why I could never move on
 from sleeping on a futon
 I knew back then
 so deep in love
 no one competes
 with you I have no sight
 pick it up where I left you at
 yeah we went through that
 I'mma get you that
 baby let's do that
 I notice these things
 way back
 when your vision's far it's tough to see things
 we might split an entree
 that's no relation to Andre
 that's what my moms say
 money goes  People switch to funny roles
 I knew back then
 so deep in love
 no one competes
I wish for love but sweet love takes her time
Every star waits for the darkness to shine
Why do I cry when the tears never dry
Why do I drown when I look through your eyes
Love is the morning that succeeds the night
I was gone by the first sign of the light
When it's dark out
I search for love but don't find it
Just sex n drugs but don't mind it
Because nothing's real I'm reminded
And
I Do suppose
Ignorance is bliss truth be told
They say go smash these groupie hoes
N Spend money on some newer clothes
N put poison up through your nose
Well
Eventually everything fades
Even the brightest of Colors turn greys
Highs comes down But the pain still stays
Even the longest of nights turn days
Then
Wake up and it's over
Love to escape cuz I hate being sober
& you and I we never had closure
We just knew when it was over

Don't let me go
Don't let me go
Don't let me go
Troubled mind of an Artist
But the star comes alive in the darkness
Late nights Lower east side apartments
But the night is impossible to Harness
Soon as comes it Departs us
Couldn't stay & love you so I became Heartless
Lost track of our long term targets
Live n Die young leave a beautiful carcass
Thinkin when we just had met
Realizing now that it just wasn't meant
But how would we know If the time wasn't spent?
If only we could live where the sun doesn't set
Somewhere it's always light out and happy
You and I were like a Sid vicious and Nancy
I mean it was bound to be tragic its
No way this ever coulda lasted
Don't let me go
Don't let me go
Don't want none of your downtown love
Downtown love
Don't want none of your downtown love
Just wonderin' if you notice me
Just wonderin' if you notice me
Wood floors in your Soho apartment
Every morning always roll one and spark it
Credit cards left on your glass table
You been wildin' since I met you last April
Always claimin' that you're not the type to notice hype
But that's the reason why we kicked it and you know it's right
It was fun while it lasted but you'll never get it
For a minute thought about forever like it's Jodeci
But now you're spiraling and falling over hopelessly

Just wonderin' if you notice me

And you're just spending your allowance cash
But it drains like the sand in an hour glass
And when it does is when I see you turnin' sour fast
Free falling from the sky 'till the gravel caught us
Doin' drugs on the surface of Apple products
Started beautiful but look at where havoc brought us
And it was fun but I could never be the one for you
But it was unbelievable when I was fucking you
Thought that I was momentarily in love with you
And even more in love with attention
Walking through life so eager for affection
Downtown love
Don't want none of your downtown love
Downtown love
Don't want none of your downtown love
Just wonderin' if you notice me
Just wonderin' if you notice me
So in love with the scene she was
4AM is when she leaves clubs
She's...
The road to riches could throw you off at the next turn
Fell in love with the fast life but started it slow
The first time is what she kept on searching trying to find
Scared to lose it all but everything was nothing inside
Couldn't face the truth but everyone's got something to hide
It's ironic how conscious she is of how she appear
Two hours getting dressed but still can't look herself in the mirror
Downtown love
In case you was wonderin'  I ain't even plan for it
I just left L.A.  barely caught the plane
Fuckin' TSA  swear a nigga ran for it
Ain't used to this fame shit
This you-all-know-my-name-shit
Me  I'm just the same kid
That fucked around and made it
Fucked over my main chick
Damn  she was the main chick
Thinkin' 'bout the game
I shouldn't have played  but I played it
And now I'm missin' your love  I'ma roll up (Oh)
I'm faded once again  I don't know where I am
But I just know I'm driftin' far from you (Ooh)
I'm tryna keep my head strong  but my heart (Woah)
Won't just let me grow away from you
Don't you know we driftin' off  driftin' off?
I know you think that it's my fault we fallin' off
All this hope and disregard  driftin' off
I know you think there ain't no fault that far apart

Uh  I blame it on the distance
Why I'm fuckin' with these bitches
These numbers in my phone
You probably got a mistress
Probably every week it switches
Now is this cause for concern?
And should I be suspicious?
I'm overseas trippin'  a million miles away
And she's still in L.A.  my mom's out in the Bay
And these overseas minutes add up  that's a lot to pay
She's been tryna track me down
I feel like I'm cattin' now
Dodgin' her when she's the one
I'm out here trippin'  actin' wild
Start to wonder if I've changed
I'm like how could that be now?
Would these bitches be here really if I wasn't rappin' now? (Oh!)
Now tell me now
I'm faded once again (Yeah)  I don't know where I am
But I just know I'm driftin' far from you (Ooh)

I know you think there ain't no fault that far apart
Ooh  and now I'm missin' your love (Ooh)
Uh  I'm just so conflicted
It's been so long since we've kicked it
And I can't lie  I've missed it
But somewhere the current shifted
And now I'm somewhere else
Far away  feel like we drifted
Hard to face the facts
I'm drinkin' to escape 'em  then get lifted
Get swept under the rug 'til I'm trippin' on the pile
Did it change somethin' different for a while?
Yeah  we grew apart with time
We ain't kicked it in a while
But I still think about you now
Without you  see there's differences now
But shit happens  how could we have known?
Nothin' can prepare us
From sleepin' at your parents  now to sold-out shows in Paris
To parties at my hotels  ashin' blunts up off my terrace
Tell me  how'd we ever come to live this careless? (Oh!)
Tell me now
I'm faded once again  I don't know where I am (Ooh)
But I just know I'm driftin' (Driftin') far from you (Ooh  yeah)
I'm tryna keep my head strong  but my heart (Woah)

Dear Gerald  you're fourteen years and a truant
You're trying to find your place  and figure out where you fit
You're finna start rappin' with a kid you went to school with
See  you're going to have to prove that you ain't soft and you ain't stupid
And you gon' have to scrap with some kids that you ain't cool with
You got a short temper  just be careful when you lose it
You wanna be the man  but it's gon' take some time to prove it
You'll fall in love  but she's gon' break your heart and put you through it
Fuck falling for that bullshit  you gon' fall in love with music
You're finna get arrested  almost fuck around and lose it
Spend days in juvy standing at the window  looking through it
Nothing in life is promised  not even free-time is
If it was easy  everyone would do it

I mean  I was fucking up
My moms made me move to New Orleans and shit  I went to school down there on a scholarship
I finally got my shit together  I started taking music seriously
Then it started to kinda pop off a little bit  almost
Got a big head from them labels trying to bring you out
'Til they passed on you  they ain't see what they was missing out
On  that flight home gave you some shit to think about
Scrambling trying to figure out  went back to the drawing board
Know they say rejection's only supposed to make you want it more
But  what the fuck you supposed to do? This is all you're living for
Really it was that and Dev  that was all you had
Paying rent by engineering other rappers at the pad
Then These Things Happened  you finally seen a bag
You drove down the highway  a fork in the road
A normal life with her  or going for broke?
I seen an open lane and then I drove straight through it
If it was easy  everyone would do it

Pull out your heart to make the being alone

I literally sold all my shit
I moved out of my place in New Orleans
I was bouncing around  living out of a suitcase
Crashing on friends' couches
Living at AirBnb's and hotels
Trying to make the album
Trying to make When It's Dark Out
If I could take it there  that'd be great
Dear Gerald  life changed since you dropped your second album
And Me  Myself & I just went 7x Platinum
But now you're 27 and it's time to be a legend
Back when it all started  grinding hard on that promo tour
Tired from the night before and the night before and the night before
Don't complain  this is what you signed up for
They all want something different from you  tell them all patience
Been trying to be famous  been trying to be A-list
When you arrive  it will appear as if there's nothing to it
But  you planted the seeds and you grew it
There's people taking credit for success that they had nothing to do with
If it was easy  everyone would do it
This game is not…

So now you're here
What you gon' do with it?
You know?
Make no mistake  listen it's the life that I was chosen for
All I prayed for was an open door
I've been rich  I've been broke before
I've seen the floor
You try to put me in a box  I'll box out like Okafor
And fuck being indecisive now I'm so for sure
And fuck Trump  it's like What the fuck we voted for?
And most of y'all should probably party less and focus more
And if that line resonates  you're probably who I wrote it for
Where will I go from here? IDK
They want me to architect Rome  in a day
Juice knew I was greatness when he looked at me
Right away  I've made platinum records that'll never see the light of day
This is what the whole world's been waiting for
The crowd's jumping  going dumb till they break the floor
Come take a walk inside my mind  come and take a tour
I'm really not playing  what the fuck you take me for?

And ten years would pass before Mom sees anybody else
Who Melissa was and why she wasn't another man
Over the years when a secret was how she kept it
By '05 things had gotten worse
Becomin' more reclusive and the pills should have been alerts

(G-Eazy  let E-Feezy tell his story!)
It ain't funny what I've been through
Your enemy can be some kin to you
I started off hella broke
Hung around people that's older than me  took notes
Momma worked three jobs on the weekends
Used to help her wash the walls at Mare island
In Vallejo naval houses
Havin' a roof over my head was my allowance
The oldest of four  young adults
Surrounded by grief  big dreams and hope
They hated and they doubted
How did you take it? Took it with a grain of salt
I wanted it badly  they couldn't stop me  Indie
Erry label wanted to sign me
Grew up on Short and Freddie B
(Who else?) Magic Mike and Calvin T
They used to tell me I couldn't go too far alone
They used to always say I couldn't go too far alone

But now I'm here  bitch
From the BART train to a tour bus
Still the same game except I'm pulling more sluts
More butts  more bucks  never giving more fucks
Did it my way  I'm never taking short cuts
Raised in that town like fool  who put you upon?
Huh  E-40  Mac Dre is who I grew up on
I'm just selling game got you if you need a coupon
You can check my resume  see every beat I threw up on
Smoking on grapes  rollin up swishers  no papes
Back of the Ghost  closed drapes
I'm a boss tycoon
Girls in the crowd all swoon
Super high  I'm off to the moon
And I vanished with your girl then I took her to my room
She wants me to slay ooh-kay  that means doom
Boom  and it's to be expected
Knew this would happen as soon as she texted
They used to tell me I couldn't go too far alone
They used to always say I couldn't go too far alone

These girls wanna tie a kid down and keep me around
But I tell them what they wanna hear
They like how it sounds
If we go three rounds then she'll fall in love faster
The very next morning I’m Casper
In another city for a show somewhere getting plastered
It’s a disaster  to her I’m a drug
And she speak another language like she from another planet
And she tell me that she love me but it’s hard to believe
And I swear I’m really not that shady
But you can’t blame me for who I’ve met lately
Nowadays chicks wanna call a kid baby
I give in to every groupie with a fat butt
Chicks say I’m the man

Adds to the mystique of what might exist
Lurked your Instagram tryna like your pics
So that's probably why I'm all acting brash
I'm like an addict how I have to smash
Cause she's never catching a man
If it don't pan out I'm a flash in a pan
We just spent the night now send her back to her man
Maybe some different time our paths will cross and then we'll drink some wine
You'll end up a verse when I think of a line
Or when I need a muse on a record just like this one
She think it's her but it's just fun
When I touch on these topics
I'm thinking 'bout when she's topless
Out on vacations going in the tropics
That was before we broke apart just like chopsticks
Girls slip away and then find their way inside flows
Guess I could've took that chance I suppose

I always wondered 'bout why you let me go
We just went out for drinks
Where you turned me on
That night you told me that you heard it in the background
Not just any music talking Mr. Soul Child
Said you was scared to come fuck with me cause you see I'm chasing dreams
But that mean that I don't need no love
So tonight you should go and take a chance with her
Don't let that love escape
Don't let that love escape
I know we fell out of touch and this probably won't amount to much
But if we're trying to get back to where it got away
All the fights and the bouts and such
Your best friend hate it but she doubts a bunch
But rainfall after droughts are lush
Shoulda-wouldas always crossed my mind
Years passed guess we lost the time like a misplaced watch
But what if it seems that the dreams we both chase
Conflict with each other's then there won't be no space
To make a home now when you know there's no place
I guess there'll always be a part I won't face
Real life and that's why I left with no trace
Knew I couldn't answer the please don't go face
But right now I feel like my life's a boat race
Yeah it's sad but we're worlds apart
And life is short
Maybe I was made the villain but I'mma save this feelin'
For a song that I might record
 I know I'm crazy  but you're sick  too
 it's too long
 it's all wrong (You know)
 the way I always miss you (Ayy  yeah)
 the way I always miss you  yeah (Yeah)
 a promise I should stick to
 I said I promised I would quit you
 but it's powerful  it grips you
 you think you got control until I see you  can't resist you
 some I won't admit to
 everybody wants to fix you
 but I ain't got no crystal
 I always go back? (Go back)
 I know that
 I always

 it's feelin' like a week  this shit is stressful
 wish you wasn't distant
 still wish this shit was different
 wishin' it was something that could fix it
 different substances  I mix it
 try to draw the line and then she sniffs it
 I give you my word and then you twist it
 I think the paparazzi
 still can't seem to find out what's the issue
 too
 they don't know about the shit we've been through

Tryna see through a cloud of doubt
Goin' till a pound is out
We all got problems too proud to pout
Takin' long walks when I'm out and about
Dreaming 10 mil just to round amount
Wonder how the charts feel
Everyday I'm here I try to write songs
Cause I know the beat'll longer than my heart will
You can tell my girl i'mma be runnin' late
Can't tell how much longer she's gonna wait
A real good girl with a dirt bag guy
She could probably do better than me
Like a rich-ass lawyer with a house and car
Who takes care of her and never leaves
Nobody here for me to try and impress
I'd rather chase a dream
Than be content to sit behind a desk
I used to live with the highest stress
Just believe

Lately I've been losing sleep
A couple bad habits that I choose to keep
My intake of booze is steep
Pop a couple of pills that I use to sleep
I think I took a few this week
I'm trying to adjust to the hugest leap
But I'm afraid of failing
My anxiety is getting too severe
Dying young might be my truest fear
But now my future's bright and my view is clear
There's no way in hell I could lose this year
I worked 10 years 'fore it ever paid off
You don't know what I had to trade off
I shed tears when my moms got laid off
You would do the same shit if you was on the ropes
Shit gets realer when you zooming up close
There sure ain't nothin' iller
Man I'm a lady killer  if I want her I'mma steal her

Swear this shit goes down like every other night
Man I fuckin' love this life
Put it down and these hoes sayin' they love the pipe
Off that whiskey  101 proof
I'm just mixing that with Vermouth
She'll be taken if you're aloof
We just fucked on top of that roof
This is real life  these ain't just no raps I kick in the booth
Every thing I say is the truth
Make her disappear just like poof
Then she's gone
Addicted don't know what the fuck I'm on
I can't stop it when I feel it coming on
When we chill it starts with smoking something strong
Take her down and then she'll be the surface that I'm cumming on

I try to talk it out but this was all she speak about  she said...
I  I  I  I  I want to love you 
But if it's not right what can I do?
Everything will be alright 
So baby get some sleep tonight
Uh  so if tonight turns out to be
The last night before you peaced then walked out on me 
Let's let it all hang out like a balcony
One last time  the best is what you about to see 
So make it worth it tonight  only so you know I never hurt you in spite
Love me like you never will again  it's our last time
Tonight forget about the pastime 
Everything will be alright

Drunk listening to Gucci throwed
Who appeared to be the type to be down to cut
She took another shot and said “turn down for what?”
Silly hoes party so much these days
The Monica Lewinsky’s who give the BJ’s
This songs full of all the clichés
Neighbors bugging saying ‘‘please just try to keep it civil!’’

Never thought touring the world all year would be something I might actually do
Friends came through got me so high
I forgot who I was passin' it to
Party in a mansion splash in a pool
Reminiscing '06 back in the school
When my whole crew would come through and rap with us too
Couple of them been goons  packin in a tool
Go ahead try and talk shit on me
I squad up come back with a crew
Call me a bitch see what that's gonna do
Fights in the streets like that shit was cool

Dreamed since I was just a baby

Missing every birthday anniversary
Yesterday my moms got out of surgery
Wasn't even in town
Shows and after parties what I've been 'round
Finding out the news late
Imagine how that shit sound
Sit down priorities are all over the place and shit
Stress levels rise and that J gets lit
Try on shoes that Jay Z fit
Fuck all that complacent shit
I'm just dropping crazy shit
Trying to outdo those fool who think they can spit
But I can't even lie
All this real life shit is passing me by
Talking to myself and I'm asking me why
Would I feel better as an average guy?
But I know that's just a lie
Pour up a glass and get high
Wonder if this rockstar life taking a toll on me like I'm asking to die
Going on tour for 6 months  hug moms right after she sigh
Look up wish me luck when you see that plane pass in the sky
No Stress bullshit gets passed to the side
Working hard to make sure I'mma be the man when I die

Can't tell if you're oblivious or if you really mean it
I wonder just how many other folks before me seen it
But that shit love can make you blind to a lot of shit
But I can't waste my time on this right now I gotta split
We had a shot up until you stirred the pot
And then you did some shit I never would have thought

I get right back up when I fall  you know
Yea  Catching shots from head to toe
I don't need no medic though
A modern Gatsby chasing Daisy I should have let it go
But you never know
I might have dreamed too high  rather way too low
Cause you wouldn't stick around back when I wasn't making dough
Till you see a poster with my face for me to play a show
And your friends are like He made it now! Fucking way to go
Used to dream about becoming rich
You ain't see the vision
I ain't make it fast enough for you so you ain't stickin' with him
I used to think about a life with you and music I was wishin'
For them both but you ain't see it 'till I brought one to fruition
But for some reason now and then I still consider
The what if's and the maybes but that shit just makes me bitter
We had a shot up until you stirred the pot
And then you did some shit I never would have thought
I get right back up when I fall  you know
But every shot I'm getting closer  getting closer
Is it true that eighty proof is the reason I'm with you?
Oh  I know that I'll regret this when it's over
I just know that I'll regret this when it's over
Eazy
But them drunk nights are more fun than sober ones
But I got this bad bitch tryna throw me buns
If I listened to my Uncs  all them older ones
They all talk about karma  how it slowly comes (Uh)
But life is short  enjoy it while you're young
Spend my bank account tonight and have to borrow funds
It all started with a light glass
Now I'm asking How long could tonight last?
Man  she had the 'eeh' face with a tight ass
If I had a shot less  then I might pass
But I'm faded and I got a little sedated
I can't believe we made it  every night we celebrate it
I live like Jim Morrison  no telling where I'll take it

I slipped up with my ex and I smashed again
Stayed over  now she's 'bout to get attached again
Walls built up around  they come crashing in
Passed out at 6 A.M.  but she's up at ten
Doing this was not in my plans
She got up and saw rubbers in the trash can
Hoop earrings some bitch left on my nightstand
Cussed me out and stormed off like Alright then (Uh)
On both sides  that was bad for 'em
Why do people do things that be bad for 'em?
Say we done with these things  then we ask for 'em
When the sun comes down  then we transform
Yeah  you can probably bet this
By this time tomorrow  I'll probably regret this
Try  but it all falls down like Tetris
No telling where an eighty proof gets us  yeah
Oh  I know that I'll regret this when I'm sober
But every shot I'm getting closer  getting closer

Ever seen an angel with some horns?
Everybody got their own demons
When you move this fast as I'm movin'
All the toxic things that I'm using
All the substances I'm abusin'
The decision is mine for the choosin'
But I can't understand what I'm losin'
I know a Gemini can be confusing
Split right down the middle like there's two of me
This is everything that comes with celebrity
Think about what I spent on some jewelry
But it all comes back to me usually
And it's none of y'alls business truthfully

And this shit got more and more digits than a license plate

 until I pass the fuck out
 never struck out
 just trying to get a buck out

Last night I sent a message
Essentially along the lines of saying I'm in town
Let's chill and get a drink
The text bubble popped up and disappeared again
Like I don't want it gettin' weird again
And I don't wanna fight
And I don't want you shedding tears again
Just 'cause I ain't spoken about you
You'll probably tell your friends that I wrote this about you
The voices in my head have liked to yell at me lately
I still can't believe what they've been telling me lately
Let me know
'Cause I do but
With skinny waists and drug habits
She expects the free drinks
Always comes around when weed stinks
Only ever really fuck off and on
Never see her these days 'cause I'm often gone
Back this week from across the pond
Noticed I was close to the block she's on
Elevator to the floor her loft is on
That's closure
Tomorrow act like I don't know her
She said she can't feel her face
(She said she can't feel her face)
But you knew that from the start

She's fine as fuck and she knows it
She draws the line then she blows it
Feels a fit then she throws it
She pops a bar now she's dozing
Truly the bullshit has gotten old
Superficial with a rotten soul
Head to her place then we lock the door
Making bad calls when I'm off the blow
Right now I know you felt it
I touched her then she melted
She said she can't feel her face
(She said she can't feel her face)
Right now I can't feel my heart
For your feelings there's no place
But you knew that from the start
Missing everything you say
It's not important what you stand for
You're asking will he be the one
I'll be gone before you're done tonight
Waiting for another day
You're not getting what you paid for
Trying to salvage what's undone and deny you got outrun tonight
