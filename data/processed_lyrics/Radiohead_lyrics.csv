" listen to me
 made me happy
 the good angel
 but
How come I end up where I went wrong?
Won't take my eyes off the ball again
How come I end up where I started?
How come I end up where I went wrong?
Won't take my eyes off the ball again
First you reel me out and then you cut the string
You used to be alright
What happened?
Did the cat get your tongue?
Did your string come undone?
One by one
One by one
It comes to us all
It's as soft as your pillow
You used to be alright
What happened?
Fads for whatever

How come I end up where I started?

Won't take my eyes off the ball again
Are you such a dreamer
To put the world to rights?
I'll stay home forever
Where two and two always makes a five
I'll lay down the tracks
Sandbag and hide
January has April showers
And two and two always makes a five
It's the devil's way now
There is no way out
You can scream and you can shout
It is too late now
Because
You have not been
Paying attention
Paying attention

I try to sing along
But I get it all wrong
'Cause I'm not  'cause I'm not
I swat 'em like flies
But like flies  the bugs keep coming back
Not  but I'm not
All hail to the thief
All hail to the thief
But I'm not  but I'm not
But I'm not  but I'm not
Don't question my authority or put me in a box
'Cause I'm not  'cause I'm not
Oh  go and tell the king
That the sky is falling in
But it's not  but it's not  but it's not
Dragging out the dead
Singing I miss you
Snakes and ladders
Flip the lid
Out pops the cracker
Smacks you in the head
Knifes you in the neck
Kicks you in the teeth
Steel toe caps
Takes all your credit cards
Get the eggs
Get the flan in the face
The flan in the face
The flan in the face
Take it with the love it's given
Take it with a pinch of salt
Take it to the taxman
I promise to be good
Don't look in the mirror
At the face you don't recognize

Walking like giant cranes and
In a tight little world and are you on the list?
Cold wives and mistresses
Cold wives and Sunday papers
City boys in first class
Don't know we're born at all
Just know someone else is gonna come and clean it up
Born and raised for the job
Someone always does
I keep the wolf from the door but he calls me up
Steal all my children if I don't pay the ransom
And I'll never see them again if I squeal to the cops
In a jackknifed juggernaut
I am born again
In the neon sign
Scrolling up and down
I am born again
In an interstellar burst
I'm back to save the universe
Of the innocent
I am born again
In a fast German car
I'm amazed that I survived
An airbag saved my life
In an interstellar burst

I am all the days that you choose to ignore
You are all I need
You're all I need
I'm in the middle of your picture
Lying in the reeds
I am a moth who just wants to share your light
I'm just an insect trying to get out of the night
I only stick with you because there are no others
You are all I need
You're all I need
I'm in the middle of your picture
Lying in the reeds
And you're still standing in your dressing gown
I know all the things around your head
And what they do to you
What are we coming to?
What are we gonna do?
Blame it on the black star
Blame it on the falling sky
Blame it on the satellite
That beams me home
The troubled words of a troubled mind
I try to understand what is eating you
Since that I last slept with you
What are we coming to?
I just don't know anymore

I'm gonna melt down
Blame it on the black star
Blame it on the falling sky
Blame it on the satellite
That beams me home
Understand
What it is
I've done wrong
Full of holes
Check for pulse
Blink your eyes
One for yes
Two for no
I have no idea what I am talking about
I am trapped in this body and can't get out
You killed the sound
Removed backbone
A pale imitation
With the edges sawn off
I have no idea what you are talking about
Your mouth moves only with someone's hand up your arse
Has the light gone out for you?
Because the light's gone out for me
It is the twenty-first century
It is the twenty-first century
It can follow you like a dog
It brought me to my knees
They got a skin and they put me in
They got a skin and they put me in
On the lines wrapped 'round my face
On the lines wrapped 'round my face
And for anyone else to see

I'm a lie

Do not cry out or hit the alarm
You know we're friends till we die
Climbing up the walls
It's always best when the light is off
It's always better on the outside

Fifteen blows to your mind

Shut the eyes in the cupboard

Beyond the point

Beyond me

A white room

Where the sun comes
Through
We are
Just happy to serve

There's a spacecraft blocking out the sky
And there's nowhere to hide
You run to the back and you cover your ears
But it's the loudest sound you've ever heard
And all we trapped rag doll cloth people
We are helpless to resist
Into our darkest hour
Even at this angle  and so we crumble
You've gotta be kidding me  the grass grows over me
It's whatever you say it is  in split infinity
Then into your life  there comes a darkness
And a spacecraft blocking out the sky
And there's nowhere to hide
You run to the back and you cover your ears
But it's the loudest sound you've ever heard
Into your darkest hour

The wind rushing 'round my open heart

Don't lose your nerve

For a fake Chinese rubber plant
In a fake plastic earth
That she bought from a rubber man
In a town full of rubber plants
To get rid of itself
It wears her out
It wears her out
It wears her out
It wears her out
She lives with a broken man
A cracked polystyrene man
Who just crumbles and burns
He used to do surgery
For girls in the eighties
But gravity always wins
And it wears him out

And if I could be who you wanted

All the time
Comfortable  not drinking too much
Regular exercise at the gym three days a week
Getting on better with your associate employee contemporaries
At ease
Eating well
No more microwave dinners and saturated fats
A patient  better driver
A safer car
Baby smiling in back seat
Sleeping well  no bad dreams
No paranoia
Careful to all animals
Never washing spiders down the plughole
Keep in contact with old friends
Enjoy a drink now and then
Will frequently check credit at moral bank
Hole in wall
Favors for favors
Fond  but not in love
Charity standing orders
On Sundays ring road supermarket
No killing moths or putting boiling water on the ants
Car wash  also on Sundays
No longer afraid of the dark or midday shadows
Nothing so ridiculously teenage and desperate
Nothing so childish
At a better pace
Slower and more calculated
No chance of escape
Now self-employed
Concerned  but powerless
An empowered and informed member of society Pragmatism  not idealism
Will not cry in public
Less chance of illness
Tires that grip in the wet
Shot of baby strapped in back seat
A good memory
Still cries at a good film
Still kisses with saliva
No longer empty and frantic
Like a cat
Tied to a stick
That's driven into
Frozen winter shit
The ability to laugh at weakness
Calm
Fitter  healthier and more productive
A pig
In a cage
You really messed up everything
If you could take it all back again
Strike up the tinderbox
Why should I be good if you're not?
This is a foul tasting medicine
A foul tasting medicine
To be trapped in your full stop
Truth will mess you up (All the good times)

A frightening place  the faces are concrete grey
And I'm wondering  should I turn around?
Buy another ticket? The panic is coming on strong
So cold  from the inside out
No great drama  message coming in
In the oh-so-smug glassy eyed light of day
Glassy eyed light of day
Where the path trails off and heads down the mountain
Through the dry bush  I don't know where it leads
And I don't really care
Where the path trails off and heads down the mountain
Through the dry bush  I don't know where it leads
And I don't really care
I feel this love to the core
 don't you  boy
 ever stop
 it's the best thing that you've ever had
 ever had
I just want to be your lover
No matter how it ends
No matter how it starts
Forget about your house of cards
And I'll do mine
Forget about your house of cards
And I'll do mine
The infrastructure will collapse
From voltage spikes
Throw your keys in the bowl
Kiss your husband 'goodnight'
And forget about your house of cards
And I'll do mine
Forget about your house of cards
And I'll do mine
(Your ears should be burning)
That's not me

I walk through walls
I float down the Liffey

No longer wound up like a spring
Before you've had too much
Come back in focus again
The walls are bending shape
They've got a Cheshire cat grin
All blurring into one
This place is on a mission
Before the night owl
Before the animal noises
Closed circuit cameras
Before you're comatose
Before you run away from me
Before you're lost between the notes
The beat goes 'round and 'round
The beat goes 'round and 'round
I never really got there
I just pretended that I had
Words are blunt instruments
Words are sawn-off shotguns

Won't stop now  won't slack off

To stop from falling down a mine

Where all this love has been in vain

Black-eyed angels swam with me
A moon full of stars and astral cars
And all the figures I used to see
All my lovers were there with me
All my past and futures
And we all went to heaven in a little row boat
There was nothing to fear and nothing to doubt
I jumped into the river
Black-eyed angels swam with me
A moon full of stars and astral cars
And all the figures I used to see
All my lovers were there with me
All my past and futures
And we all went to heaven in a little row boat
There was nothing to fear and nothing to doubt
There was nothing to fear and nothing to doubt

The smell of the warm summer air
I live in a town where you can't smell a thing
You watch your feet for cracks in the pavement
Up above aliens hover
Making home movies for the folks back home
Of all these weird creatures who lock up their spirits
Drill holes in themselves and live for their secrets
I wish that they'd swoop down in a country lane
Late at night when I'm driving
Take me on board their beautiful ship
Show me the world as I'd love to see it
I'd tell all my friends but they'd never believe me
They'd think that I'd finally lost it completely
I'd show them the stars and the meaning of life
They'd shut me away

To hide all the dirt and pain
'Cause I'd be scared that there's nothing underneath
And who are my real friends?
Have they all got the bends?
Am I really sinking this low?
My baby's got the bends  oh no
We don't have any real friends
Just lying in a bar with my drip feed on
Talking to my girlfriend  waiting for something to happen
I wish it was the '60s  I wish we could be happy

Where do we go from here?
The planet is a gunboat in a sea of fear
And where are you?
They brought in the CIA
The tanks and the whole marines
To blow me away  to blow me sky high
My baby's got the bends
We don't have any real friends
Just lying in a bar with my drip feed on
Talking to my girlfriend  waiting for something to happen
I wish it was the '60s  I wish we could be happy
I wanna live  breathe
I wanna be a part of the human race
I wanna live  breathe
Where do we go from here?
The words are coming out all weird
It touches  like a breeze
It shines its understanding
Open on all channels
Ready to receive
'Cause we're not at the mercy
Of your chimeras and spells
Your chimeras and spells
Mm-hmm
We are of the earth
To her we do return
The future is inside us
It's not somewhere else
It's not somewhere else
It's not somewhere else
(One day at a time)
One day at a time
We call upon the people
The people have this power
The numbers don't decide
The system is a lie
A river running dry
The wings of butterflies
And you may pour us away like soup
Like we're pretty broken flowers
We'll take back what is ours
Take back what is ours

Like it's seen a ghost
I guess it's seen the sparks a-flowin
No one else would know
Sometimes I get overcharged
That's when you see sparks
They ask me where the hell I'm going
At a thousand feet per second
I go walking in your landscape
Broken branches
Trip me as I speak
Just 'cause you feel it
Doesn't mean it's there
Just 'cause you feel it
Doesn't mean it's there
There's always a siren
Singing you to shipwreck
Steer away from these rocks
We'd be a walking disaster
Just 'cause you feel it
Doesn't mean it's there
(Someone on your shoulder)
(Someone on your shoulder)
Just 'cause you feel it
Doesn't mean it's there
(Someone on your shoulder)
(Someone on your shoulder)

And lonely?
To me
To happen
To have your babies
I'll dress like your niece
And wash your swollen feet
Just don't leave
Don't leave
I'm not living
I'm just killing time
Your tiny hands
Your crazy kitten smile
Just don't leave
Don't leave
And true love waits
In haunted attics
And true love lives
On lollipops and crisps

Just don't leave
 my videotape
The bottom of the sea
Your eyes
They turn me
Why should I stay here?
Why should I stay?
I'd be crazy not to follow
Follow where you lead
Your eyes
They turn me
Turn me into phantoms (Way out)
I follow to the edge (Way out)
Of the earth (Way out)
And fall off
If they get the chance (Way out)
And this (Way out)
Is my chance
I get eaten by the worms
And weird fishes
Picked over by the worms
And weird fishes
Weird fishes
Weird fishes
