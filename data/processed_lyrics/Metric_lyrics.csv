"Split tomorrow from today
Knowing what you know just makes it harder to think straight
Starting over after it breaks
Starting over when the story's got an astounding twist
You better turn that page
When push it comes to shove we do not fall out of love
We double down  we do not fade
For all I know
This might be my last night
That's how it goes  there's no one
I would rather be lying beside
When it all comes crashing
When it all comes crashing
Starting over won't be easy  damage bе damned
Please  say you lovе me just as I am
Starting over won't be easy misunderstand that pattern
Fear is forcing your hand

Came crashing down tonight

Pleading self-defence but the story's old
I don't believe what they say

At its best it's all the art of doubt
Doubt
Now we gotta take it upon ourselves
Next time the kick drum starts
Drag your mind from the gutter babe
All this isolation's sinister
So be kind to yourself
There will never be another you
There's just nobody else that's you

At its best it's all the art of doubt
I can't fake the daytime
I found an entrance to escape into the dark
Got false lights for the sun
It's an artificial nocturne
It's an outsider's escape for a broken heart
We hide out in the back
Like shadows in a stranger's dream
Hiding out in the back together
Hiding out in the back forever
I make all that I believe
In dreams so real
Fate don't fail me now
I make all that I believe
I set myself free
So take all the time you need
And let yourself be
I'm as fucked up as they say

Wound up in a movie with no story

Hesitate outside the times

When she wishes  she wishes for less ways to wish for

I made every mistake  paper walls break

Something in your head
You've been fighting all along
I don't want to say it
The news is not so good
We'll never get away

We'd just play the tambourine
Around an open flame
Oversleep and burn

For a couple days everything you lacked
You possessed  it was yours
Started slow  started late
Started strong  then we lost faith
Started slow  started to lose control
The more we accelerate
With your hollow eyes  you keep coming back
It begins to transform
Can you spend the night? Can you be the raft?
In the eye of the storm?

Drift into a deep fog
Lost where I forgot to hold it

Watched our neighbor's house collapse
Looked the other way
All the oceans boiled and rivers bled
We auctioned off our memories
In the absence of a breeze
Scatter what remains

A comedown of revolving doors
Every warning we ignored
Drifting in from distant shores
The wind presents a change of course
A second reckoning of sorts
