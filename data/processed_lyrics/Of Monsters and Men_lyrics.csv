lyrics
"And now we're both sitting in silence
But if it's alright
I'll wrap myself around your cold shoulder
A bull without horns
And though you are warm
The cold lingers on the tip of your fingers

I see colour raining down
But I don’t know what you want
I am open and I am restless
Wake me up
I’m fever dreaming
And now I lose control
I'm fever dreaming
Shake it out
It's just what I'm feeling
And now I take control
I'm fever dreaming (I'm fever dreaming)
Oh so quiet when they laid me in the stream
And the starlit sky grew before my eyes
Twenty-two women stood by the banks and cried

Wake me up

And now I lose control

Shake it out

And now I take control
I'm fever dreaming (I'm fever dreaming)
 hold me down
 the stars are crystallised
 what are you waiting for?
 you colour me clear
 from white to gray
 and a broken one (Ooh)
 and a vicious one
 what are you waiting for?
 you colour me clear
 what are you waiting for?
 you colour me clear
To travel the sea
I need nothing
I need nothing
But there's something
Eating at me
Black water
Take over
Darker days are raining over me (Oh Ooh)
In the deepest depths I lost myself (Oh Ooh)
I see myself through someone else
The strange silence
Surrounding me
Grows closer
Feels colder
But I'm ready
To suffer the sea
Black water
Take over

 oh-oh
 but know I ain't too proud
 we do this every time
 but we're running in circles
 run away
 so I don't take the blame
 but we're running in circles
 I got a feeling that it's time to let it go
 I knew that this was doomed from the get-go
 special
 the sex though
 let it go
 but we're running in circles
 run away
 so I don't take the blame
 but we're running in circles
 what do you got to lose?
 what are you gonna do?
 let it go
 but we're running in circles
 run away
 so I don't take the blame
 but we're running in circles
Caught in clouds of silver ropes
Showered by the empty hopes
I know I'll wither so peel away the bark
'Cause nothing grows when it is dark
I see it all so clear
And feel the tones that tremble down your spine
And let your colours bleed and blend with mine
Making waves in pitch black sand
Feel the salt dance on my hands
Raw and charcoal coloured thighs
Feel so cold and my skin feels so paper-thin
I know I'll wither so peel away the bark
'Cause nothing grows when it is dark
I see it all so clear

And feel the tones that tremble down your spine

I forgive what is within
All my time

 is an animal
 it ran away
 they got help from below
 things were cold
See the mountains where they meet smothering me
As the wind fends off the waves  I count down the days
Heavy stones fear no weather
I find comfort in the sound and the shape of the heart
How it echoes through the chest from under the ground
As the hills turn into holes  I fill them with gold
Heavy stones fear no weather
And from the rain
Comes a river running wild that will create
An empire for you
Illuminate
There's a river running wild that will create
An empire for you
An empire for two
An empire for you
An empire for two
And I paint your body black  I hide in your hair
And you're staring back at me like I wasn't there
As our bodies become stills  we welcome the fear

The salty ocean wind made the seagulls cry
The rocking of his house had me holding on
But I knew that I was safe from there on out
And the waves that hit his face marked the past
And we are far from home

I couldn't breathe if I tried
I lay my head on the floor
My beating heart wanted more  but I'll keep it in and keep you out
I'm drowning  I'm drowning
I'm drowning  I'm drowning
And for the longest time I knew  there was nothing left for us to do
But I tried  oh  I try
And in this quiet company  there is nothing staring back at me
I'm in need of a sound
Hungry for the kill  but this hunger  it isn't you
Voices disappear when you're speaking in somber tunes
I will be the wolf and when you're starving  you'll need it too
Hungry for the kill  but this hunger  it isn't you
It isn't you  it isn't
I grew tall to fill the void
Let me go  'cause you are just a shade of what I am  not what I'll be
But in this quiet company  I forget sometimes just how to breathe
Fill my lungs with a sound

I'm drowning  I'm drowning
I'm drowning  I'm drowning
With all my shadows
I'd bow my head and welcome them
But I feel it burning  like when the winter wind stops my breathing
Are you really gonna love me when I'm gone?
I fear you won't  I fear you don't
And it echoes when I breathe
Until all you see is my ghost
Empty vessel  crooked teeth
Wish you could see
And they call me under
And I'm shaking like a leaf
And they call me under
And I wither underneath in this storm
I am a stranger  I am an alien
Inside a structure
Are you really gonna love me when I'm gone
With all my thoughts and all my faults?
I feel it biting  I feel it break my skin
So uninviting
Are you really gonna need me when I'm gone?

But these problems aside  I think I taught you well
And in the winter night sky  ships are sailing
Looking down on these bright blue city lights
Howling ghosts  they reappear
In mountains that are stacked with fear
But you're a king and I'm a lionheart
A lionheart
His crown lit up the way as we moved slowly
Past the wondering eyes of the ones that were left behind
Howling ghosts  they reappear
In mountains that are stacked with fear
But you're a king and I'm a lionheart
And in the sea that's painted black
Creatures lurk below the deck
But you're a king and I'm a lionheart
And as the world comes to an end
I'll be here to hold your hand
'Cause you're my king and I'm your lionheart

I don't like walking around this old and empty house
It's the house telling you to close your eyes
It's killing me to see you this way
'Cause though the truth may vary
This ship will carry our bodies safe to shore
(Hey)
(Hey)
(Hey)
There's an old voice in my head that's holding me back
Soon it will be over and buried with our past
We used to play outside when we were young
And full of life and full of love

There is a storm that is ascending now
Feels like it's close enough to touch
So I step back into it
Lonely weather
And you can stay here if you want
But is it worth it if my limbs don't follow?
Lonely weather
We don't say it all too much
There's a storm that is ascending now (Lonely weather)
Feels like close enough to touch
I step back into it (Lonely weather)
We can stay here if you want
I fell back into it (Lonely weather)
I get back into it
Yeah  maybe I'm a crook for not caring for it
And these fingertips will never run through your skin
And those bright blue eyes can only meet mine across a room
Filled with people that are less important than you
So I think it's best  we both forget before we dwell on it
The way you held me so tight
All through the night  till it was near morning
So I packed my things and ran
Far away from all the trouble
I have caused with my two hands
Alone we traveled armed with nothing but a shadow
We fled far away
Hold your horses now
(We sleep until the sun goes down)
(Deep into the mountain sound)
Hold your horses now
(We sleep until the sun goes down)
Some had scars and some had scratches
It made me wonder about their past
That we were nothing like the rest
Hold your horses now
(We sleep until the sun goes down)

Can't remember when it was dark
Or the sun coming up
Far across the ocean alone
While numb bears at home
Said I could never get there
Never get there
Breaking little twigs with my feet
And underneath
Is a road that's so steep
Far across the ocean alone
While numb bears at home
Said I could never get there
But I'm already there
Already there
Already there

The wind blows loudest when you've got your eyes closed
But I never changed a single colour that I breathe
So you could have tried to take a closer look at me
I am tired of punching in the wind
I am tired of letting it all in
And I should eat you up and spit you right out
So I take off my face
'Cause it reminds me of how it all went wrong
And I pull out my tongue
'Cause it reminds me of how it all went wrong
I guess I could swim for days in the salty sea
So I take off my face
'Cause it reminds me of how it all went wrong
And I pull out my tongue
'Cause it reminds me of how it all went wrong
And I cough up my lungs
'Cause they remind me of how it all went wrong
But I leave in my heart

But I leave in my heart
You are still waiting on me
But you are hardly ever
All those times that I could swear I heard you speak
You spoke in such low voice
'Cause you are hardly ever happy
Sometimes I find myself standing in those steps
With eyes so blank and unsure
Realising this is not where I want to be
And not where I want to go
And I don't mean to somehow always disagree
But I feel that you do not see
Mostly you have to love yourself

I'm tired and I think I want to go home

But I know that I've got to get running
But I run up to the house
You can follow if you dare

No one's to blame that I knew it
To the edges so that I can fall off

But I'm not

 you shout
 we crawl like animals
 I'm still awake
Wrapping its arms around me
Pulling me down to the deep
All eyes on me
I push you away
Although I wished you could stay
So many words left unsaid
But I'm all out of breath
Go away
Cold dark sea
Your waves are rocking me
I close my eyes and fall asleep
Her blood on my bones
Let go  lay to rest
Sleep  sleep all night
While the young  they wait alone
So get up  shake the rust
Alone  I fight these animals
Alone until I get home
A wolf  wolf and I
We share the same cold meal
I float on  float on down

So the sun wouldn't notice
The seaweed that wrapped its
Arms around you
The carpet on my cheek
Feels like a forest
And I run through the tall trees
With your hand chasing me
The books that I keep by my bed
Are full of your stories
That I drew up from a little dream of mine
A little nightmare of yours
To forgive and forget
To be a better man
And love my sister

And love my brother

I met a man today
And he smiled back at me
Now there are thoughts like these
That keep me on my feet
All the trees outside are buried in the snow
I spend my night  dancing with my own shadow
And it holds me  and it never lets me go
I move slow and steady
But I feel like a waterfall
Yeah  I move slow and steady
Past the ones that I used to know
My dear old friend  take me for a spin
Two wolves in the dark  running in the wind
I'm letting go  but I've never felt better
Passing by  all the monsters in my head
And I move slow and steady
But I feel like a waterfall
Yeah  I move slow and steady
Past the ones that I used to know

Lost in the forest of this heart is a foreign still
Why are they shaking their heads? We're stuck in slow life
Is it the beating of the chest that makes us fear the rest?
We're slowly sailing away behind closed eyes
Where not a single ray of light can puncture through the night
You caught me in the tide and I caught you
You caught me in the tide and I caught you
Between the daylight and the deep sea
Lies a swarm of silhouettes floating aimlessly
You'll get lost and buried deep if you swim with me
You caught me in the tide and I caught you
You caught me in the tide and I caught you

And I still feel you around
You've become a tempo that my heart knows
And I know this can't be wasted love
Please don't tell me that it's wasted love

I get lost in my delusional reality
I don't know up from down
Or when my feet are on the ground
I've been around for thirty years
It's kinda hard to think about your own mortality
That you give to me
It's all I'm missing
It's all I'm missing
That you give to me
It's dripping down my hands like honey
It's all I'm missing
I'm stuck in gravity
I'm clawing for some bravery
Try to be still in a moment
And I'm hoping for a never ending odyssey

I know you are born to be wild
In your years you've been alone too
Hidin' from the monsters in your head
Sugar in a bowl
On your coffee table
Animals that sleep on your dining room floor
In your house
You are just waiting for a light to pass by
One second at a time
Your freckles are gone and now your face is
Dry as the walls surrounding you
Coffee keeps you up for hours
TV tucks you in at night
A picture on the wall
Of a friend you used to know
The smell of the coffee sitting on the stove
In your house

I feel the air light up when I'm alone
When I'm under a dome
It's the only way I know
It's cake to not feel great when you're in a storm
This happiness is hell on earth
Somebody better save me
This happiness is hell on earth

No need to sleep when the sun is staring me down
Staring me down

A bird in the night

I can't control withering wonders
Flowers that lose their shape
I lie awake and watch it all
It feels like thousand eyes

I'll be the calm  I will be quiet
Stripped to the bone  I wait
A tower that casts a shade

But what if I tumble?
Have I said too much?
Did I love too hard?
This steel can't carry me now that things are rough
I used to make mountains
But then they grew bigger than me

And I wish I could fly that high
You might also like
A serpent on a bed of leaves
In the month of May
What do you want me to say?
You keep me still when all I feel
Is an aimless direction
When I think I'm losin' connection
I see you
And you got me now
And you got me now
But why don't we full on pretend?
And I wish I could fly that high
And you got me now
And you got me now
 ooh  ooh-ooh
 woah
 ooh-ooh
 woah-oh-oh
 I will take control
 ooh  ooh-ooh
 I run  I run further than before
 woah
 ooh-ooh
 woah-oh-oh  woah-oh-oh
 woah
 ooh-ooh
 woah-oh-oh  woah-oh-oh
 woah-oh-oh  woah-oh-oh
 I'm giving you all
 I'm giving you all
 I'm giving you all
 I'm giving you all
 haunt me in my sleep
 sinking in my sea
 you're feeding on my energy
 she wants it
 ooh
 ooh
 we are the same
 you run in my veins
 you breathe what is mine
 haunt me in my sleep
 sinking in my sea
 you're feeding on my energy
 he wants it
 ooh
 ooh
 you can follow me
 you can follow me
 haunt me in my sleep
 sinking in my sea
 you're feeding on my energy
 she wants it
 ooh
 ooh
 you can follow me
 you can follow me
 you can follow me
And everything feels so different now
Just grab a hold of my hand
I will lead you through this wonderland
Water up to my knees
But sharks are swimming in the sea
Just follow my yellow light
And ignore all those big warning signs
Somewhere deep in the dark
A howling beast hears us talk
I dare you to close your eyes
And see all the colors in disguise
Running into the night
The earth is shaking and I see a light
The light is blinding my eyes
As the soft walls eat us alive
Out of feathers  out of bones
We set fire to our homes
Walking barefoot in the snow
Distant rhythm of the drum
As we drifted towards the storm
Baby lion lost his teeth
Now they're swimming in the sea
Troubled spirits on my chest
Where they laid to rest
The birds all left  my tall friend
As your body hit the sand
Million stars up in the sky
Formed a tiger's eye
That looked down on my face
Out of time and out of place
So hold on
Hold on to
What we are
Hold on to
Your heart
You might also like
Awakened by the sound
Of a screaming owl
Chasing leaves in the wind
Going where we've never been
Said goodbye to you  my friend
As the fire spread
All that's left are your bones
That will soon sink like stones
So hold on
Hold on to
What we are
Hold on to
Your heart
So hold on
Hold on to"
