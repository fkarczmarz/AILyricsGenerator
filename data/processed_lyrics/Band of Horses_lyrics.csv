"Wanders all around  everywhere
Trembles and it shakes 'til every tree is loose
It rolls the meadows  and it rolls the nails
So  take me down to your dance floor
I won't mind people when they stare
Paint a different color on your front door
And tomorrow  we will still be there
Jesus built a ship to sing a song to
It sails the river  and it sails the tide
Some of my friends don't know who they belong to
Some can't get a single thing to work inside
So  take me down to your dance floor
And I won't mind the people when they stare
Paint a different color on your front door
And tomorrow  we will still be there
I've loved you every day  and now I'm leaving
And I can see the sorrow in your eyes
I hope you know a lot more than you're believing
Just so the sun don´t hurt you when you cry

Oh  take me down to your dance floor
I won´t mind the people when they stare
Paint a different color on your front door
And tomorrow  we may still be there
For a better position to enjoy the warmth
Of the sun to keep warm
And working the needle and twine
Lost in the furthest recess of the mind
A cat on his lap and a dog at her feet
The secrets they bury within
Lead to be misled thus the deceivin' hand
And it's a night among easily described
Misunderstanding our thoughts by and by
A fear of the misunderstood
Invites the violence right in chasin' off all the good
We'd brought all on ourselves
Led astray by the words of somebody else

His head above the water and pushed under again
It's a test of the spirit versus the health of the mind
Oh
And all his well meaning intent
As far as we've come we're still further to go
The only thing it ever taught me was a grand illusion
That comes and goes
The city blanketed of snow
What if we die?
No end and no conclusion
How could you smile  just walk away? Well I don't know
I don't know
I met you at the railroad station  now years ago
And somethin' happened on the night I last drank with you
In the neon glow
Now I don't see you anymore
The midwestern sky is gray and cold
The sun never shines but that's alright
And I couldn't find the letters that you wrote me
What did you write? Where'd you go  well I don't know
No
Take a little time  gonna roll the dice
Find another way  try break the ice
Everything you do is a farce!
Talking television at the casual party
Here's some brand new friends to get you started off
So start it off
Since Ben got that he's a sociopath
He's only playing games  don't be distracted
It's all or nothing  all or nothing
So you really got something to lose
It's coming around as it did before
Or it's gettin' your attention  but where's the door
I can't locate it  where's it located?
I got plenty to live for
Blind faith don't sit right
You got rage  wound so tight
I wanna leave  best get out of the way
Blind faith don't sit right
You're full of rage  wound so tight
I'm gonna leave  best get out of the way
Awful conversation at the casual party
No  it never stops
Kids and the dog  a freshly mowed lawn
Retirement plans for a mountain home
Been arrested  lived in Texas
My God  I'm gonna leave it with you

Children and dogs and manicured lawns
All your future plans and vacation homes

...so stupid! Everything's about you man
We sit out in the weather
Familiar he said  time soon breeds contempt
Wash your hands of it forever
Violence it ripped through the old dogwood fence
See the whole scene unravel
The drunk brother said he could reason with them
While they lied at night  they lied at night
While they lied
While they lied at night  they lied at night
While they lied
The picture was left on the front porch
The back said I love you  don't you ever think of me?
If my body goes then to hell with my soul
We don't even know the difference
The dead folks in the clouds  for crying out loud

You may have stayed too long
You're splittin' apart at the seams from the hospital call
You've known him so long
If there's a God up in the air
Someone lookin' over everyone
At least you got somethin' to fall back on
Deep in the heart of the country was a house I built from logs
A raven and a lady hawk
A quiet and calm through the day
See the sun burn through the fog
Approachin' was a yellow dog
If there's a God up in the air
Someone lookin' over everyone
At least you got somethin' to fall back on
What are people really for?
Does anybody even care?
I'll bet you get a lot of compliments down there

I couldn't pace myself or raise my standards
But one can hope  you need to know
And then that one stayed one  one stayed one
Forgotten where I was  confusing it with another that I saw
You wouldn't like nothing tonight
Beginning was quite disturbing
I got a crutch on you
Sick of needing something to do-do-do-do
Tablets in my pocket at the Easter soiree
Bouncing off the carpet in line for the TSA
A lot of wasps on the walls  wasps on the walls
I'm bailing toilet water in a lake full of moccasin
The middle was dark and storming
You're on your own  I need to go
I got a crutch on you
Guеss I got nothin' to lose

Wishing there was something that I could do
When I saw you lookin' like I never thought
That words can do more than harm
See things through to the very minimal
But what's it gonna cost to be gone?
If we see you like I hoped we never would
When eyes can't look at you any other way
When eyes can't look at you any other way
So take it as a song or a lesson to learn
And sometime soon be better than you were
And watch how you treat every living soul
My eyes can't look at you any other way
When eyes can't look at you any other way
Such a simple phrase
Are we passengers on (separated trains)
Separated trains?
Take the mask off (take the masking off)

Ethereal to everyone

Three to just get in the way

Dull times  let 'em seep into your bones
Keep it kind  always in time
Honest themes every once in a while
In a while  in a while

Underneath is there something to see?
Slower clouds only reflecting

The home is where the heart is how long we've been apart  it's been

And which side I live on  long we've been apart
Blank state and a maudlin
In need of something to say
Get to solving this thinking problem
Dissolution at the start of the day
Start of the day
I administered badly
Dreaming mysteries up
The stars spinning around and around me
While the tasks keep piling up
Piling up  they're piling up
I might talk to the ceiling
I never need something to do
I never needed a reason to stare into the light
The light of the moon  moon
Staring at the light  moon
Home is where the heart is  home is where you are
Long we've been apart  which side I live on
Home is where the heart

Ain't it enough  alone in the night?
And it don't matter what you've done
I just want my life back for a while
Is it too much to ask?
The bookmarks page sittin' out in the room
And altars of candles casting shadows on you
You see the bed in the dark?
Well I could just sleep  I could just sleep
And hear me babe  when I don't wanna say it
Seein' through  I'm back home and stayin'
I can't be alone anymore
And I don't blame you
Or pretend to know
The right thing to do
Late afternoon and the knocks on the door
A fist through the wall
Wipe the blood off the floor

Late afternoon and the locks on the door
A ship through the fog sweep the mess from the floor
I can see the bed in the dark
But I could just leave  I could just leave
You wasted my time
I called off my plans
And if you're ever left with any doubt
What you'll live with and what you'll do without
I'm only sorry that it took so long to figure out
Got lost in the places I've been
I should go out with my friends
For me this bottle of wine
Is to slow down my mind
And if you're ever left with any doubt
What you'll live with and what you'll do without
Stashed away in a hidden place
We can hide if you want to
We can hide but then one day
Everything's gonna be undone

How'd you get to be wound so tight

The man inside is going to a hotel room
He jumped out right after seein' just the very sight of me
Decided he better hike it to the second floor
I permanently won't do this again
My belongings scattered all across the hotel floor
I thought about you and a candy bar
I fell asleep to the greatest movie of the year
He's wonderin' only what did you do today

Roads there leading straight to your place
Look like the tin can would swallow the kitchen
Plugging up your space

This Christmas-time though  I'm coming over
Coming from the north
I'm already done
Wrapping up the presents I bought
Overcoat
Now take me anywhere  oh
We've suffered enough
It's scary to leave
When they're leaving from work
They're cutting us off
Knowing not why
They're calling on the telephone
Roy  do I know anyone?
And coming up only to show you wrong
Ooh
Ooh
Really too late to call so we wait for
Morning to wake you is all we got
But to know me as hardly golden
At every occasion of one billion day funeral
I'm coming up only to show you down for
And coming up only to show you wrong
'Fore they died and had trees to hang there upon

Ooh
Ooh
At every occasion of one billion day funeral
We had a close call
I hardly believed it at all
Only for you and me
We're hungry next that I know
And running the blender in a lightning storm
Are disguised as a blessing I'm sure
Pants have gotta go
We're on an island on the Fourth of July
It looks like the tide is going home
In time I'd find a little way to your heart
Down to the general store for nothing specific
Gonna wash my bones in the Atlantic shore
There was country music playing
But he don't like it at all
And red fire popping on the rained-down wood
There was whiskey bottle spilling
And a lake that's made of salt
Now if you find yourself falling apart
Then I'm sure I could stand on
The Great Salt Lake
Falling apart
And I'm sure I could stand on
The Great Salt Lake
Your old man was but a wishing machine
It's time that you could spend
Now he's getting old
When Billy Lorett had found a watering hole
It's a place to lay south or the heads of coyote

Well I'm sure

Follow me home
We want more
Follow me home
We all want more
If ever beat down
We know who we are
If ever beat down
We know who we are
They know we all want more
One more time
Gonna get wasted all night long
Grippin' on tight to the cutlery when the paranoia comes
You can take your time
Gettin' me arrested was the strangest way of showing me that you're mine
I'll be with you all in years
Now if anybody dies before I'm back see me laughin' through those tears
Just leave these things alone

All the trees are turning gold
You see me fuckin' with the mercury when a change of season comes
 now God wants to be us
 I want some
 you're never here
 I'm dog tired
 pray that it crashes
 I'm dog tired
 go fuck yourself
 I'm dog tired
 a loss of mine
Not to cry in front of people at work
You get reminded of the earlier days
The end of April '78
And you showed a lot of warning signs
You made your own situation mine
Now your problem's mine
You don't want help
You don't need me
You don't look well
And you don't want anything
You don't want anything
Slim pickings when the weather is snow
Pretty winded on a bicycle
A hot dinner on a souvenir plate
The part of town where the money ain't

We don't want help
We don't take handouts
We won't seek sympathy
And we don't want anything
And you keep it bottled up inside and let it out from time to time
I don't want help
I don't want counseling
I won't go to therapy
Yeehaw
I got you arrested because
Weed party come and gone
Gone
I am about to set this off
Till weed party's done
Is done
The wine is there to keep yourself
You got it wrong
So I brought you perplexing thoughts
Words were at a loss
A loss
It's a good day to skip because
Weed party is gonna call
It's called
The wine is there to keep yourself
But don't you ever listen at all
Parents aren't enforcing the laws

But don't you ever listen at all
How did I come off? Would lead you to ask
Can I help you along?
The day is coming closer
The dream slipping through me will fade
Inching slowly from the slumber
Wherever you are (wherever you are)
Not every moment matters
Across marked jots laid down
Look you're growing faster and faster
Heights that I held you up
Times when I couldn't be at home
See Band of Horses LiveGet tickets as low as $45You might also like
And I owe you a lot
So whatever you want
Whatever you want (wherever you are)
Wherever you are
Times when I couldn't be enough
Hate you because
Go tippy toe
Shut off to the world
I barely told a lie
Now pray to be blind
And I'm gone for a while
Shut off the world
Shut off to all
I'm yours
I'm yours
There'll be evil people to say things they show
Say once before
I know evil people will say things
I begged Gil really why
Stay through the night
I'm here for a while
Shut off to the world
Shut off to all

They don't know
Oh why do I even care
The shit was flying out of the window I painted blue
I paint the whole room
The screen door swayin'
I've been a fool
Pace the floor
I take it all back
The regret that's got us sayin' the hound's upon the tracks
And always in time
I sing it to you"
