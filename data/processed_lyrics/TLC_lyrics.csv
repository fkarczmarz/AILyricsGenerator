"We in the house
Yeah  come on
1992  TLC kickin' off in your mother— *bleep* (I ain't too proud to beg)
So ya best be duckin' fast (I ain't too proud to beg)
Yo  T-Boz  is ya being a boss? (I ain't too proud to beg)
Chilli  what's up wit' dat sauce? This is it
Yo  T  step on that (Shh)
(I ain't too proud  I ain't too proud to beg)
Thinkin' short of what you got
Better get it while it's hot
Ain't no better love than your own
Unmistakin' urge to be
Sexin' with society
How can you be happy alone? Hey  hey
I need to feel loved
Why wait for so long?
'Cause I ain't too proud to beg
For something that I call my own
And I want to be touched
And feeling so much  see  'cause
Everybody needs some good lovin'

Yo  if I need it in the morning or the middle of the night
(I ain't too proud to beg  no)
If the lovin' is strong then he got it goin' on and...
(I ain't too proud to beg  no)
Two inches or a yard rock hard or if it's saggin'
(I ain't too proud to beg  no)
So it ain't like I'm braggin'  just join the paddywagon  'cause
(I ain't too proud to beg  I ain't too proud to beg)
Screamin' loud and holdin' sheets
Scared that you'll be called a freak
Gotta let it go while you can
Ain't too proud to beg  you see
'Cause my man belongs to me
And I know that he understands
I need to feel loved (I need to feel loved)
Why wait for so long?
'Cause I ain't too proud to beg
For something that I call my own
And I want to be touched (Wanna be touched)
And feeling so much  see  'cause
Everybody needs some good lovin'

So it ain't like I'm braggin'  everybody join the paddywagon  'cause
(I ain't too proud to beg  I ain't too proud to beg)
Yo  Left Eye  kick that shit
Realize the realism of reality treats us both the same
'Cause satisfaction is the name of this game
So I choose to explain  it's evident
Left Eye don't mean the rest of my body is irrelevant
In other words  let's refresh your head
About pullin' down curtains and breakin' the waterbed
Yeah  I like it when you (Mwah)
Both sets of lips
Oooh  on the TLC tip
I ain't too proud to beg (I ain't too proud to beg)
What I call my own (I ain't too proud)
Just you and me (Uh)
Hey
I ain't too proud  I ain't too proud  I ain't too proud to beg
I need to feel loved (I need to feel loved)
Why wait for so long? (Oh so long)
'Cause I ain't too proud to beg
For something that I call my own (Something  yeah)
And I want to be touched (Wanna be touched)
And feeling so much  see  'cause (Feeling so so much)

TLC isn't too proud to beg
 and watch
 oh
 check it
 oh
Seems love has died too soon
When will we try?
I'll give breath to save your life
Bombs are falling from the sky
I'll be bold enough to fight
I think none of us are safe
We been in and out the race
Cries they echo into space
Tragedies we have to face
I lost some friends
Some friends that I didn't want to
I lost some stars
I've been in and out of the fire battling for you
I bleed American gold
On this American soil
We pay for the price it cost
I bleed this American gold
I cry for the ones I lost
I pray for the ones that don't
I'm bleeding on American Soil
I'm bleeding this American gold

Feeling undefeated
From the ones who try to have power over you
Don't let them control you
Won't you let them know right now
You won't let them drag you
This is Left Eye
Uhhh you know cuz the eye is right
Check out this phat remix kinda like Slim Fast
Baby baby baby
Ya know what I'm sayin'
T-Boz won't you kick the ballistics
Well that's alright
But you gotta be good
And do it right
Ain't got no time for part-time lovin' in my life
Well you wanna be loved (huh)
Hey that's O.K
Cause it falls in line right with my sexuality
But you gotta be down
A nigga gotta be true
Cause otherwise this beat ain't got no time for you
I got so much love in me
Cause if you're gonna get me off
You got to love me deep
I got so much love in me
Cause if you're gonna get me off
You got to love me deep
But it won't be there if you can't deal with my mind
I require plenty conversation with my sex
Long as you know that I can have any man I want to
Baby that's actual and factual
But still I choose you to be with me
And work on me so you better not flake it up (Ohhhhhh)
Cause if you're gonna get me off
You got to love me deep
I got so much love in me
I gotta be loved if that's ok
Cause if you're gonna get me off
You got to love me deep (Get me off)

Baby that's actual and it's factual
But still I choose you to be with me
And work on me so you better not flake it up
But it won't be there if you can't deal with my mind
I require plenty conversation with my sex
Excuse me if I put a lot on it
Daggone it
As if you didn't know how much you want to really want it
In place it has effects in case your mind is in the gutter
I left the triple A's
And she surely don't stutter
A privilege it is to be considered as a great
And you remind me of my past cuz they are very upliftin'
And plan to give a little but a lot is what you want
And like my hat is 2 da back we can both sit down in front
I understand what a man is all about
You understand I can't have anybody else without a doubt
We understand that you as you I wouldn't want to be without
Understandin' is the key which holds a very large amount
And bein' that I am the kinda girl that I am
Heck just expect to be checked
Return the favor and the rest just flows
I'll be standin' on my toes as the rest turn into ho's
I got so much love in me (So much love in me!)
Cause if you're gonna get me off
You got to love me deep (Love me deep)
I can have any man that I want to
Time and place that I choose to
That's actual and factual
 it will be there for you  morning  noon and night
 and do me right
 a nickel gotta be true
 baby  baby

Thought that they would never do me wrong
When all the time they want to take your place
Them backstabbers
Same old scene that you've seen for so long
Always want to be around you
But as jealous as they come
'Cause if you do it's gonna lessen their space
That's when I decide to say
To all the fake people in my life
I never wanted you around me
So be on your way now
You better think twice
Before you let people in your life
'Cause when you put down
No one is around you
You got a case of the fake people

Don't want you to win that race

I love my man with all honesty
But I know he's cheatin' on me

I'ma get mine yeah
Oh I oh I oh I yeah (come on sing along y'all)
Oh I oh I Oh I yeah
Oh I Oh I Oh I am the surgeon general
I do believe in lyrical miracles (Warning!)
Creepin' may cause hysterical behavior in the mind
Put your life into a bind and in time
Make you victim to a passionate crime
Pregnant women put themselves at greater risk of bein' dissed
Known as no one for not knowin' who the daddy is
Which may result in little kids growin' up by the dozens
Gettin' sexually involved with first cousins
Creepin' is the number one item on the chart
Rippin' families apart the leadin' cause of a broken heart
Injuries can be fatal may infect the prenatal
HIV is often sleepin' in a creepin' cradle
(Because I need some attention)
Said nobody is supposed to know (Don't mess around)
Oh I oh I oh I yeah
Said nobody is supposed to know
It's me again
And I'm back
The 22nd of loneliness
And we've been through so many things
I love my man with all honesty
But I know he's cheating on me
(Creep) I look him in his eyes
But all he tells me is lies to keep me near
I'll never leave him down
Though I might mess around
It's only 'cause I need some affection
Just keep it on the down low
Said nobody is supposed to know
'Cause he doesn't know what I do
And no attention goes to show

It was bangin'

Coulda swore I saw you with someone
And at much to my surprise (whoa)

I'm getting sick and tired of folks who wanna come around

Sometimes I might get a little crazy
And sometimes I might seem out of hand
But I'm sayin' life's too short for me to let you dictate
What I say and the moves I make
I'm sick of people tryna tell me what to do
It's my life and I'ma live it like I want to
Is the reality of my mentality
Always creatin' a plan for me to conquer this land (TLC)
Maybe so 'cause when his life wasn't right (TLC)
And don't you ever be worried 'cause I'm down for the ride
Ever wonder what put the thunder deeply in my eyes?

Now as I look at myself
I'm seeing someone familiar starin' back at me
Through every deep crack that's in my mirror
And as I think to myself
I'm hearin' somebody else scream at me (shhh)
I no longer hear 'em
Could it be the unknown sneaking into my zone
I'm visualizing this invisible clone
Maybe I need to go to bed (*Yawn*)
Could have sworn I just heard that voice up in my head
But now its laughing at me
Something must got me backin' out from way back in the day
But what can it be I can't recall the memory
So if I may ask...

By any means was all it ever seemed to be
This reminiscin' with my past has got me caught up in a daydream
Stayin' bent with niggas who can pay the rent
Spending my green on pantyhose and tight jeans
I used to be so amused
Cuz the tools that I used to break rules
Only seemed to confuse as to whose being abused
Place yourself in my shoes
My pleasant look of innocence was never refused
Now that I choose to abide
(Hello left eye)
And put my past to the side
(I don't guess I...)
And kill a piece of my pride
(... need to introduce myself huh you already said hi)

Huh I thought I left you on that cruise?

A very merry Christmas (Oooh!)
And a happy New Year (A merry Christmas)
Filled with love and joy and happiness
And lots of good cheer
When the only sign we had was pickets
G-angs killin' others for colors
Thangs that we wear for fashion
Other brothers take it for a reason to be blastin'
What the kcuf is goin' on
Not soft like buttercups but
Had enough of singin' that same song
Took out yo' momma trash and groceries to her trunk
To keep my pockets (Come on)
For some shull-bit and I pray to God I won't repeat
I shoulda pulled it when I had the chance to
Y'all would not hear dat phat shit
That keeps you on your tippy-tippy-toes
I go through obstacles like a whole box of condoms
You can't forget where you come from
Take a good look in the mirror
But you're always quick to point the finger at me
Won't somebody tell me

I just don't understand
The ways of the world today
Sometimes I feel like
There's nothing to live for
So I'm longing for the days of yesterday
What gave you the right to misjudge me
And write me off on the wall
Acting as if you understand me
Sometimes I can't help but wonder
If this was how it's meant to be
But if you search deep enough in your soul
You'll always find a slight reminder of me
Won't somebody tell me
I just don't understand
The ways of the world today
Sometimes I feel like
There's nothing to live for
So I'm longing for the days of yesterday
To lettin' our souls become free
Of that sweet bitterness
Then who's chest would have the most seeds?
I keep misfocusin' my needs
And this stress on my back
With them gats they be blastin' into my knapsack
Ain't no accidental deathtraps
My mishap is the fact that I'm destined to snap (Yeah)
It's when I feel as though my body's able to go
My mind is ready to flow
Did you know first you catch and then I throw
It's my own sense of time
Just when the sun shines
And still gently advising the arisin' of the moon
As it roams around into my soundproof dimension
I just don't understand
The ways of the world today
Sometimes I feel like
There's nothing to live for
So I'm longing for the days of yesterday (Oh yeah)
I just don't understand

Sometimes I feel like

So I'm longing for the days of yesterday

Make you feel unpretty too
I was told I was beautiful
But what does that mean to you?
The one with the long hair
You can buy your hair if it won't grow
You can fix your nose if he says so
You can buy all the makeup
You can't look inside you
Find out who am I to
Be in the position that made me feel so
Damn unpretty

Staring at a son that she just can't touch
But he doesn't realize he hurts her so much
But all the praying just ain't helping at all
'Cause he can't seem to keep himself out of trouble
So he goes out and he makes his money the best way he knows how
Another body laying cold in the gutter
Listen to me
Don't go chasing waterfalls
Please stick to the rivers and the lakes that you're used to
I know that you're gonna have it your way or nothing at all
But I think you're moving too fast
Little precious has a natural obsession for temptation
But he just can't see
She gives him loving that his body can't handle
But he doesn't recognize his own face
Three letters took him to his final resting place
Y'all don't hear me

Come on!
The many chances I blew to bring my life to anew
Clear blue and unconditional skies
My only bleeding hope is for the folk who can't cope
With such an endurin' pain that it keeps 'em in the pourin' rain
Who's to blame for tooting 'caine into your own vein?
For falling prey to crime
I say the system's got you victim to your own mind
Dreams are hopeless aspirations in hopes of coming true

And it's nothin' but a thing  to pick up where we left off (yeah)
Don't you ever think
Back on all that other shit we went through
You know I remember (yeah)

One day we could reminisce
It feels like  we were just together

That's not the way it's supposed to be
Sometimes my vision is a little hazy
I can't tell who I should trust or just who I let trust me  yeah
People try to say I act a little funny
But that's just a figure of speech to me
They tell me I changed because I got money

I supply creativity to what others must take as a form of self-hate
Only to make an enemy  which results in unfortunate destiny
They dog me out then be next to me
Just 'cause I am what some choose to envy
Every now and then  I get a little easy
I let a lot of people depend on me
I never thought they would ever deceive me
Don't you know when times got rough
I was standing on my own
I'll never let another get that close to me
You see  I've grown a lot smarter now
Sometimes you have to choose and then you'll see
If your friend is true  they'll be there with you
Through the thick and thin
