" we got room 'cause we fly)
 date of birth (Date of birth)
 come find me
 can you keep massaging?
 come find me
 can you keep massaging?
 date of birth (Date of birth)
 ah
 but I'll call when I'm here again
 long as I don't embarrass her
 ooh)
 told me he ain't got a preference
 mm)
 I'ma pull up at your place at ten
 you off Hen'
 ooh)
 oh)
 I love the taste
 I love the chase
 I'm tryna see what you on
 told me he ain't got a preference (Baby)
 down)
 huh?
 I'm the funniest
 I don't go to school
 what you do?
 What's that?
 she my other half
 told me he ain't got a preference (Baby)
 down)
Grades goin' down as I'm stackin' up zeros
But not the dinero
Peach fuzz comin' in
And I'm cummin' in my girl like I'm sterile
I was never meant to be a college applicant
Fuck I look like goin' to college after this
Class clown type that like to holla at the chicks
Friend group solid as it gets
Recordin' in my room with the air conditioner all up in the mix
Even if it's fifteen high school chicks
Better than a front row of dicks
Onе day I'm gon' be front row at the Knicks
Wait until the world gеts a load of this (Ooh)
Ambitious nineteen-year-old
And I really think this might be my year though
Playin' dive bars and stoppin' at Cracker Barrel
Street raps make me ask if this the era for me
Is the playing field fair or is it fairer for me? Whew
A couple karats in my ears enough karats for me
I'm feelin' like the local scene finally cherishing me
Selling out my hometown so my parents can see
Givin' everything I got to the American dream
But I'm still playing 1 PM sets at the festivals

Ambitious twenty-four-year-old
Used to have dreams of being friends with my heroes
Now I'm Andrea Pirlo out in Europe spending euros
French girl chewin' on my earlobe
FaceTime calls about God from Justin
I saw that comin'
Auditioned for a lead and got the call back from it
Folks think it's 'bout to be more actin' and less rhymin'
Can't hold back
Holdin' on for many
Blame on me
Put the blame on me
Throwing football in the yard 'til the lights turned on inside the lampposts
Years go by
Somethin' changed when you got to junior high
Started hanging with them guys
You run with a crew that doesn't include any room for your little brothеr
Instead of lookin' at me like I'm disgusting
I wanna reminisce and ask you if you miss those days
But I'm terrified of broaching the subject
I don't say nothing

Put the blame on me
Put the blame on me
And I hate the man above the sink lookin' at me in the glass
Pokin' at your deepest wounds
But I know you remember the way that dad would let loose on me more often and way less you
He criticized and tested me so I'd test you
I got so much wrongdoing to confess to
I don't say nothing
Put the blame on me
Put the blame on me
Raised you with discipline and taught you life's truths
Lashed out at you for things you'd misplace
Reprimanding you in public 'til you're red in the face
Made you feel the weight of every single mistake that you made
My hot temper turned up full throttle
'Cause I needed you to be your little brother's role model
Don't you understand?
'Cause the way I parent you is how my mother did
And the way you treat your little brother's how my older brother did
And now I'm not even my brother's friend
There's so much I would do and say if I could have it done again
But I'm terrified of broaching the subject
I don't say nothing
Put the blame on me
Put the blame on me
 and said it first
 but they all know what I'm headed for
 but hard shit don't need no extra work
 Can we have a word?
 but I remember when you used to be fanned out
 uh
 do you fully understand? Uh
 call me pops
 but I make that sacrifice for the life that I chose
 so I like when it snowed
 I knew he and I would get along
 'til I say I want it twice
 know your everything is one of mine
 they know who I'm wanted by
 I just see divorce
 they throwin' stones
 there's growin' pains
 but you don't get a prize out of me
 but you can't get a rise out of me
 and they glitterin'
 it's belittlin'
 the PTSD is triggerin'
 the stones is shimmerin'
 but
 people that don't fuck with me
 it's like they ain't disposable
 yeah
 it's non-negotiable
 my music's not even relatable
 it's an inflatable
 I feel like a kid again
 man
 I'm very rarely referrin' to women
 they not even women
 I'm not even kidding
 y'all financial situation's my biggest motivation
 my presence in the spot is so abrasive
 You know that boy Jack is goin' places
It's a bag for the money that I'm makin' out with
Go ahead and make 'em round trip
Anonymous is what she layin' down with
Puerto Rican accent and the shit sound thick
Why she terrified to feel pain
I don't wanna' stress 'bout trying to get the bills paid
Got an Indiana chick and I don't ever go across
I ain't really into showin' off
I got New B's on my feet that I ain't purchase and they pink
Cody Banks in a secret agent outfit
It's a bag for the money that I'm makin' out with
Go ahead and make 'em round trip

It's a bag for the money that I'm makin' out with
Go ahead and make 'em round trip
Anonymous is what she layin' down with
Just talkin' about what I see
The suburbs are filled with ebonics and trap sonics
The dialect got a lil' splash of some black on it
Cap and gowns bought by the money in dad's pockets
White girls squattin' tryna get that ass poppin'
Caught back-talkin' to their mom and dads often
Recitin' rap lyrics 'bout murder and cash profit
Get to feel like a thug but don't have to act on it
Local homicide rates got 'em astonished
Readin' 'bout it on a laptop and pajamas
Microsoft Office to complete their assignments
Never had a convo with a kid from that climate
Common ground ain't that common
The festivals are filled with Larry Bird jerseys
College students in a hurry to jump to a four-count and say the N word
Business interns takin' Molly then Percs
Tramplin' on top of bodies in dirt
Condescendin' suburban kids growin' up to be rap journalists
Writin' urban myths about who they think is the best urban kid
And who the worst is and who's authentic
And what the real hip-hop is and who's all in it
Thrift shoppin' for articles and garments
That feel like they came from a foreign environment
Anything to feel less harmless
Adderall dealers carryin' 'round guns just to make it feel realer
House with white pillars
I'm the crème de la crème and it's filled to the brim
But you should still go be with him
I can't hold your hand this time
I can't fold my plans this time
We 'bout to hit the cut and get smoky
Hit a couple spots where they know me
I am not a visit to your mommy
I got a couple mamis on call that's about me
She ain't got no boundaries
I'm just as dirty as the shit you see around me
But you can bet they know about us
Told me she ain't goin' out much
I'm the crème de la crème and it's filled to the brim
But you should still go be with him
I can't hold your hand this time
I can't fold my plans this time
We 'bout to hit the cut and get smoky (Smoky)
Hit a couple spots where they know me (Know me)

Light beams hit off the side of my watch bezel
Don't be so naive
Go ahead if you tryna leave
'Cause what's a nine to a dime piece?
What's a headache to a youngin tryna find peace?
What's one girl to a couple Siamese? (Ooh)
'Cause I'm the crème de la crème and it's filled to the brim
But you should still go be with him
I can't hold your hand this time
I can't fold my plans this time
We 'bout to hit the cut and get smoky
Hit a couple spots where they know me

 this an intro now

 no one takes on it
So many losing hope in those dreams that they—
Walkin' past the homeless in a Rolex
Just got off the stage on the TODAY Show and I basically felt soulless
Years go by and I keep saying I'm gon' use my phone less
But I should just be phone-less
Ignorance is bliss and so is bein' underground
'Cause it was fun when we were known less
Sorry  that's cliche  I know I'm so blessed
But Jason keeps on tellin' me  Say yes
And truth be told  I know he knows best
But I don't wanna do no press
I've seen enough of me on this lil' screen
I've become so vain and insecure 'bout everything
I feel all this pressure to live up to what they tell me I'm gon' be
So I isolate myself  you can't help me  it's on me
I'm hidin' any sign of weakness from my guys
I don't want 'em second-guessin' with me
Nemo said to keep my foot on necks 'cause I can't let 'em just forget me
But the brags in my raps are getting less and less convincing
So I'd rather just (Wonder)
Oh  why this ever had to be?

I wrote that first verse in Denver back in September
It's January now and I'm feelin' like myself again
I got Angel back in here  I need his help again
I'm takin' time away but wonderin' what a healthy helping is
Fuck it  they gon' check for me  I tell myself and tell my friends
Avoidin' any talks about the elephant
Chalkin' up the hate to jealousy and just embellishments
But deep down  I find myself wonderin'
If the people that write about me are right about me
And I wonder if my exes are oversharin' 'cause they know a lot about me
I'm a long way from Shelby County
I been through some local tension  heard talks of a healthy bounty
Sober and focused  I cannot walk down no deli alleys
I still got the fellas 'round me  I love 'em and tell 'em proudly
My mama needs help adjusting  my father needs help accounting
I'm lookin' out heaven's window  I know that there's hell around me and—
Wonder  oh  why this ever had to be?
Hey
If you want it you can have it  that my old style
Moving through the night just like an old coy-
-Yote  low profile  sippin' something  got my piss lookin' like the Oh-hi
Push it 'til it's broke down
Somethin' like my momma when I take the bag home to her
Con artists talkin' like some connoisseurs
If you want the beef we can put them bitches on skewers
She the one I wrote this song for
And she put it on while she puttin' on the contour
Phone calls from the concourse
Long way from home and that pussy what I long for
But  for now I'm on the clock  uh
Give myself off to you right before I knock
Once I'm back home  then you know it's Yung Joc
We gon' set the camcorder up and make a Hitchcock
I'm a uhh  big shot  uh
I can't eat it cold  so I hope this shit's hot
I can't eat the leftovers out the Ziploc
It's a mental thing for me  I can't really explain it
I know we're friends  but it feel like we datin' sometimes
I feel the tension in all the conversations we have
I know the beat ain't really hot 'til I'm pacin' around
And I'm pacin' right now
Yeah  this shit knockin'
And she  and she  she tryin' give noggin (Oof!)
Tryin' show the youngin' what the tip top is
But see me  I'm just tryin' see what the drip drop is  uh
Hit it once  she say that we been talkin'  uh
I don't mind  I'm enjoyin' the company
And it's validatin' for me  fill the void I been strugglin' with
I rock a soldier out of Troy when I'm bussin' this shit
It's an infection I avoid  I been wantin' to kick
But  I been flip floppin'  huh
Indecisive how I'm tryin' get poppin' (Ooh!)
Plain cheeseburger  I don't get toppin'
Chauncy tryin' show me what the crip walk is

Spokin' word over bass  I be grid lockin'

Hit the Rollie store to kill time  now we tick tockin'  huh

Send her home in some sweatpants
She vegan so I hit her with the eggplant  huh
Her daddy rich so so I'm Stedman  huh

She said I'm better than her ex man
If you fuck another bitch  you a dead man
Hold on  girl  you talkin' like you pregnant
I am not your nigga  I'm your bestfriend  huh
Shhh  quit talkin'
I just wanna' know what the drip drop is  huh
I pull her hair  girl  I rip stockins'
If you ain't fuckin' with me  you can kick rocks then
Never take the hat off  boy  I'm Kid Rockin'
She said  I'm sorry  I don't get that type of dick often
Honey gold diggin' hoe be tryin' to pick pocket
So I'm swip swappin'
Got a thick chocolate
Little chick from the market  caught her wrist watchin'
Now we at the crib and we binge watchin'
I'm straight forward on some Chris Rock shit
I catch a groove like  uh-uh
Dua Lipa  I'm tryna do more with her than do a feature (Do it)
I checked the web  they out here chewin' me up  fuck it
Fadeaway  I lift that Luka knee up  bucket
I heard from someone you said you could be us  nothing
You know my city like the new Korea  bustin'
All these discussions over who could see us  hush it
I sold them basements out  let's do arenas  crushin'
She looking  I'm blushing  I'm lying  I'm touching
Rain  rain  rain  rain
I need this shit to be tooken up  I got accustomed to it
Fuck a leap of faith  I took a jump just like it's nothing to it
Girl  them Russian twists is working  now just put your butt into it
All that talk  I'm cutting through it
I ain't no connoisseur  but I like this kind of storе
I got nothing to do with who the fuck they think I'm screwing

Dua Lipa  I'm tryna do more with her than do a feature (Do it)
I checked the web  they out here chewin' me up  fuck it
Fadeaway  I lift that Luka knee up  bucket
Through the yellow lights  I'm gliding on the way to her apartment
And I'm ridin'  takin' in the smell of the street
It's night time by the way  but you can tell by the beat
That bass knockin' in my whip  just like some elephant feet
Catch a wave when I'm driving past my elementary
Grew up round the kids that made a belt with a string
And made me feel like I belonged 'cause they could tell I was me
Since then  whew feelin' like I might've lost track
I been thinking too much but I can't help what I think
That shit that's s'posed to make me happy only melts in the heat
If I could freeze it  maybe I could turn myself into steam
Bendin' corners through Cherokee Park
Way I'm driving you would think I was scared of the dark
Another ticket and my momma gon' tear me apart
Well… shit
Young and poppin'  I been soakin’ up my adolescence
I took some time to find the balance  now we back in session
Ain't goin' to college  I decided that's a bad investment
But I'm still takin' notes and siftin' through my past and present
I been having trouble socializing
Go out to these parties to make people like me  nah I really don't feel like it
Can't relate to no one  I should stay home they'll miss me
I told this shit to Copelan on the way home from Cincy
He agreed with me  felt the same
Damn  that shit's relieving
Maybe time to reassess my standards for an evening
Shit ain't perfect  we just searching for a plan or just a reason to
Fall in love with life and be a fan of fuckin' breathing
I ain't suicidal  but lately nothin' seems to interest me
And I ain't got the time if it don't gratify me instantly
Thought that I’d be smooth if I ain't smoke or drink
Still I got some vices that be stopping me from focusing
Like wassup with my dopamine  searching for a doper me
I grew up with the poetry  at 12 I wrote a hot verse

Hotel with some biddy
Got her doing my bidding
Wasn't always this pretty
Ain't no way we ain't winning

Cheaper to keep her Willy Caballero

Pretty bitch and she be killing them angles

I ran my projects before I was famous
Pass her to dog and you know how I'm playing
Act like I'm dumb but you know I ain't crazy

But we both inside this party and we lifted
So what's up?
I'ma sip my drink and crack a big smile
It's been a minute now
That's fucked up
So you just wasn't gon' hit me?
You should come and step into my world just like Narnia
How's your sister and your niece? Does she still cry a lot?
Who you talkin' to now? Are y'all 'bout to tie a knot?
'Member back when I would come and spend the night at your house
Wake up by myself in bed 'cause you'd be at the stovetop
A man's greed can't see the things that he's already got
Fucked it up between us 'cause I wanted you and every thot
Things would only worsen when you'd let me rock
You used to say her man was trash and tell me 'bout the way he'd act
I would shake my head until I realized I'm the same as that
And would he shake his head until he realized he was trash too?
So what you 'bout to do?

My friend pulled me to the side like  Did you hear about Marcus?
Our Marcus? Yeah  our Marcus
A bunch of girls say he raped them in the back of some Target
They say he drove 'em back there in his car
And then he parked it and the rest is even darker
Wait  which Marcus? 'Cause it can't be—
Yes  our Marcus

The one with perfect grades that has family in New Orleans?
Yes  that Marcus  he's got seven rape charges

Dawgs until the lifting of the fog
I always got you  turns into Well  I never thought you
Years of camaraderie suddenly disappear
Almost like you never were here
Unconditional love becomes very conditioned when push comes to shove
And all that talk of takin' bullets suddenly feels foolish
Pictures with him turn to ad campaigns  you gotta pull it
Feet held to the fire
We hold accountable the ones we hold dear out of morals  but mainly fear
The choice becomes clear
And years of camaraderie suddenly disappear
Almost like you never were here

Now it just feels like a swing and a miss
You used to think I'm the shit
Sometimes I wish you could meet me again
I know you always believed in the kid
And my music and that I'd succeed and go big
Now you think that you believed in a myth
I cannot tell you the reason for this
Summer is coming I'm facing temptations
Maybe I'm selfish and I think with my dick
Remember we spent all of those nights in my basement
I know that I'm really all that you want
Wish you could say This is all that I need
I know you see right through all of my fronts

I still remember the first time I saw you
And I do not think there was a way of preparing us
When you go to college and I chase a dream
Probably a guy with some muscles
The type that be smokin' and drinkin' that liquor
I gotta get myself focused again

Same nutsack and the same dick head (What the fuck?)
Seen that bitch and we ain't impressed (Woo)
Thick brunette and she came from Lex
Phone got bugs and they ain't insects
Feds tuned in when I send my texts
Ain't nobody worried 'bout if I'm next
'Cause they know I'm next
I thank God  I know I'm blessed
I recall when you threw shade
I can let that shit go  I guess
I'm locked in  had to go out less
Everybody act like they know best (Know best)
Her boyfriend ain't fresh
Look like someone I'm gon' outdress
She’s so wet  had to hold my breath
Ain't hit since  she know I'm pressed (Fucked up about it)
In the flesh  got connects down in Texas (Woo)
Can we have a threesome with your fuckin' best friend?
I ain't talking Florida when I say I'm destined
She ain't know my money taller than a Westin
Hotel  got your bitches checked in
Ex-chick salty just like Chex Mix (Uh)
Cop a plane ticket for my new chick once the check hits
I come from a city that is very much eclectic
But it's got another side to it that gets hectic
Shorty that I mess with got a friend that's a detective
She gon' run surveillance just to find out who I've slept with
All my jewelry gifted just like me  ain't bought a necklace
Flexin'  I'm the one that she texting (Texting)
Lightskin from DC like the Redskins (Redskins)
These rappers falling off just like dead skin
Number one spot  I'm too official
Name ringin' bells like school dismissal
She think I'm cold  I seen her nipples (Seen 'em)
I got a shot  it's off the dribble
She brought a friend  I'm in the middle
This one right here ain't sentimental
But I know you remember  I know you remember
'Cause now I'm somebody you used to know
Hang at the places I used to go
Drivin' G-Wagon with Louis V baggage
Mm  you must be used to dough
I got a shot  it's not a pistol
Number one spot  I'm too official
Name ringin' bells like school dismissal
But I know you remembеr  I know you remember
I'm from thе city where they might put one in your temple
It's really that simple
Twenty-four karat the gold on the dental
That's just how they get down  it's just what they into
I'm eatin' wagyu with wooden utensils
I made a livin' off these instrumentals
She know me well and she know I ain't gentle

Name ringin' bells like school dismissal
But I know you remember  I know you remember
I know you see me 'cause everyone does
Know they don't love me unless we in touch  that coulda been us
I was gon' take you up outta that lil' bitty town  but you just wasn't ready enough
And I'm gettin' fetti on fetti on fetti on fetti on fetti on fetti  what's up?
Came a long way from Confetti  my pen a machete
The book bag is Louis  it used to be Eddie
I look in they eyes and I know they ain't ready
'Cause now I'm somebody you used to know
Hang at the places I used to go
Drivin' G-Wagon with Louis V baggage
Mm  you must be used to dough
I got a shot  it's not a pistol
Number one spot  I'm too official

I wanna—
I wanna see some ass
I wanna see some ass
From the front to the back
'Til she hit that gas
Ciroc and the puff puff pass
Now the whole squad getting fucked up fast
And I'm still flyer than a bitch
I'ma tell her be safe
I got God with me and he's telling me things
I wanna see some ass
I wanna see some ass
From the front to the back
'Til she hit that gas
Ciroc and the puff puff pass
Now the whole squad getting fucked up fast

Going all night like the reruns
I wanna see some ass
I wanna see some ass

Ciroc and the puff puff pass
Huh  huh  what's that?
Huh  huh  what's that?
It must be my skin  I can't think of any other reason I win (Ooh)
I can't think of an explanation  it can't be the years of work I put in
It can't be the way that I stuck with the same friends
It can't be the swag I got when I walk in  it can't be
It can't be the way I treat people or how I make time to see people
Or make sure that they feel like we equals
It can't be the smile  it can't be the eye contact with these crowds
It can't be my pen  it can't be these verses
That make people feel like I'm talkin' to them
It can't be the homage I've paid
Nights when I could've left the studio early  but I stayed
It can't be the tone of my voice
It can't be the thought I put into every choice
It can't be the Jeep instead of the Rolls-Royce
It can't be the downtime with my boys
It can't be the Tribe and the Biggie and the Nas
The Outkast and the Missy in my iPod
It can't be the absence of any facade
It can't be the worldwide hometown pride
So I guess (So I guess)
It must be my skin  I can't think of any other reason I win
I can't think of an explanation  it can't be the years of work I put in
It can't be the way that I stuck with the same friends
It can't be the swag I got when I walk in  it can't be
It can't be some understanding or branding
Or maybe that I'm outstanding
Or all the South American fans that meet me at the airport upon landing
It can't be my aunties and grannies
And every other woman in my family that raised me to be upstanding
It can't be that I simply make ear candy
Especially when the industry could just plant me
Especially when I didn't grow up on Brandy
Especially when I'm havin' dinner in Frankfort with Andy
It can't be a bit of good karma
It can't be the way they all said that he's a charmer
It can't be the lack of chinks in my armor
It can't be the poise when them boys try to harm us
It can't be that we built somethin' to be a part of
It can't be the way that every beat gets barred up
So I guess
It must be my skin  I can't think of any other reason I win
I can't think of an explanation  it can't be the years of work I put in
It can't be the way that I stuck with the same friends

I'd do anything to make you smile  bitch
Travel ’round the world and come back home and now my style switched
They say I get spicy when I step out  this ain't mild shit
I hit that last night and she already feel nostalgic
Five hunnid thousand
Just for me to hit my little dance  then I'm bouncing
You know that the head keep coming ’cause she's a down  ooh
Nice dress but your birthday suit's a better outfit
Mic check (Can you hear me now 'cause I just doused it?)
I'm Jack but I came up with the fucking fountain
My OG's move a mountain  I'm cutting up like a Shaolin
I'm bouncing  I think I need somе counseling

I'ma grip that body power steering off of you
You know you a star  that's why they cheering all for you
You my lil' muse  get these lyrics all for you
And then I sing 'em like an Ed Sheeran song to you
I mean the memory is nice but I would love a tape of you
I got so much that I want to say to you
I'd do anything to make you smile
Take you to the Panama Canal
Hotels five star like they play for Coach Cal
Everything that I bet I'd be
All the kids that I grew up with
They see me out and congratulate me
Couple of 'em just graduated
Couple of 'em done had a baby
I say thank you like twenty times
Try to talk about somethin' else
Reminisce on some funny time
Even more when y'all get to drinkin' and start tellin' me all the things
That you really think
Likе what I should've done differеntly
What you think of my energy
The downsides that come with being friends with me
I can tell you think this the realest that anybody's ever been with me
But luckily I got PG
And luckily I keep them with me
I keep it humble so you can have a good time
I keep it light so you can have a lil' shine
And I sleep at night just fine
I tried to be kind
Now I'm speakin' my mind

(La música de Harry Fraud)
Once people lose touch with ya
They start to hate ya
Start to show you they true nature
Start to be the ones in the comments
That's talkin' 'bout you like you a stranger
Talkin' 'bout ya like y'all didn't have class together
Talkin' like you not humble now or you acting better
Speakin' on the things you've done that they haven't ever
I created this added pressure
I'm the one that made Jack get better
All the greats caught all the hate
All the rappers I love most at one point got called a fake
Everybody seem to know the song that I oughta make
Know the route that I oughta take
I put too much work in to just call it fate
But I keep it humble so you can have a good time
I keep it light so you can have a lil' shine
And I sleep at night just fine
I tried to be kind
Now I'm speakin' my mind
This is probably advice I keep giving you frequently
And probably will continue to give it to you frequently because
It's made a difference in my life
Take some moments today during the shoot to look around
Look at the faces of all the people you've brought together
Watch their reactions
Look at the joy on their faces
Take a moment to really absorb what you've created
What you're creating
And try to savor it
I know that you and I are built the same and that it's never enough
Just lean back for a moment today
And really comprehend the greatness that you've made
You the type of girl I would've flirted with in class
Copied every test  be the reason that I passed
I know we could have a blast
We could have a kid  am I movin' too fast?
Know I'm not your first  but I could be your last
You can't even get gas without bein' harrassed  mm
Some of these girls in the mix more than engineers
But I think you'd rather disappear
You don't know where you gon' end up  but you know it probably isn't here
I gotta put you in a different tier
IG private  spend hеr own money on the whip that she drivin'
In her prime  she's thrivin'
Met you in the dark  tryna put that light on you
Could buy you anything  let me spend some time on you
'Cause I want you  mm
I think I want you  too
Truthfully  I only give it up to very few
I know that you probably don't believe me  but it's true
Had a boyfriend I dated for like five years in school
Then another one I dated for like two
Focused on myself  what 'bout you?
We just got off tour and we sold out every building
You probably had hella bitches on you  not really
Gotta duck the cameras  they gon' treat us like we Kim and Ye
I ain't tryna keep you low  but this is high stakes

This chick got a lil' Porsche body  I might let the bro test drive it
It's hard for me to get excited  I love music  and stress 'bout it
My city haulin' and I'm cosigning this wave  comin' up next out it
Ridin' 'round and this shotgun in her Tesla
Hangin' both of my legs out of it  like What's up? (What's up?)
I got stakes and they too high now  I can't fuck up (Can't fuck up)
I like girls that's down to Earth  so don't be stuck up (Stuck up)

Paranoid  even out in paradise
Terrified to see my parents pass
Red carpet and some dress shoes
And a pair of slacks
I think I might be gettin' sick of wearin' that
I need some peace and the 'burbs might be where it's at
You know like where them Karens like to they run they errands at
I'm on a journey  man  Jarrett Jack
Got my twin with me like The Parent Trap  there and back
Serenade 'em with the clarinet
I got the tea and I ain't sharin' that
Who the fairest of 'em all? Shawty's been declarin' Jack
Fellas hatin'  I don't blame 'em  I mean how unfair is that?
The top is where they like to see you get embarrassed at
Especially when you charismatic and the coppas wear Hermès

All these rumors and these unchecked facts
Old friends I forget to text back
Maybe this'll show where my heads at  my bad (You know)
Every sky can't be blue
It's hard to see when you're walkin' in the grey

I wanna treat you to some things that you'd enjoy

And you the type of girl I wanna bring to Thanksgiving
I became exactly what I wanted to

Telling girls I love 'em and they love me too (Ooh)
I don't question if they mean it 'cause I know they do
Started being me when I realized it was okay to
First album and I know just how it's gon' debut
Track three is where I tell her we gon' rendezvous
I'm signed to the gatekeepers
Don't believe the gossip 'cause it ain't true
Half of the dreams I had already came true
And they never told me anything I couldn't do
I got a mirror in my room I like to look into
Classmates can't believe the place I took it to
If I didn't rap then I would be a good masseuse
She leaving my hotel wearing something I packed
My wardrobe's spread across a whole map
JWise used to book me for the open mics
Kills me when they act like this was overnight
Like we didn't do a tour in a tiny van
They love it when I rap and I don't even put a chorus
 it sound like a spaceship door opening
 they don't want me to be modest
 your new shit is not it
 I'm simply a product of people I rock with

Or maybe she doin’ volunteer work in Rio

Surrounded by family  I'm not with other people
They say I got my pops' demeanor and mother's features
The Garden still Private as ever  the gang thrivin' together
Ya boy's strivin' to be the most dominant ever
The hardest white boy since the one who rapped about vomit and sweaters
And hold the comments 'cause I promise you I'm honestly better than whoever came to your head right then
They ain't cut from the same thread like him
They don't study  doin' work to get ahead like him
They don't toss and turn in the fuckin' bed like him
