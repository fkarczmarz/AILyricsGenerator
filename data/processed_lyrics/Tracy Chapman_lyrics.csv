lyrics
"Fast girls walk slow
On side streets
Sometimes the girls who walk alone
Aren't found for days or weeks
On the busy boulevards
Bad boys call you names
And cruise you hard
Bullies laugh and grin and beat
Your soft skin against
The cold concrete
Knock you down
Make you bleed
Make you cry
And make you think
I'll die here soon if I don't leave
If I don't leave if I don't leave
You might also likeThis patch of sky and native ground
Take turns to push and pull you down
Forget trying to live and be happy
I'll take safe and terror free
Hit the floor
Shut off the lights
As the bullets fly
Terror rules the dark night
Dogs hang from the trees
These training ground for punks and thieves
Home of poor white retirees
Who didn't bail
And couldn't sell
When color made the grass less green
Apples are filled with razor blades
But fools and innocents believe
That love and faith and truth and beauty
Can make a garden of this human factory
Bad girls run fast
Leave home alone
No trace or clue of where they've gone
Sometimes these girls are never found
Never found never found
Who would dare to go
Under the bridge
Over the tracks
That separates whites from blacks
Choose sides
Run for your lives
Tonight the riots begin
On the back streets of America
They kill the dream of America
Little black girl gets assaulted
Ain't no reason why
Newspaper prints the story
And racist tempers fly
Next day it starts a riot
Knives and guns are drawn
Two black boys get killed
One white boy goes blind

Across the lines
Who would dare to go
Under the bridge
Over the tracks
That separates whites from blacks
Choose sides
Run for your lives
Tonight the riots begin
On the back streets of America
They kill the dream of America
Little black girl gets assaulted
Don't no one know her name
Lots of people hurt and angry
She's the one to blame
Across the lines
Who would dare to go
Under the bridge
Over the tracks
That separates whites from blacks
Choose sides
Run for your lives
Tonight the riots begin
On the back streets of America
They kill the dream of America
Say she want to spare the children
She say don't give or sell your soul away
Cause all that you have is your soul
Don't be tempted by the shiny apple
Don't you eat of a bitter fruit
Hunger only for a taste of justice
Hunger only for a world of truth
Cause all that you have is your soul
I was a pretty young girl once
I had dreams I had hight hopes
I married a man he stole my heart away
He gave his love but what a high price I paid
And all that you have is your soul
Don't be tempted by the shiny apple
Don't you eat of a bitter fruit
Hunger only for a taste of justice
Hunger only for a world of truth
Cause all that you have is your soul
Why was I such a young fool
Thought I'd make history
Making babies was the best I could do
Thought I'd made something that could be mine forever
Found out the hard way one can't possess another
And all that you have is your soul
You might also likeDon't be tempted by the shiny apple
Don't you eat of a bitter fruit
Hunger only for a taste of justice
Hunger only for a world of truth
Cause all that you have is your soul
To beat the system
To make a deal and have no depts to pay
I'd take it all take it all I'd run away
Me for myself first class and first rate
But all that you have is your soul
Don't be tempted by the shiny apple
Don't you eat of a bitter fruit
Hunger only for a taste of justice
Hunger only for a world of truth
Cause all that you have is your soul
Here I am waiting for a better day
A second chance
A little luck to come my way
A hope to dream a hope that I can sleep again
And wake in the world with a clear conscience and clean hands
All that you have is your soul
Don't be tempted by the shiny apple
Don't you eat of a bitter fruit
Hunger only for a taste of justice
Hunger only for a world of truth
Cause all that you have is your soul
My mama told me
Cause she say she learned the hard way
Say she want to spare the children
She say don't give or sell your soul away
Cause all that you have is your soul
All that you have
All that you have
All that you have
Came upon the shore
Found you were conquering America
You spoke of peace
But waged a war
While you were conquering America
There was land to take
And people to kill
While you were conquering America
You served yourself
Did God's will
While you were conquering America
The ghost of Columbus haunts this world
'Cause you're still conquering America
The meek won't survive
Or inherit the earth
'Cause you're still conquering America
America
America
America
You might also likeYou found bodies to serve
Submit and degrade
While you were conquering America
Made us soldiers and junkies
Prisoners and slaves
While you were conquering America
America

America
Your hands are at my throat
My back's against the wall
Because you're still conquering America
We're sick and tired hungry and poor
'Cause you're still conquering America
You bomb the very ground
That feeds your own babies
You're still conquering America
Your sons and your daughters
May never sing your praises
While you're conquering America
America
America
America
I see you eyes seek a distant shore
While you're conquering America
Taking rockets to the moon
Trying to find a new world
And you're still conquering America

The ghost of Columbus haunts this world
'Cause you're still conquering America
You're still conquering America
I don't know if I can do right
Done so many things wrong
I don't know if I can do right
At this point in my life
I've done so many things wrong
I don't know if I can do right
If you put your trust in me
I hope I won't let you down
If you give me a chance I'll try
You see it's been a hard road
The road I'm traveling on
And if I take your hand
I might lead you down the path to ruin
I've had a hard life
I'm just saying it so you'll understand
I'm doing the best I can
At this point in my life
You might also like
At this point in my life
Although I've mostly walked in the shadows
I'm still searching for the light
Won't you put your faith in me
We both know that's what matters
If you give me a chance I'll try
You see I've been climbing stairs
But mostly stumbling down
I've been reaching high
Always losing ground
You see I've conquered hills
But I still have mountains to climb
I'm doing the best I can
At this point in my life
Before we take a step
Before we walk down that path
Before I make any promises
Before you have regrets
Before we talk commitment
Let me tell you of my past
All I've seen and all I've done
The things I'd like to forget
At this point in my life
At this point in my life
I'd like to live as if only love mattered
As if redemption was in sight
As if the search to live honestly
Is all that anyone needs
No matter if you find it
You see when I've touched the sky
The earth's gravity has pulled me down
But now I've reconciled that in this world
Birds and angels get the wings to fly
If you can believe in this heart of mine
If you can give it a try
Then I'll reach inside and find and give you
All the sweetness that I have
At this point in my life
Is all that you can't say
Years gone by and still
Words don't come easily
Forgive me
Is all that you can't say
Years gone by and still
Words don't come easily
But you can say baby
Baby can I hold you tonight
Maybe if I told you the right words
At the right time
You'd be mine
I love you
Is all that you can't say
Years gone by and still
Words don't come easily

Now there ain't place to run to
Ain't no place to run to
When he hold it in his hand
He feel mighty he feel strong
Now there ain't no place to run to
Ain't no place to run
One day he may come back
Repay us for what we've done
Then where you gonna run to
Where you gonna run
But one fine day
All our problems will be solved
Bang bang bang
We'll shoot him down
Give him drugs and give him candy
Anything to make him think he's happy
And he won't ever come for us
He won't ever come
But if he does
And if there's no one else around
Bang bang bang
We'll shoot him down
You might also likeIf he preys only on his neighbors
Brothers sisters and friends
We'll consider it a favor
We'll consider justice done
But if he comes for you or me
And we can place a gun in his hand
Bang bang bang
We'll shoot him dead
What you go and do
You go and give the boy a gun
Now there ain't no place to run to
Ain't no place to run
Now we'll all be at his mercy
If he decides to hunt us down
Cause there ain't no place to run to
Ain't no place to run
If he wants the chances that you took from him
And nothing that you own
Then there'll be no place to run to
There'll be no place to run
And if he finds himself to be
A reflection of us all
Bang bang bang
He'll shoot us down
Before you can raise your eyes to read
The writing on the wall
Bang bang bang
He'll shoot you down
Before you can bridge the gulf between
And embrace him in your arms
Bang bang bang
You and your honey lips
You and all the sweet things that they say
You and your wild wild ways
One day you just up and walked away
You left me hurting
But I can forgive you for that now
You taught me something
Something took me half my life to learn
When you give all yourself away
Just tell them to be careful of your heart
Be careful of this heart of mine
It just might break and send some splinters flying
Be careful
You you you
You you you
You you you
Took my love
Thought you took it all
You might also likeYou you you

Took my love
And now you're gone
But I'm not breaking down
And I'm not falling apart
I just lost a little faith
When you broke my heart
Given a chance I might try it again
But I wouldn't risk it all this time
I'd save
A little love for myself
Enough for my heart to mend
A little love for myself
One day I just might love again
One day some sweet smile might turn my head
One day I just might give all myself away
One day
One day
Loud voices behind the wall
Another sleepless night for me
It won't do no good to call
The police
Last night I heard the screaming
Loud voices behind the wall
Another sleepless night for me
It won't do no good to call
The police
And when they arrive
They say they can't interfere
With domestic affairs
Between a man and his wife
And as they walk out the door
The tears well up in her eyes
Last night I heard the screaming
Then a silence that chilled my soul
Prayed that I was dreaming
When I saw the ambulance in the road
You might also like
And the policeman said
I'm here to keep the peace
Will the crowd disperse?
I think we all could use some sleep
Last night I heard the screaming
Loud voices behind the wall
Another sleepless night for me
It won't do no good to call
The police
By stripping me of everyhing I own
They're tryin' to hurt me inside
And make me into a white man's drone
But this one's not for sale
And I was born to fight
I ain't been knocked down yet
I was born to fight
I'm the surest bet
There ain't no man no woman
No beast alive that can beat me
'Cause I'm born to fight
They're tryin' to dig into my soul
And take away the spirit of my god
They're tryin' to take control
And monitor my every thought
I won't let down my guard
And I was born to fight
I ain't been knocked down yet
I was born to fight
I'm the surest bet

One day you'll find you're walking
Lonely
Baby I
Never meant to hurt you
Sometimes the best intentions
Still don't make things right
But all my ghosts they find me
Like my past they think they own me
In dreams and dark corners they surround me
Till I cry I cry
Let me take this time to set the record straight
Let me take this time to take it all back
Let me take this time to tell you how I felt
Let me take this time to try and make it right
All the bridges that you burn
Come back one day to haunt you
One day you'll find you're walking
Lonely
But you can
Walk away
Be all alone
Spend all your time
Thinking about the way things used to be
If love feels right
You work it out
You don't give it up
Baby
Anybody tell you that
Anybody tell you that
Anybody tell you that
You should take some time maybe sleep on it tonight
You should take some time baby heed the words I said
You should take some time think about your life
You should take some time before you throw it all away

So all the bridges that you burn
Come back one day to haunt you
One day you'll find you're walking
If you saw the face of God and love
Would you change?
Would you change?
If you knew that love can break your heart
When you're down so low you cannot fall
Would you change?

Who in spite of his young age and small size knew his mind
For every copper penny and clover he would find
Make a wish for better days the end of hard times
For no more cold feet
His clothes were always clean
His face was always scrubbed
There was food on the table enough to fill him up
His house was full of life. His house was full of love
But when winter days arrived
There was never money enough to shod his
Cold feet
He grew up to be a worker determined to succeed
But with nobody to share the life he'd made
No body to keep him warm at night
When he'd go to sleep he'd sleep alone with his
Cold feet

One night he walked the street looking to the heaven's above
Searching for a shooting star a benevolent God
When a woman passing by brushed his arm
He turned and found love
He then wished for the courage to ask this stranger
Who she was to not have
Cold feet
One year later he stood beside her
He vowed I'll give you everything you want
She said I'll take some love from my heart
To keep your body warm
You won't have
Cold feet
He thought she'd like the party life and want the finer things
So he promised more than he could buy
And he promised her the sun and moon to not have
Cold feet
He worked day and night his fingers to the bone
His worried mind guilty conscience drive him on
He can't give her what she needs
He wants to give her what he thinks she wants
And his cold feet
He'd struggled all his life to be an honest man
Proud that the dirt on his palms was the soil of the land
But some guys he knew from high school days
Said they had a plan to get rich quick
And they could count him in if he don't have
Cold feet
He thought about their offer accepted it without qualms
Dreamt about the life he'd buy
The comfort that would come without
Cold feet
He decided to drive a car
He decided to carry a gun
To take the biggest risk of all
Prove his loyalty to his friends
He decided to tell his wife things would soon turn around
He said the little boy is dead
A man stands with you now without
Cold feet
Without cold feet
He thought he'd set his clock right
He though he'd read his watch
He left in such a hurry he didn't think to wish for luck
Makes no difference if you're early
No difference if you're late
When you're out of time
The flowers have been laid
You're six feet underground
With cold feet
But you never made any sacrifice
Demons they are on my trail
I'm standing at the crossroads of the hell
I look to the left I look to the right
There're hands that grab me on every side
Mmmmmmmmm
Mmmmmmmmm
All you folks think I got my price
At which I'll sell all that is mine
You think money rules when all else fails
Go sell your soul and keep your shell
I'm trying to protect what I keep inside
All the reasons why I live my life
Mmmmmmmmm

Say I should be willing to compromise
I say all you demons go back to hell
I'll save my soul save myself
Mmmmmmmmm

Save my soul save myself
Save my soul save myself

I want a ticket to anywhere
Maybe we make a deal
Maybe together we can get somewhere
Any place is better
Maybe we'll make somethin'
You got a fast car
I got a plan to get us outta here
I been working at the convenience store
Managed to save just a little bit of money
Won't have to drive too far
Just across the border and into the city
You and I can both get jobs
Finally see what it means to be living

His body's too young to look like his

She wanted more from life than he could give

I had a feelin' I could be someone
You got a fast car
You still ain't got a job
And I work in a market as a checkout girl
I know things will get better
You'll find work and I'll get promoted
And we'll move out of the shelter
Buy a bigger house and live in the suburbs
City lights lay out before us
And your arm felt nice wrapped 'round my shoulder
And I had a feeling that I belonged
I had a feelin' I could be someone
You got a fast car
I got a job that pays all our bills
You stay out drinkin' late at the bar
See more of your friends than you do of your kids
I'd always hoped for better
So take your fast car and keep on drivin'
City lights lay out before us
And your arm felt nice wrapped 'round my shoulder
And I had a feeling that I belonged
I had a feelin' I could be someone
You got a fast car
Is it fast enough so you can fly away?
You gotta make a decision

This feeling inside I have for you

Safe from the guards

Leaving me at a loss
For words to express my feelings

But with feelings this strong
I'm no longer the master
Of my emotions
No words to say

Hoping soon he'd die
That his body and spirit would waste away
And soon after that his mind
But every day is born a fool
One who thinks that he can rule
One who says tomorrow's mine
One who wakes one day to find
The prison doors open the shackles broken
And chaos in the street
Everybody sing we're free free free free
Everybody sing we're free free free free
Everybody sing we're free free free free
They throwed him in jail
And they kept him there
Hoping his memory'd die
That the people forget how he once led
And fought for justice in their lives
But every day is born a man
Who hates what he can't understand
Who thinks the answer is to kill
Who thinks his actions are god's will

Look for God and life on distant planets
Have your faith in the ever after
While each of us holds inside the map to the labyrinth
And heaven's here on earth
We are the spirit the collective conscience
We create the pain and the suffering and the beauty in this world
Heaven's here on earth
In our faith in humankind
In our respect for what is earthly
In our unfaltering belief
In peace and love and understanding

Of ordinary people leading ordinary lives
Heaven's in our hearts
In our faith in humankind

And an unfaltering belief that truth is divinity
And heaven's here on earth
I've seen spirits
I've met angels
I've touched creations beautiful and wondrous
I've been places where I question all I think I know
We are born inside the gates with the power to create life
And to take it away
The world is our temple
The world is our church
Heaven's here on earth
If we have faith in humankind
And respect for what is earthly
And an unfaltering belief
In peace and love and understanding
This could be
Pour a round for me and my friends
I won't go there or drink it if you paid me
When they come to waylay me
When they close in for the capture
I did it all
I did it all
For the love and the laughter
I did it all
I did it all
I did it all
Slept in late
Stayed up for days
Partied hard
Lived my twenties in haze
Smoked second-hand in crowded bars
With the A-list of B-list movie stars
When they come to arrest me
Pat me down and undress me
I'll confess without Miranda
Strike a pose for the tabloid cameras
I did it all

Crash and burn
And then you know you're living
I did it all
Some pain a few tears after
I did it all
To the last line of the final chapter
I did it all
I did it all
My heat is a wound that festers
Seduced my share in silk and polyester
Oh my great loves
And my few losses
I'll tell it all
When my little black book is published
When they come to interview me
For my made for TV movie
Say I'm the bitch who was a bastard
Who did it all for the love and laughter
I did it all
I did it all
If not today  then
Why make your promises?
A love declared for days to come
Is as good as none
You can wait til morning comes
You can wait for the new day
You can wait and lose this heart
You can wait and soon be sorry
'Cause if not now  then when?
If not today  then
Why make your promises?
A love declared for days to come
Is as good as none
Now love's the only thing that's free
We must take it where it's found
Pretty soon it may be costly
'Cause if not now  then when?
If not today  then
Why make your promises?
A love declared for days to come

Don't see the links of chain
Binding blood
Our own ancestors
Are hungry ghosts
Closets so full of bones
They won't close
Call it upward mobility
But you've been sold down the river
Just another form of slavery
And the whole man-made white world
Is your master
You in your fancy
Material world
Create in your own image
A supreme god
Your virgin mary
Your holy ghosts
Claimed to be pure of heart
Have hands that are stained with blood

Material world
Don't see the links of chain
I make a fool of myself
In matters of the heart
We should have been holding each other
Instead we talked
I make a fool of myself
In matters of the heart
But I asked before
Your reply was kind and polite
One wants more
When one's denied
I make a fool of myself
In matters of the heart
I won't call it love
But it feels good to have passion in my life
If there's a battle
I hope my head always defers to my heart
In matters of the heart
I guess I'm crazy to think
I can give you what you don't want
I make a fool of myself
In matters of the heart
You might also likeMake myself sick
I can't think of anything else
I can't sleep at night
I make a fool of myself
In matters of the heart
I wish that I had the power
To make these feelings stop
I lose all self control
In matters of the heart
I can't believe
It's so hard to find someone
To give affection to
And from whom you can receive
I guess it's just the draw of the cards
In matters of the heart
You caught me off guard
Somehow you reached me
Where I thought I had nothing left inside
I've learned a lesson I've been edified
In matters of the heart
I've spent my nights
Where the sleeping dogs lie
Not by your side
It feels so lonely
Once again I've left to much to chance
In matters of the heart
Here I sit
I'm feeling sorry for myself
It's quite a sight
But I have you to blame
For reminding me
We're all alone in this world
In matters of the heart
I'm already missing you
Although we won't say good-byes
Until tomorrow afternoon
Maybe when and if I see you again
We'll see eye to eye
In matters of the heart
I have no harsh words for you
I have no tears to cry
If the moon were full
I'd be howling inside
It only hurts
In matters of the heart
If today were my birthday
I'd be reborn
As Bronte's bird a bird that could fly
And all accounts would be settled
In matters of the heart
I guess I'll never have
I'll be working for somebody else
Until I'm in my grave
I'll be dreaming of a life of ease
And mountains oh mountains o' things
To have a big expensive car
Drag my furs on the ground
And have a maid that I can tell
To bring me anything
Everyone will look at me with envy and with greed
I'll revel in their attention
And mountains oh mountains o' things
Sweet lazy life
Champagne and caviar
I hope you'll come and find me
Cause you know who we are
Those who deserve the best in life
And know what money's worth
And those whose sole misfortune
Was having mountains of nothing at birth

Oh they tell me
There's still time to save my soul
They tell me
Renounce all
Renounce all those material things you gained by
Exploiting other human beings
Consume more than you need
This is the dream
Make you pauper
Or make you queen
I won't die lonely
I'll have it all prearranged
A grave that's deep and wide enough
For me and all my mountains o' things
Oh they tell me
There's still time to save my soul
They tell me
Renounce all
Renounce all those material things you gained by
Exploiting other human beings
Mostly I feel lonely
Good good people are
Good people are only
My stepping stones
It's gonna take all my mountains o' things
To surround me
Keep all my enemies away
Keep my sadness and loneliness at bay
The life I've always wanted
I guess I'll never have
I'll be working for somebody else
Until I'm in my grave
I'll be dreaming of a life of ease
And mountains oh mountains o' things
Less than I should
Say I have known some
Too well for my own good
Say I'm a saint of mercy
Say I'm a whore
I've been a lot of things
But never yours
I wear my mama's dress
Her finest clothes
Daddy showed me outside
To meet you on the front porch
I laugh at all your jokes
But you look bored
I've been a lot of things but never yours
You never cross my mind
You can be sure
You'll never catch my eye
Waiting for you watching the door
I let you hold me
Dry lip kiss me on the dance hall floor

If tenderness is what you need
I've got that to give
If you need some affection
Baby these are open arms

I'll let you in
I'll be open with my thoughts

Who stole your heart? Left you with a space
That no one and nothing can fill
Who stole your heart? Who took it away?
Knowing that without it you can't live
Who took away the part
So essential to the whole?
Left you a hollow body
Skin and bone
What robber?
What thief?
Who stole your heart?
And the key?
Who stole your heart?
The smile from your face
The innocence the light from your eyes
Who stole your heart or did you give it away?

Who stole your heart?
Did you know but forget
The method and moment in time?
Was it a trickster
Using mirrors and sleight of hand?
A strong elixir
Or a potion that you drank?
Who hurt your heart?
Bruised it in a place
That no one and nothing can heal
You've gone to wizards
Princes and magic men
You've gone to witches
But still all sentiment is gone
But still you have no trust in no one
If you can tear down the walls
Throw your armor away
Remove all roadblocks barricades
If you can forget there are bandits
And dragons to slay
And don't forget that you defend an empty space
And remember the Tin Man
Found he had what he thought he lacked
Remember the Tin Man
Go find your heart and take it back
Who stole your heart
Maybe no one can say
I know Mary's little baby
Came into the world
Just to save me
But I don't know about you
My God's a mighty big God
My God can shake the world up
Plagues and famines
Frogs and locusts
Walking on water
Burning bushes
Rolling the thunder
And parting the waters too
My God is good in the kitchen
Make a good meal from bread and fishes
Feed the hungry pour the wine
Everybodys welcome to have a good time
Sit at his table enjoy the food

Save us all
And love the sinners too
But if pride goeth before the fall

A failure in the race

About the trail you'd left of broken hearts
About the sea of tears too wide to cross
But a little bad press has never scared me off
So I burned a path to figure out
How to get me some of what you got
I've got a red hot heart
If the talk is true yours is the same
We should be together
Let our passions fan love's flame
When I looked for you I almost passed you by
You were so cool and calm
I thought my friends had lied
But I thought so much reserve must make you wild inside
It was there and then that I knew
I had to get some of what you got
I've got a red hot heart
If the talk is true yours is the same
We should be together
Let our passions fan love's flame

Leaving only smoke and ashes
Only smoke and ashes  baby
I've got a red hot heart
And your heart's as blue as the blood in your veins
I say: There's fire down below
You say: It's only smoke and ashes  baby
I'm crying all the time
Salty stinging tears
And mourning for the past carbon-dated years
But knowing now for certain that you were always right
Because if a breeze could blow you out of my life
It's only smoke and ashes  baby
Only smoke and ashes  baby
I've got a red hot heart
And your heart's as blue as the blood in your veins
I say: There's fire down below
You say: It's only smoke and ashes  baby
I was blinded by devotion
My unwavering love for you
So blinded that I thought all your lies were true
But now I know for certain since you've gone away
It was just a smoldering fire I mistook for a blaze
Only smoke and ashes  baby
I've got a red hot heart
And your heart's as blue as the blood in your veins
(Your heart's as blue)
I say: There's fire down below
You say: It's only smoke and ashes  baby
(Only)
Only smoke and ashes  baby

If the sky that we look upon
Should tumble and fall
And the mountains should crumble to the sea

Where people live everyday
Off the waste and decay
Off the discards of their fellow man
Here in subcity life is hard
We can't receive any government relief
For disregarding me
They say there's too much crime in these city streets
My sentiments exactly
Government and big business hold the purse strings
When I worked I worked in the factories
I'm at the mercy of the world

Place of our birth
How can we stand aside

About what's real and true
What can not be proven
What can be assumed
Once when I was younger
In the bloom of youth
I received an honest answer
When a lie would do
And now all I do is sit
In my darkened room
And on occasion break my silence
To howl at the moon
To curse every nerve
And neuron in my brain
That won't stop the pain I'm feeling
And let me stop thinking
I used to think
Galileo would agree
That the world was round
And you'd come round to me
But I have looked for you
And you're nowhere in sight
The world must be flat
The Babylonians were right

I used to think
Consider gravity
If I placed you on a pedestal
You'd slip and fall for me
But you floated on the air
Far away at light speed
I guess some objects do defy
The laws that we conceive
And now all I do is sit
In my darkened room
And on occasion break my silence
To howl at the moon
To curse every nerve
And neuron in my brain
That won't stop the pain I'm feeling
And let me stop thinking
Stop thinking of you
Stop thinking of you
Stop thinking of you
I used to think
It took all my time
Analyzing you
Your mind on my mind
Your name my mantra
Repeated on my lips
That once tried to kiss you
A memory unrepressed
And now all I do is sit
In my darkened room
And on occasion break my silence
To howl at the moon
To curse every nerve
And neuron in my brain
That won't stop the pain I'm feeling
And let me stop thinking
Stop thinking of you
Stop thinking of you
I won't show I'm vulnerable
This time
I won't give in first
This time
I will hold out with my love
This time
I will not be hurt
I'm gonna love myself
More than anyone else
I'm gonna treat me right
I'm gonna make you say
That you love me first
And you'll be the one
With the most to lose tonight

I'd be at peace and I'd have no desire
If I'd lived right
There would be cherubs with tiny harps arrows and bows
I'd have a halo and a flowing white robe
I'd be enfolded by a celestial light
If I'd lived right
But I'm feeling hot and bothered under the collar
I feel the sweat breaking out on my brow
I feel the heat and I know it's the passion
The love I can't disavow
If this is a dream wake me up now
If this is a movie let's edit these scenes out
It would be a PG instead of an X-rated life
If I'd lived right
Some would call me a cheat call me a liar
Say that I've been defeated by the basest desired
Yes I have strayed and succumbed to my vices
But I tried to live right
But I have no regrets no guilt in my heart
I only feel sadness for any pain that I've caused
I guess I wouldn't bother to worry at all
If I'd lived right
Do you live by the book do you play by the rules?
Do you care what is thought by others about you?
If this day is all that is promised to you
Do you life for the future the present the past?
If there is one thing I know I know I will die
If anyone cares some stranger my critique my life
I may be revered or defamed and decried
But I tried to live right
There would be psalms sung by a choir
I would have a white robe a halo newly acquired
I'd be at peace and I'd have no desire
 you are always standing
 I don the veil
 you are always standing
 I give my pledge
 we're living
 you are always standing
 I am revealed
