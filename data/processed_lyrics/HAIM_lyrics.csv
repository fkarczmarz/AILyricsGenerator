" my head is spinning
 Have I lost my mind?
 I'm gonna lose
 floating away
 floating away
 my head is spinning
 Have I lost my mind?
 what are you doing?)
 uh-uh-uh
 floating away
 floating away
 my head is spinning
 Have I lost my mind?
 what's up?
 I promised myself I wouldn't call again but ahh...
Just calling to see if you're still up
But straight to voicemail  uh
Yeah  no biggie
Um  if you're up or whatever  just hit me up
Now you're calling
3 AM  my head is spinning
Pushed off the sheets from my bed
'Cause the phone keeps ringing
All I keep thinking is  Have I lost my mind?
But I'm picking up for the last time
Either way  I'm gonna lose
But I just wanna give
I just can't stop staring at it
I just can't resist
I'm floating away
Keep floating away
Floating away  floating away
I'm floating away
Keep floating away
Floating away  floating away

Now you're calling
3 AM  my head is spinning
Pushed off the sheets from my bed
'Cause the phone keeps ringing
All I keep thinking is  Have I lost my mind?
But I'm picking up for the last time
You and I don't have to meet
But it's fun to think we could
On the screen and in my jeans
Just make me feel good
I'm floating away
Keep floating away
Floating away  floating away
I'm floating away
Keep floating away
Floating away  floating away
Now you're calling
3 AM  my head is spinning
Pushed off the sheets from my bed
'Cause the phone keeps ringing
All I keep thinking is  Have I lost my mind?
But I'm picking up for the last time
Now you're calling  3 AM
Now you're calling  3 AM
Now you're calling  3 AM
When I look in your eyes
This is not what you wanted
You never liked surprises
It's not about them or what they think we do
I never cared about what they said
I only cared about me and you
I'm not something that you can buy
You know I've never been that type (Fuck no)
Never cared about this life
'Cause if you took it away
And I guess you never knew
All that ever mattered was you
So what is it like now that you don't have me?
Do you think about all the things I did to you?
Do you think about how to get me back?

And I guess you never knew
All that ever mattered was you
I'm pulling away (I'm not something that you can buy)
You know I've never been that type (Fuck no)
I'm pulling away (Never cared about this life)
I'm pulling away ('Cause if you took it away)
And I guess you never knew
Never really mattered that much to me
Now all these apologies are on repeat
Is it destiny or just chemistry?
We're living in such extremes
And life won't wait around
So are we gonna give it another try?
Are we gonna give it another try?
'Cause if it's luck that's not on our side
I'm wishing the best for the next in line
One thing's true
Every memory leads back to you
Got your hat in the back faded up
Camo tee in the crease of the passenger seat
And every time I try to leave them out
My feelings come back around
So are we gonna give it another try?
Are we gonna give it another try?
'Cause if it's luck that's not on our side
I'm wishing the best for the next in line
But are we gonna give it another try?
But are we gonna give it another try?

Wrapped up in your old fleece
I put it on when I can't sleep
When I call and I can't reach you
Worried that it makes me look weak to you
So are we gonna give it another try?
Are we gonna give it another try?
'Cause if it's luck that's not on our side
I'm wishing the best for the next in line
Baby (We can give this another try)
 I'm done I'm done
 I'm done I'm done
 you ain't gonna pin this one on me
 I'm not sleeping here tonight
 she can't relate to anyone
 she can't relate to anyone
 it's just a toss-up
 over it all
 I want it all
 all the times I've said it before
 and I know that now
 I want it all
 those days are gone
 I gave you my all
 gone all along
 all the times I've said it before
 I'll never get that back
 'cause those days are gone
 those days are gone
 days are gone (Ha)
 days are gone (Ha)
 days are gone (Ha)
 days are gone (Ha)
 days are gone (Ha)
 days are gone (Ha)
 days are gone (Ha)
 days are gone (Ha)
 those days are gone
Still I never want it to go
I would hold it up to my cold heart
Feel the way it used to start up
To the way that I was before
Hungry for what was to come
Now I'm longing for the way I was
Take me back
'Cause I can't go on
If your love isn't strong
If you can't hold on

No (If your love isn't strong)
All my life I wasn't trying to get on a highway
I was wondering which way to go
Spending all of my damn time (Damn time)
Leaving all the weight behind
Screaming for what was to come
Now I'm dreaming 'bout the way I was
Take me back
'Cause I can't go on
If your love isn't strong
If you can't hold on
No (If your love isn't strong)
And if I have to beg for your love
T-t-tell me
And if I have to beg for your love
Don't save me
Don't save me
When I was in the moment
Well  I didn't understand
Ooh  yeah  you did me so harsh
Left me low with my high heels in the parking lot
Always thought I'd see it coming (Mm)
But I don't
Gotta leave the engine running in the front seat
In my mama's winter coat
I don't wanna give up on you
I don't wanna  don't wanna
I don't wanna have to
Well  we both have nights
Waking up in strangers' beds
But I don't wanna  don't wanna
I don't wanna give up yet
Ooh  yeah  it's still early days
Don't know what I mean to you
I don't know what to say
Ooh  yeah  don't walk away
Don't look at me like that 'cause my mind's 'bout to change

Can't believe that I'm nervous (Mm)

Well  we both have nights
Waking up in strangers' beds

But I couldn't let it go  it was too hard to get going
And I kept hoping that you would run first
I couldn't let it go  you were too good to know
You were my own
The memories hold
They're overgrown
But now I know
There's no climbing over
Because I know you'll never see me through
Well  I can feel my heart pressing down on me
Feeling like the sun setting on the sea
It's getting to the edge of what could be
I can't fight it off  I can't fight it off
Oh  you know you could've had it all
But you want me like your crown
And it seemed your favorite thing to do
Was to keep me in the dark and turned around
You might also like
You can say I'm crazy for giving up
You can wave your sayings like a flag
You can wave high over your head
You can sing your song to bring me again
You were my own
The memories hold
They're over grown
Moments of the past
Have dimmed too much
To bring us back
But I can feel my heart pressing down on me
Feeling like the sun setting on the sea
It's getting to the edge of what could be
I can't fight it off  I can't fight it off
Well  I can feel my heart pressing down on me
Feeling like the sun setting on the sea
It's getting to the edge of what could be
I can't fight it off  I can't fight it off
No I can't  no I can't fight it off
Over and over  over and over
No I can't  no I can't fight it off
Over and over  over and over
Well  I can feel my heart pressing down on me
Feeling like the sun setting on the sea
It's getting to the edge of what could be
And I can't fight it off  I can't fight it off
Edge of what could be
Edge of what could be
Edge of what could be
Over and over  over and over
Edge of what could be
Edge of what could be
Edge of what could be
 I know
 I could let go
 and in the middle
 I know

Come on!
Huh!
Can you hear the justice of thunder right here?
The need for speed
Got it ringing down to your knees
Get her on the prowl
Feel it shaking to your core
Feel it quaking
Do you want more?
Can you see our power shaking the tree?
Bam! Full bang!
You know we can't bе tamed
You can't slow down
We're taking it out of town
On vinеs we swing
We're getting you in the ring
You might also like
Feel it rumble to your core
Do you stumble?
Do you want more?
Remember trying to stay together?
My time  oh  you took it all  you tried to see
You tried to bring yourself up without involving me
It isn't fair to have your way
Can't you see? It isn't fair to have your way
But I'm trying to get your attention  I need you to know that
I know  I know  I know you ain't the one to play the game
Now  I know I  I'm never gonna go your way
Forever we tried to make it right
But together  we saw the end in sight
I'm tired of fighting the good fight
If you say the word  then I'll say goodbye
Forever I see you and me
Forever I'll try for you and I
No  I never believed in their insight
Just another good reason to get it right

I don't wanna turn around  so come on  baby
Come on and try to let it out
Let's figure it out  let's get back to where we started out

Now  I know I  I'm never gonna go your way
Forever we tried to make it right
But together  we saw the end in sight
I'm tired of fighting the good fight
If you say the word  then I'll say goodbye
Forever I see you and me

I thought I found one of them
Stood by him every time I was scared
Thought he was a modest man
Who could put me back together again
Tried so hard to read his mind through his eyes
Three fingers on the edge
You always talked me down in the end
Made me think you were right all this time
Both of us holding back
But you were the most guilty of that
Someone else on your mind all this time
You might also like
You told me not to walk away
It was always for the better
And I guess I should've known
The truth is it's your issue
I know I need to let it go
And though I have found happiness
In a life that's truly mine
You'd think I could just laugh it off
But it gets me every time
Found it in silence
 I wanna feel that empty space
 but you could do no wrong
 even though it makes me miserable
 but it's true
 I'm gonna lose
 but it's true
 but it's true
But you shouldn't have
Now it's your fault if I mess around
I took a drag
But I shouldn't have
Now I'm coughing up like I
Never smoked a pack
I want to get off
But you're such a tease
Throw the keys back to me
Go on and kick off your boots
In the passenger seat
And I can't look past what I'm sad about
You did me bad
And I did it back
Wrong with that?
I want to get off
But you're such a tease
Throw the keys back to me
Go on and kick off your boots
In the passenger seat

We're watching the sunrise from the kitchen counter
You say you wanna go slower but I wanna go faster
Faster and faster
I want to get off
So that I can hear everything you're saying
Now I know you're going
You just threw this away
You know I ain't gonna take it (Go slow)
But we ain't gonna make it (I know)
I can't make you stay
From your heat now
Going crazy trying hard to forget
From your heat now
To the way that I was
'Cause you took away all my young life
And I hate who I've become
You might also like
From your heat now
I know
I'm giving in and believing every lie
For now the moon is night
I turned off the light
And you shook up the foundation (Go slow now)
With your intimidation (I know)
From your heat now
Going crazy trying hard to forget
From your heat now
To the way that I was
'Cause you took away all my young life
And I hate who I've become
From your heat now
No
From your heat now
No
From your heat now
From your heat now
To the way that I was
'Cause you took away all my young life
And I hate who I've become
Go back (Go back)
Go back (Go back)
Go back
Took one look to realize
Tell 'em anything and they will sympathize
These arms hold me tight
Old fears  helped to ease them in my mind
New tears say that they will dry in time
Why me? How'd I get this hallelujah?
Hallelujah
Laughing together like our thoughts are harmonized
Been that way since '95
Give me direction when it is hard to fight
Three roads  one light
Now and then I can lean my back to yours
Travelin' like our feet don't touch the floor
Why me? How'd I get this hallelujah?
Hallelujah  hallelujah
Why me? How'd I get this hallelujah?
I had a best friend but she has come to pass
One I wish I could see now
You always remind me that memories will last
These arms reach out
You were there to protect me like a shield
Long hair  running with me through the field
Everywhere  you've been with me all along

I'm not the girl who waits around just to be walked all over
I never tread the line  I never fell and I never lied
But I never thought that I could be the one to open my eyes
I know that
We'll be looking back one day
But I trust that I
Could never stay the same
When everything felt so wrong
It led me to where I belong
So now
I'm going home
Take me home  just take me home
Take me home
Home is a symphony and it's bittersweet when it's callin' me
Just another river deep  flowing to an ocean
I know that I may never know  the future  unpredictable
A hundred choices led me here  lessons learned with every tear
They take me home  take me home
Take me home  take me home
Hold it inside my heart
Just take me home

Take me home
Looking back on my life
The past is a mirror
I've left and come back
But what am I closer to? (I know that)
But what am I closer to? (We'll be looking back one day)
What am I closer to? (I hope that we)
What am I closer to? (Will never be the same)
I know that
We'll be looking back one day
But I trust that I (I trust that I)
I could never stay the same (I could never stay the same)

I know that I may never know  the future  unpredictable
A hundred choices led me here  lessons learned with every tear
They take me home  take me home
Take me home  take me home
I hold it inside my heart
I know there's nothing good in goodbye
But you lead me to no other line
No other line
Eyes wild
When you walked through the door
You made your way across the floor
And all the little girls had to try their turns
Try their turns
(I'm not afraid no more)
To turn you away no more
(Turn you away no more)
My honey and I
My honey and I
My honey and I
D-doing just-a fine now
Honey and I (Honey and I)

D-doing just-a fine now

I don't love you just because
Love wasn't what I thought it once was
But I thought it once was
Telling each other everything
Picking out your wedding rings
I'm not afraid no more
So why are you always trying to stay at home?
(Why are you staying there?)
This song can't be played alone
(This song can't be played alone)
It was made to be played with my
My honey and I

I've never done this before
Drove a million miles
Back when you were mine
I was too young to know
You were the one to find
But if I was to say I regret it
Would it mean a thing?
'Cause every time I think (I think) think about it
Memories take me back
To all of our wildest times
If I could change your mind
I would hit the ground running
It took time to realize
And I never saw it coming
Forgive my lying eyes
Gonna give you all or nothing
If I could change your mind
I could make you mine  make you mine

Feeling up and down
Taped up the windows at the house
But I ain't dead yet
Would you even pick me out in the crowd?
'Cause I can't recognize myself now
And I'm turning away help
Can you pull me out?
I've been down
I've been down
You say there's no stupid questions
Only stupid people
Trying to get myself through this
And I've been watching too much TV
Looking up at the ceiling
It's been making me feel creepy
I'm just trying to shake this feeling
I've been down
I've been down

The love of my life sleeping by my side

I think that we need to come together (You know I'm down)
I've been down
I've been down

Can you help me out?
Hurts to say  but I'm always awake
If you want me  I'm waiting for you
If you call me  I'll pick up
Know I shouldn't  but I can't give up
'Cause you
Kept me crying for so long  my tears have dried
So don't call me up just to tell me you don't love me anymore
Still it wrecks me 'cause
I was your lover
I was your friend
Now I'm only just someone you call
When it's late enough to forget
I was your lover
I was your friend
Now I'm only just someone you call
When it's late enough to forget
When you leave  I can't stop my heart hurting
Hurts to say I keep thinking you'll stay
If you want me  I'll be waiting for you
If you call me  I'll pick up

I've got no cover
I can't pretend
That I'm anything more to you now
Than someone who's hard to forget
And after all these tears
After all my years of trying
I don't wanna hear
That none of it meant anything
I was your lover

But you take care of me when I have to leave at dawn
I might sleep in past all my alarms
But you take care of us when I make it tough because
It takes all that I got
Not to fuck this up
So won't you let me know
If I’m not alone?
Leaning on you
Was I fearless at seventeen years old?
Or was I faking it? I was just a kid leaving home
Now I get scared for reasons I don't know
Is it just because I ain't tough enough
Being alone?
It takes all that I got
Not to fuck this up
So won’t you let me know
If I'm not alone?
And I like what we got
But I'm scared of what it's not

I gave you everything I could give
You tried to take  you tried to make it
But take all everything you can't break
If you go so easily
I will wait  I will want
Wait 'til the day you're back again
Let me out  let me in
I've given up  not given in
'Cause together we are not one  we are nothing
We're holding on and on
Together now  forever then
Go ahead  don't you let me in
But I will wait  I will want
Wait 'til the day you're back again
Let me go
You know I'm not the one for leaving
Let me go
You know I'm nothing without your love  no
I know I'm nothing without your love
So let me go (Let me go)
You know I'm not the one for leaving

Meetin' you caused a chain reaction (Chain reaction)

In loneliness my only friend
In loneliness my only fear
The night's here
And I say goodbye to love once more
No shadow darkening my door
Until your memory is gone
The night so long
And I say goodbye to love again
In loneliness my only friend
In loneliness my only fear
The night's here
And I say goodbye to love once more
No shadow darkening my door
Until your memory is gone
The night so long
With nothing to say
Goin' through the motions
It's slippin' away
We were so gallant
So unafraid
Sleeping back to back
You're turnin' away

Told me that I shouldn't fight what I felt

A fall from grace
I was in for a heavy one
When I could feel you pull away
On the way down
It all was too much to take
We're running in the same damn place
But I never stopped or gave up
I couldn't ever let you go
'Cause in the end
I know you know that it's no good
But you could never say it first
I know you're hurt
'Cause I've got something to tell you
But I don't know why
It's so hard to let you
Know that we're not seeing it eye to eye
Because I know if I tell you
That everything's alright
We could stay in this moment
And never say goodbye

Something you see wakes you up from the dream
Wanna go back to sleep but now you're up from the dream
Walk into the kitchen  pull the dishes from the sink
And you have changed in the blink of an eye
Pretty baby
Innocently
Change the channel
On the TV
Something you see wakes you up from the dream
Wanna go back to sleep but now you're up from the dream
Walk into the kitchen  pull the dishes from the sink
And you have changed in the blink of an eye
Something you see wakes you up from the dream
Wanna go back to sleep but now you're up from the dream
Walk into the kitchen  pull the dishes from the sink
And you have changed in the blink of an eye

I could always dream
Could always leave
Could always breathe
And still picture you there by my side
I could always slip out the front door
Find my way home
Only to crawl into bed next to you
At the end of the night
We were lying awake or so it seemed
Trying to figure out what was happening
Are we already up from the dream?
Or do we need to wake up again?
Something you see wakes you up from the dream
Wanna go back to sleep but now you're up from the dream
Walk into the kitchen  pull the dishes from the sink
And you have changed in the blink of an eye
Something you see wakes you up from the dream
Wanna go back to sleep but now you're up from the dream
Walk into the kitchen  pull the dishes from the sink
If you were gonna face it  you would've by now (Tell me)
When were you around? When were you a—?
I waited hours and hours  hearing loud sirens
Suffered 'til I saw it differently
You see  now I'm not coming around
Coming around  coming around
Walking away  walking away
Walking away  walking away
You don't wanna give and you don't wanna know how
If you were gonna change things  you would've by now
When were you around? When were you a—?
Try not to think about it  baby
Run it up and down the stairs
'Til there's nothing left between us
But what we won't say
Walking away  walking away
Walking away  walking away

Some things were never said
We were on one endless road
But I had a wandering heart
I said we were opposite lovers
Said it from the beginning
You kept tryin' to prove me wrong
Said you'd always see it through
And I know that I ran you down
So you ran away with your heart
But just know that I want you back
Just know that I want you back
Just know that I want you
I'll take the fall and the fault in us
I'll give you all the love I never gave before I left you
Just know that I want you back
Just know that I want you back
Just know that I want you
I'll take the fall and the fault in us
I'll give you all the love I never gave before I left you
I know it's hard to hear it
And it may never be enough
But don't take it out on me now
'Cause I blame it all on myself
And I had a fear of forgiveness
Said it from the beginning
I was too proud to say I was wrong
Said you'd always see it through
I'm ready for the both of us now

 you and I
 see an open road
 don't wait for me
We jumped  never asking why
We kissed  I fell under your spell
A love no one could deny
Don't you ever say I just walked away
I will always want you
I can't live a lie  running for my life
I will always want you
I came in like a wrecking ball
I never fell so hard in love
All I wanted was to break your walls
And all you did was wreck me
I put you high up in the sky
And now  you're never coming down
It slowly turned  you let me burn
And now  we're ashes on the ground
Don't you ever say I just walked away
I will always want you
I can't live a lie  running for my life
I will always want you

A strain on my back
But I loved to have you right there by my side
It used to be when we were alone
We shared such beautiful moments
(But lately it's been such a mess)
Go on and say it
Was my love too much for you to take?
I guess you never knew what was good for you
Say the words that you're too scared to say

I need to hear you say it

Say the words that you're too scared to say

You weren't around
Excuses were one right after the other
You woke up from another dream
Another fight you didn't mean
