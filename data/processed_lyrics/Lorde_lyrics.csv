"Can I kill it with you
Till the veins run red and blue?
We come around here all the time
Got a lot to not do
Let me kill it with you
You pick me up and take me home again
Head out the window again
We're hollow like the bottles that we drain
You drape your wrists over the steering wheel
Pulses can drive from here
We might be hollow but we're brave
(And I like you)
I love these roads where the houses don't change
(And I like you)
Where we can talk like there's something to say
(And I like you)
I'm glad that we stopped kissing the tar on the highway
(And I like you)
We move in the tree streets
I'd like it if you stayed
You might also like
Now we're wearing long sleeves
And the heating comes on
(You buy me orange juice)
We're getting good at this
Dreams of clean teeth
I can tell that you're tired
But you keep the car on
While you're waiting out front
You pick me up and take me home again
Head out the window again
We're hollow like the bottles that we drain
You drape your wrists over the steering wheel
Pulses can drive from here
We might be hollow but we're brave
(And I like you)
I love these roads where the houses don't change
(And I like you)
Where we can talk like there's something to say
(And I like you)
I'm glad that we stopped kissing the tar on the highway
(And I like you)
We move in the tree streets
I'd like it if you stayed
We're never done with killing time
Can I kill it with you
Till the veins run red and blue?
We come around here all the time
Got a lot to not do
Let me kill it with you
(And I like you)
I love these roads where the houses don't change
(And I like you)
Where we can talk like there's something to say
(And I like you)
I'm glad that we stopped kissing the tar on the highway
(And I like you)
We move in the tree streets
I'd like it if you stayed
(And I like you)
(And I like you)
And I like you
Bruising the sun
I feel grown up with you in your car
I know it's dumb
We've both got a million bad habits to kick
Not sleeping is one
I'm biting my tongue
All my fake friends and all of their noise
Complain about work
And you haven't stopped smoking all night
Maybe the Internet raised us
Or maybe people are jerks

(But not you)
All the double-edged people and schemes
You're my best friend and we're dancing in a world alone
I know we're not everlasting
We're a train wreck waiting to happen
One day the blood won't flow so gladly
All the double-edged people in schemes
You're my best friend and we're dancing in a world alone
Let 'em talk
 I lie  and I'm shy
 now I'm not alright
 take me home tonight
 you're a big star
 now I'm not alright
 you're a big star
It feels better biting down
It feels better biting down
It feels better biting down
It feels better biting down

Breathed so deep I thought I'd drown

I can't talk to you or your friends
It's not only you
My heart jumps around when I'm alluded to
This will not do
'Cause I was raised up
To be admired  to be noticed
But when you're withdrawn  it's the closest thing
To assault when all eyes are on you
This will not do
I'm faking glory
Lick my lips  toss my hair
And turn the smile on
And the story's brand new
But I can take it from here
I'll find my own bravado
It's a switch flipped
And I can tell you that
When the lights come on  I'll be ready for this
It's in your bloodstream
A collision of atoms that happens before your eyes
It's a marathon run
Or a mountain you scaled without thinking of size
I was frightened of
Every little thing that I thought was out to get me down
To trip me up and laugh at me  but
I learned not to want
The quiet of a room with no-one around to find me out
I want the applause  the approval
The things that make me go  Oh

It kissed your scalp and caressed your brain
(I remember when your head caught flame)
Explosions on TV
And all the girls with heads inside a dream
So now we live beside the pool
Where everything is good
We ride the bus with the knees pulled in
People should see how we're living
(We ride the bus with the knees pulled in)
Shut my eyes to the song that plays
(Shut my eyes to the song that plays)
The men up on the news
They try to tell us all that we will lose

Cola with the burnt-out taste
I'm the one you tell your fears to
There'll never be enough of us

But I live in a hologram with you
When Carole called my name
That's when the doors swung open
All the hotels and the jets
And I'd pay it all again to have your golden body back in my bed
But I don't miss the poison arrows aimed directly at my head
Bye to the clouds in thе skies that all hold no rain
Don't want that California love
Don't want that California love
Don't want that California lovе
Was where my world began
All that mystery and beauty gleaned from desert flowers and gifted children
But it got hard to grow up with your cool hand around my neck
My girlfriends and my baby
But every time I smell tequila
The garden grows up in my mind again

(Hmm) It's just a dream
(Hmm) It's just a dream
(Hmm) It's all just a dream
With Uma Thurman's mother
Just outside of Woodstock
Now you're watering all the flowers
You planted with your new girlfriend
Outside on the rooftop
Just another phase you're rushing on through
Fifty gleaming chances in a row
Then I watch you flick them down like dominoes
Must feel good being Mr. Start-Again
I know
Know a girl who knows a
Another girl who knows the woman that you hurt
It's strange to see you smoking marijuana
You used to do the most cocaine
Of anyone I'd ever met

There's no turning back
Even while we sleep
We will find you
Acting on your best behaviour
Turn your back on Mother Nature
Everybody wants to rule the world
It's my own desire
It's my own remorse
Help me to decide
Help me make the most of freedom
And of pleasure
Nothing ever lasts forever
Everybody wants to rule the world
There's a room where the light won't find you
Holding hands while the walls come tumbling down
So glad we've almost made it
So sad we had to fade it
Everybody wants to rule the world
Everybody wants to rule the world
All the golden ones who were lifted on a wing
We had no idea the dreams we had were far too big
Far too big
And we will walk together (We will walk)
Psychedelic garlands in our hair
Through the halls of splendor where the apple trees all grew
You'll leave us dancing on the fallen fruit
The fallen fruit
The fallen fruit (Ooh)
The fallen fruit
From the Nissan to the Phantom to the plane
We'll disappear in the cover of the rain
Took the great minds and the vapers
And a pocketful of seed
It's time for us to leave
And we will walk together (We will walk)
Psychedelic garlands in our hair
But how can I love what I know I am gonna lose?
Don't make me choose

My blood is a flood of rubies  precious stones
It keeps my veins hot  the fires find a home in me
I move through town  I'm quiet like a fight
And my necklace is of rope  I tie it and untie it
And now people talk to me  but nothing ever hits home
People talk to me  and all the voices just burn holes
I'm done with it (Ooh)
This is the start of how it all ends
They used to shout my name  now they whisper it
I'm speeding up and this is the
We're at the start  the colors disappear

Sparking up my heart
And we're slipping off the course that we prepared
(Drop-drop-drop-drop) Dropping glasses just to hear them break
You've been drinking like the world was gonna end (It didn't)
Took a shiner from the fist of your best friend (Go figure)
It's clear that someone's gotta go
And the cry goes out (Oh)
They lose their minds for us
And how it plays out (Oh)
Now we're in the ring and we're coming for blood
Glory and gore go hand in hand

No-one 'round here's good at keeping their eyes closed
The sun's starting to light up when we're walking home
Roughin' up our minds so we're ready when the killtime comes
Glory and gore go hand in hand
That's why we're making headlines
We order different drinks at the same bars
I know about what you did and I wanna scream the truth
Hope they bite you
Thought you said that you would always be in love
But you're not in love no more
Did it frighten you
How we kissed when we danced on the light up floor?

You've heard it all before
One minute  I was killing 'em all
Typical
So I took a happy face
And it's coming on like a charm
I don't wanna get lost  I wanna worship the sun
If you want  you can come
I'm in my own little golden age
But it's such a pill when they don't appreciate
So when you smoke that cigarette
Or when you talk shit 'bout an old friend
I know it's hard  but do your best
Let's hear it for the girls
Living in the modеrn world
They're banging on the door
Evеryone please make way
For the girl who looks like she flew in from outer space
Yesterday  eh
I think I'll wait it out
My little thing is keeping 'em keen
They could be drinking with you  but they'll be looking at me
This whole time  I've been playing it coy
The city's falling for me just like I'm Helen of Troy  ah

Before your mother got home?
There was a sound to our innocence
Our voices were lovers in the same bed
Now I'm not sure how they would sound  isn't that sad?
Now that the ocean's all waves and the diamonds are blood
There's a new girl on your song
I didn't know that I could be replaced
Years ago  I tried to get a message to you
But I never heard back  I never heard back
Where did we go wrong?
Our haven was always in the song
But just when I go to close the gates permanently
I realise that it isn't me
No  I don't keep a list  can't hold a grudge
Don't you think that we both might've done some growing up?
Well  I know that some shit was said and done
But it's such a different world now  I can't hate anyone
Remember when we woke at dawn
Saw the silver sun in your old Citroën?
And remember when we took them on?
Stoners on the run  How the West Was Won

Where did we go wrong?
Our haven was always in the song
But just when I go to close the gates permanently
I realise that it isn't me
No  I don't keep a list  can't hold a grudge (Hold no grudge)
Don't you think that we both might've done some growing up?
Yeah  I know that some shit was said and done (Said and done)
But it's such a different world now  I can't hate anyone
Remember when we woke at dawn
Saw the silver sun in your old Citroën?
And remember when we took them on?
Stoners on the run  How the West Was Won
Acting my age  not my horoscope
Guess that's growing up
Now I'm sending you love and wishing you well
 ooh-ooh

 showin' someone else love

Flying with nowhere to be
Don't know you super well
But I think that you might be the same as me
Behave abnormally
Let's let things come out of the woodwork
So let's let things come out of the woodwork
Dancing with our shoes off
Blowing shit up with homemade d-d-d-dynamite

You're gonna lose what you love the most
You're not alone in anything
You're not unique in dying
I feel estranged every now and then
Fall asleep reading science fiction
I wanna fly in your silver ship
Let my mama hang and my sister sit
It's on now
The days are long now
The ups and the sundowns
And a twisting mind
If I gotta go first
I'll do it on my terms
I'm tired of traitors always changing sides
They were friends of mine
Don't hang around once the promise breaks
Or you'll be there when the next one's made
Kiss the feet of a charlatan
Some imagine freedom
All the rest is predictable
Trying your hardest to melt the snow
Tie the knots to concentrate

We'll welcome the new age
Covered in warrior paint
Lights from the jungle to the sky
Looks just like a blood orange
Don't it just make you wanna cry
Precious friend of mine?
Will I know when it's finally done?
This whole life's a hallucination
You're not alone in anything
Made it to the island on the last of the outbound planes (Ah-ah)
I'm gonna live out my days
Free the keepers of the burnt-out scene another day
Lust and paranoia reign supreme
Much for me
And what ya gonna do? Whoa
All of the dreams that get harder
All of the things that I offer you  ayy
And all of the shit that we harbour
Make all of the kids in the choirs sing  Woo-hoo
And maybe all this is the party
Maybe the tears and the highs we breathe  oh no
And maybe all this is the party
Maybe we just do it violently
But you're not what you thought you were
But you're not what you thought you were
(Liability) But you're not what you thought you were
(Much for me) But you're not what you thought you were
 two
 crying in the taxi
 but she's a forest fire
 play at romance
 stroking a cheek
 You're a little much for me
 make other plans
 I'm a liability
 make you leave
 everyone
 running through the night
 You're a little much for me
 make other plans
 I'm a liability
 make you leave
 everyone
But money and time
Million dollar bills
And the tick-tick-tick-tick
There's nothing more cruel
Than only nine lives
Unlimited spines
Would do the trick-trick-trick-trick
Go drown the colours of our minds and watch the cars go
There's nothing as fun
As coming untied
And running with the kids
In the park-park-park-park
There's nothing that's hurt
Like letting you go
It's like a bird
Eyes
In the dark-dark-dark-dark
Go drown the colours of our minds and watch the cars go
It's not about just bein' out with the right people

Ladies  begin your sun salutations
Transcendental in your meditations (Love and light)
You can burn sage and I'll cleanse the crystals
We can get high  but only if the wind blows (Blows just right)

Tell me how I'm feeling

 but I kiss you like a lover
 but they're weak and short-lived
 try come out and steal our thunder
 I can feel the subtle taste
 but you never said
We could jump Bulli
When I hit that water
When it holds me
I think about my father
Doin' the same thing
When he was a boy
When he was a boy
It's a blue day
We could go fishing
You'll catch the big one
Ah
Slidin' the knife under the skin
Grateful for this offering
And all the livin' things under the sun
Under the sun

When she was a girl?
Now the cherry-black lipstick's gathering dust in a drawer
I don't need her anymore
'Cause I got this power
I just had to breathe
And tune in
I just had to breathe
And tune in
I just had to breathe
It's shimmerin' higher

Feel the party to my bones
Watch the wasters blow the speakers
Spill my guts beneath the outdoor light
It's just another graceless night
I hate the headlines and the weather
I'm nineteen and I'm on fire
But when we're dancing  I'm alright
It's just another graceless night
Are you lost enough?
Have another drink  get lost in us
This is how we get notorious  oh
'Cause I don't know
If they keep tellin' me where to go
I'll blow my brains out to the radio  oh-oh-oh (Tch-tch)

Black sand on all our beaches
Witchcraft  split lip and a bee sting

Do I look like a fool?
'Cause I must be a fool
To hold on to precious metals like I do
Do  I do
To hold on to precious metals like I do
I do  do
Give my best to the ones that are bothered
Take a flight trip to Jakarta
All the kids at the shows make it louder
All of the feelings and all of the tears are going
All of the secrets and all of the schemes that don't go my way
I wish you would come back  then you want to run back
Come back  bet you want to come back
And I'll find you

It's a funny thing  thought you’d never gain self-control
Guess it's been a while since you last said sorry
Crying in the dark at your best friends' parties
You’ve had enough  gotta turn the lights up  go home
Couldn't wait to turn fifteen
Then you blink and it's been ten years
Growing up a little at a time  then all at once
Everybody wants the best for you
But you gotta want it for yourself  my love
You can take 'em if you want 'em  these are just

When you get to my high (Midnight  lose my mind)
I tend to cancel all the plans (So sorry  I can't make it)
But when the heat comes  something takes a hold
Can I kick it? Yeah  I can
My cheeks in high colour  overripe peaches
My boy behind me  he's taking pictures
Lead the boys and girls onto the beaches
I'm kinda like a prettier Jesus
Forget all of thе tears that you've cried
It's a new state of mind

Acid green  aquamarine
The girls are dancing in the sand
And I throw my cellular device in the water

Maybе I'm just stoned at the nail salon

If being strong's your kind  then I need help here with this feather
If being afraid is a crime  we hang side by side

Pound the prairie pavement  losing proposition
Quitting school and going to work and never going fishing
Water all around  I never learned how to swim now

In the old days  there was enough
The card games and knees with the bitter salt of blood
I was in  but I want out
My mother's love is choking me
I'm sick of words that hang above my head:
What about the kid? It's time the kid got free
Be a part of the love club
Everything will glow for you
Go get punched for the love club
For the love club
I joined the club and it's all on
There are fights for being my best friend
And the girls get their claws out
There's somethin' about hanging out with the wicked kids
Take the pill  make it too real

I'd say it's the way you love to dance
Movin' the furniture when my back is turned
The flick of the lights and the world falls away
And your office job and your silver hair
But our shapes in the dark are the reason I've stayed
For all these years
And it's startin' to feel like all I know how to do is
Put on a suit and take it away
With my fistful of tunes that it's painful to play
Fingernail worlds like favourite seashells
They fill up my nights and then they float away
And a throat that fills with panic every festival day
Dutifully fallin' apart for the Princess of Norway

We've been through so many hard times
Raised in the tall grass
Teen millionaire having nightmares from the camera flash
Now I'm alone on a windswept island
Caught in the complex divorce of the seasons
Won't take the call if it's the label or the radio
Arm in a cast at the museum gala
Fork in my purse to take home to my mother
Supermodels all dancing 'round a pharaoh's tomb
You need someone to take your pain for you?
'Cause we are all broken and sad
Where arе the dreams that we had?
Can't find thе dreams that we had
I just hope the sun will show us the path
Saviour is not me
I just hope the sun will show us the path
Saviour is not me
I guess you're lucky that it's dark now
Impress the empress  take a shot now
We got the glow in our mouths
White teeth teens are out
White teeth teens are up for it
I know you love it when the hairpins start to drop
I like your reckoning
But we got our methods and there's nothing here to stop
To stop this
Give the bruises out like gifts
You'll get the picture of your dreams
We got the glow in our mouths
White teeth teens are out

And my necklace is of rope  I tie it and untie it
And now people talk to me  but nothing ever hits home
