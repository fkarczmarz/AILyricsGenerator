"Thinking what else could go wrong
Would've stayed in bed
How can the day be so long?
Never believed that things happen for a reason
But how this turned out
Do it all over again
So I'd do it all over again for you
I missed the first train
Guess that's what I waited for
Never believed that things happen for a reason
But how this turned out

Do it all over again
So I'd do it all over again
Whoever thought a day gone so wrong would turn out so lovely
I'm so glad I found you
Do it all over again
So I'd do it all over again
I'd do it all over again
Do it all over again
So I'd do it all over again for you
Whoever thought a day gone so wrong would turn out so lovely
(Hey  hey  hey)
I'm a dreamer  I'm a gypsy
I'm a river passing by
Got to run to keep up with me
I'm a sailor in the sky
And if I keep my heart open
If I wear it on my sleeve
No matter what life's throwing
Nothing's ever gonna get to me
(Hey  hey  hey)
All I need is what I've got
My soul is free and I've got more than enough
I believe in love and I'll never stop
That's why all I need is what I've got
I'm working up to something
So don't drag me down with you
We're all looking for that one thing
That's gonna pull us through
And I'll keep my heart open
Even if it starts to bleed
And all the daggers that you're throwing
They're gonna bounce right off of me
Hey  hey  hey

I'm such a disgrace
You get me out of my mood
That's something only you can do
'Cause I feel like I'm home when I'm in your arms
And that’s why I need you to...
Cheer me up
And you take my hand
Even if we're the only ones dancing
Cheer me up (Whoa)
Even if we're the only ones that's there
You've got your ways to make this girl's day
It's the magic that’s in your touch
It makes everything mean so much

Whoa whoa  whoa whoa
Yeah  something different  Tasha  Estelle
Come on  uh
UK  stand up for this
You know what  the world stand up for this
This  come on  Tash  sing it
I think I found the recipe for creativity
Put all you've got  then add some heart
They fence us in to break us down
But still  they can't shut us down
The walls are thin
But still  they're strong
We're broken  but we beat as one
From the UK to your street (London blood)
Saying nothin' ain't different under the sun
So I'm'a become somethin' like a ripple in the sea
Cause I wanna be
Where it's happening  oh
Drop me in the middle so I can make a ripple effect
Upon the ocean  I'll be the moon that turns the tide
Drop me in the middle so I can make a ripple
A domino effect  falling through the sands of time

Put me in the middle  let me start the drama
Said I'm trying to do this 'cause it affects my karma
Listen  no one expected us to do this
Well  so I know we're making best without any time to dwell
Said I'm trying to make a stand for my family name
I got my piece of gold and I had it engraved
It's more than a chain  more than hearing what they say
I'm trying to go  be global  be out in space
Try to do it at a pace  but I got a little sick of it
Robbin' me hot and lukewarm a little bit
In my two feet two-stepping in my Timbo's
Anyone in my way's getting moved out the window
I have to represent my Mama my Nanny like Laila Ali
I need your daddy every time she fight
I'm trying to live my dreams 'stead of watching them flow
You'll be just another memory
Drop me in the middle so I can make a ripple effect
Upon the ocean  I'll be the moon that turns the tide
Drop me in the middle so I can make a ripple
A domino effect  falling through the sands of time
Drop me in the middle so I can make a ripple effect
Upon the ocean  I'll be the moon that turns the tide
Drop me in the middle so I can make a ripple effect
A domino effect  falling through the sands of time
Drop me in the middle
Drop me in the middle
The life that we chase
Buried deep in mixed emotions
Love is always two steps away
But so is the pain
On this sunny afternoon
Yeah  we're walking without shoes on the sand
Hand in your hand
Makes no difference what we all say
Ooh  we can change
When everybody comes together
When everybody comes together
Yeah  we're drifting underneath the strobe light
Everything's alright
The whole world is invited
No one really wants to go home
And float on their own
Back where everything divides us
Yeah  we're walking without shoes on the sand
Hand in your hand
Makes no difference  what we all say
Ooh  we can change
When everybody comes together (Yeah)

Here's what we need to say
When everybody comes together
I almost didn't have a thought of my own
The slightest remark would make me embark on a journey of self doubt
But that was a while ago
This girl has got stronger
And if I knew then what I know now
I would've told myself Don't worry any longer
It's okay
'Cause a face without freckles is like a sky without the stars
Why waste a second not loving who you are?
They show your personality inside your heart
Reflecting who you are
I wondered if I could trade my body with somebody else in magazines
Would the whole world fall at my feet?
I felt unworthy and would blame my failures on the ugliness I could see
When the mirror looked at me (Sometimes I feel)
Sometimes I still feel like that little girl who doesn't belong in her own world
But I'm get it better by reminding myself (Yeah)

Can’t figure how I'm gonna fix tomorrow when yesterday's still a mess

Clear away the clouds inside my head
Someone just tell me that it's okay now (Oh  oh)

We normalize and empathize and hold our hands over our eyes
What are we supposed to do
When everyone's afraid of changing?
How much do we have to lose?
Isn't all that we are worth saving?
Doesn't anybody wanna hear the truth?

My skin is like a map
Of where my heart has been
And I can't hide the marks
But it's not a negative thing
So I let down my guard  drop my defenses down by my clothes
I'm learning to fall with no safety net to cushion the blow
I bruise easily  so be gentle when you handle me
There's a mark you leave
Like a love heart carved on a tree
I bruise easily
Can't scratch the surface without moving me
Underneath  I bruise easily
I bruise easily  yeah
I found your fingerprints
On a glass of wine
Do you know you're leaving them
All over this heart of mine too?

Remember how I didn't care?
Left it all on the kitchen table
For my heart to bear
We used to run along the shoreline
On the sands of Malibu
Holding hands in the shallow waters
Promises and I-love-yous
Laying on the hood of your car (Oh yeah)
Oh now
And I'm praying for an endless summer
Like a dozen bonfires
Lined up and down the road
Can't keep up with your baby
Do I need to let you go?
Something always turns ugly
Someone always gets mean
And the darkness that follows
Weighs too heavy on me

Sometimes you bring out the worst
Sometimes we get on like fire

I'd rather love just a little too much

'Til we're digging holes in the ground
'Cause if I'm lost in the desert
I know somehow you'll find me

Oh  oh
Never knew that taste of freedom
I knew that there was some more than just what I was seeing
But it was so hard to believe it
Then somehow you brought out a strength that was deep down
Let it out
Now I got my eyes open and wide
My heart burnin' like fire
Feels like I'm so alive
I'm never going back
Who I am I can't contain it
I'm not gonna hold it in
'Cause there's more of me to give
There's more of me to give
I can feel the sunlight shining through me
Theres a beautiful world under my feet

Pulls you near

Lying down  but not resting
Breathing air  suffocating
All the while  I'm debating
Life was never what I thought
Never what I wanted it to be
Had a plan  couldn't follow
Had a dream  it was hollow
Everywhere felt like nowhere
Everything was so boring
Life was never what I wanted
Never what I thought
Until you came and turned it all around
Oh  you found the peace of me
It was missing  it was broken
You put soul into it
Oh  you found the whole of me
I was empty  now I'm better
All my peace is back together
Restless ways for a living
Fitting in 'cause I was driven
Saying Yes  when I meant No
Holding on  should've let go
I was scattered all around
Left shattered on the ground
You picked me up
All I wanted was a little bit of hope
Couldn't find it
You showed me something that I never knew I owned
You put a light to it

What if I burn so bright that the fire goes out
And I can't stay lit?
What's the point in it?
I could get good at crying crocodile tears
Just to get along
I could carry on telling you what you wanna hear
'Til my voice is gone
But if I finally get to the place that I think is home
And I don't belong
It's not worth having

 you ain't taking that from me (Oh-oh-oh)
Would you spare me a minute  give me a single chance
To look in your eyes  let me hold your hand?
I want to get close enough to read you  understand you
Open up your heart  open up your mind
Nobody needs another stalker in your life
I'm only here to help you learn to love me  to know me
I need a hook so you won't be the one that got away
I need a look that stuns you  makes you wanna stay
Don't wanna speak in case it comes out wrong
Don't wanna blink  'cause in that second  you could be gone
I need a twist to help me turn  turn this story around
I need a bridge to cross this dangerous ground
Meet me in the middle like I want you to
I gotta find your heart to shoot my arrow through
Did you see me staring? Uh  you caught my eye
Don't turn around  don't walk away
The night is young  can we get together? Oh
Got so many questions  feelings I can't explain
We're worlds apart  don't even know your name
I'm longing to give you my heart
