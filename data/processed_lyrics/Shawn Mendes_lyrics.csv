"Sign the check and the place is ours
It's a little soon
But I wanna come home to you
I promise that I love you
So I'll bet it all on me and you
Let's throw away our backup plans
And people might not understand
Who cares about if they approve?
I'd face them all to be with you
All it'd take is 24 hours
Sign the check and the place is ours
It's a little soon
But I wanna come home to you
All it'd take is 24 hours
It's a little soon
But I wanna come home to you

I heard that once a wise man said
Only fools go rushing in
But I'm not the type to overthink
When something feels so right
And I promise I mean every word
I'll paint the world that you deserve
Every color you'd imagine
I can't wait for it to happen 'cause
All it'd take is 24 hours
Sign the check and the place is ours
It's a little soon
But I wanna come home to you
All it'd take is 24 hours
It's a little soon
But I wanna come home to you
I heard that once a wise man said
Only fools go rushing in
I'm not the type to overthink
All it'd take is 24 hours
Sign the check and the place is ours
It's a little soon
But I wanna come home to you
All it'd take is 24 hours
Sign the check and the place is ours
It's a little soon
I'm on a rollercoaster ride
Hoping you don't change your mind
You're my sunlight on a rainy day
Would take my heart with you if you walked away
I'm waiting for the moment that you let me down
Don't wanna skydive without my parachute
I'm scared I'm gonna wake up and you'll let me down
This feeling doesn't fade no matter how hard that I try
I always think about it at the same time every night
It's 305
I'm on a rollercoaster ride
Hoping you don't change your mind
I'm terrified
You'll turn around and say goodbye
Hoping you don't change your mind

I'm terrified
You'll turn around and say goodbye
Hoping you don't change your mind
I want to be with you
I want to fly with you
I want to be with you
It's 305
I'm on a rollercoaster ride
Hoping you don't change your mind
You'll turn around and say goodbye
Hoping you don't change your mind
But being and feeling alone was too much to face
Though everyone said that she was so strong
What they didn't know is that she could barely carry on
But she knew that she would be okay
So she didn't let it get in her way
But you gotta realize that soon the fog will clear up
And we know that sometimes it all gets a little too much
She would use no help it would be just fine
But when it got hard she would lose her focus
And she knew that she would be okay
So she didn't let it get in her way

Probably shoulda known
Now you're all alone  yeah
Turns out that no one can replace me
I'm permanent  you can't erase me
I'll help you remember me  one more kiss is all it takes
I'll leave you with the memory and the aftertaste
But I'm everywhere
I'm the smell on your sheets  you weren't ready
When you left me there
Said it would be fair  oh

'Cause you threw it all to waste

And it hurts 'cause

I'll help you remember me  one more kiss is all it takes
I'll leave you with the memory and the aftertaste
Truth is that no one can replace me
I'm permanent  you can't erase me
I'll help you remember me  one more kiss is all it takes
I'll leave you with the memory and the aftertaste
Full of words I don't know how to say
And without a little twist of fate
I swear that you've been sent to save me
You're the only one that my heart keeps coming back to
And you've seen all my darkest fears
Like you've known me for a thousand years
The boy who's really underneath
I swear that you've been sent to save me
You're the only one that my heart keeps coming back to
You're the only one that my heart keeps coming back to

Ah-ah-ah woo-ooh

And all of my friends seen her naked
Or so the story goes
Mistakes we all make them
'Cause she's got a bad reputation
But I know what they don't
They don't know what you've been through
All I need is you
She got a bad reputation
Nobody gets too close
A sight of a soul when it's breakin'
Makin' my heart grow cold
And into the deeper she's sinkin'
She's got a bad reputation

Should've told you not to go
Thought I knew just what I wanted
I didn't know myself at all
But I can tell that you're happy
It's time for me to finally meet somebody new
Take her to all the places that I took us to
And she might help me forget
But loving her is something I could never do

But I think it's time I finally found somebody new
And tell myself that she's the one to get me through
And she might help me forget but loving her is something I just couldn't do
And you're all at a bar in our hometown
Feels like we've been living different lives
The music's loud and everybody's dancing
Haven't seen your faces in a while
I should call my friends
I should call my friends and go get high
I need a vacation from my mind
I wanna go  nobody knows me better than them
Wanna feel something again
I should call my friends
I don't wanna miss another birthday
Feels like it's been forever since nineteen
I just wanna be right where you are
I miss how it was when we wishеd we were oldеr
Feeling so far when I wanna be closer

'Cause I won't be sure that I can stay
And don't waste your time trying to pull me in
'Cause I'm just a mess you don't wanna fix
Just promise me one thing that you won't forget
But for now  kiss me softly before I say
And don't be a fool
And wait on me  darling
I know that you don't wanna hear this
But I'm always on the move
And don't be a fool
And say that you love me
'Cause you'll find a man who will stand by your side
And will be there for you
And just know that I do  oh I really like you  babe
And I wanna be there for you  for the rest of your days
But I know that you'll hurt if we keep on doing this
So I'm sorry to end this now  but I know that it's for the best

Hello  hello  hello  can I hear an echo?
Purple  red  and yellow  I can't wait to get home
Head down on the pillow
Holding you is all I think about
You're asleep in London  I wish you were coming
Back home to me  darling  you're too far away
Count back from one hundred
Holding you is all I think about
Oh  baby  when I'm apart from you
I just shut my eyes  all I have to do
Is dream  dream  dream  dream
About you
Dream  dream  dream  dream
About you

Hello  hello  hello  walking through a meadow
Full of sunflowers  picking off the petals

Feeling suffocated  I just need to breathe

No blinds in the place where I live
'Cause this was only ever meant to be for one night
So close with you on my lips
I can't see one thing wrong
Between the both of us
I thought I knew it all
Found love but I was wrong
More times than enough
But since you came along
You (Yeah) are bringin' out a different kind of me
There's no safety net that's underneath
I'm free
Fallin' all in you
Fell for men who weren't how they appear (Yeah)

New York in summertime
Get close with a bottle of wine

You got me thinkin' what we could be 'cause

Can't get my mouth to say the words they wanna say to you
This is typical of love  I can't wait anymore  won't wait
I need to tell you how I feel when I see us together forever
In my dreams you're with me  we'll be everything I want us to be
And from there  who knows?
Maybe this will be the night that we kiss for the first time
Or is that just me and my imagination?
We walk  we laugh  we spend our time walking by the ocean side
Our hands are gently intertwined  a feeling I just can't describe
And all this time we spent alone thinkin' we cannot belong
To something so damn beautiful  so damn beautiful
I keep craving  craving  you don't know it but it's true
Can't get my mouth to say the words they wanna say to you

They always say your name

I'm so glad that you came
I know that we went late

Got these angels all around me

Look up at the stars  they're like pieces of art

Looking through your timeline
I got an idea

I know a girl  she's like a curse
We want each other  no one will break first
So many nights  trying to find someone new
Do I speak my truth or do I filter how I feel?
To live inside a world that isn't black and white?
I wonder what it's like to be my friends
Hope that they don't think I'll forget about them
Right before I close my eyes
The only thing that's on my mind
Been dreamin' that you feel it too
I wonder what it's like
I wonder what it's like to be loved by
I wonder why I'm so afraid
I'm conditioned to feel like it makes me less of a man
And I wonder if someday you'll be by my side
And tell me that the world will end up alright

I wonder what it's like to be loved by you
I wonder what it's like to be loved by you
I wonder what it's like to be loved by—
Right before I close my eyes
The only thing that's on my mind
Been dreamin' that you feel it too
 still not growin'  nah
 filled with devastation again
 but I keep goin'
 but I won't let it turn into  hate
 I won't let it change me
 knowin' what's outside
 I need focus
 I don't want it  no
 but I won't let it turn into hate
 I won't let it change me
 yeah
 but I won't let it turn into hate
 I won't let it change me
 but I won't let it turn into hate
 I won't let it change me
Is this gonna hurt?
But that never works
Yeah
I start to imagine a world where we don't collide
It'll be okay
We don't have to stay
I will love you either way (Ooh-ooh)
