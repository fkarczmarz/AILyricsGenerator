lyrics
" nigga
 dawg
 smoking on whatever take the pressure off
 I’m living proof
 the other PMS’ing
 top spot redeemed ho
Straight up
God!
Finally famous  nigga
Paper chasers  G.O.O.D
I'ma just keep countin'
I look up
Okay
Got my Rolex set Pacific  while I fly through the Atlantic
And just like a know-it-all  I always got the upper hand
And if I listen to you bitches I would still be on the campus
But instead I'm in The Standard  with a girl who got some standards
Gettin' head in the Jacuzzi and she claim she from Los Angeles
But she ain't come up for air one time  I swear she from Atlantis
It's so fuckin' hard to have manners since I bought a manor
I never take off  I just take off her panties
Hop on a song and kill with niggas  who just won all the trophies
Bitch I ain't playin' no more like D. Rose or Kobe  it's Kobe the beef and it's shrimp ravioli
Then I double it up like I cloned it!
My homie called me like Sean Don  look
But could you hook me up with Ariana Grande?
Seems like niggas just call me for the hook-up or to get up off the hook
I'm back in this bitch like I'm parallel parkin' (swerve swerve)
I look up to the stars and God damnit I swear I can hear them shits talkin'
To you they the stars but to me they a target
She said that I'm fine and I say that I'm gorgeous
I'm livin' so lawless  I promise
We just landed  Bora Bora
Model girls  old Kimora
Fuck more or less  it's more or more
Touch a dollar and them killas be door to door to door to door to door to door
I've been plottin' since '86  and I was born in '88
So what the fuck that make me?
A young visionary
My secretary finna be a millionare
Imma call her military
'Til I hit the cemetery
And I'm way too skinny for jail  ho
So I gotta stay rich enough just for the bail  ho
I'm collectin' this change like I live in a well
Heaven on Earth  I could get it through Hell
Bitch  we did it and did it ourselves
Like my homie Tone said  I could talk about my watch all day
But that's a fuckin' presidential debate
Man shout out to SAYITAINTTONE and Jay John
Oba and Boldy  Doughboyz and Vezzo
East Side  K-Dizzle
Dusty  Ro' Spit and the rest of them niggas
'Til we come together  we all ain't gon' get it
We run the city!
You might also like
Lot of shit been on my mind lately  feel me?
My homie talked to me like Man why the hell you look the way you lookin'?
How you feel the way you feel
When you got every architect in town
Man  tryna sit and build
You got every girl that's in Detroit that's hot tryna come chill
Cause I just lost my nigga Doe B and a fuckin' Uncle Phil
Nigga  Ye layed the Blueprint
So I need hundred dollar bills  new print
Fuck your two cents  you ain't do shit
Lightin' struck like Zeus sent
Sean cold  bitch where you been?
Motherfucka  I've been great
This for the fans that say they love the album but they fuckin' love the mixtapes
For y'all  man I do whatever it takes
Don't worry
Got my Rolex set Pacific  while I fly through the Atlantic
And just like a know-it-all  I always got the upper hand
And if I listen to you bitches I would still be on the campus
But instead I'm in The Standard  with a girl who got some standards
Gettin' head in the Jacuzzi and she claim she from Los Angeles
But she ain't come up for air one time  I swear she from Atlantis
Finally famous
You little fuckin' bitch
So from here on out it's murder  nigga
Oh that's who you excited  oh that's the new nigga?
He's alright
You ain't fuckin' with me!
Waddup doe Key Wane!
As the dynasty grows  sunshine's all we know
Detroit  G.O.O.D
Waddup La Flame  the homie Travi$ Scott
Killin' y'all
My girl the baddest  my drinks the coldest
My team the realest  the trillest
Wishing I could wrap my whole life up in 24 karats of gold
Lately  I've been dreaming 'bout diamonds and pearls
Yup  diamonds and pearls
And enough money I could rule the world
If I ruled the world man  it got me thinking man if I ruled the world
If I ruled the world  if I ruled the world
I could rule the world man  if I ruled the world
If I ruled the world  I would buy it all
I'm addicted to champagne and buying the mall
I'm addicted to living life above the law
How much do it take to live above the law?
I call my homie Ralph up  cause his car stop
Told him bump a new car  come grab the car lot
That way you can have convertibles  and a hardtop
Like  open up
Where restaurants and legs stay opened up
Start a franchise so my dawg can quit wearing
A .44 up on his waist like it's his pants size
And to my OG locked up bumping Ready or Not
Who was just trying to do it big  but wasn't ready to die
Cop a first class wherever he like  with hoes already inside
Now he can rest in peace while he alive
Fuckin' right

Seems life's never at a standstill  even in a photo
Thinking about the ex-girl  I hoed though
Like would we have won it all  or would I have lost it all like Ocho
The things I think about the most are things I never know though
Like  why don't schools teach more mathematics?
Less trigonometry and more about taxes?
They at the chalkboard  teaching us ass backwards
How about preparing us for life instead of lab rat us?
With a mansion that's about five floors
No more sleeping on the couches  cause we got five more
With the fam that reminded me what I'm alive for
And at the same time remind me what I'd die for
A world where you wouldn't need sleep
That way we could catch up instead of chase dreams
And finally get the speedboat my dad always wanted
Mm  I swear I feel it coming
Wishing I could wrap my whole life up in 24 karats of gold
Lately  I've been dreaming 'bout diamonds and pearls
Yup  diamonds and pearls
And enough money I could rule the world (Cole World)
If I ruled the world man  it got me thinking man if I ruled the world
If I ruled the world  if I ruled the world
I could rule the world man  if I ruled the world (Cole World)
Is this a dream? Well that's how it feel
Sometimes I got to pinch a fat ass to see if it's real
I specifically remember  no heat in the winter
Now I supply heat for the winter
Then I skate to the beach for the winter
When it comes to chips boy  nigga get a grip
No cleats I'm a winner
Show love to the hoes and the freaks I remember
Hit the club and raise hell all week for the sinners
Meet a young Dennis  the menace to society
Check my sobriety  fuck hoes in varieties
Shame that these things is the reasons you admire me
Splurging all crazy
Switching lanes in the Range swerving all crazy (Swerve)
Wishing I could wrap my whole life up in 24 karats of gold
Lately  I've been dreaming 'bout diamonds and pearls
Yup  diamonds and pearls
And enough money I could rule the world
If I ruled the world man  it got me thinking man if I ruled the world
If I ruled the world  if I ruled the world
Keep talkin' about this shit but whatever
We can go back and forth all day

That's that don't play! Whuh! That's that new Ye
People sayin' I'm the closest thing to Mike since Janet  whuh!
That's a fresh house  is that a guest house?
Your house got another house?
Your bitch got a bitch  your spouse got another spouse
Young Walt Disney  I'ma tell you truthfully
If you leave Mickey you gon' end up with a Goofy
I imagine that's what Chris told Karrueche
Girls be actin' like it's diamonds in they coochie
I don't give a fuck  I don't give a fuck
But cops chokin' niggas out in the media
We finna have to protest and tear the city up
We 'bout to tear this whole place up  pretty much

Hoe  we done made it through hell and disaster
My crib done got bigger  my women got badder
You wonderin'  How do you get in the game?
I'm wonderin'  How do I get to the rafters?
Oh boy  I'm mad until these records gettin' shattered
She done sent so many naked pics  my phone ain't got no data
I walk off in New York like my name Derek Jeter
Headed home to the D where you know I keep a Gina (Gina!)
I'm the good with the evil  fuck you  nice to meet you
With the clique when you see us  that's my family to me
And I can't cut them off with even diabetes
Hit the beat and kerosene it  scratch that  I white sheet it
A 100 dollar fade every single time you see us
Been a king all my life so I shoulda got a Caesar
Somewhere off in Vegas rollin' dice up at the Caesar's
Got me thinkin' back bout how I used to roll to Little Caesars
Piece of pizza with Tanisha now I'm with a Boniqua
She finna blow at that
Throw her to me  I'ma throw that back
Top spot  I'm finna go at that (Straight up)

Hoe  you gotta move quick
World in my hands  I ain't gotta loose grip
I don't like loose pussy or loose lips
And I done did the impossible a few times  Tom Cruise shit
Hoe  and I ain't satisfied bein' on that top five list
I ain't satisfied until I'm on that all-time list
'Til everything I spit is all timeless
My girl on that all fine list
Fuck your nomination man  fuck the world
I'm repopulatin'  wrap my Rollie round my waist
Yeah  time's a-wastin'
Niggas want the comma-comma-combination
Got my pinky on her brain while I'm gettin' brain
Plottin' world domination  people ask me how to make it
And I  just so fucking lucky you're my girl  girl  girl
And I  I wouldn't trade it for anything
No  no  not anything and you
Yeah  I got a brand new Benz  crazy right? Brand new Benz
Got less miles on it than I do friends
Remember when we laid at you and Paige’s crib?
Was there so long  I coulda paid rent
Remember when we couldn’t get shit?
Best thing 'bout being broke is you don’t spend shit
Remember that Christmas? We had a wish list
We couldn’t afford nothin' but we still get shit
Ironically  those were the times I felt the richest
All those times that we spent by the pool girl
Was too broke to even take you to the zoo girl
Maybe it's because I had you girl
Was thinking about when we went to London and Paris
And gave each other times that we cherished
Remember when you saw the Eiffel Tower
And you got so drunk  threw up? Yup  you were so embarrassed
See those are times I can’t let go  I can’t let go
Man  I hate to see you single in the club
Looking for kisses and hugs  so you sipping on XO
'Til I snatch you up like Let’s go

Can't nobody do it like (Do it)  like (Do it)  like (Do it)  like
My bad for those long  long nights
Long nights when I left you in the sheets
Sorry for when you had to cry yourself to sleep
Tried to count on me and I made you count sheep
Sorry when you put your faith in me
I was unfaithful  disgraceful  distasteful
Yeah I know you’re not supposed to have your cake and eat it too
Crazy how these hoes always kept my plate full
But what about the emails you hacked in?
I know we hate to live in the past-tense
It’s been weird since I went out West
And did an album with No I.D. and ain’t came back since
Now we the best in the city  I rep for the city
That’s about the time that you left for the city
You and all your girls moved to NY
I shoulda known now how you watch Sex and the City
I know we ain’t close but  I gotta focus on blowing up
I know I promised that I’d be there  and really did I ever show up?
I know I wasn’t honest to ya girl
Almost broke every promise to ya girl  brought problems to your world
And you said How could you just lie to me? I thought you’d die for me?”
I was scared you’d find somebody who would treat you like you supposed to
You the type niggas get close to  get close to and then propose to
And when Thanksgiving come around
I ain't tryna bring hoes through to momma
So it’s back to the drama
“No  I don’t know that number”
“Well why the hell you text it?”
Heartbreak Hotel man  with no exit  just checked in
Young and living reckless
And I  I wouldn't trade it for the world  world  world
And I  just so fucking lucky you're my girl  girl  girl
And I  I wouldn't trade it for anything
No  no  not anything and you
Can't nobody do it like (Do it)  like (Do it)  like (Do it)  like
I can't imagine myself without you
I need a whole lot of help without you
Me and my granny both agreed
Damn you're such a G I’ll hold you down forever  B
And I  I wouldn't trade it for the world  world  world
And I  just so fucking lucky you're my girl  girl  girl
And I  I wouldn't trade it for anything
No  no  not anything and you
Why you let these hoes tear what we had right apart?
Yeah  praying to a sky all black
Looking at the stars like they finna talk back
Looking at my phone like she finna call back
But last night I feel like probably ended all that
'Cause by now  she woulda sent a text in all caps
Then another one tryna take it all back
'Cause girls only say hate you to the guys that they love
'Cause you take anything and just make it everything (God)
And I never cheated  I mean  maybe once or twice
But one time don't change everything
She ask why I don't feel the same  I'm still the same
She's still insane and now she's saying
When you said it was over  you shot right through my heart
Why you let these hoes tear what we had right apart?

Then she text me like  Why you still talk to my mama?
How the fuck you run around with condoms?
Why you make me get this tattoo? Man  fuck this tattoo
You the reason I wasn't single in college
What  all because I had you?
Nigga  I don't even have you
How I'm supposed to get past you?
Then she called the next guy  spillin' some real shit
Now they problems that he got to deal with
When you said it was over  you shot right through my heart
Why you let these hoes tear what we had right apart?
Girl  don't believe them hoes
'Cause they don't wanna see us together
And you already know you're too fly
But baby  don't get your hair caught in the propellers
I be tryna tell her these hoes is jealous
You know they never like it when you never say never
Mwah  I french kiss it like we in Paris
I be screaming out  Ain't no woman like the one I got!
But she be always worrying about the one I fucked
She said it's gonna be me  myself and I
Damn  that'd make me a one-eyed fuck
I was so mad
Damn  you used to ride a nigga like a moped
But players fuck up  my bad
And just to keep from crying  I laughed
When you said it was over  you shot right through my heart (Tunechi)
Why you let these hoes tear what we had right apart
Baby  last time calling me baby
Baby  last time calling me baby

I feel blessed
(Straight up)
For my niggas who gon' go to Hell and back for me
I'ma give 'em Heaven on Earth
Blessings on blessings on blessings
I treat the beat like it's a reverend

Blessed

Blessings on blessings for me and my niggas from the 6
Stop worrying 'bout whoever's next
I am just worried 'bout my mama worrying less
I think I'm famous enough
I don't need any more press
I guess when your stars align
You do like the solar system and plan it out
The family never going anorexic
I pay my own mortgage and electric
Never going under even with anesthetics
At the top of the rap game and progressin'
Shit feel like Shaq and Penny got back together
Since the truth keep niggas traumatized
They tryna compromise my condom size
So I Snapchat that whole shit
Even though I get slammed with lawsuits like car doors
See three P.O.'s like Star Wars
They want me by the road holding up cardboard
So I go extra hard on the hard floor
Just did a couple laps in my home pool
 I'm gon' shoot you
 but tonight I bounce back
 it bounce back
 but tonight I bounce back
 every week I bounce back
 then you know how to bounce back
 owe nobody
 I got no hobbies

 I woke up in beast mode
 that's beauty and the beast though
 these niggas sleep though

 I don’t act but I'll act up
 I'ma need like 10 feet

 I’m takin' back control
 I call shots while you call off
 but tonight I bounce back

 and I live for a livin'
 bitch
 but you gon' get this rain like it's May weather
 'Ye weather

 so I can kick it with my granddad  take him for a ride
 let him tour inside
 I always feel behind in my mind
 I can't motherfuckin' stop movin'
 you won't stop losin'
 spray your dome
 I know that shit ain't fair
 we ain't even got a mayor
 I write mine in stone
 tryna be better than everybody that's better than everybody
 everybody  Detroit vers' everybody
 feel it  it's metabolic
 and not because I'm namedroppin'  Hall of Fame droppin'
 every dollar
 I'm just the new version of old me
 won't look back at my old seats
 thinkin' maybe when you get old you realize
 motherfucker  I sell it!
 everything I rap is a quarter piece to your melon
 just relax and pop in my disc
 then give you this
 ring the alarm  like Vietnam on this shit
 make Farrakhan think that Saddam in this bitch
 I line them up
 I'm a Muslim on pork
 I'm the King of New York
 I juggle 'em both

 I'm unsociable  fuck y'all clubs!
 my big homie Kurupt
 blessings to Paul McCartney
 I'm either that or a Marley
 motherfucker  I sell it!

 I’ve been jumped before you put a gun on me
 I put one on yours  I'm Sean Connery
 better run for Pete's sake
 Jigga  and Nas
 André 3000  the rest of y'all
 don't get involved
 this red Corvette's anonymous
 and them niggas should know what time it is
 Big K.R.I.T.  Wale
 but I'm tryna murder you niggas
 he drunk as fuck  tryna land
 someone heard the stewardess said
 then reigned on the hook
 mother of many soldiers
 so our cup runneth over
 but tether your Chevy Nova
 so you could get it from Hova
 ‘cause I came from a rock
 then put my name on the plot
 right  to baskin' in the limelight

If I ain't going to get it that day is going to waste
I'm tryna move in my safe like the safe was a safehouse
I ain't going out to eat but these hoes stay on the stakeout
And you know it's official when I go bringing that BAPE out
I'm thumbing through the magazines like This the girl Imma take out
Imagine stuck in the D and you tryna find a way-way out
And yeah  your music been bumping and you just waiting to break out
And I've been waiting all god damn year  oh yeah
I can tell that it's near but near ain't here
Man  them bills is here right now
I guess you shine brightest when the lights down like now
I guess it took ten years for me to be an overnight success
What you know 'bout living check to check to living check to check to check to check?
First place  no neck and neck
Two girls is breast to breast to breast to breast
Blowing smoke but I'm a breath of fresh air
Yes  and I'm doing extra numbers like I'm Chinese
Taking double shots like Siamese
I'm from where crime breeds  her titties out like Sign these
I knew I lived this life back when I was young and used to climb trees
I should've known back then I wasn't gon' stop
Cause even then I was infatuated with just sitting at the top

It wasn't even no real issues there to begin with
Lack of communication and wrong information
Should be a billionaire based on the time off I'm not takin'
Probably why this shit with me get crazy and we lost a baby
And everybody around me think I'm the one
You don't how deep your roots is or what your ancestors had done
Who knew they history so they knew where to take it farther
And all the ones that stuck with me like good barbers
So I can't give you everything that you want from me for free though
Bro hit me up for cash like we didn't have the same chances
But not how to cope with anxiety
Or how I could feel like I'm by myself on an island
With depression on all sides of me (Damn)
With a Glock seventeen right on the side of me (Hol' up)
Until life showed me all these different sides of me
Too many times I thought the reaper was outside for me (Ooh)
And how the fuck it's people that never met me that hate me?
I wonder if they understand that I meditate daily
And feel like my life purpose is to give inspiration
Despite the hit songs that there's just no escapin'
That I take care of my family and beat the odds that were deadly
Gone (Gone)

I'm pretty sure you see it in my eyes
Sometimes I wonder if I already died
Man  I swear to God it get so deep though
That sometimes I  just gotta wake my ass up out my sleep though
And wonder what if all the shit I reaped then got repoed
And the girl I gave it all up for ain't love me for me though
See  I got a stack of problems that could use a fucking steamroll
Got off in the game  don't need no cheat code
As long as I know the G code
Being paranoid done turned me to a creep
You ain't got that metal on your side
Police gon' work it like Magneto if they need to  it get deep
Deep  deeper than telekinesis
Deeper than your sister dying and you're telling your nieces
But pressure make diamonds
And my name is Sean cause I shine  it's self explanatory
I architect the flow  rapping all of these stories on stories
You know the story
If my back against the ropes  then I'll finish Stone Cold it
My opponent probably praying for postponement
You fuck with the best rapper  don't even know it
I pulled the sword out of the stone  I'm King Arthur

And niggas always thinking it's a game
Til we ran them out the arcade
Stunting in my southernplayerlistic Cadillac  Andre
I talk that cash money shit
Jail time  a slap on the wrist
You can tell I'm grinding by my wrist
Anything can happen cause a broke man is an optimist
Well  tell them I'll be waiting in suspense
I got some miles on me  but it's cool cause I never give an inch
And I don't give two fucks about what your mouth say
Cause this shit is deeper than rap  I cannot say
That shit enough times like somebody rewind me
Like shit is deeper than rap  I cannot say that shit enough times
I feel like Sean  don't get enough shine
Is it because he ain't got the tattoos? He ain't throwing up signs
Well  let me throw up mine
And also let me show this vision of mine
Fuck the finish line  just finish your lines
And if getting your point across crosses the line
Some of the time then cross it with pride
And it ain't about if they remember you  they remember rap
So just spit it back and hope somebody diggin' that
Cause this shit is deep  deep
Deep as empty pockets  nigga
We come empty pockets before we have empty pockets  slime
That shit get deep
Would I hit the ground or will I learn how to fly?
I'm pretty sure you see it in my eyes
Sometimes I wonder if I already died

Now I be fuckin' with these bitches like they hypo-allergenic
Some girls are the Lebron James of playing mind games
And switch their home team up every single time their mind change
And pray I don't see the end of my paper like P.S nigga
But damn in high school you had the fattest ass
Swear I was just up on your Instagram a day or two ago
Reminiscing on the one time we smashed in the back of the whip
And you gave me that head
I swear to God that was the best night of my life
Dancing with your titties out
I know at first it was a little bit embarrassing yeah
But 5 minutes later you on my lap
And we just kickin' it like we're the only ones here
You're telling me how you went down South for school
Down near TSU
But you know business majors
You can't even get a job when you're comin' right out of the school
In L.A where all the girls that look like you are aspiring

Then she turned around said
Seems like yesterday you freestyled in the cafeteria
Tell me how it happened? Know this ain't the place to ask
Seeing the houses on the hills like I'm deserving this shit
Oh boy I'm worth it yeah it's time to put the work in this shit
Oh that was back before I had the G.O.O.D. imprint
Few years later yeah we on and poppin'

If you're not down then what's your location
I called and checked in every night and that was not probation
They gave they two cents and we ain't ask for no donation
Man you on some other other shit
Just found out about my other other bitch
Went from I love you to you don't know who you fucking with
Fresh off a vaca' and already need another trip
She said I had enough tries
What's the perfect girl if it's not the perfect time
If you wanna leave fine
Just don't tell me you love me
You're gonna make it too hard for me
I wish you were ugly
It wouldn't be so hard to leave
Cause baby I hate to love you

Feeling like we ended too soon
Used to stay home and do it in all the rooms
Had you hitting high notes and you ain't even need no autotune
Nights I was Patron'd up
Girls dressed alike looking like they cloned up
Same nights I wouldn't pick my phone up
And you was thinking damn boy grow up
And I could still hear her leaving
Crazy when a heart breaks it never breaks even
I even found another girl that's perfect
And I'm the only reason we're not working
Cause what's the perfect girl if it's not the perfect time
And if you wanna stay fine
Just don't tell me you love me
You're gonna make it too hard for me
I wish you were ugly
It wouldn't be so hard to leave

Came up off a fifty slab  now my bag big as yappers
Workers beggin' me for time off  askin' me for raises
Took me six hours to count it  bubble wrap it up  and tape it
All my bitches want allowance  plug askin' me for favors
I been out of town so long  had to get reacquainted
With the neighbors on the block  all this cash we been rakin'
Way before the rap when I was writin' verses
We was beatin' up the Ike like I was Tina Turner
We was loadin' up the Glock and fillin' up the hearses
Now I'm preachin' like it's Sunday  tryna teach the sermon

Godbody my physique and my profile

Checked it off  it's old now
And that shit give me chills  fuck I gotta take yours?
I'm the originator  make it  then I make more
Written in stone  you can't forge
You ain't on my level even if we in the same buildin' on the same floor
Old boy black out
Dough boy cash out  payroll  contract maxed out
Cash kid  cash cow
Tapped in  I can't tap out
Bitch  keep thinkin' I'm sleepin' in
Tony on the monitor  I see your ass creepin' in
Fuck a cease and desist  they shootin' up seats and exits
Throwin' plays to my bros  I'm leadin' the league in assists
Hopscotch  blacktop  I ain't been skippin' a step since
Dodged so many rainy days  it changed my complexion
Hang up on your ass and say I lost the connection
I turned out to be the man that I manifested
(Let's go then)
Hmm  fuck the bullshit
I ain't here to make no friends  can't get bool with me
Since an adolescent  I was ignorant  up in school trippin'
Pistol at my desk  I was sittin' up in school with it
Put your bitch hand in my corner pocket  play pool with it
She gon' eat the dick  both balls licked  and do it to me
Ain't go to college  I ain't want no pussy nigga roomin' with me
Still could've went to college  Sada ain't no fool  nigga
Every clip we got extended  yellow Perkies look like minions
Put Church's Chicken on your niggas  scrape them boys for half a biscuit
Hit a nigga in his shit with this fifty or thirty  duh
(Let's go  Royce)
Name a nigga out of the D as solid as me
I unlocked a lot of dollars  nigga  knowledge is key
I did it all without a college degree
I went from hottest signed artists  don dada  to G
Standin' on the corner three days
Phone is on Motorola prepaid
Diadora or gold Ellesses
These are ordered from the older East Bays
She either rollin' with the owners or the lessees
A kind man knows a blind man holds grudges
A wise man knows a wise man knows nothin'
I thought I told you motherfuckers I ain't need a budget
I ride with them guys that society begrudges
We been thuggin' worldwide  got arenas buzzin'
We survived gettin' fronted by Ilena cousin
Before you could sell that Cole and Adele
Or go NFL  be Kobe or Kells
The plight of the rich is to throw you in jail
The fight has been fixed since the openin' bell
And you know who postin' your bail? Who promotin' your L?
Who be hopin' you fail? Nigga  Oprah and Gayle
Ignore the hate  show the world that we love the opps
Call Lyor great while they make rape Russell docs
Nah

(Hit-Boy)
Yeah
(G. Ry got me)
Bitch  you have never said a clever line ever
You murdering in the booth is the furthest thing from the truth
Rest assured  I'ma treat this roof like I'm peelin' off (What?)
The plastic on a pill bottle  I'm tearin' the ceilin' off  yeah
Ripping rappers like they were wrapped in Saran  bitch
And I'm strapped up with ammunition
And single-handedly takin' over the game like I had an actual hand missing
But I only need one to clap
Animal ambition
The only butt-fuckin' way that you're strapped is for cash
Wish you could slap in the damn clip in that motherfuckin' imaginary little handgun you're brandishin'
Bitch  if you pull up with the stick
It's a car with a manual transmission
The chances are low to none that I will overcome my bipolar one
Voodoo dolls  I'm just pokin' fun  pins to me are like loaded guns
When I'm holdin' one  if I'm just fiddlin' with it
This motherfucker discharges like me checkin' myself out of the fucking mental hospital
And I get off like an acquittal  I spit it  you critique it
It feels like I'm bein' belittled by midgets
It's like holding a nuke or a damn bazooka
And walkin' right up in the middle of a little kids' fuckin' pillow fight with it
You want smoke? I'm like hookah
Man  I remember back when I used to get jumped for my fucking Pumas
Run home and go fuck my room up
These streets will try to vacuum you up
That's why the avenue where I grew up was 8 Mile and Hoover (What?)
'Cause it sucked like a Roomba
But even if I would've went the indie route
I don't have any doubt
I would still get blown like it's windy out
Shoot 'til the clip is emptied out
This is the beginning of the ending  but I'll put another clip in and spit these rounds
If I dig deep down when I'm in my bag like Fendi
Who am I offending now?
Got so many fucking detractors  feels like I'm gettin' plowed
Had to put my money on a diet  I got too many pounds
You would think I'm turnin' pages the way that I'm flippin' paper
Middle fingers  them bitches get to wavin' like friendly neighbors
I'm talkin' loot like I'm rioting
Dick is so big  I can't fit the entire thing through a tire swing
I don't think it'd be logic for me to say that I'm retirin'
But I should say bye-bye  earthlings
'Cause I'm back on Uranus fuckin' up this Grindin' beat  yeah
I took the pain and learned how to put that shit into a song
You listen for flaws and strip it and try to pick it apart
So when I'm rippin'  it's hard to tell whether if it is really because
Of how offensive I am  or just what a bitch that you are
Like I never had to get my clothes at fucking St. Vincent de Paul
Like I don't make sure every sentence and bar with a pencil is sharp  and I'm quick on the draw
You need to walk the Yellow Brick Road and find the chick with the dog
'Cause y'all are missing a heart
Plus your bitch is giving out brain like the Wizard of Oz
This shit is like sitting in the principal's office getting scolded for skipping
Y'all got detention tomorrow
I'm severe like Benzo withdrawal
Bitch  your skin's gonna crawl
I'm invincible  I've been through it all
Like I never thought about just ending it 'til I got pissed off and put a fist through the wall
My back was against
Now I rap like I'm possessed  that's nine-tenths of the law
Oh
Boi  boi
I've been workin' all god damn year  I just got my check
I'm 'bout to spend it all on me  I'm worth it  yeah

Told myself that man if I can't live like this  I'd rather die
I give it up to God  and he always replies:
Control yo' hoes  you let her talk 'til you crazy
You got baby mama drama  you ain't even got you no baby!

Far as I came  guess when you're running the game they want you to sprain
Takin' shots  swear it's like my stomachs made of Teflon
They like  Boy  won't you get your rest on?
Bitch  cause I'm up for every hour I was slept on
And last night I dreamed about two girls  bisexual
They was tryin' things  trisexual
Then I woke up in a city where the population match the death toll
Drew my blueprint  got it illustrated  F.F. affiliated
Millions chasin' go to sleep wake up continuated
Life of a Don  Chandon sippin'  never had a palm readin'
Always had my palms itchin' time to get it

Even when I got it  watch me get it like I don't

I'm hangin' halfway off the balcony
Overthinkin' 'cause my job is way more than a salary
Everything around me gold like I just practiced alchemy
I realized when it comes to girls
That chemistry means way more than anatomy
I'm the livin' proof
That you don't need a master's just to be a masterpiece
People passin' faster than I'm passin' weed
And be the man you have to be
Brrrt! Paper on my phone line
So I'ma call my favorite girl and she gon' bring that ass for me
So you ain't gotta hit the front desk and go ask for me
Don't ask for me

G.O.O.D
Reminiscing on the rappers I would look up to
The ones who want my feature price and the hookup too
The girls I fantasized about tryna hookup too
Don't invite 'em to my shows but always still manage to show up
And I step inside the booth and change the world like I be votin'
Collecting everything overdue for all the work that I overdid
Tryna make it to the top so I can let my dogs know it exist
And show 'em that it's more to the world than tryna make a living
Like changing it then looking back and saying that we did it
Wishing Lamborghinis made a five do'
Straight out the metropolitan
And it's a few bad Lois Lanes I can't name
And life ain't what it seem no mo'
A million dollars never seemed so broke
And every bitch I'm fucking praying they the one I settle with
And niggas suin' me and they just banking on the settlement

On vacation  yeah

Blame it on the alcohol or blame it on sativa
The harder your heart keep beating

Plus the tan look like you flew in from Mexico
You need to be taken care of and pampered
But just like a pamper  he on that childish shit

Spent my whole life tryna find the light that's at the end of the tunnel
I should have realized it was inside
So lately I been trying to get what's inside outside
So many people wanna see my insides outside
I'm from that city four hours east of Southside
Where everyone outside  but don't fuck with no outsiders
Going up  with the ones I hold it down with
Whole city got my back on some photobomb shit
Whole city blowing up on some old Saddam shit
Before this  I was the one hoes tried to go to prom with
Now we gotta take the train  hood niggas takin' chains
Slavemaster take our names  5-0 take the shot
And young souls take the blame  man but they can't take away
The light
No matter how much they gon' shade you
No  man they can't fuck with the light
They can't stop the shine
They can't fuck with the light
Hell nah  the boy's that bright

Ayy  at least when I hit the doctor I'm carefree with no plan b's
You probably never got tested and have that type of clarity
I'd rather live my life with that lifetime guarantee
But I'm down to hear the stories about what your hoes do
It’s probably more entertaining than me talking about my wife down in Whole Foods
Or how when I'm with her I feel whole too
Go on  keep living that life you niggas know you too old to
Fuck it  I started laughing and pretend like I ain't listen
Even though he on target with everything I've been missing

But a millionaire under 30 so He must be hearin' shit
Don  don  don life  I do this for the crib  the D to Flint
Kids who get sick with lead  others get hit with the lead
From where they need a handout  but they tell you put hands up
Only deals I had was from the Sam's Club
Now it's blue blood in my veins  though you know what I came for
Born in a world goin' where they told me I can't go
In my lane though  I'm in the same boat as Usain Bolt
Get ahead by any means so the head's what I aim for
When my grandma died I realized I got an angel
Show me everything's a blessing dependin' on the angles
Look  I am the anomaly  never needed favors or apologies

No taste buds  ho  later!
Fuck you lookin' at  hater?
I saw them eyes like an ass raper
Try to copy my swag like a cheating classmate
I'll be the last face you see 'fore you pass
When you get your fuckin' ass graded like a math paper
So ahead of my time  late means I'm early
My age is reversing  I'm basically thirty
Amazingly sturdy  zany and wordy
Brainy and nerdy  blatantly dirty
Insanely perverted  rapey and scurvy
They blame me for murdering Jamie Lee Curtis
Said I put her face in the furnace  beat her with a space heater
A piece of furniture  egg beater  thermos
It may be disturbing  what I'm saying's cringeworthy
But I'm urinating on Fergie  call Shady number 81
Surely I'm turning into the Aaron Hernandez of rap
State of emergency  the planet's having panic attacks
Brady's returning  matter of fact I may be deserving
Of a pat on the back like a Patriots jersey
Inexplicable stomach growl from the pit of it
Like a fuckin' Terrier hid in it
Despicable  dumb it down  ridiculous
Tongue is foul  shoot off at the fuckin' mouth
Like a missile  a thunder cloud
Hundred pound pistol  pull the trigger  this gun will sound
And you'll get a round like Digital Underground
And fuck Ann Coulter with a Klan poster
With a lamp post  door handle  shutter
A damn bolt cutter  a sandal  a can opener
A candle  rubber  piano  a flannel  sucker
Some hand soap  butter  a banjo and manhole cover
Hand over the mouth and nose smother
Trample ran over the tramp with the Land Rover
The band  the Lambo  Hummer and Road Runner
Go ham donut  or go Rambo  gut her  make an example of her
That's for Sandra Bland  ho  and Philando
Hannibal on the lam  no wonder I am so stubborn
I'm anti  can't no government handle a commando
Your man don't want it
Trump's a bitch  I'll make his whole brand go under (Yeah)
And tell Dre I'm meeting him in L.A
White Bronco like Elway  speeding
I'm 'bout to run over a chick  Del Rey CD in?
Females stay beating 'em
Bet you they'll lay bleeding  and yell  wait  pleading
But screaming is pointless like feeding Michel'le helium
Leaving 'em pale-faced  medium-sized welt
Straight treating 'em like a cellmate
Seedy  I'm climbing hell's gate
Bitch  I'm like your problems: self-made
Meaning someone else's help ain't needed  'cause I'ma—
Make it  make it  make it  boy  we gotta make it
You can save your hand  I ain't gotta shake it
Everything lined up for the takin'
And what I need from 'em? No favors

Hey  I'm outside

Stopping you

Parents always tried to keep me home
I had it on my jacket way back in high school
Know I wanted to be in them night clubs and not all off in that night school
I woke up early on a Saturday
Said I'mma cash my check and hit some ass today
I didn't even have no gas but somehow God just lead me to it

Cause I had a yellow bone that could've come from out the Simpsons
Man. who claim she never did it (Yeah right)
Then I hopped up on that red eye when I finished
Getting rest that I be missing
But fuck it I'm on a mission
I know the Program Director hot
But I spit a freestyle up in there so cold
You gotta make time when it's time for karma to come back around
It's a riddle and I'm repping that Michigan
And a bunch of synonyms about how he was living and I even let him finish it
So I give him my email on the fly
And if his song's good I'll reply
Trick Trick: Hello
Trick: What!
Trick: Awwww Dang! Tight!
Both: Hahahaha
Shorty: But that nigga was cool though man
Trick: Alright!
I'm sorry
I hope you learn to make it on your own
And if you love yourself  just know you'll never be alone
I hope that you get everything you want and that you chose
I hope that it's the realest thing that you ever know
Hope you get the pretty girls that's pretty at everything
Million-dollar cribs  havin' million dollar dreams
And when you get it all  just remember one thing
Remember one thing  that one man could change the world
That one man could change the world
All I  all I wanted was a hundred million dollars and a bad chick
Imagined this so much  some nights it felt like that I had it
Back on the mattress  starin' at the ceilin' tryna connect the dots
But it's hard makin' those attachments
I'm talkin' dreamin' so hard  some nights it felt like draft day
You know? My - my stepbrother used to flip them bags
Outside the crib like it was trash day
No Kim K  but he bagged yay (Ye)
With all the drive in the world  swear you still need gas
Tell your team about it  go make million-dollar schemes about it
Success is on the way  I feel it in the distance
Used to look up at the stars
And be like  Ain't too much that's different
What you know bout' wakin' up every day like you on a mission?

My grandma told me  If you write your name in stone
You'll never get the white-out
I grinded out that black hole then performed up at the White House
I said you not the only one I know got rich wearin' masks
Where I'm from  I swear they broke
They need way more than the cast
We need more than what you have
And then we need more than that
But how am I supposed to say I'm tired
If that girl from West Virginia came up in conditions
That I couldn't survive?
Went to war  came back alive
On top of that became a female black captain
When being black  you had to extra-extra try
Way before James Brown made us proud
She bought a crib on the same street as Marvin Gaye
Right there on Outer Drive  and she taught me how to drive
Taught me how to love  taught me not to cry
When I die  I hope you teach me how to fly
All my life you've been that angel in disguise  sayin'...
I hope you learn to make it on your own
And if you love yourself  just know you'll never be alone
I hope that you get everything you want and that you chose
I hope that it's the realest thing that you ever know

That one man can change the world

Sometimes it ain't about what we did or didn't do
It's about what we getting through

Didn't learn faith in school but that's what I'm testing the most
I got a picture of us on the front lawn
Wishin' you could see the lights all dijon and parmesan
You told me I would feel it would happen before it do
And you taught me I'm a product of everything I go through
And you and Grandma went broke so we would never get bruised
You the reason that I ever touched my first Franklin
It reminded me of how we used to dress up
You taught me to remember that when I get set back
Been through the worst times to get the best back
Wishin' for a time machine to jet back

Feeling like I'm in the middle of the ocean
You either drown or canoe through it

So when it's time to travel management say I only need two
Listenin' to them when I'm the one that makes the rules
I'm just a victim of the life though that I ain't tryna lose
This the dream  I had a wake up call and missed snooze
