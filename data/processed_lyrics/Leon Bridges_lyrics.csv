lyrics
"But I got a heart that’s strong and a love that’s tall
Ain’t got no name  ain’t got no fancy education
But I can see right through  a powdered face on a painted fool
Let me slip through (Let me slip through)
Why you tryna hold me back? (I ain't)
I’m just tryna move up front
Lil more of this  lil less of that (Can you feel me?)
Let me come through (Let me come through)
I’m tired being in the back (Aight)
I’m just tryna move up front
They tell me I was born to lose
But I made a good good thing out of bad bad news
I hit ‘em with the style and grace  and watch their ankles break
I know you wish  I know you wish I would fade away
But I got more to say  Lord they pray

People moving out  people moving in
Why? Because the color of their skin
(Run  run  run)
But you sure can't hide
An eye for an eye  tooth for a tooth
Vote for me and I'll set ya free!
Rap on  brother  rap on
Well  the only person talkin' 'bout love thy brother is the preacher
And it seems nobody's interested in learning but the teacher
(But the teacher)
Segregation  determination  demonstration  integration
Aggravation  humiliation  obligation to our nation
Ball of confusion
Uh  yeah  that's what the world is today
Hey hey
The sale of pills are at an all time high
Young folks walking round with their heads in the sky
Cities ablaze in the summer time

Evolution  revolution
Gun control  sound of soul
Shootin' rockets to the moon  kids growin' up too soon
Politicians say more taxes will solve everything
(And the band played on)
Round and round and round we go
Where the world's headed  nobody knows
Oh  great googamooga  can't ya hear me talkin' to ya?
Just a ball of confusion

Fear in the air

Unemployment rising fast
The Beatles' new record's a gas

Eve of destruction
Tax deduction

Don't get your feelings broken for nothin'

Leavin' here with nothin'
I might regret that I can't be your man
Sometimes the bet isn't worth the hand

And don't nobody check on me

Killing myself  saying these words
There's a hurting deep down in my soul
But I learn not to let it show
Do I need help?
No
There's a price I'ma pay
For hiding feelings I don't say

Am I the stupid one for doing everything that I did for us?
I put a pillow under your hair
Gave you tender love and my care
I tried to swallow my pride
When you left me lonely outside
Looking like a fool what else could I do after all we’ve been through it still hurts
But I forgive you though my friends tell me not to
I forgive you even when it's so hard to
When we are good we're great
But I couldn’t keep on carrying on this way
Won't ever be the same
But I'd rather know you're better off than when you left us

In her womb to the land of the peach
Her birthing pains brought me low
But she held me high on Peachtree road
Got my mother’s eyes and my father’s nose
Also got my brother's hand-me-down clothes
We had no green but the love was strong
Left ATL for the Texas way
We drove 20 East in my daddy's '88
I learned in school I didn't measure up
I fell short of what true blackness was
Mama taught the righteous way
I set down that path but went astray
Paid for love on a crescent moon
In that Oklahoma motel room
Kyree taught me chords to strum
They got me through when I felt numb
504 black girl
504 black girl carried me
504 black girl carried me

She said nobody needs her
There is room for her
I'll be there for you
To comfort you
I'll be your world
I'll be your sunshine
And you will never fall

All you gotta do is call
She says nobody wants her
But not for long
She said nobody needs her
There is room for her
