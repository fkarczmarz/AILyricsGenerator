lyrics
" will I find another one?
 aching in my bones
 does that make me wrong?
 are you feeling strong?
 it's bloody red
 a hole in my head
 addicted to chaos
 turn bad days into good
 smashed 'cause I could
 my head would spin
 cold wind blows
 welcome the unknown
 chaos
The more of me I see reflect
The more I try to read your lips
The more the mask you're wearing rips
But when I seek out your voice
My ears are overcome with noise
You show and tell with greatest ease
Raving impossibilities
Engaged in crime I grasp my throat
Enraged my mind starts to smoke
Enforce a mental overload
And when the story takes a twist
It folds like a contortionist
Slight of hand and quick exchange
The old tricks have been rearranged
Engaged in crime I grasp my throat
Enraged my mind starts to smoke
Enforce a mental overload

The searing of the sinew
My body fights for air
The ripping of the tissue
My lungs begin to tear
Gravity's got my bones
It pulls my flesh away
The steam finally dissipates
I make out my sweaty face
Association that I choose
Game I inevitably lose
Governed by laws set up by me
Fracture its jaw to let me be
A cut-out cardboard condo maze
Filled with an insubordinate race
Irrational youths stop to stare
As music rubber hosed the air
Engaged in crime I grasp my throat
Enraged my mind starts to smoke
Enforce a mental overload
Engaged in crime I grasp my throat
Enraged my mind starts to smoke
Enforce a mental overload
 come dance with me
 spiritual rites
 the moon is full tonight
 who's watching with demon's remote
 racing in your blood
 human blood will spill
 they sing pagan tunes
 one can know
An insane place with insane moves
Battles without for battles within
Where evil lives and evil rules
Cease to speak or cease to breathe
And when you kill a man you're a murderer
Ladies and Gentlemen of the jury  have you reached a verdict?
Life?! What do you mean life?! I ain't got a life!
Start kicking ass and taking down the names

Shot in cold blood  no chance to fight
The stage is set  now pay the price
An ego boost  don't think twice
Technology  the battle's unfair
You pull the hammer without a care
Squeeze the trigger that makes you man
Pseudo-safari  the hunt is canned
The hunt is canned...
All are gone  all but one
No contest  nowhere to run
No more left  only one
This is it  this is the countdown to extinction
Tell the truth  you wouldn't dare
The skin and trophy  oh so rare
Silence speaks louder than words
Ignore the guilt  and take your turn
Liars' anagram is lairs
Man  you were never even there
Killed a few feet from the cages
Point blank  you're so courageous
So courageous...

In perpetual writhing
The primordial ooze
And the sanity they lose
Awakened in the morning
To more air pollution warnings
Still we sleepwalk off to work
While our n-n-n-nervous systems jerk
Pretending not to notice
How history had forebode us
With the greenhouse in effect
Our environment was wrecked
Now I can only laugh
As I read our epitaph
We end our lives as moles
 the place they wanted me
 execution's near
 my every breath and step along the way
 walking as danger paved the way
 let her evil wander free
 the final stop for me
 but feel not today
 it's dying and fading away
 hear the call from the grave beyond
 she doesn't care for me
 though I tore that page away
 I'll always have to stay
I'm a social disease
I've come for your wealth
Leave you on your knees
No time for feeling sorry
I got here on my own
I won't ask for mercy
I choose to walk alone
What's yours is mine
What's mine is mine too
What if I do get caught?
What if there is no judgement?
I ought to get caught
Because I'm doing something wicked
And the only consequences
Are dread and the fugitive mind

You built walls to protect you

What's yours is mine

What if I do get caught?

And the only consequences
Are dread and the fugitive mind
If you only want to live and die in fear
They tell us to believe just half of what we see
And absolutely nothing that we hear
Resist the twisted truth no matter what the cost
Supplant the rights with wrongs inside our heads
Outlawing all the questions to the answers
That no one likes when someone ends up dead

A plan of dignity and balance for all
Political breakthrough  euphoria's high
More borrowed money  more borrowed time
Backed in a corner  caught up in the race
Means to an end ended in disgrace
Perspective is lost in the spirit of the chase
Foreclosure of a dream
Those visions never seen
Until all is lost  personal holocaust
Foreclosure of a dream
Barren land that once filled a need
Are worthless now  dead without a deed
Slipping away from an iron grip

Led to stay  to die beside the thieves
Kill the king of the world to be
And now to you  this will come a putrefying pestilence
More noxious than the serpent's breath  malevolently destined
More corrupt than the malice of Choronzon

Is this a nightmare to unhallow thy name?
Smell of brimstone dancing in the flames

Just a dream? You're weeping all alone!

I tiptoe through the darkness
Aware of my immediate surroundings
Up into my hideout
Hiding from everyone
Drift into a deeper state
I stalk the cobwebbed stairways
Dirt grits beneath my feet
Hypnosis guides my hand
I slip-slide through the walkways
Sit in Granny's rocking chair
Memories are whirling by (Yeah!)
Reminiscing in the attic
Lucretia waits impatiently
Cobwebs make me squint
The cobra so eloquently glints

The crystal ball is energized

A touch against the trigger  a touch inside the head
Take another drink and raise the last bets
Think about my last words  they might be what I just said
A click comes from the hammer that couldn't drive a nail
Sense the numbing cold blue or the red of Hades' grill

Between its leaves place the lash from a black cat's eye

Invaders came on phantom ships
It was the fleas onboard that bit infected
Soon the ghost ships tied up to the docks
You can't mask the fragrance of death in their beds
Feral creatures feasting on the dead
Death and sickness permeate their bones

No one cares anymore
The Messiah or mass murderer
No controlling who comes through the door
A culture made of cover-ups
Will leprosy touch their flesh?
For backroom meetings and rendezvous
The vultures have come home to nest
The clock runs out
The weakest link
A deadly strike
The threat is real
See the burnished images
Of a crest fallen agency
Violent conditioning
Caused the nature of the enemy
Your terminal lack of vision
Blinded eyes see no light
A chronic lack of perspective
Their cancer now eats us alive

It was just another fight
It was words strung into sentences
It was doomed to not be right
There is something wrong with me
There is something wrong with you
There is nothing left of us
There is one thing I can't do
Lying on your bed examining my head
This is the part of me that hates
Somewhere an electric chair awaits
This was the wrong thing to do
This was the wrong one to be doing
This was the road to destiny
This was the road to my ruin

Now there's nothing left to say
And now there's method to the madness
And now there's society to pay
Lying on your bed examining my head

In our life there's if
In our beliefs there's lie
In our business there's s-s-sin
In our bodies there's die
This was my life
This was my fate
This was my life
The one that ends it all
Not for the money
Not for the fame
Not for the power
Just no more games
But now I'm safe in the eye of a tornado
I can't replace the lies that let a thousand days go
You'll grow to loathe my name
You'll hate me just the same
You won't need your breath
And soon you'll meet your death
Not from the years
Not from the use
Not from the tears
Just self-abuse

Who's to say what's for me to say?
Who's to say what's for me to be?
Who's to say what's for me to do?
'Cause a big nothing it'll be for me
The land of opportunity
The golden chance for me
My future looks so bright
Now I think I've seen the light
Can't say what's on my mind
Can't do what I really feel
In this bed I made for me
I warn you of the fate
Proven true too late
Your tongue twists perverse
Come drink now of this curse
And now I fill your brain
I spin you round again
My poison fills your head
As I tuck you into bed
You'll feel my fingertips
You won't forget my lips
You'll feel my cold breath
As I'm taking all your money
I guess I should feel sorry
But I don't even trust me
There's bad news creeping up
And you feel a sudden chill
How do you do? My name is Trouble.
I'm coming in for the kill
In for the kill
Set the ball a-rolling
I'll be clicking off the miles
On the train of consequences
My boxcar life of style
My thinking is derailed
I'm tied up to the tracks
The train of consequences
No horse ever ran as fast
As the money that you bet
I'm blowing on my cards
And I play them to my chest
Life's fabric is corrupt
Shot through with corroded thread

Searching my head for the words that you said
Tears filled my eyes as we said our last goodbyes
This sad scene replays of you walking away
My body aches from mistakes
Betrayed by lust
We lied to each other so much
That in nothing we trust
Time and again she repeats Let's be friends.
I smile and say Yes
Another truth bends  I must confess
I try to let go  but I know we'll never end 'til we're dust
We lied to each other again (I wish I could trust)
But I wish I could trust
My body aches from mistakes
Betrayed by lust
We lied to each other so much
That in nothing we trust
Betrayed by lust (By lust)
We lied to each other so much (So much)
Now there's nothing we trust

Killing Is My Business and I was hung like a martyr
Then I started seeing Bad Omens in my head
But some crazy shit has happened since The Conjuring
Not even close to overdose!
Came Anarchy to Set the World Afire
Tornado nearly got me by the Skin o' My Teeth
May the past Rust in Peace in Hangar 18
And Countdown to Extinction just be a bad dream

I'll wake up dead

And the new slavery is to keep the people
How can there be any logic in biological war?
There was a king (An evil king)
Who dreamt the wickedest of dreams
An ancient mystery
No prophet could interpret
Of seven years of famine
The wolf is at my door
As predicted years ago
The word predicts the future and tells the truth about the past
Of how the world leaders will hail the new Pharaoh
The eighth false king to the throne
Washington is next
Promote sex and war and violence in the kindergartens
Blame the parents and teachers
Keep the public undisciplined 'til nothing left is sacred
And the have-not's get hooked
And have to go to the have's just to cop a fix

 I can't help but think
 and the truth beat out my brains
 don't need no more anything
 I can't help but think
I realized life was a game
The more seriously I took things
The harder the rules became
I had no idea what it'd cost
My life passed before my eyes
I found out how little I accomplished
I'd love to stay with you all
Smile when you think of me
These are the last words I'll ever speak
And they'll set me free
If my heart was still alive
I know it would surely break
And my memories left with you
There's nothing more to say
Moving on is a simple thing
What it leaves behind is hard
You know the sleeping feel no more pain
And the living all are scarred
