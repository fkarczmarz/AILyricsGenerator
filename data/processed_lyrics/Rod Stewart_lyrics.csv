"I'd find a way to believe that it's all true
Knowing that you lied straight-faced while I cried
Still I look to find a reason to believe
Someone like you makes it hard to live without somebody else
If I gave you time to change my mind
I'd find a way just to leave the past behind
Knowing that you lied straight-faced while I cried
Still I look to find a reason to believe
If I listened long enough to you
I'd find a way to believe that it's all true

Woman  it's fading away from me
'Cause your personal touch it's growin' cold
As if someone else controls your very soul
I fooled myself as long as I can
Can feel the presence of another man
It's there when you speak my name
It's just not the same
Can feel in the air
It's there everywhere
Oh  I'm losing you
I can feel it in my bones
Any day  you'll be up and gone
Woo  I'm losing you
It's all over your face
Some one's taken my place
Could it be that I'm losing you?
When I look into your eyes
A reflection of a face I see
'Cause that face doesn't belong to me  woo

The seas between us roar and swell
Since the days of auld lang syne

And never brought to mind

I knew you when you had no one to talk to
Now you're moving in high society
Don't forget I know secrets about you
I used to think you were on my side
But now I'm no longer sure
I wish I knew what I know now before
When I give my heart again
I know it's gonna last forever
No one tell me where or when
I know it's gonna last forever
Baby Jane  don't it make you feel sad
Just when I thought that we were winning
You and I were so close in every way
Don't time fly when you're loving and laughing
I've said goodbye so many times
The situation ain't all that new
Optimism's my best defense
I'll get through without you
When I give my heart again
I know it's gonna last forever
No one tell me where or when

I won't be that dumb again

Baby Jane  I've said all I want to say
Go your own way don't think twice about me
'Cause I've got ideas and plans of my own

But I know that I'll survive
I'm gonna take a good look at myself and cry

When I fall in love next time

I won't be that dumb again
Or just a contradiction
But from where I come from
All the blondes have more fun
Well just awatch them sisters on a Saturday night
Peroxide causin' all the fights
I took a rose in Texas
She gimme plenty of practice
But I couldn't touch the surface
'Cause of recent facelift
She had no idea what love's about
'Cept the one o'clock call on the casting couch
Sissy from New York
Was on the cover of New Vogue
I ain't supposed to be available
So completely untouchable
I got a limousine 'n' bodyguard and chaperone
But God knows Rodder just needs to ball
You can keep your black and your redheads
You can keep your brunettes too

You can keep your brunettes too
Don't wanna subservient woman
Gimme a blonde that's six feet two boy
And that ain't all
I hated the moonlight
Shadows of the night that poets find beguiling
Seemed flat as the moonlight
With no one to stay up for I went to sleep at ten
Life was a bitter cup for the saddest of all men
Blue moon
You saw me standing alone
Without a dream in my heart
Without a love of my own
Blue moon
You knew just what I was there for
You heard me saying a prayer for
Someone I really could care for
And then there suddenly appeared before me
The only one my arms would ever hold
And when I looked  the moon had turned to gold

Without a love of my own

Leave the whole world behind

Has punched a hole in the night time mist
I climb through the window and down to the street

The downtown trains are full
Full of all them Brooklyn girls
They try so hard to break out of their little worlds
You wave your hand and they scatter like crows
They have nothing that'll ever capture your heart
They're just thorns without the rose
Be careful of them in the dark
Oh if I was the one you chose to be your only one
Will I see you tonight on a downtown train
On a downtown train
I know your window and I know its late
I know your stairs and your doorway
I walk down your street and past your gate
I stand by the light of the four way
They all having their heart attacks
They stay at the carnival
But they'll never win you back

I wouldn't blame you if you wanted to leave
But remember one thing don't lose your head
To a woman that'll spend your bread
Paris was a place you could hide away
If you felt you didn't fit in
French police wouldn't give me no peace
They claimed I was a nasty person
Down along the Left Bank minding my own
Was knocked down by a human stampede
Got arrested for inciting a peaceful riot
When all I wanted was a cup of tea
I moved on
Of the things that keep a young man alive
At a time when I was right out of luck
Looking like a tourist attraction

On the Peking ferry I was feeling merry
Sailing on my way back here
I fell in love with a slit-eyed lady
By the light of an eastern moon
Shangai Lil never used the pill
She claimed that it just ain't natural

Wait a minute
I firmly believe that I didn't need anyone but me
I sincerely thought I was so complete
Look how wrong you can be
The women I've known I wouldn't let tie my shoe
They wouldn't give you the time of day
But the slit-eyed lady knocked me off my feet
God I was glad I found her
And if they had the words I could tell to you
To help you on the way down the road
'Cause it's all been said before
You didn't have to come here anyway
Gettin' from there to here
It's been a long time
But my time is finally near
And I can feel the change in the wind right now
Nothing's in my way
And they're not gonna hold me down no more

From our school days they have told us we must yearn for liberty
Yet all I want in this dark place is to have you here with me
Oh Grace just hold me in your arms and let this moment linger
They'll take me out at dawn and I will die
With all my love I place this wedding ring upon your finger
There won't be time to share our love for we must say goodbye
Now I know it's hard for you my love to ever understand
The love I bare for these brave men  my love for this dear land
But when Pádraic called me to his side down in the GPO

There won't be time to share our love for we must say goodbye

On this May morn as I walk out  my thoughts will be of you
And I'll write some words upon the wall so everyone will know
I loved so much that I could see his blood upon the rose
Oh  Grace just hold me in your arms and let this moment linger
They'll take me out at dawn and I will die
With all my love I'll place this wedding ring upon your finger
There won't be time to share our love for we must say goodbye
Trying to make the other side?
Ever seen a young girl growing old
Trying to make herself a bride?
So what becomes of you my love
When they have finally stripped you of
The handbags and the gladrags
That your grandad had to sweat so you could buy?

And all I thought I had to do was smile

Love is like a burning arrow
It can pierce the coldest heart

A day I'm never allowed to forget

Forever our lives entwined

You don't know how strong my weakness is
Or how much it hurts me
'Cause when you say it's over with him
I want to believe it's true
So I let you in knowing tomorow
I'm gonna wake up missing you
Wake up missing you
When the one you love is in love with someone else
Don't you know it's torture
I mean it's a living hell
No matter how I try to convince myself
This time I won't lose control
But one look in your blue eyes and suddenly
My heart can't tell you no
I don't want you to call me up no more
Saying you need me
You're crazy if you think just half your love
Could ever please me
When you look at me that way
You gotta stay away from me
Stay away from me

Yes I would (listen baby)
It was great while it lasted (ah yeah)
And together we smashed it (ah yeah)
There's just one more thing to do (ah yeah)
Now if we have to separate and find somebody new
It's hard to imagine somebody else with you
You taught me how to nasty in those naughty high heel shoes (the devil wears Prada)

Some people die and kill for passion
Nobody admits they need passion

Down in the gutter  life is slipping away
Let me still exist in another place
Running under cover of a helicopter blade
Flames are getting higher in effigy
Burning down the bridges of my memory
Love may still be alive somewhere  someway
Where they're downing only deer  a hundred steel towns away

With the words  I love you rolling off my tongue
Where the ocean meets the sky  I'll be sailing

I'd feel so happy I could cry
You are so dear to me
I just can't let you say goodbye
And I choke on my reply
I'd rather hurt you honestly
Than mislead you with a lie
And who am I to judge you
On what you say or do
I'm only just beginning
To see the real you
And sometimes when we touch
The honesty's too much
And I have to close my eyes and hide
I wanna hold you 'til I die
'Til we both break down and cry
I wanna hold you 'til the fear in me subsides
Romance and all its strategies
Leaves me battling with my pride
But for all the insecurity
Some tenderness survives
I'm just another writer
Still trapped within my truth
A hesitant prize-fighter

Georgie boy was gay I guess
Nothin' more or nothin' less
The kindest guy I ever knew
His mother's tears fell in vain
The afternoon George tried to explain
That he needed love like all the rest
How can my son not be straight
After all I've said and done for him?

Georgie went to New York town
Where he quickly settled down
And soon became the toast of the great white way
Accepted by Manhattan's elite
In all the places that were chic
No party was complete without George
Along the boulevards he'd cruise
And all the old queens blew a fuse
Everybody loved Georgie boy
Do-do-do-do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do-do-do-do

The last time I saw George alive
Was in the summer of '75
George attended the opening night
Of another Broadway hype
But split before the final curtain fell
Deciding to take a short cut home
A gentle breeze blew down Fifth Avenue
Do-do-do-do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do-do-do-do
Out of a darkened side street came
A New Jersey gang with just one aim
To roll some innocent passer-by
There ensued a fearful fight
Screams rang out in the night
Georgie's head hit a sidewalk cornerstone
He did not intend to take his life
He just pushed his luck a little too far that night
The sight of blood dispersed the gang
An ambulance screamed to a halt on Fifty-Third and Third
Do-do-do-do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do-do-do-do
Georgie's life ended there
But I ask who really cares
George once said to me and I quote
You may never get another chance
'Cause youth's a mask but it don't last
Live it long and live it fast
Georgie was a friend of mine

Left a note for her mama

There were tears in her eyes
When she kissed her little sister goodbye
They held each other tight
As they drove on through the night
They were so excited

Let's take it while we're still not afraid
Because life is so brief
And time is a thief when you're undecided
And like a fistful of sand

When you walked into the room
I said hello unnoticed
You said goodbye too soon
Breezing through the clientele
Spinning yarns that were so lyrical
I really must confess right here
The attraction was purely physical
I took all those habits of yours
That in the beginning were hard to accept
I put down to experience
The big bosomed lady with the Dutch accent
Who tried to change my point of view
But my heart cried out for you
You'll be my breath should I grow old
You're in my soul
My love for you is immeasurable
My respect for you immense
You're beauty and elegance
You're a symphony and a play
You're every love song ever written
