lyrics
"I awake as daylight breaks and wash my face
Put my bedroom back in its place
And tucked away
Write a note of a few things I want to say
And leave it on the fireplace
In my dreams
I stare out in the distance of the city scene
There's nothing said
As I make myself more comfortable with the edge
I leap into the darkest night
I never have fеlt so alive
Will you let me take control?
I wanna see the things that you see
I wanna be the human you be
I wanna know the secrets inside
I wanna know the feelings you hide
Will you give me my own soul?
Control
Tell me all the things you wanted me to be
Tell me when I'm really alive
Can you feel my love?
Is it such a sin
For me to take what's mine
Until the end of time?
We were more than friends
Before the story ends
And I will take what's mine
Create what God would never design
Our love had been so strong for far too long
I was weak with fear that somethin' would go wrong
Before the possibilities came true
I took all possibility from you
Almost laughed myself to tears (Ahahaha)
Must have stabbed her fifty fucking times
I can't believe it
Ripped her heart out right before her eyes
Eyes over easy
She was never this good in bed even when she was sleepin'

It goes on and on and on
I can keep you lookin' young and preserved forever
With a fountain to spray on your youth whenever
'Cause I really always knew that my little crime would be cold
That's why I got a heater for your thighs
And I know
I know it's not your time
But bye-bye
You had my heart
'Cause everybody's gotta die sometime
We fell apart
Now possibilities I'd never considered
Are occurring to the likes of which I'd never heard
Now an angry soul comes back from beyond the grave
To repossess a body with which I misbehave
Smiling right from ear to ear
Almost laughed herself to tears
Must have stabbed him fifty fuckin' times
I can't believe it
Ripped his heart out right before his eyes
Eyes over easy
I must venture back to apologize from somewhere far beyond the grave
I gotta make up for what I've done
'Cause I was all up in a piece of heaven
'Cause I really always knew that my little crime would be cold
That's why I got a heater for your thighs
And I know
I know it's not your time
But bye-bye
You had my heart
At least for the most part (Ah-ah-ah)
'Cause everybody's gotta die sometime
We fell apart
Let's make a new start (Ah-ah-ah)
I will suffer for so long (What will you do?)
(Not long enough)
To make it up to you
(I pray to God that you do)
I'll do whatever you want me to do
And if it's not enough (It's not enough)
(If it's not enough)
If it's not enough (Not enough)
Try again (Try again)
And again (And again)
Over and over again
Do you take this man in death for the rest of your unnatural life?
Do you take this woman in death for the rest of your unnatural life?
(I do)
I now pronounce you—
'Cause I really always knew that my little crime would be cold
That's why I got a heater for your thighs
And I know
I know it's not your time
But bye-bye
You had my heart
At least for the most part (Ah-ah-ah)
'Cause everybody's gotta die sometime
We fell apart
Let's make a new start (Ah-ah-ah)
It's drawn in the sky
Be thankful for the time
If there never was an end
Children still play in the garden
Dance as the sun slips away
We've come so far
You will always be my heart
When I'm facing it with you
Children still play in the garden
Dance as the sun slips away
Not even stars last forever

Send us home

So unlike what you've seen
'Cause we've been waitin' for you
Fallen into this place
Just givin' you a small taste
You'll be back here soon anyway
I see a distant light
Such a surreal place to see
So how did this come to be?
Arrived too early
And when I think of all the places I just don't belong
Escape from this afterlife
To move on and on
Far away from here

Place of hope and no pain
Perfect skies with no rain
'Cause we've been waiting for you
Fallen into this place
Just givin' you a small taste
You'll be back here soon anyway
This peace on Earth's not right

No pain or sign of time
(I'm much too young to fall)
I've made up my mind
Escape from this afterlife
To move on and on
Far away from here
This place full of peace and light
And I'd hoped you might
Take me back inside
When the time is right
Loved ones back home all cryin' 'cause they're already missin' me
I pray by the grace of God that there's somebody listening
Give me a chance to be that person I wanna be
Escape from this afterlife
To move on and on
Far away from here
This place full of peace and light
And I'd hoped you might
Take me back inside
 and that's the way it stays
 I may have forced the scale to tip
 I'm not insane
 it's almost easy
 it's almost easy
 but the fact remains that this is nothing new
 I'm not insane
 it's almost easy
 it's almost easy
 it's almost easy
 it's almost easy
 it kills me to say (Hurts to say)
 I've treated you so wrong
 it's almost easy
 it's almost easy
 it's almost easy
And the days have not been kind
Once a steady gaze and charming smile
And darkness seems to know just where I am
Pray the Lord I have the strength to stand
Show me where the angels die
There are words that never found my lips
There are words I'd soon forget
Thought the trick was never to look back
And somehow all the bullets bear my name

Don't be surprised when things aren't what they seem
These good ideas will tear your brain apart
A far cry from innocence
There's more than meets the eye 'round here
Look to the waters of the deep
A city of evil
There sat a seven-headed beast
Ten horns raised from his head
Symbolic woman sits on his throne
But hatred strips her and leaves her naked
The beast and the harlot
She's a dwelling place for demons
And makes us drink the poisoned wine to fornicating with our kings
Fallen now is Babylon the great
The city dressed in jewels and gold
Her plagues will come all at once
As her mourners watch her burn

Looking back on her to see there's nothing around
I don't believe in fairy tales and no one wants to go to Hell
You've made the wrong decision and it's easy to see
Now if you wanna serve above or be a king below with us
You're welcome to the city where your future is set forever
She's a dwelling place for demons
And makes us drink the poisoned wine to fornicating with our kings
Fallen now is Babylon the great

And makes us drink the poisoned wine to fornicating with our kings
Touch of the divine upon my neck
Lay me gently
And save me before I've gone too far
Let me inhale my passage to hell
While slowly exhaling the scar
You walk on water
But the water swallows you
I lay quiet
Floating in the stillness of this tomb
Headstone empty
Choking on the flowers as they bloom
And nothing of me I'vе left behind
And letting it all go to be

Everybody is smilin'

I took a walk to paint the flowers and the trees

I made a picture and I put it in the rays outside
There's no one but you two
Dressed in armor
Just the hollow shell I was before
Help me to turn my attention on me
So empty just as I was before

 too many you'll lose
 I'm feeling compromised (feeling compromised)
When the voices screaming are much too loud
Take a look in the distance
Try and see it all
Chances are that you might find
That we share a common discomfort now
I feel I'm walking a fine line
Tell me only if it's real
Still I'm on my way (On and on it goes)
Vacant hope to take
Darkness has kept the light concealed
Grim as ever
Hold onto faith as I dig another grave
Meanwhile the mice endure the wheel
Real as ever
And it seems I've been buried alive
I walked the fields through the fire
Taking steps until I found solid ground
Followed dreams reaching higher
Couldn't survive the fall
Much has changed since the last time
And I feel a little less certain now
You know I jumped at the first sign
Tell me only if it's real
Memories seem to fade (on and on it goes)
Wash my view away

Take you down now

What's it feel like?
Took the wrong route
Watch it fall apart
Now you're knockin' at the wrong gate
For you to pay the toll
A price for you alone
The only deal you'll find
I'll gladly take your soul
While it seems sick
Sober up quick
Psycho lunatic
Crushing you with hands of fate
Shame to find out when it's too late
But you're all the same
Trapped inside inferno awaits
Evil thoughts can hide
I'll help release the mind
I'll peel away the skin
Release the dark within

We shut another door
But not a last goodbye
Fate has taken once again
A fight we'll never win
And in so many lives
Sometimes we got it right
Until we meet again
Into that good night
None too far as we chase through the stars
Dancin' in the wind
As roses born again
Before the dawn of man
In castles made of sand
Writin' in the caves
As fire lights the way
Mask of royal glow
Don in pharaoh's clothes
Rings of dust and ice
Weightless in the night

I'm far from home and I'm fighting your war
(Not the way I pictured this  I wanted better things)
Some are scared others killing for fun  I shot a mother right in front of her son
(Take this from my consciousness  and please erase my dreams)
Fight for honor  fight for your life
Pray to God that our side is right
And though we won  I still may lose
Until I make it home to you
I see our mothers filled with tears
Grew up so fast where did those years go?
Memories won't let you cry
Unless I don't return tonight
So many soldiers on the other side  I take their lives so they can't take mine
(Scared to make it out alive now murder's all I know)
Nobody tells me all the reasons we're here
I have my weapons so there's nothing to fear

Grew up so fast where did those years go?
Memories won't let you cry
Unless I don't return tonight
Staring at the carnage  praying that the sun would never rise
Living another day in disguise
These feelings can't be right  lend me your courage to stand up and fight
Watching the death toll rise wondering how I'm alive
Stranger's blood on my hands  shot all I can
There are no silent nights  watching your brothers all die
To destroy all their plans with no thought of me
(No thought of me  no thought of me)
Walk the city lonely
Memories that haunt are passing by
A murderer walks your streets tonight
Forgive me for my crimes  don't forget that I was so young
It holds in place my plastic bones
Cast button eyes reflect an image
Cue the breeze
That sway the painted trees
Toy yellow birds upon the rooftops sing
In chorus with the buzzing bees
Melt in sun LED beams
While boredom tears me apart at the seams
Now I know this might sound crazy
But I've smelled the plastic daisies
And it seems we've found ourselves in hell

Ears made of wax unfit to hear

So  I robbed you blind
The voices in my head suggest a less-than-peaceful side
Of endless possibilities controlling nine-three-five
