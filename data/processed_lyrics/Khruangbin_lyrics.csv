"Level and true
I built my house on shifting sands
And from the date
A giant palm
A golden shield for every man
In time before we couldn't stand
We're the first
And my throne is your throne
And the rings on my hand
Are your gold
And my sun is your sun to the end
And my bones are your bones
From the grain to the sand
To the stone
The crushing wind
The serpent's tooth
Buried me in the shifting sands
A rotten date
Seen in the palm
A sunken tomb

And my throne is your throne
And the rings on my hand
Are your gold
And my sun is your sun to the end
And my bones are your bones
From the grain to the sand
To the stone
To the stone
To the stone
To the stone
To the stone
Happiness and cheer
Sleigh bells in the air
Beauty everywhere
Christmastime is here
Such spirit through the year
Sleigh bells in the air
Beauty everywhere
Christmastime is here
Such spirit through the year
Such spirit through the year

She died in a fight
