"Then you moved away to the capital of England
I hoped you'd stay there
Once you asked me what I'm thinking
I lay back and think of England
Do you know my real answer?
I was born to be a dancer
Request to touch your breasts and
A load of cheats and liars
Do you know what I've been thinking
I lay back and think of England
Do you know my real answer?
I was born to be a dancer
Once you asked me what I'm thinking
I lay back and think of England
Do you know my real answer?
I was born to be a dancer
Do you know what I've been thinking?
I lay back and think of England
Do you know my real answer?
I was born to be a dancer
It's been the coldest year since records began
And now the sun is coming up again in no man's land
So let's go  into tomorrow
Together fighting
We're bows and arrows!
You and me on the front line
You and me  every time
It's always you and me  we're bows and arrows
You!
Well I'm not waiting for no one  I'm waiting for you!
Well I'm not waiting for no one  I'm waiting for you!
It takes the two of us together if we'll make it through!
So let's go  into tomorrow
Together fighting
We're bows and arrows!

I didn't know where to look
So I looked at your face
But you were a boxing champ
And I was a weakling
You didn't give me a chance
You gave me a beating
And I thank you very much that you did
And as the time went by we
Stayed out of trouble
Before I could realize
My age had doubled
The man I became is a tragic bore
And he's not a boxing champ any more
If there's one thing I learned it's to run away
At least I enjoy what I do today
Pick a side
Draw a line in the sand
You're just the band
They treat us like we're extras in an epic
They treat us like we're mud on their boots
They leave us on the stretchers when the credits roll
Retreating safely to institutes
Where dinner party military forces
Toast themselves with the blood of us all
Smashing regimes between courses
We're gonna need a lot more cannons
We're gonna need a lot more cannons
If you wanna be home by Christmas
If we're gonna be home by Christmas
I know there is another way
If you wanna see their face again
I know they feel the same way over there

Followed by their personal physicians who say
You will be happy if you expect the worse
Armed with paper straws and a bible

Get in Line
Get behind the man in front

The Occupation
The Occupation
The occupation of Damnation Eternal
Decreed by Commander in Chief
Came at costs that would beggar belief
As they marched upon the inferno
And the inﬁdels dropped to their knees
Millions of civilians crammed in pavilions
Came to watch it on big screen TVs
The population of Damnation Eternal
Went from millions to thousands to one
The survivor then wrote in his journal
Why on Earth did it take them so long?
Within weeks we constructed a pipeline
Within years we'll have run the place dry
It'll just about last us our lifetime
So it's hip hip hoorays and high ﬁves
On the factory ﬂoor there's a whisper
We built cannons before it began
But the engines still pumping its piston
And the turbine still whirring its fan
The assembly line spits out the surplus
Into purpose built lead lined white vans
Rockets stockpile as ministry workers
Fill their pockets with all that they can
Secret meetings are held in the senate
What to do with this excess supply
There's a plan to abandon the planet
One V.I.P at a time
So we get up each day and have breakfast
Read the news and the weather forecast
As we sit and we open our letters
Watch your back because revenge is sweet
And you are everything I wanna be
Did you have to take Caroline?
I bet you thought that was the death of me
'Cause you are everything I wanna be
In my life
In my life
You go your way and I'll go mine
But my way's better and it took less time
People say now that you look like me
'Cause you are everything I wanna be
In my life
In my life
'Cause you are everything I wanna be
In my life
In my life
In my life
Do you wish you hadn't gotten so high?
Do you wish you hadn't come?
Oh no
Gotta go
Do you wish it wasn't half past gone?
Do you wish you didn't last that long?
Do you wish you hadn't come?
Oh no
Gotta go
Gotta run
That you've got nowhere to go?
So I'm staying beside you
Standing beside you
'Til you find a way back home
We're coming home
We're coming home
Light a fire
We're coming home
We'll write it down
We'll write it all down

I was banging on the door
She was crying in a puddle
On the laminate floor
I was screaming out let me in
You've had too much gin
You better come out or I'm kicking it in
Do something
The 24-hour garage
And it's in my hand
As a telephone it's average
But it's worth a grand
A gang of youths
Start throwing abuse
I fro-o-oze and I thought...

Do something
It would be useful if you knew
That everything you say and do
Potentially could change tomorrow
And if you're all still sleeping there
Without the power without a care
Life is just a beer garden
A sunny afternoon
There's always one drunk hardman
Singing out of tune
A plastic chair flies through the air
The lager tops go everywhere
It would be useful if you knew
That everything you say and do
Potentially could change tomorrow
And if you're all still sleeping there
Without the power without a care
Don't mention me when your alarm goes
It's clear to see that you've become obsessed
I got to get this message to the press
That everyday I love you less and less
And everyday I love you less and less
I've got to get this feeling off my chest
The doctor says all I need is pills and rest
Since everyday I love you less and less
I got to know what's not and what is real
Everyday I love you less and less
I can't believe once you and me did sex
It makes me sick to think of you undressed
Since everyday I love you less and less
And everyday I love you less and less
You're turning into something I detest
And everybody says that you're a mess
Since everyday I love you less and less

One day it's gonna fight
Sticks and stones and animal bones

On a bad day
There's good days and bad days

Breaking the barriers
Drowning the sorrows
Upset the regulars

If you had a different attitude
Instead of take and take and take
You have missed an opportunity
And that's a really big mistake
If you had a different attitude
You'd still have good days and bad days
Heads or tails  doesn't make a difference
Beneath the glamour there was always gonna be
Amateur dramatics  a lot of bad behavior
I would see glasses on the table
Wearing nothing in the lap of luxury
Sipping slowly  not a leg to stand on
Take my money
Waste of paper
Leave the table
Bad behaviour
I got my spies  swift to every consulate
To be my eyes and tell me what I never see
'Cause a ghost don't fear a lover
Nothing teeth blank  ah get ready for the credit clubber
Secret mole  getting it together
With a big fat bowl of alphabet spaghetti
Watch the birdie looking through the mirror

Running round Highroyds isn't fun
Just teenagers testing their courage
Standing outside nightclubs in the snow
Us not very cool or impressive
They let in all the girls from the year below
No need for ID's with those dresses
Got news from afar
From a girl who knows who we are
She's still got my dinner money
She can keep it
Never had a fight that we haven't lost
Not very tough or athletic
Once I had a boxing champ in a headlock
When he gets out I'll regret it
Got keys to a car
Picked up a girl from Boston Spa
For fast food and cinema
It's not worth it
Got word from down south
Well he had heard about it word of mouth
Haven't much stayed in touch
Since Highroyds

And will you write a song about me?

Could you tell me
In three words or more?
It's the only way of getting out of here

From the ones who have been there
My brain is not damaged
But in need of some repair

There's no point sitting

Why do you act surprised when you got it you show it
When you cry like that and you throw yourself down on the floor?
Oh why do you do it to me?
Why do you always try to make me feel like a nobody?
Oh why do you do it to me?
Why do you always try to make me feel like a nobody?
There's more to this than passing by
There's more to this than meets the eye
I tell you what it's going to be like
They fell apart some time ago
I'll buy some more in five years
I don't regret a single thing
I don't regret a single thing
I tell you what it's going to feel like
'Cause I'm not there to hold you too tightly
I tell you what it's going to be like
They can't know or understand
That you and me are now together
I don't regret a single thing
I don't regret a single thing
And I will give it all to you 'cause you'd never fight me for it
And know that you can have it all
La la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la
I don't regret a single thing
I don't regret a single thing
And I will give it all to you 'cause you'd never fight me for it
And I will give it all to you 'cause you'd never fight me for it
And I will give it all to you 'cause you'd never fight me for it
And know that you can have it all"
