lyrics
"I let down my guard
Swore I'd never fall in love again
But I fell hard
Guess I should have seen it comin' (Ah)
Caught me by surprise (Ah)
Wasn't lookin' where I was goin'
I fell into your eyes
You came into my crazy world
Like a cool and cleansing rain
You were flowin' through my veins
Like a powerful drug I can't get enough of
I'm addicted to you
Midnight blows in through the window (Ah)
Dances 'round the room (Ah)
Got me hypnotised
I'm gettin' high on the perfume
You might also like
I couldn't live without you now
I couldn't stand the pain
Like a powerful drug I can't get enough of
For all of these fucking situations
And I swear I never say shit
But this time I'm gonna say it
When the record's on the final song
All the pretenders and the hangers on
Can go find themselves another one
But it ain't a thing
All of these fucking altercations
But this time I really mean it
You might also like
When the record's on the final song
All the pretenders and the hangers on
Can go find themselves another one
But it ain't a thing
But it ain't a thing
Sinking away in slow motion?
Like a break in the ocean
Just getting lost out at sea
Can you see my emotion
Like a break in the ocean
Just getting lost out at sea
And now you got me praying for a better situation
Guess it's gonna follow me wherever I go
I got a bad reputation
I know that you've been talking
You never see me sleepwalking
Drifting out into nothing
Rolling away in my dreams
Can you feel that I'm falling?
Laying awake till the morning
Every word that I'm calling
Just getting lost out at sea

And now you got me praying for a better situation
Guess it's gonna follow me wherever I go
I got a bad reputation
I got a bad reputation
Know what I'm all about
I'm all about dollars and green
Don't care about nothing but me
You got me figured out
You know what I'm all about
And now you got me praying for a better situation
Guess it's gonna follow me wherever I go
I got a bad reputation
Fire shy and cold alone outside
You stripped it right down to the wire
But I see you behind those tired eyes
Now as you wade through shadows that live in your heart
You'll find the light that leads home
Cause I see you for you and your beautiful scars
And sometimes you lose and sometimes you're shooting
Broken arrows in the dark
I've seen the darkness in the light
The kind of blue that leaves you lost and blind
The only thing that's black and white
Is that you don't have to walk alone this time
We have to tear down walls that live in your heart
To find someone you call home
Now you see me for me and my beautiful scars

And sometimes you lose and sometimes you're shooting
Broken arrows in the dark
I see the hope in your heart
 oh-oh-oh
 he was gone tryna make a dime
 got the motivation

 love of creation
 just replace them
 you bet you must face them
 yeah
 yeah
 got to blend in
 love of creation
 just replace them
 you bet you must face them
 yeah
Now it's time  we never ever head down
Don't be scared  I am for real
Hide away and we will never be found
It's alright  we never look back
Birds will sing if we fall
It's alright  with memories inside
Midnight dust on the floor
Watch it turn into gold
And I don't even know what's real
And I don't know what to feel
I'm your truth in disguise  I'm in love with your lies
'Cause I can't breathe  can't settle down
And I don't know what to feel
No  I don't know what to feel
See these lights  we're getting away
Heads won't find us  we're not making a sound
We're not scared  we are for real
Love can't hurt us  now we're sheltered by lies

'Cause I can't breathe  can't settle down
And I don't know what to feel
I've known you for some time
Whole life changed while
Bones like yours and mine
Go dance in the woods and
Do you remember old times?
It's a time for everything and I call you
Sweet love of mine
Destruction ain't a crime
For those who find
Love as a game like you and I
Go dance in the waters
Of all the tears we have cried
Do you remember our time?

One too many records sold (That's why I'm)
Chillin' while I keep on building
See you fuckers down the road (Ah)

Hey  sister
Know the water's sweet  but blood is thicker

Hey  brother
Do you still believe in one another?

Starting to choke on your heart in your throat and
It feels just like you can't remember how to fight
We'll crack before we shatter
We can't fall apart (Oh  oh)
We don't get to die young
Trouble keeping our head sometimes
We just have to push on
We don't get to give up this life
All the breath in your lungs
Is stronger than the tears in your eyes
It's do or die  but we're alive
And while we're here  hold the line
Hold the line
Don't hold your hands up  it's your final stand
Put your white flag down  oh don't you surrender now

 will I go?
 I don't want to go
 I'm scared of that middle place
 left in there
 rest my head
 I don't want to go
A million rainy days
Such a shame in a way
And no one else than I
Sacrificed everything
A million broken dreams
And I know I can't stay
I did it anyway
If the sun don't rise
If the moon won't shine
If the stars fall out of the sky
Then I could be your guiding light
All through the night
All through your life
You'll be long long gone
And now the world is spinning
Like the sun
And now the table's turning
I don't mind

No  you don't ever tell the truth
Liar  liar
Can't nobody say you're fireproof
Follow you to dust
Leavin' footprints on the clouds as we're walkin' home
Iron hearts all turn to rust
By tears and the days on a diamond street
Kiss these apoca-lips
Chasin' shadows  livin' dreams that don't exist
Anymore

Well  we are who we are and we're all goin' under

We need to find a way
Well  we are who we are and we're all goin' under
Liar  liar

Liar  liar
Can't nobody say you're fireproof
I just sit there and watch them come and go
There might be somethin' underneath it all
But at least I'll find  we'll all find out in the end
I caught the edge of a knife and it hurts just a little
You're the high that I can't give up
I might hate myself tomorrow
But I'm on my way tonight
At the bottom of a bottle
You're the poison in the wine

I won't change

All my life I've been blind I've been fooled by greed
All my life I just wanted to be free
All my life I've been blind I've been fooled by greed
All my life I just wanted to be free
All my life I've been blind I've been fooled by greed
I left my home as a gift to my past
Next to the things that will never last
I looked for fire but found nothing but ash
 no ego  no pretense
 we danced and prayed for no tomorrow
 but we were right
 like breathing
 she sees me
 chasing innocence
 you showed me what it meant
 but we were right
 I'm feeling
 like breathing
 she sees me
 ooh-ooh)
 ooh-ooh)
 never leave me  never leave me)
 never leave me  never leave me)
 like breathing
 she sees me
I'd chase the dream across the blue
'Cause I am rich no matter what I lose
I'd rather risk it all and find the truth
I'm gonna change my heart
And start anew
And turn myself into someone new
If I can't be the one I choose
I'd rather leave it all
And die with you
You are moving way too fast
Way too fast for me
I'm just tryin' to catch my breath
Can I get a little peace of mind?
And a little bit of silence to unwind?
Do you need a relief? Do you need a release?
Do you wanna be free? Do you wanna be free?
Do you wanna be free? Do you wanna be–
Can I get a little peace of mind?

We've come a long way since that day
And we will never look back at the faded silhouette

Listening to Wu in my Walkman
That's me right there on the corner
For a dream that I didn't have
That I'd one day would believe in
Strange how the same place I ran from
Is the same place I think of whenever the chance comes
I hear echoes of a thousand screams
As I lay me down to sleep
There's a black hole deep inside of me
Somewhere in Stockholm
I'm from a place where we never openly show our emotions
We drown our sorrows in bottomless bottles
And leave them to float in the ocean
I'm from a place where we never
Separate people from people
Still believe that we are treated as equals
My friends and my family's there
Almost lost everything here
Right where I was founded
Is right where I'll be found dead

A promise that never was kept
One of those moments you'll never forget
I am that feeling inside
The one we all know but can't really describe
Somewhere in Stockholm
But I'm not alone
Don't have to get by on my own
I'm finally home
Hemma i Stockholm
Där jag hör hemma
I hear echoes of a thousand screams
As I lay me down to sleep
There's a black hole deep inside of me
Somewhere in Stockholm

A pound of weed and a bag of blow

Lock up my cadence and rhyme
Don't know what I'm trying to say
My heart  all the time was stolen by bad poetry
Some nights I talk to myself
I say the words that I could say to no one else
And some nights I talk in my sleep
I say the words I never said when you were with me
Some nights I talk to myself
I say the words that I could say to no one else
And some nights I talk in my sleep
I say the words I never said when you were with me
I'm gone  the nightmares cut me open
Love's insanity
So long  words are left unspoken
I couldn't set them free
Watch all the language run dry  thoughts go on holiday
My heart  I'm left with a broken vocabulary

And some nights I talk in my sleep
And I already know
I’ll be fine
Ten more days till it’s over
Till the darkness goes
And I see the light
I’m torn between fulfilling my wildest dreams
To satisfy the beast inside of me
And a grounded love that raises me high above
The grabbing hands of cowards and of thieves
Ten more days to find my way
Ten more days till I’m awake
Ten more days till I don’t have to fight
I don’t need a future king
There ain’t a prayer that I could sing
Ten more days and I’m gonna make it right
You see my conscience betrayed me
But baby I’m strong enough
To take the tides
But wherever the road is rough
You know I’ll rise

We made a promise to never get old
You had a chance and you took it on me
And I made a promise that I couldn't keep
But something flipped like a switch when you came around
(Oh whoa oh)
These are the days we've been waiting for
On days like these who could ask for more
Keep them coming 'cause we're not done yet
These are the days we won't regret
These are the days we won't forget
These are the days we've been waiting for
Rattle the cage and slam that door
And the world is calling us but not just yet
These are the days we won't regret
These are the days we won't forget
Out on the midnight the wild ones howl
The last of the lost boys have thrown in the towel
We used to believe we were stars aligned
You made a wish and I fell out of

These are the days we'll never forget
And these are the days (these are the days)
And these are the days (these are the days)
Once upon a younger year
When all our shadows disappeared
The animals inside came out to play
(Hey) Went face to face with all our fears
Learned our lessons through the tears
Made memories we knew would never fade
One day my father he told me
When you get older
Your wild heart will live for younger days
Think of me if ever you're afraid
So live a life you will remember
My father told me when I was just a child
These are the nights that never die

Oh-oh (Hey)
Oh-oh
We scream and we fight like there's nothing to lose
End of the day  come and take my all
There’s no place I'd rather be than in your arms
Weight is on you  weight is on me
Sometimes I'm not who you want me to be
God knows I try  we stumble and we fall
There’s no place I'd rather be than in your arms
Give me tough love and a lesson to learn
Your tough love is what I deserve
Sweet tough love  you're my pretty good luck charm
There's no place I'd rather be than in your arms

I've been a loner and I've worn the ring
Losing myself just to find me again
I've been a teacher and a student of hurt
I've kept my word for whatever that's worth
Oh I've seen trouble more than any man should bear
I'm a million miles ahead of where I'm from
But there's still another million miles to come
I keep on searching for the city of gold
And I'm gonna follow this yellow brick road
I'm a million miles farther and a long way from home
I know that there's a plan that goes way beyond mine
Got to step back just to see the design

Until I learned how to dance
You got me thinking
Love will come around but you
Never gave me a chance
I might not been the tallest
Until I learned how to jump
You got me thinking
Love will come around but you
Never say I'm the one
Love will come around
Maybe love will come around for us
I wasn't always the bravest
They say you only live once
So you got me thinking
I'm so glad I found ya

And every night has its day  so magical
And if there's love in this life  there's no obstacle
That can't be defeated
For every tyrant a tear for the vulnerable
In every lost soul the bones of a miracle
For every dreamer a dream we're unstoppable
With something to believe in
Monday left me broken
Tuesday I was through with hopin'
Wednesday my empty arms were open
Thursday waiting for love  waiting for love
Thank the stars it's Friday
I'm burning like a fire gone wild on Saturday
Guess I won't be coming to church on Sunday
I'll be waiting for love
Waiting for love to come around
We are one of a kind  irreplaceable
How did I get so blind and so cynical?
If there's love in this life we're unstoppable
No  we can't be defeated

Guided by a beatin' heart
I can't tell where the journey will end
But I know where to start
They tell me I'm too young to understand
They say I'm caught up in a dream
So wake me up when it's all over
When I'm wiser and I'm older
Didn't know﻿ I was lost
So wake me up when it's all over
When I'm wiser and I'm older
Didn't know﻿ I was lost
I tried carryin' the weight of the world
But I only have two hands
Hope I get the chance to travel the world
But I don't have any plans
Wish that I could stay forever this young
Not afraid to close my eyes
Life's a game﻿ made for everyone
And love is the prize

Got wasted too many days
You left on a Wednesday
You told me to go fuck yourself
I wasted too many days
And we
We burn faster than light
Shine across in the night sky
We burn faster than light

Without you I feel lost at sea
Through the darkness you'd hide with me
Like the wind we'd be wild and free
You said you'd follow me anywhere
But your eyes tell me you won't be there
I've gotta learn how to love without you
I've gotta carry my cross without you
Stuck in the middle and I'm just about to
Figure it out without you
And I'm done sitting home without you
I'm gonna tear this city down without you
I'm goin' Bonnie and Clyde without you
From myself and the truth I fear
My heart is beating I can't see clear
