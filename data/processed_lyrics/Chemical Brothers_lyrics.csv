"No way of knowing if I care or not
No way of knowing if she's right or if she's wrong
No way of knowing if I'll carry on
And I never wanted to be either of those
And I never wanted to be either of those
And she shines
Still she shines for me
She shines for me
No way of knowing if she's ever coming back
No way of knowing if I care or not
No way of knowing if she's right or if she's wrong
No way of knowing if I'll carry on
And she shines
Still she shines for me
She shines for me

Another world will surround me
Another heart will forgive
Another world will surround me
Gotta tell you something
I saw it in your eyes
I think I left your back seat
And now it's always good
I fell asleep from day
And all the promises
There's a lot of people
That let their will to change
I've got a lot of friends
And they've got beautiful eyes
That make my heart feel surprised
And you notice it
And that's the truth
(That's the truth)
(That's the truth)
Have me to you
I shine along underneath your view
I'll be the one
To let you know when you've come undone
I like the stars in the sky
And watch the moonlight go by
I've got a lot of friends
And they've got beautiful eyes
That make my heart feel surprised
And that's the truth
That's the truth
That's the truth

I'm falling fast in  in your eyes
I feel  I  I feel  that I might save you  save you
We are an unbalanced couple
I am strong and you are weak
You are quiet while I speak
And I am tired of talking to myself
I won’t back down  give me my thunder
I won't back down  give me my thunder
I won't back down  give me my thunder

Bango  bango  bango  bang  my

There's no path to follow
There's a line in the sand
Put there by a man
By a man whose children built the castles made of stone
There's a man in the sky
Giving reasons why
That line grows deeper like the shackles round our bones
Move on to my own
Here come battle scars
It's the final charge
Here come battle scars
There's a child born
To a land of scorn
Sneaks past the borders and the lords that hold his hand
He was led like a lamb
All part of the plan
This castle crumbles as he walks out of this land

There's no path to follow
There's no path to follow
There's no path to follow
Living for the reasons of the dead that moved to
Paper from their heads into my fingers
And my deadly view is strangled by the rent
I have no purpose in this land have I forgotten how to stand up
With the humor and the need I've got to find a way to be
I just turn up the stereo I can't survive without the cold
This culture's fallen off its feet I've got to find a brand new beat
There's a road ahead
Between the live and dead
Church bells are ringing like the panic in my head
Walk into the setting sun
History catching up at last
No one to follow but old man time
I need you to believe in something
I needed to believe something

With initiative to move  so why make it harder?
Don't hold back  if you think about it
Don't hold back  and you shouldn't even care
'Bout those noses in the air and their crooked stares
Don't hold back  'cause there's a party over here
So you might as well be here where the people care
Don't hold back  world (You're holding back)

Don't hold back  if you think about it too much
Don't hold back  you think it's time you get up
Crunch time like a sit-up  c'mon keep pace
Don't hold back  put apprehension on the back burner
Let it sit  don't even get it lit
Don't hold back  get involved with the jam
Don't be a prick  hot chick be a pig

Hey
Wait
Hold up
Electrify
Let the fire elect the high
Connect the sky
To the sense they blade keeps spinning
All around the world
And the world keeps sinning
I been in a crazy situation
Since I learned the art of watching patients
Big shouts to the hip-hop nation
Just dance for elation
Yeah

Yo
Put the needle on the record
Here we go again
It's the brand new funk for real
Mass appeal is everlasting
I've seen you forecasting direction
Insurrection is served on a 12 inch plater
Mostly correct data over matter
Is a mind that you'll find
Whos design is international
Rational
Back in the days we were trying to rap
No gats in the backpack
Yo caught many styles but the free one
Instead of writing a rhyme I'd rather be one
Two yo kiddy watch what you do
I live in the (?) but believe they hold the fuse
Now you got to get inside to get it off
What you really lost

Everything gettin' harder to find
Everybody jumpin' out of they mind
Everybody goin' out of they skins
See we get to the end but that's where we begin
You feel it
Mannequins say We breakin' the mold
Breakin' out and we breakin' the codes
Similar to the Jacques Cousteau
To the depths and you're wet
So your tank explodes  so get it out
Send your body to flight
Everybody got a target tonight
Everybody come along for the ride
All you studs and you duds and you ladies  let's fly
Grip the moment like you grippin' the earth
Feel the weight and you feelin' the girth
Now you get it  now you feelin' your worth
Feel the sound you used to make when everything used to hurt
It goes
Go  no time to rest
Just do your best
Go  what you hear is not a test
We're only here to make you

Five seconds 'fore you're saying my name

Gonna hit you and this whole execution is aim
Get together and we building a fire
Clear smoke and it's taking us higher
Hands up  everyone is one
If you see yourself making it
You're seeing the sun
Metropolis on the edge of control
They take our money  but they won't take our soul
Fuck that  ain't gon' do it no mo'
Won't do what we told and we ain't gonna fold

He laid on his back  his firearms by his side
Hearin no sound  just watchin the fireworks in the sky
I walk by look down he still smiling 'cause he's done fightin'
A fallen soldier  now his war's over
Don't matter which side is wrong or right
Some innocent lives will be lost on the battlefield tonight
So hungry to kill  only his death can curb his appetite
Live ammo hit the flesh and it feels so right
I've embellished my life  now God please tell me is this what death's like?
 kept his innocence  heavy hearted spouse
Clingin on to anything intimate she can find around the house
What's the difference between Bush and Saddam?
Sheik Ahmed Yassin  Osama Bin Laden or Idi Amin
Fidel Castro  it seems to me they on the same team
They hate only lead to innocent blood streams
If it's so important for us to fight for mankind
Well I don't see none of they kinfolk out there on the front line

And how does it feel like
To shine on everyone?
And how does it feel like

I'm talking in my sleep
I think you're going soft
I know it's stiff for me
And Saturdays are short
I'm walking with my dog
A lie's a canyon size
Break up this all
There is nothing bound and left
Longer that I love
Break up all
There is nothing wrong with me
I'm driving in the sun
It's a hell of a way down south
Bring me back my love
I'm standing in your home
And Saturdays are short
I'm walking with my dog

Hmmm I was confused
But I composed myself and decided I should face him
But I stood paralyzed on the supposed golden path
And I was confronted by a powerful demon force
And they said it was the devil
And when he spoke his words flowed like glowing lava
From the mouth of a volcano
I found myself in some kind of hell
But I did not believe in a heaven-and-hell world-in-opposite's kind of reality
And I gained control of myself and I decided to press on
And as I walked along the supposed golden path
I seen in the distance silver mountains rising high in the clouds
And voice from above did whisper some shining answer from the womb
As I walked along
As I walked along

The pills won't help you now

They looked around and stood like I was on crack
I heard somebody say out loud  What the fuck is that?
This nigga's dancing like a fish  while he's doing The Snap
But the more I kept doing it  the more they were feeling it
And then I heard some bitches say  Yo  that nigga's killing it
By the end of the night  everyone was on my team
And the whole club was dancing like a salmon floating up stream
I'll float up stream
(You know how we do it  you know how we do it)

Most of our friends find their home waters by sense of smell
Which is even more keen than that of a dog or a bear
