lyrics
"I swear by now I'm playing time against my troubles
Do you wish a dance and while
I'm in the front
The play on time is won
I will go in this way
And find my own way out
I won't tell you to begin
But I'm coming to much more
Me
Reeling in you now
Remember when I used to play for
All of the loneliness that nobody
Notices now
Only waiting
I wanted to stay
I wanted to play
I wanted to love you
I'm only this far
And only tomorrow leads the way
I'm coming waltzing back and moving into your head

I wouldn't pass this by
What sort of man goes by?
I will bring water
Why won't you ever be glad?
It melts into wonder
I came in praying for you
Why won't you run
Into the rain and play
Mama  bless me to my bones
You have started the fire
Ooh  I'm weak now in my soul
With your poison sting
This is deep and true
I'd do anything
Your sweet perfume
You bleed
Till the well is overflown
You're my gold  my hunger
Where you go  I will follow
Sweet poison sting
I see the light
I see everything in you tonight
I breathe
In and out here we go  oh oh
Over and again and again
Oh and the love you give to me
Here mama  I'ma give it back to you

Reaching out  reaching out for you
Just to kiss your mouth
Wanna turn you inside out
Isn't such a thing
As you do to me

I'll be your king 'cause you are my queen
In and out here we go  oh oh
Over and again and again
And all the love you give to me
Mama  I'ma give it back to you
Oh  don't let it get away
And if we did  we gonna get it back
All in time you and me

Oh and the love
That you ever had I give it back to you

Never changes a thing
Wondering what the other is thinking
But we never say a thing
These crimes between us grow deeper
Take these chances

She feeds him well his concerns
He forgets them
And remembers being small
Playing under the table and dreaming

Driving in on this highway
All these cars and upon the sidewalk
People in every direction
No words exchanged
No time to exchange
When all the little ants are marching
Red and black antennae waving
They all do it the same
They all do it the same way
Candyman tempting the thoughts of a
Sweet tooth tortured by the weight loss
Program cutting the corners
Take these chances
Place them in a box until a quieter time
 brother of mine please don't forget me if I go
 fill my glass for me
 and if I die before my time
 sweet sister of mine please don't regret me if I go

There's too many ghosts in here
Makes me wonder
Will we find peace anywhere?
All falls far away
And only if I could always
Always feel this way

Could we find the truth someday
And then you talk to me
And you are the truth I need

Through my head
Human as to human
The future is no place
To place your better days
Cry freedom cry
Hope laid upon hope
That this crowd will not subside
Let this flag burn to dust
And a new a fair design be raised
While we wait head in hands
Hands in prayer
And fall into a dreamless sleep again
And we wave our hands
Hands and feet are all alike
But gold between divide us
Hands and feet are all alike
But fear between divide us
All slip away
There was a window and by it stood
A mirror in which
He could see himself
He thought of something
Something he had never had but hoped would come along
From deep inside
Where we are all confined
While we wave hands in fire

Such a shame to throw it all away
The images grow darker still
Could I have been anyone other than me?
Then I look up at the sky
My mouth is open wide lick and taste
Turn turn we almost become dizzy
I am who I am who I am well who am I
Requesting some enlightenment
Could I have been anyone other than me
And then I'll
Sing and dance
I'll play for you tonight
The thrill of it all
Dark clouds may hang on me sometimes
But I'll work it out
And then I

Could I have been a dancing Nancy a dancing Nancy
Come now come now
Can you not see?
There's no place here
What were you expecting
Not room for both
Just room for me
So you will lay your arms down
Yes I will call this home
Away away
You have been banished
Your land is gone
And given me
And here I will spread my wings
Yes I will call this home
What's this you say?
You feel a right to remain?
Then stay and I will bury you
What's that you say

I will silence you

I'll build heaven and call it home

Someone’s house is burning down on a day like this
The evening comes and we’re hanging out

Someone is screaming and crying in the apartment upstairs
Somebody’s going hungry and someone else is eating out

I saying love treats us well keeps us dancing
Baby I love you well our love is sure and find

She says nothing of what she thinks
She just goes stumbling through her memories
Staring out onto Grey Street
I dream myself a thousand times around the world
But I can't get out of this place
There's an emptiness inside her
And she'd do anything to fill it in
But all the colors mix together - to grey
And it breaks her heart
How she wishes it was different
She prays to God most every night
And though she swears it doesn't listen
There's still a hope in her it might
She says  I pray
But they fall on deaf ears
Am I supposed to take it on myself?
To get out of this place?
There's loneliness inside her
And she'd do anything to fill it in
And though it's red blood bleeding from her now
It feels like cold blue ice in her heart
When all the colors mix together - to grey
And it breaks her heart

I live on the corner of Grey Street
And the end of the world

And though it's red blood bleeding from her now
It's more like cold blue ice in her heart
She feels like kicking out all the windows
And setting fire to this life
She could change everything about her
Using colors bold and bright
But all the colors mix together - to grey
And it breaks her heart

When we come I'll let you come low

Oh and then the nightmares
I'll fill them in good time

Why do you come inside of me
Why does it rip me out in dream
Why then why then watch this little fuck

But looking at blood
It's alive right now
And deep and sweet within
Pouring through our veins
Intoxicate moving wine to tears
And drinking it deep
Then an evening spent dancing
It's you and me...
This love will open our world
From the dark side we can see a glow of something bright
Oh  there's much more than we see here
Don't burn the day away
Is this not enough?
This blessed sip of life
Is it not enough?
Staring down at the ground
Oh  then complain and pray for more from above
You greedy little pig
Stop  just watch your world trickle away
Oh  it's your problem now
It'll all be dead and gone in a few short years
Just love will open our eyes
Just love will put the hope in our minds
Much more than we could ever know
Oh  so don't burn the day away
Don't burn the day away

Come sister  my brother
Shake up your bones  shake up your feet
I'm saying open up
And let the rain come pouring in
Wash out this tired notion
That the best is yet to come
But while you're dancing on the ground
Don't think of when you're gone
Because we need the light of love in here
Don't beat your head
Dry your eyes
Let the love in there
There are bad times
But that's okay
Just look for love in it
And don't burn the day away...
Look  here are we
On this starry night  staring into space
And I must say
I feel as small as dust lying down here
What point could there be troubling?
Head down wondering what will become of me?
Why concern What we cannot see
But no reason to abandon it
The time is short but that's all right
Maybe I'll go in the middle of the night
Take your hands from your eyes  my love
All good things must come to an end some time
But don't burn the day away
Don't burn the day away...
Come sister  my brother
Shake up your bones  shake up your feet
I'm saying open up
And let the rain come flooding in
Wash out this tired notion
That the best is yet to come
But while you're dancing on the ground
Don't think of when you're gone
Oh I am bounce around so well
Branch to branch
Limb to limb you see
All in a day's dream
I'm stuck
Like the other monkeys here
I am a humble monkey
Sitting up in here again
But then came the day
I climbed out of these safe limbs
Ventured away
I went to the city
Now I am the proudest monkey you've ever seen
Then comes the day
Staring at myself I turn to question me
Oh things were quiet then
In a way they were the better days
But now I am the proudest monkey you've ever seen
My heart calls to me in my sleep
How can I turn to it
Cause I'm all locked up in this
Dark place -
And I do not know
I'm as good as dead
My head aches -
Warped and tied up
I need to kill this pain
My head won't leave my head alone
And I don't believe it will
Until I'm dead and gone
My head won't leave my head alone
And I don't believe it will
Until I'm six feet underground
How long I'm tied up
My mind in knots -
My stomach reels
In concern for what I might do or
What I've don
It's got me living in fear
Well I know these voices must
Be my soul
I've had enough I've had enough of being alone
I've got no place to go

In my grave
Lying wired and shut and quiet in my grave
Leave me here
Leave me here to waste here
So young and here I am again
Talking to myself
A T.V. blares
Oh man
Oh how I wish I didn't smoke
Or drink to reason with my head
But sometimes this thick confusion
Grows until I cannot bear it at all
Needle to the vein
Needle to the vein
Take this needle from my vein my friend
I said
My head won't leave my head alone
And I don't believe it will

My head won't leave my head alone
And I don't believe it will

Lying
Lying cold in my grave
The reason -
My reason
Take my head off this terror
The fearing won't come back
I can't see
My mind's all wiped clean
The needle
Make my great escape
I seem caught in time
My head leaves me behind
Young mother screams and pushes you
The day you came
Oh joy begin
Weak little thing
More precious there’ll be nothing  no
Oh joy begin
Let’s not forget these early days
Remember we begin the same
We lose our way in fear and pain
Oh joy begin
First just one step
One word and then
With laughter sing  oh life begin
First just one step
Let’s not forget these early days
Remembering we began the same
We lose our way in fear and hate
Oh joy begin
Innocent kiss
Black magic bliss
First broken bone
Sudden and swift
Oh innocence
Let’s not forget these early days
Remember we begin the same
We lose our way in fear and pain
Oh joy begin
Like a diamond in the sky
How I wonder
Satellite strung from the moon
And the world your balloon
Peeping Tom for the mother station
Winter's cold spring erases
And the calm away by the storm is chasen
Everything good needs replacing
Satellite headlines read
Someone's secrets you've seen
Eyes and ears have been
Satellite dish in my yard
Who's the king of your satellite castle

And the calm away by the storm is chasen

You've got me wild
Turned around inside
Inside here
And know you feel the same way I do now

Just for an evening
When we make
Our passion pictures
You and me twist up
Secret creatures
And we'll stay here
Tomorrow go back to being friends

And away here

You have run out of time

Torching time talking rhymes in
Would you like to play
With the thought of a friend
In a distant passing stage?
While you lie around
With your hands up and down
So resigned you will fall down
While you around here play
Wild on the warm and far away
Keep scribbling themselves in tidy lines
Would you like to play
With a fool holding hands?
With a one-eyed jack of spades?

Still he and the queen are lost at sea

You were standing underneath us
We were not yet lovers
Dragons were smoked
Bumblebees were stinging us
I was soon to be crazy
For tomorrow we'll die
For tomorrow we'll die
'Cause we're tripping billies

Nothing but our shadows
Shadows falling down on the beach sand
We wore pineapple grass bracelets

This warehouse frightens me
Said I'm going
Now I'm slipping slow away
Hoping to find something better than I've got inside of here
And the warehouse slips away
Hey reckless mind
Don't throw away your playful beginnings
And be sure to leave all the lights on
So we can see the black cat changing colors
And we can walk under ladders
Hey we have found
Becoming one in a million
Slip into the crowd
This question I found in a gap in the sidewalk
Keep all your sights on
Hey the black cat changing colors
And you can walk under ladders
And swim as the tide choose to turn you away
Spot in the middle
Hard to believe an end to it
Smell touch feel
How could this rhythm ever quit
Bags packed on a plane

Spot in the middle
Hard to believe an end to it
Warehouse is bare
Nothing at all inside of it
The walls and halls have disappeared
They've disappeared where?
In a corner and wondering
If a change can be better than this
Maybe things won't be better than they have been here in the warehouse
At the warehouse
At the warehouse
That's our blood down there
Seems poured from the hands of angels
But trickled into the ground
Leave the warehouse bare and empty
And my heart's numbered beats
Still echo in this empty room
And the fear wells in me
But nothing seems good enough to them
So I am going away
I'm going away
Fleas and ticks jump everywhere
Cause of original sin
Down the hill fell Jack and Jill
And you came tumbling after
Cause of original sin
Rip away the tears
Drink a hope to happy years
And you may find
A lifetime's passed you by
What would you say?
Don't drop the big one
If you a monkey on a string
Don't cut my lifeline
If you a doggie on a chain
