" wake up and wonder
 I wish I can join her
 when I'm falling down
 and she puts them together
 she stands by me
 and she makes them feel better
 wake up and wonder
 turn off my head
 and she puts them together
 she stands by me
 and she makes them feel better
 and she puts them together
 she stands by me
 and she makes them feel better
 woah-oh
It's even worse because we built this from the floor
It's just as hard for me to know I might see you 'round
It's just as hard for me to worry 'bout reachin' out
And then I crumble when you say you're getting over us

And I won't tell you what I want to
What I want to
But I learn to
Don't have to stand there and burn inside
Oh oh oh if you don't like it
She's working late and making eyes at the door
She sick of everybody up on her floor
She wants the sun in her eyes but all she gets is ignored
She used to put it out and get it all back
But now she slipping trying to carry the act
Woah
No you don't have to wear your best fake smile
Don't have to stand there and burn inside
Oh oh oh if you don't like it
And you don't have to care so don't pretend
Nobody needs a best fake friend
Oh oh oh don't hide it
No hesitation now she gets up and walks
She thinks of all the pain and pride that they caused
She emptied all the tip jars and won't get back what she lost
You might also likeOutside the window with two fingers to show
She lifts her head up just to blow out the smoke
She doesn't have to look back to know when she's gotta go
No you don't have to wear your best fake smile
Don't have to stand there and burn inside
Oh oh oh if you don't like it
And you don't have to care so don't pretend
Nobody needs a best fake friend
Oh oh oh don't hide it
If you don't bleed it you don't need it anymore
If you don't need it get up and leave it on the floor
No more believing like its a voice you can't ignore
No you don't have to wear your best fake smile
Don't have to stand there and burn inside
Oh oh oh if you don't like it
And you don't have to care so don't pretend
Nobody needs a best fake friend
Oh oh oh don't hide it
No you don't have to wear your best fake smile
Don't have to stand there and burn inside
Oh oh oh if you don't like it
And I'm still not sure just who I am supposed to be
I hung back in the shadows and periphery
And you took my hand through the bright lights when they blinded me
'Cause everything's better
As soon as you're next to me
I know I'll fall apart
But you fix me with your heart
Everything's better
You're there in the fight with me
And when I fail to start
You fix me with your heart
I grew up trying to hit light speed
But I lost my nerve when the big kids kicked it out of me

'Cause everything's better
As soon as you're next to me
I know I'll fall apart
But you fix me with your heart
Everything's better
You're there in the fight with me
And when I fail to start
You fix me with your heart
You're fearless in defeat
You're a dancer in the street
And you looked the deepest darkness in the eye
We missed the last bus home
Found a park bench for a throne
And the stars stayed out tonight
As soon as you're next to me
I know I'll fall apart
But you fix me with your heart
Everything's better
You're there in the fight with me
And when I fail to start
You fix me with your heart
I'm better with you
We put on a brave face
We write down the details to make us feel safe
Cold on the mattress
Sad and alone
I think it's ten thousand minutes till I get home
Someday we're gonna get to do
All the things that we wanted to
Never wanna say goodbye
You always see through my disguise
You're the one who breaks my heart right
You tear me up and wreck my dreams
I hold your hand when I'm asleep
I don't mind falling for a lifetime
'Cause you break my heart right
Be tender and honest
And sometimes say words that hurt

And someday we're gonna get to do
Never gonna say goodbye

'Cause you break my heart right
Don't say you're sorry
Stay in my head
Don't protect me
Never wanna say goodbye
You always see through my disguise
You're the one who breaks my heart right
You tear me up and wreck my dreams
I hold your hand when I'm asleep
I don't mind falling for a lifetime
'Cause you break my heart right
I don't mind falling for a lifetime
I know no one could ever love me better
Take all night  you're the truth that is breaking me
And keeping me together  together
I wanna be in your touch
Sleeping's so tough  you're burning up my mind
What would it feel like if you tore me apart?
Come on  chew on my heart
Come on  chew on my heart
I wanna be in your touch
Sleeping's so tough  you're burning up my mind
What would it feel like if you tore me apart?
Come on  chew on my heart
Come on  chew on my heart
I'm on fire  I'm a hot mess
I'm thinking things that I might start regretting
So hear me out  I need you now
I'm spiralling  I'm sinking down
Look for me  I'm sending up a message

(Ooh  ooh

Ooh  ooh
No diamonds in the trees  only leaves of gold
And our long days in the heat haze starts to fade
We can hide under sheets  under heavy covers
So deep as the night draws in
And we'll be slow hearted lovers
'Til the clocks go forward again
When there's no blue above  gonna keep my summer clothes
Cause there's still a field of green underneath the falling snow
When our hands grow so cold and hard to hold
We can hide under sheets  under heavy covers
So deep as the night draws in
And we'll be slow hearted lovers
'Til the clocks go forward again
Stay warm  close your eyes
Let time fly
Stay close  stay right here
Nothing to fear

And we'll hide under sheets  under heavy covers
So deep as the night draws in
And we'll be slow hearted lovers
'Til the clocks go forward again
I know we're gonna collide
I know we'll call it the end
You wear your heart on your sleeve
I wear my blood on my tie
But it's only love underneath this disguise
Oh you left a hole in me
But I don't cut easily
I think it's time to open up
And I don't mean bleed
So turn it on
We can go wild if it's what you want
Fire at me
I can't bear to let you go
So keep on throwing your sticks and stones
I'd rather fight with you all night
Than never have you in my life
You might also like
Why don't you do it again?
Go wrecking something of mine
Like you deserve the revenge
Like I've got something to hide
You keep on calling me names
It's just a game
Oh you left a hole in me
But I don't cut easily
I think it's time to open up
I don't mean bleed
So turn it on
We can go wild if it's what you want
Fire at me
I can't bear to let you go
So keep on throwing your sticks and stones
I'd rather fight with you all night
Than never have you in my life
All I know is I love it when our shit blows
We keep turning red hot and stone cold
Sweet burn inside
Deals get broke
We fall in and fall out
Until curtains close and we come alive
I can't bear to let you go
So keep on throwing your sticks and stones
I'd rather fight with you all night
Than never have you in my life
I can't bear to let you go
So keep on throwing your sticks and stones
I'd rather fight with you all night
Than never have you in my life
In the town I grew up
Shelter from the rain in every doorway
It's dark and everyone's numb
Kids are making faces in the bus lane
But nobody looks up
Everyone's life the same as yesterday
Just like the ticking of clocks
Never thought the night could get so lonely
'til she called me up
Never thought these streets could've out-grown me
I guess it wasn't enough
So I put my faith in everyone around me
Then she sold all my stuff
Sheer and wild abandon that's all I need
And someone I can trust

Take me far from streets and roads
Lead me out in the night
Don't show me the way back home
'Coz I
Craving
We're gonna watch the sun come out
Everyone's here
There's silver slipping through the clouds
I pull this moment close
To stop me running out of hope
Hear this complicated heart of mine
Is someone when the night is long
Half a lonely soul to make me whole
'Cause everybody needs someone
That's all it takes
A simple little twist of fate
A little spark
Some strength to keep your heart from breaking when
You get so close
'Cause breaking comes and breaking goes

Is someone when the night is long

All I want
Is someone when the crowd is gone
'Cause everybody needs someone
All I want
Is someone when the night is long
Half a lonely soul to make me whole
'Cause everybody needs someone
'Cause you only text me after 2
I wanna just be done with you
But I call you back 'cause I'm a fool
Come get me when your promises come true
Until then I'll keep driving out to you
You say nothing all night
Then we get drunk and repeat
I could touch the moon
You try so hard to play this bullshit game
One night you even straight forgot my name
You say nothing all night
(Tell me what this is for you)
Then we get drunk and repeat

I let you play me
I let you play me out
I let you play me
I let you fade me out
I let you play me
Watching them empty out
Invisible to this crowd
Always double vision
I've been losing my mind
Listening to broken speech
Stacking up broken seats
It's a lonely picture
And I hear your voice as it echoes 'round my head
Always that same thing that you said
Don't let the nights slip through your hands
The world is wide from where you stand
As I'm sweeping up glass
I see the exit light so green
These people falling into the street
Something comes together
I've been here too long
And if I stay they'll tie me down
I know this chance won't hang around
So I'm gone forever

And I hear your voice as it echoes 'round my head
Always that same thing that you said
Don't let the nights slip through your hands
The world is wide from where you stand
Making my tracks along the cracks in the concrete
Seeing those headlights shining down upon my feet
For all the bleeding hearts pushing 'round their shopping carts
I'm ejecting like a bullet from a gun
Don't let the nights slip through your hands
The world is wide from where you stand
Am I staying or leaving?
Give me the reason to give it one more try
Don't wanna say goodbye
Feels like yesterday
Standing on the corner in your favorite dress
Then you broke my heart
I can't stand to see those tears in your eyes
We should be dancing like we did that night
Give mе the reason to give it onе more shot
And I'll give it all that I got
After all that we did to everything that we are
Give me the reason to give it one more try
Don't wanna say goodbye
Give me the reason
Am I staying or leaving?
Give me the reason to give it one more try
Don't wanna say goodbye

'Cause I've got nothing left
Without your foot on the drum that beats inside my chest
I feel like mirrors and smoke
It's not that I couldn't see you were in pain
I'm not fooling around
I can't stand to see those tears in your eyes
We should be dancing like we did that night
Give me the reason to give it one more shot
And I'll give it all that I got
After all that we did to everything that we are
Give me the reason to give it one more try
Don't wanna say goodbye
Give me the reason
Am I staying or leaving?
Give me the reason to give it one more try
Don't wanna say goodbye
I can't stand to see those tears in your eyes
We should be dancing like we did that night
I want you to know that
We don't have to say goodbye
Give me the reason
Am I staying or leaving?
Give me the reason to give it one more try
 mine's got a crack in it
 This is not forever
 walk me to the door
 trying not to buckle down to the floor
 I want you back
 No need to be sad
 soft as we might say it
 it cuts to the core
 even though we go down together
 ay
 I want you back
 No need to be sad
 but I'm falling apart
 I don't wanna lose you again
 I want you back
 No need to be sad
 oh
I find you all alone
Shaking tired  but looking lost
I came to take you home
And we walk in silence
Side by side
And I just wanna lay you down your burdens  all your fears
And I don't need your deepest secrets whispered in my ear
Cause I can hear your heart  your heart
I can hear your heart  your heart
The window's cold against your hand
Outside is just a blur
I pull you close  and you close your eyes
And we don't say a word
We've got to keep ruling  ruling
And I just wanna lay you down your burdens  all your fears
And I don't need your deepest secrets whispered in my ear
Cause I can hear your heart  your heart
I can hear your heart  your heart

And I just wanna lay you down your burdens  all your fears
And I don't need your deepest secrets whispered in my ear
Cause I can hear your heart  your heart
I can hear your heart  your heart
I can hear your heart  your heart
Talking to you without falling down
And this house keeps getting darker
If we're cutting any corners
There's still a chance to make it right
So let's put our heads together
Before we lose our mind
Have I been holding on too strong?
Maybe I'm coming off all wrong
Is it our heavy handed love
Keeping us from moving on?
Feels like I'm treading the water
Trying to keep my head above the line
I hear the sound of you get softer
Lately you've been just so hard to find
And there's nothing I want more now
Than to say the perfect word
I try to make it better
But the trying only hurts

Have I been holding on too strong?
Maybe I'm coming off all wrong
Is it our heavy handed love
But life got in between
Tried to square not being there
But think that I should have been
Hold back the river so I-I
Can stop for a minute and see where you hide
Once upon a different life
We rode our bikes into the sky
But now we crawl against the tide
Those distant days are flashing by
Hold back the river so I
Can stop for a minute and be by your side
Hold back the river so I-I
Can stop for a minute and see where you hide

Playing records that I couldn't own
Walking fast into the ticket line
Walking slow to save a lonely night
I'm sweeping up at 9 a.m
Unable to pay my rent
There's ten more hours of life I missed
But I don't even need them back because I found you
I found you
I can't believe I get to know you
I had no one 'til I found you
'Til I found you
Early mornin' in the market place
Freezing rain falling in my face
Heavy sky on the same old town

'Til I found you
'Til I found you
'Til I really found you
When I found you
When I found you
There wasn't nothing left that wasn't love
When I found you
When I found you
I needed you more than I'll ever know
I can't believe I get to know you
I had no one 'til I found you
'Til I found you

I can't believe I get to know you

Some people live for the fortune
Some people live just for the fame
Some people live for the power
Some people live just to play the game
Some people think that the physical things define what's within
So full of the superficial
Some people want it all
And I don't want nothing at all
Some people bought diamond rings
Some just want everything
But everything means nothing
If I ain't got you
Oh
Some people search for the fountain
That promises forever young
Some people need three dozen roses
So hand me the world on a silver platter

If I ain't got you
Oh
Nothing in this whole wide world
Don’t mean a thing
Oh
Don’t mean a thing
If I ain’t got you with me
Oh
Felt just like it used to be
Talking for hours 'bout a different life
Surrounded us in memories
We were close never close enough
Where are we now
Cause if it's torn we can stitch it up
Don't rule it out
Oh no no
I'll come around
If you ever want to be in love
If you ever want to be in love
I'll come around
Wanted to ask if we could have been
But my tongue wouldn't break the seal
You always had something effortless
At school you were the biggest deal
Little quirks close and open up
Time is slipping by
I'm always thinking 'bout the two of us
Replay on my mind
Always playing on my mind

We were young we were side by side
Don't know when we started losing touch
If you want we could walk around
Maybe that would be enough
Used to talk drinking to the night
I would wake up on the front room floor
Make me crazy make me want you more
I'll come around
If you ever want to be in love
I'll come around
If you ever want to be in love
If you ever want to be in love
I'm gonna get you in my head 'til I can't forget
I'm fed up with this profile
I don't sleep  I'm obsessed
I get worn out by my words
'Cause they sounded so good in my head
I'm confused and I'm lonely
So is everyone else
Where are you in this ocean
Of static and nothing much else?
I swear I got somethin' worth heart
I know you could find it
Say that you can see me  I'll speak up I swear
But I need a second light
Now that you exist  I'm in your atmosphere
I'm going out my mind

Of our own problems to fix
And now we're lost and lonely
I'll be lost 'til you want me
Take me home  take me home  take me home
I'll go
Say that you can see me  I'll speak up I swear
But I need a second light
Now that you exist  I'm in your atmosphere
I'm going out my mind
I'm gonna get you in my head whether I like it or not
I'm gonna get you in my head 'til I can't forget

I'm gonna get you in my head  in my head  in my head
But the bleeding heart I left on the shelf
'Cause you're here and you're all mine
I press my lips down into your neck
And I stay there and I reconnect
Bravery I've been trying to perfect
It can wait for a while
Scared of the hope in my head
You're here with your head on my chest
I should've guessed
That the world will turn and we'll grow
We'll learn how to be
To be incomplete
I breathe out now and we fall back in
Just like before we can re-begin
Let your lungs push slow up against my skin
Let it all feel just right

Gone is the emptiness

How'd we ever go without?
'Cause the world will turn and we'll grow

To be incom...
I don't want to look down
I don't want us to break up in the clouds
I don't want to look down
I don't want us to break up in the clouds
And the world will turn and we'll grow
We'll learn how to be
To be incomplete
We can just stay
You wanna walk home?
I hate when you do this
Hey!
Hey
What's up?
Uh  nothing
Really?
OK  what's going on in your head? You're like  being weird
I don't... I don't know how I... I feel about... this... us
Is it me or you?
No  it isn't you. Um  you should go
Blurry eyes into my telephone light
All your words in disguise
Makin' me think like you're mine
We were such a pretty picture in a frame
Now it's like you don't remember my name
What we gonna be this time?
Go with me through the dark
For tonight
What you mean when you say you're better now?
All these calls like you still want me around
Go with me through the dark
For tonight
Go with me through the dark
For tonight
Make me believe that you need me most
I try to call but I can't get ahold
If I come-a-lookin' would you even know?
Make me believe that you need me most
I try to call but I can't get ahold
Go with me through the dark
For tonight
Go with me through the dark
For tonight
Just for tonight
Just for tonight
Just for tonight
Just for tonight
If I come-a-lookin' would you even know?
Why can I call but I can't get hope?
I'm gonna pick you up
And take you far way
From trouble my love
Under a big ol' sky
Out in a field of green
There's gotta be something left for us to believe
Good fortune comes our way
And we ride down the kings highway
No you can't hide out
In a six gun town
We wanna hold our heads up
But we gotta stay down
I don't wanna end up
In a room all alone
Don't wanna end up someone
That I don't even know
Good fortune comes our way
To seeing shows in evening clothes with you
From nervous touch and getting drunk
To staying up and waking up with you
Now we're slipping near the edge
Holding something we don't need
All this delusion in our heads
Is gonna bring us to our knees
And I'll be me
From throwing clothes across the floor
To teeth and claws and slamming doors at you
If this is all we're living for
I used to recognize myself
It's funny how reflections change
When we're becoming something else
I think it's time to walk away
You might also like
And I'll be me
Tryna fit your hand inside of mine
When we know it just don't belong
Tryna push this problem up the hill
When it's just too heavy to hold
I think now's the time to let it slide
And I'll be me
It's colder to turn on your side
And I know you're up in two hours
But we didn't get tonight  we don't have tomorrow
So don't ruin now
How we gonna move together? Just come closer
If we don't move together  just come closer
How we gonna breathe? How we gonna be together?
Just keeping the peace between the sheets
And I creep in  and everything's loud
I'm sorry  I've woken you now
And we'll argue the tiniest thing
But we didn't get tonight  we don't have tomorrow
So I'm done whispering  done whispering
How we gonna move together? Just come closer
If we don't move together  just come closer
How we gonna breathe? How we gonna be together?
Just keeping the peace between the sheets

So maybe don't give me cold  cold shoulder
And let me stay in the dark of the morning
Just one more thing
How we gonna move together? Just come closer
If we don't move together  come closer
How we gonna breathe? How we gonna be together?
Just keeping the peace  just keeping the peace
 I'm battle worn
 I hope
 butterflies
 I hope
 oh oh
 oh oh
 I hope
 yes I'm hope I'm not too late
 oh oh
 oh oh
 oh oh
The wonders of the world don't come close
You're from another planet and I want you  I want to
Try to write around every curve
I'm flipping every stone left unturned
I think you understand what's on my mind
The way you hit me with those eyes  I can't escape in time
We can take it love  we can make it all night
I wanna trace my hands cross your frecklеd constellations
I wanna hide in the covers  discover your body slow
'Til there's nowhere left to go
Oh my God  it's happening again
I feel myself falling back in
Gravity's got me holding tightly  I might be
In a little over my head  in a little deep in this bed
I think you understand what's on my mind

Take me to your mountain high
Your river  your valley wide
Take me where nobody's been before
I wanna trace my hands cross your freckled constellations
I wanna hide in the covers  discover your body slow
'Til there's nowhere left to go  oh
'Til there's nowhere left to go  oh
 in your arms
 living small in a big house
 rushing in from the rain at the back of the garden
 I just wanna tell you
 at the back
 easily
 I just wanna tell you
 I don't know what I'd do
 no)
 they're all saying  Call me up

Don't ask me to repeat it
Don't suffocate my heart
I don't know what I'm feeling
Do you wanna talk? Do you wanna talk it through?
Swear I ain't got anything on my mind
I don't wanna talk to you
(Don't ask me)
Do you wanna talk? Do you wanna talk it through?
Swear I ain't got anything on my mind

I'm protecting you from what I don't wanna have to say
I'm protecting us 'cause I don't wanna walk away
You
Thinking of you
I'm just thinking of you
I came to warm your bones
There were twenty million tears in your hands
You found me in the dark
You came to heal my scars
But I would rather hurt than nothing at all
Through the lonely
I always rescue you
You always rescue me
We never draw the line
But only 'cause you're mine
Only 'cause you promise me I'm yours
You made me fall apart
My sewn together heart
Is better when you're walking through the door
But I would rather hurt than nothing at all
Through the lonely
I always rescue you
You always rescue me

When the world spins in reverse
I'll keep running
To the place where I belong
When you go to turn down the light
And no one's there to hold you in the night
I'll keep running
To the place where I belong
When you think you're on your own
I'm still coming home
When our picture fades in the Sun
And all the colors blur into one
I'll keep running
To the place where I belong
When you think you're on your own
I'm still coming home

I'll keep running
To the place I belong
When you think you're on your own
I'm still coming home
When you think you're on your own
For someone who's never gonna run
For someone who's there when you wake up
But be careful who you choose
'Cause you still got a heart to lose
You know it ain't good for you
Like he's some God to you
Then he stops calling you
And you try to keep it hid
But you're drowning in your tears
As I watch you disappear
We're grown enough to make our own decisions
I'm not just saying things to blur your vision
The truth is that it's more than intuition
Even if your body doesn't wanna listen
Save your love
For someone who's never gonna run
For someone who's there when you wake up
'Cause you still got a heart to lose
Save your love
For someone who will appreciate
Who's willing to give the time it takes
But he ain't good enough for you

 the engine's running
 I swear
 anymore
 you're shaking
 it's breaking
 you try to make a payphone call to me
 you're on your own
 anymore
 anymore
 no
 there's no doubt
 anymore
At home
From when everybody
Stayed over
In the summer
Now it’s cold
And I still wanna let you know
I always found you
Through the crowd
But I never told you
Out loud
To everyone else I could speak
But with you I was tongue tied
You will always spark the light
Spark the light in me
You will always mess me up the best
You knew my name
All of your friends knew what I felt was not pretend
My heart was see-through
I wanted to hold you
But I never told you

And the long walks home in the dark we'll miss
Nobody teaches you how to reminisce
Nobody teaches you to hurt like this
Then we slide into the arms of someone else
Was that ever even us? Do we know what we missed?
Nobody teaches you how to win big
Nobody said there's no reverse on this
Then we slide into the arms of someone else
Then we slide into the arms of someone else
Nobody wants to wake up alone

The one without you
Would you spit fire at me
Or would you burn to know
Every single by blow?
I don't know her
Maybe she isn't real
She didn't hold back
When you were lying next to me
This can't be all we are
Silent and in the dark
We could be making sparks
We could be making sparks
Come a little closer
Remember when we used to sway
Trembling in the covers
Taking it with an only grey
This can't be all we are
Silent and in the dark

Lookin' out into nothin'
Lookin' for a way to get around at night
We were kids
Holdin' out for a dream
We were born to be wild and free
Or sit alone online
But I don't wanna wait
Sit the other side of these flood lights
Dreaming up a way to escape
Anyone around?
Stand up and be counted
Before we slip away out here
Don't ever doubt it
Even if we're surrounded
Slip away (Slip)
Slip away (Slip)

We were Kings
We were Queens of an empire
We were made out on these streets
We were all desire
If we're gonna tumble in the gunfire
Promise we'll be side by side
Say you'll be there when the school gates close
Say you'll be there when the rest don't show
Stand up and be counted
Before we slip away out here
Don't ever doubt it
Even if we're surrounded
High on hope and high on fear
We were heartbreak of the year
We were summers in the street
We were sunlight through the trees
We were whispers in the dark
We were sleeping under stars
We were rollercoaster screams
'Til our hearts burst at the seams
We're not gonna let it all go up in smoke
Stand up and be counted
Before we slip away out here
 a lifeline
 I don't know why seasons change
 fake feelings
 what are hopeless dreams?
 cherry coke until our brains burned
 all night
 what are hopeless dreams?
 cherry coke until our brains burned
 we were the only ones
 what are hopeless dreams?
 cherry coke until our brains burned
 we were the only ones
When your heart's on fire
Wild and wired
You come to me
Give me everything I need
Give me a lifetime of promises
And a world of dreams
Speak the language of love
Like you know what it means
It can't be wrong
You're simply the best
Better than all the rest
Better than anyone
Anyone I've ever met
I'm stuck on your heart
Hang on every word you say
Tear us apart

Better than anyone
Anyone I've ever met
I'm stuck on your heart
Hang on every word you say
Tear us apart
Each time you leave me I start losing control
You're walking away with my heart and my soul
I can feel you even when I'm alone
You're simply the best
Better than all the rest
Better than anyone
Anyone I've ever met
I'm stuck on your heart
Hang on every word you say
Tear us apart
Sometimes I'm broke
‘Cause sometimes this city is nothing but smoke
Is there a secret?
Is there a code?
Can we make it better? 'Cause I'm losing hope
Tell me how to be in this world
Tell me how to breathe in and feel no hurt

Oh
Mmm
Oh
At the end of each day
That I keep on working hard
But all I do is get paid
Though I keep believing
There's a light up ahead
Cause it's only getting darker
And I could stay in my bed
But I've learned to hold my own
So I stand and I wait in line
With a heavy head and this bottle of wine
And I watch as they steal my time
I stand and I wait in line
I stand and I wait in line
I walk home in the shadows
I carry my cage
And I hope they notice
What I brought to the stage

With a heavy head and this bottle of wine
And I vow as they steal my time
I know one day I'll get mine
And I stand here and wait in line

 you're the first thing on my mind
 I wasn't alone
 I was on your side
 need to feel that rush
 every one of us got wanderlust
 hot night
 every one of us got wanderlust (Got wanderlust)
 light that surrounds you
 be in that light
 light that surrounds you
 be in that light
 light that surrounds you
 be in the light
 every one of us got wanderlust
We're done with coming up and way past comin' down
My body shakes  a part of missing you
I know you miss me too  I know you do
Is it a sane desire?
Is it insane to try?
We let this runaway train catch fire (I don't care)
I don't care  all I want is you
We can try to stop this bruising  we can be like novocaine
There's a high we keep on choosing  we don't wanna change it
Everybody calls us foolish  they don't know how foolish tastes
Every time we try to fight it  we just end up wasted (wasted)
Wasted on each other
Wasted on each other
Put your hands up!
We've both got people tryna creep in  policing
Since when was this thing so indecent?
Stop acting like everything's understood
I know you miss me  too

Days getting dark and the nights are growing cold
Are we burning out?
Swept out of sight  rolling out on an ocean
Let's cut all the ropes and get lost in the moment
If our hearts are alive  maybe then they might
Send us back to the sun
Now I know  I know
We're losing light  our love is dying
Out cold on the floor
Like a fallen star that shines no more
Take  take me back to where it was before
When we were on fire
Fire
Heading down  heading underground feeling wasted
Cold to the bone  so alone I can taste it
Let's light it up
Street's are alive now and everything's bracing
You're on my mind  running in my veins
Fueling the flame  let's start it again (Start it again)

Standing right in front of you
Don't know how to fade in and out
Don't know how to play it cool
We don't have to think it through
We've got to let go
I wanna give you wild love
The kind that never slows down
I wanna take you high up
Let our hearts be the only sound
I wanna go where the lights burn low and you're only mine
I wanna give you wild love
From a runway in Tokyo
There's always something left to lose
But I wanna give you wild love
The kind that never slows down
I wanna take you high up
Let our hearts be the only sound
I wanna go where the lights burn low and you're only mine
