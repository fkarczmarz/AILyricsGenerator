lyrics
"That brought me back to life again
On the dry lands of my heart  you washed away the pain
Now there’s a rhinestone river and it takes me to the sea
The million lights that shimmer when it’s dark inside of me
Before I grow dimmer and I die and go to sleep
I wanna say these words to you tonight
We’re singing  oh
Let’s take tonight and make it for life
We’re singing  oh
Hey  my heart was in a black shade of gray
Until you came and lit your flame
You brought back the colors to my destiny
Now there’s a rhinestone river and it takes me to the sea
A million lights that shimmer  but it’s dark inside of me
Before I grow dimmer and I die and go to sleep
I wanna say these words to you tonight

Thought a little bit of space would help us see it (Us see it)
Now I see it (I see it)
On the bed and I close my eyes
Think about those perfect nights in Phoenix (In Phoenix)
Still feel that (Still feel that)
Sometimes I wonder if we knew it all along
So what are we gonna do with all this love?
And if we have to say goodbye 'cause it's for the best
What are we gonna do with all this love? Yeah

Overly cautious  seems all of my problems
Are magnified when you're in the room
Intoxicated  no way of escaping
This feeling I get when I'm with you
Straight through the middle
Nail in my heart  you're so sharp
On the edge  I am too
I feel it hurt just a little
Searching for higher ground
'Cause I'm better with you
We're so much the same  and almost different
Who is to blame if all of our mistakes leave us
Standing on the right side of wrong?

Feel my breath getting harder
And I know if you're gone any longer
That I could bleed my heart out

Held the world in the palm of my hand

Now I bleed my heart out
If you could stay just a little while longer

When I'm gonna fade away?
Will you sing it back
And know it word for word
Back to your child one day?
Oh child  oh child
I really need your love right now
I'm fading fast
Not gonna last
I'm really stupid
I'm in it bad
Don't even ask
So tell me now
When every star falls from the sky
And every last heart in the world breaks
Oh hold me now
When every ship is going down
I don't fear nothing when I hear you say
It's gonna be okay
It's gonna be okay
It's gonna be okay
It's gonna be okay

Will you show me love as we get older
And I’m falling at your feet
After 30 years of service and the wounds of it are me
Show me love as we grow colder
Let our love provide the heat
That our older bones are missing
But our hearts will never need
There’s a blanket on the sofa that I used to keep you warm
When I find you fast asleep at half past four
There’s a record we keep turning that reminds us of our youth
But there’s still nothing as beautiful as you
Will you show me love as we get older

And the lines to the horizon fade to grey
And all you want is just a little understanding
But the ground on which your standing breaks away
But together we can grow
In my face I feel the sun

'Cause there's hope that we can trade

Before you play with fire  do think twice
And if you get burned  don't be surprised
