And all the things you mean to me
When I find myself believing there's no place to go
When I feel the loneliness inside my heart
You're the answer to my prayer
And you're with me everywhere
You're all I need tonight
Give me shelter from the rain
You breathe life in me again
You're all I need to know
Tonight...
We're trying to find a friend
And only time can tell us if we win or if we lose
And who will stand beside us
When I need someone to ease my troubled mind
You're the answer to my prayer
And you're with me everywhere
You're all I need tonight
Give me shelter from the rain
You breathe life in me again
You're all I need to know
All I need tonight
You're my angel (my angel)
You're the answer to my prayer
And you're with me everywhere
You're all I need tonight
Give me shelter from the rain
You breathe life in me again
You're all I need to know
Tonight (tonight)
You're all I need tonight
All I need tonight
You're all I need to know
You are so lovely
With you standing there
I'm so aware
Of how much I care for you
You are more than now
You are for always
I can see in you my dreams come true
Don't you ever go away
You make me feel like
There's nothing I can't do
And when I hold you
I only want to say
I love you
Ballerina girl
The joy you bring me
Every day and night
Holding you tight
How I've waited for your love
Sometimes I've wondered
If you'd ever come my way
Now that I've finally found you
This is where my heart will stay whoa

I didn't mean to make a fool of myself over you
I only wanted just to love you
I didn't mean to write a love song
I didn't mean to share these feeling I have in my heart
I told myself I could forget you
And as I walk down through the halls
I see your pictures hanging on the walls
Those memories
For all the thing that we've been through
My heart can still feel me and you
Sweet memories
After the pain of losing you
I'm never going to love anybody else the way I love you today
I guess I need to say I'm sorry

You feel there's something wrong
Don't feel like holding on
You better think about it
You say you just can't see
Don't lay that hurt on me
Got something on my mind
Something I've got to find
Can't slow down

Got to keep moving on

You think I just don't care
Too hard to just stay sane

I came across a vision that caught my eye
There was a lady standing right there beside a well
Then the vision went away
I thought that I had lost her
The girl I had been waiting for
I can't believe I just saw her

What is happening here
Something going on that's not quite clear
Somebody turn on the light
The room is hot and that's good
Some of my friends came by from the neighborhood
The people starting to climb the walls
Come on!
Whoo!
Alright
Everybody starts to lose control when the music is right
The only thing we wanna do tonight
Is go round and round and turn upside down

Lived like a King with some of the finest things
One could have large amounts
I made a lot of promises
Some were kept and some were broken
Everytime I fell down on my knees for help
Gods ears were open
And this is what I told him
Please rewrite my life and erase the page
And replace the ending with happily ever after always
Cause I'm missing her
Dear God I'm missing her
(I wish her kisses showered once again)
'Cause her love was the sweetest melody
That my heart could ever sang
(Now that song just doesn't sound the same)
I would trade in all
My glory days and accolades completely
(Just to have her here again)
'Cause what's a big ol'e house and bank account
But life without her near me

Oooh baby

Oh these tears I'm crying are just for you
It'd be so nice if I could sneak you for a moment
To a place where there's just us two
Got a busy day everyday but not today
'Cause I'm here to take that stress from you
So you can just chill and clear your head
And let me do everything for you
'Cause you deserve it
Prepare your meal and make your bed
Willing to switch places with you
'Cause you are so worth it
How would you like to sail away in the Bahamas?
So far out in the sea where nobody can find us
Just the end of the world
'Cause there is no rush
For you to come back and face the rain
'Cause there is plenty sunshine where I'm taking you
And I'm here to reduce the pain
To a place where there's just us two
Got a busy day everyday but not today
'Cause I'm here to take that stress from you

Just to be close to you girl
Oh well ah baby aw
You know I've been thru so many changes in my life girl
Aw I've been up real high where I thought I didn't need anybody
Aw and then again I've been down real low where
There was no one in my life who needed me
Aw and I found that material things I thought had so much value
Aw girl didn't really have any value at all
There was a lonely man
A man with no direction  with no purpose
With no one to love and no one to love me for  for me
Aw girl then you  then you came into my life
You made my jagged edges smooth
You made my direction so clear and you aw woman
You became my purpose my reason for livin' girl
You see you're my heart  you're soul

 me and you
Feeling like you can't go on?
Just remember love will find a way
Time seems like it's passing by
Just believe that love will find a way
I see the tears you cry
I see the pain that's in your eyes
So many times you were so lonely
And no one seemed to care
But if your hopes for your tomorrows
Are drowning in your sorrows
Know your heart will show you the way
Are you trying to find a beginning
Or something just to hold on to?
Always know that love will find a way
Does the world seem so unkind?
Some say we've lost our way
Some say the world has gone astray
But if you know where you're going
There's nothing you can't do
'Cause problems will come
And they will leave you
The world will try to deceive you
But the truth will always be in your soul

Where did we go?

I do love you
Still!
We played the games that people play
We made our mistakes along the way
Somehow I know deep in my heart
You needed me
'Cause I needed you so desperately!
We were too blind to see
But then most of all
I do love you

And I call your name
No one ever made me feel the way you do
Nothing in this world I wouldn't do for you
But now I've got to let go
We don't stand a chance
Maybe it's wiser to walk away and love again
With my tender heart
We don't stand a chance
Knowing that I'm not the one you want
I can't hold on to my tender heart
I never thought I'd be the one
Who would play the fool
