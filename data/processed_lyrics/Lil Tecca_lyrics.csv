 I got five hundred rounds
 honestly
 but it's each to they own
 she hate when I be on my phone
 I got me on my phone
 know that you grown
 I know you a flirt
 tagged not safe for work
 I live with a curse
 I'm rollin' up first
 then I hit the church
 matter how you judged
 out of love
 it's not a punch-in
 it's not a function
 I'm still adjustin' (Yeah)
 why they overreact
 It's like you don't know you a star
 ayy
 I got five hundred rounds
 honestly
 but it's each to they own
 she hate when I be on my phone (Damn)
