"We behaving bad
Fast wine slow wine (we behaving bad)
We behaving bad (yeah)
We behaving bad (here we go huh)
Fast wine slow wine (we behaving bad) (yeah)
Yo! When I was young and my dad had a reefer house
I'd catch a contact and talk like Eek-A-Mouse
Go to school act like I'm pulling reefer out
Kinda funny 'cause I used to freak my teachers out
So much mi go teach ya 'bout
Peace to the one Black Chiney and the heaters out
I ain't talking 'bout this shit they call Coke and vodka
I'm talking 'bout the shit you snort and go ha ha ha ha ha ha ha
I mean just go bonkers
Make the dope boys smile they don't need binoculars
Make a nigga wanna pull out choppas

Bom to the bom to the clang clang clang
Banging on that ass like orangutan (Jesus)
Motherfucker transform to a grown man
And transform again like
(We behaving bad)
Steal my style? I ain't got no reward
Mario Kart
All y'all niggas wanna get like me
All y'all niggas wanna spit like P
Missin' ass niggas wanna hit like me
Meanwhile yo bitches wanna kiss my D
Child Rebel Soldier hit that ass for the combo
AK-47 and the dress on a rhino boom
Commodore like Lionel zoom
Hauling that ass like a new Veyron
Am I wrong?
Riding with my bitch mane all night long
One second I'm here next second I'm gone
That's two in 60 seconds nigga what you want?
Girls on me like they superglued on
My dick like a table you can place food on
Nigga I'm hot like the place Mulan
Bom to the bom to the clang clang clang
Banging on that ass like orangutan
Motherfucker transform to a grown man
And transform again like
(We behaving bad)
BBC ICECREAM skewed on
But I got the Rolls Royce for the Grey Poupon
Now you jealous with your face screwed on
Feeble ass niggas only get booed on
Shitty attitude get pissed and pooed on
Your nerves ain't there for a big dude on
Stompin' that ass until you gone
Hoping that you make it home wit' yo shoes on
I know that I make it when I'm chilling with Stewie
Ask Marc Jacobs what I did for Louis
Sunglasses campaign and jewelry
Ask Alber how he really wanna use me
Comme Des Garçons I ain't usin' that loosely
Look at your forehead sweating profusely
Bom to the bom to the clang clang clang
Banging on that ass like orangutan
Motherfucker transform to a grown man
And transform again like
(We behaving bad)

Tell di gyal dem
Hay algo en ti que no es normal
Y a mí ése algo me encanta
Se ve que no le gusta lo material
A ella es difícil darle
En su juego siempre quiere ganar
No sabe cómo parar
No te dejo de mirar
Buscando huellas para encontrarte
Y tú más desapareces
Su vibra poderosa la quiero entender
Y quería ganar
De lejos la vi rechazando botellas
Le dijeron que Balvin quería conocerla
Pero poco le interesaba

When the sen similla scent reach the senses
It kinda senseless to not see what the sense is in
On trees growing for centuries
Make you can't finish your sentences
And it seems weed has been in my genes
In my jeans I used to stash it in my teens
By any means though
When the greens grow from high grade weed stalks
That make you cease talk ease off
And flu by jack and him beanstalk though

Never got love from a government man
Heading downstream till the levee give in
What can I do to get the money?
Heading downstream till the levee gives in
And my dreams are wearing thin
All I need’s relief
Look at me
I just can’t believe what they’ve done to me
We could never get free
I just wanna be (I just wanna be)
Look at me
I just can’t believe what they’ve done to me
We could never get free

All of my life been wading in
Wonder will it ever end
Waves won’t break 'til the tide comes in
What will I do in the sunrise?

Bring on the hell and high water

And life is but a ride and the downs get ugly

If you wanna grow  we could make everything better
First you gotta trust me  if you try to rush me
I'll go back to rush over like a wave
If you gotta fight it  always tryna ride it
Let it just wash you over like a wave
You see when I'll give the world
Diamonds and rubies and pearls
It's safe to say that I am your girl
Now get a little bit closer  say it to me
Why would you try to fight it?
Something so natural
The waves come  you gotta ride it
If you wanna stay afloat

If you wanna grow  we could make everything better
Tell me that you're only mine
Promise that I'll take the time
Nobody likes a lazy lover
One step forward  two behind
Tell me  am I out of line
For letting it take me over?
Ooh  baby it's outta control
Tell me  coming crashing down
Promise you won't let me drown
Just let it go
Just let it go
If you wanna grow  we could make everything better
Boy  really make me
We could make everything better
