lyrics
"But I'll be there to make you smile
I don't have a fancy car to get to you
I'd walk a thousand miles
I don't care if he buys you nice things
Does his gifts come from the heart?
I'd make it so we'd never be apart
But my love is all I have to give
Without you I don't think I could live
I wish I could give the world to you
But love is all I have to give (Give)
When you talk (When you talk)
Does it seem like he's not
Even listening to a word you say?
I'll try my best to kiss them all away
Does he leave (Does he leave)
When you need him the most?
Does his friends get all your time?
Praying for the day that you'll be mine

But my love is all I have to give
Without you I don't think I could live
I wish I could give the world to you
(Hey girl) Hey girl
I don't want you to cry no more inside
All the money in the world
(Could never add up to)
And I will give it to you
Everything I have is for you
All that I have to give (All that I have is for you)
But my love is all I have to give
(My love is all)
Without you I don't think I could live
(I don't think that I can live without you)
I wish I could give the world to you
(I would give the world to you)
But love is all I have to give
(It's all that I have)
But my love is all I have to give
Without you I don't think I could live
I wish I could give the world to you
But love is all I have to give (to you)
Oh-oh-oh-oh! (I have to give)
Without you I don't think I can live
But love is all I have to give
That's all I got to give
But my love is all I have to give
Without you I don't think I can live
(I don't think I can't live)
I wish I could give my world to you
I'd go anywhere for you
Anywhere you ask me to
I'd do anything for you (anything)
Anything you want me to
Oooh-ooh-oooh-ooh-ooh
(Oooh-ooh-ooh-oooh) Hey baby
I'd walk halfway around the world
For just one kiss from you
Far beyond the call of love
As long as your love's there to lead me
I'd go anywhere for you
Anywhere you ask me to
I'd do anything for you
Anything you want me to
Your love as far as I can see
Is all I'm ever gonna need
There's one thing for sure
I know it's true (I know it's true)
You might also like
I used to think that dreams were just
For sentimental fools
And I'd never find someone
Who'd give their love so true
But I knew the very minute
Couldn't live my life without you in it
And now I want the whole wide world
To know
I'd go anywhere for you
Anywhere you ask me to
I'd do anything for you
Anything you want me to
Your love as far as I can see (see yeah)
Is all I'm ever gonna need
There's one thing for sure
I know it's true (I know it's true)
Hey baby (oh yeah)
I'd go anywhere for you
Anywhere you ask me to (oh yeah)
I'd do anything for you
Anything you want me to
Your love as far as I can see (I can see)
Is all I'm ever gonna need (yeah)
There's one thing for sure
Anywhere you ask me to (I'll do anything)
Your love as far as I can see
Is all I'm ever gonna need
There's one thing for sure
I know it's true
Although loneliness has always been a friend of mine
I'm leavin' my life in your hands
People say I'm crazy and that I am blind
Risking it all in a glance
And how you got me blind is still a mystery
I can't get you out of my head
Don't care what is written in your history
As long as you're here with me
I don't care who you are
As long as you love me
Don't care what you did
As long as you love me
Every little thing that you have said and done
Doesn't really matter if you're on the run
It seems like we're meant to be

I don't care who you are (Who you are)

Don't care what you did
As long as you love me
Yeah-eh-eh!
As long as you love me
I've tried to hide it so that no one knows
But I guess it shows
When you look into my eyes
What you did and where you're coming from
I don't care
I don't care who you are (Who you are)
Where you're from (Where you're from)
Who you are (Who you are)
Where you're from (Where you're from)
Don't care what you did (Yeah-eh-eh)

Where you're from (Where you're from)
As long as you love me
Oh-oh-oh yeah
It's not that I can't live without you
It's just that I don't even want to try
Every night I dream about you
Ever since the day we said goodbye
If I wasn't such a fool
Right now I'd be holding you
There's nothing that I wouldn't do
Baby if I only knew
The words to say
The road to take
To find a way back to your heart
What can I do
To get to you
And find a way back to your heart?
I don't know how it got so crazy
But I'll do anything to set things right
'Cause you're love is so amazing
Baby you're the best thing in my life
Let me prove my love is real
And make you feel the way I feel
I promise I would give the world
If only if you tell me girl

What can I do (you are my world)
To get to you (what can I do?)
And find a way back to your heart?

Sand keeps slipping right through my hands
It was good (Was good)
What we had (What we had)
If it was paradise
Can somebody take me back? (Take me back)
And it hurts (It hurts)
Looking back (Looking back)
If this is for the best

Breathe
Sand keeps slipping right through my hands
The roses you left me
Slowly fading to grey
You're coat on the chair
And the scent of your hair I miss
The clock on the wall
It reminds me of all the better times
When we walked in the park
And we whispered in the dark
And we laughed and cried
And I never knew alone
Wherever you are is home
Without your lips on mine
No the sun doesn't shine
And no I can't breathe
I can't breathe
Your words are a symphony
Music that sings to me
No I can't breathe
I can't breathe
I can't breathe

And no I can't breathe
I can't breathe
Your words are a symphony
Music that sings to me
No I can't breathe

We're not over
We're not over
Without your lips on mine
No the sun doesn't shine
And no I can't...
You know I can't breathe yeah!
Without your lips on mine
No the sun doesn't shine

What if you never smiled at me?
What if I had noticed you too?
And you never showed up where I happened to be
What's a girl like you doing in a place like this?
What's a guy like me doing in a place like this?
What are the chances that we'd end up dancing?
What are the chances?
What if I hadn't asked for your name?
And time hadn't stopped when you said it to me? Oh
Of all of the plans that I could have made

 would you meet me at the chateau?
Did I finally find me a river
That could lead me out to the ocean?
'Cause I've only ever known the kind of love
That leaves you battered and broken
I'm not that kind of person
Who can fall in and out of love with you
That's not what love's supposed to do
I'm not that kind of person
Who can fall in and out of love with you
That's not what love's supposed to do
'Cause it's the only one I've got
'Cause it's the only one I've got
Am I being too open?

And now we're having a moment
Does it make you wanna pack up all your things
And drive away like you stole it?

I never thought that I would lose my mind
That I could control this
Never thought that I'd be left behind
That I was stronger than you (Baby)
(And I) I would bring down the moon and the sun
To show how much I care
Don't wanna lose you now
Don't wanna lose you now
I've got this feeling you're not gonna stay
It's burning within me
The fear or losing of slipping away
It just keeps getting closer (Baby)

Are you still the same or
Did you change somehow?
What do you do at this very moment
When I think of you
And when I'm looking back
How we were young and stupid
Do you remember that?
Just can't let you go
Though everything's been said and done

Instead of moving on I refuse to see
That I keep coming back

Ain't nothing but a heartache
No more lies
Ain't nothing but a mistake

I'll be the light (I'll be the light)
When you feel like there's nowhere to run
I'll be the one
Where you can run to make it alright
Where you can run to make it alright
I'll be the one
To hold you
And make sure that you will be alright
 but the little things
 I like it now
 your body still feels the same
 picking up the pieces
 pretending I don't need ya
 I'ma hold you like nothing has changed
 yeah (Over you)
 oh yeah (What you do)
 oh
 lying in your bed
 guess I will
 yeah (Over you)
 oh yeah (What you do)
 ha)
 oh yeah
 baby (Over you)
 baby (What you do)
 ha)
 oh
 hey
 ah!
 ah
 hey
 yeah
 ah
