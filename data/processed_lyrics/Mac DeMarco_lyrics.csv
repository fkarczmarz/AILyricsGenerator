lyrics
"Gone  gone with my heart  locked inside a cage for you
And what's this that has become  has become of poor old me
Tried  so hard to believe in something that will never be
Never believe in a heart like hers again
Never believe in a heart like hers again
Never believe in a  heart like hers again
Never believe
All  all that I could give  all I had to offer her
Is gone  simply locked away  no longer there to bother her
Now look  look at what's become  what's become of poor old me
Tried  so hard to believe in something that will never be
Never believe in a heart like hers again
Never believe in a heart like hers again
Never believe in a  heart like hers again
Never believe
Never believe in a heart like hers again
Never believe in a heart like hers again
Never believe in a heart like hers again
Trouble is keeping quiet and you know well where your heart goes
Yeah
Don't let the world outside the windowpane get to your head
And hopefully make some sense of all this shit before you're dead
Another day has come and let you down
All of our yesterdays have gone now
Tearin’ up
Lookin' for a shoulder to prop you up
All of our yesterdays have gone now
All of our yesterdays have gone now
All of our yesterdays have gone now
All of our yesterdays have gone
And that don't mean your dream is over
And that don’t make your heart beat slower
Such a shame to complain
When all of our yesterdays have gone away
Holdin' on
All of our yesterdays have gone now
Call me up
When you need a shoulder to prop you up

Such a shame to complain
When all of our yesterdays have gone away
And that don't mean your dream is over
And that don't make your heart beat slower
Such a shame to complain
Knows how I'm feeling and gives me her healing
Daddy won't let me go and that's why I feel so low
You don't know what to do
Afraid she might not love you anymore
And though she says she does
And hasn't lost your trust
Who could that be knockin' at her door?
Must be another one
Must be another one she loves
Must be another one
Must be another one she loves
The feelin' never stops
And neither does the clock
Wishin' for tomorrow today
She still says she's true
So you start comin' to
Just as that old knockin' comes to stay
Must be another one
Must be another one she loves
Must be another one
I've heard you say that this is number one
Another life down another road
Perhaps you're better off to never know
Don't dream of all the ways things could have been
Remember all the faces you let in
Remember all the faces still unseen
There's nothing to cry about
You've always felt it's hard to voice complaints
But what you voice is what will drive your fate
And though things never really got that bad
Dreams of greener grass'll drive you mad
Don't dream of all the ways things could've been
Remember all the faces you let in
Remember all the faces still unseen

You’re no better off
Living your life
Than dreaming at night
This much is true
But it’s still up to you
To take my advice
Let it go
You’re better off dead
When your mind’s been set
From nine until five
How could it be true
So take my advice

Let it go
Getting ready for the day you're born again
Spend some time alone
Understand that soon you'll run with better men
Alone again
Alone again
Alone again
Alone again
Alone
No use looking out
It's within that brings that lonely feeling
Understand that when you leave here
You'll be clear among the better men
Alone again
Alone again
Alone again
Alone again
Alone
Alone again
Alone again
Alone again
And daddy's on the sofa  pride of the neighborhood
My brother's in the ballet  it seems he's got it set
And I'll be up at midnight with my cigarette
Ooh when life moves this slowly
Ooh just try and let it go
Ooh when life moves this slowly
Ooh just try and let it go
Daddy's in the basement  cooking up something fine
While Rick's out on the pavement  flipping it for dimes
If there's anything redeeming  I haven't seen it yet
And I'm still up at midnight  chewing nicorette
Ooh when life moves this slowly
Ooh just try and let it go
Ooh when life moves this slowly
And I'm still reminded
Maybe she's best in dreams
She's still the best I've seen
Dreamin'
Dreamin'
Dreamin'
Out on her windowsill
Baby remember
Maybe I'm out of luck
Maybe it's running still
Dreamin'
Dreamin'
Dreamin'
Come knocking at your door
It's time to realize
You aren't dreaming anymore
And once your life is set to settle down
Take a look around you
No more dreaming to be found
It was you who denied them
And no amount of tears
Could roll back all the years
Bring back all your dreams from yesterday
Once a life believes it's got it set up
A closer look reveals
Just how empty you can feel
Once a dream
Is finally put to bed
You might as well be dead
It was you who denied them
And no amount of tears
Could roll back all the years
You need a vacation
Somewhere that no one ever would dream to go
Somewhere mundane  hop on the train
See where it goes
Finish your ride  hop off and hide
Now that you're finally alone
Honey  you're finally alone
Out in the country  tending to all the pretty cattle
It turns out the cowboy dreams of the city
Who could have ever known?
Hop on a plane  fly out to Spain
Inténtalo  yeah
Pick up your bags  cure your jet lag
Now that you're finally alone
Honey  you're finally alone
Honey  you're finally alone
Honey  you're finally alone
Living day-to-day has been tough
Without her at my side
Simply being alive has been rough
And though she won't be gone forever
There are many times I find it feels that way
And I'm not trying to forget her
Just understand how I'll be feeling on that day
It's just like seeing her for the first time again
It's just like seeing her for the first time again
The time she's not around
But somehow this old heart
Found time to work it out this far
There are times I find it hard to feel that way
It's not inside me to forget her
Just understand how I'll be feeling on that day

There are times I get carried away
Please  don't worry

And I know it's no fun
When your first son
Gets up to no good
Starts freaking out the neighborhood
Really  I'm fine
Never been better  got no job on the line
Sincerely  don't worry
Same old boy that you hoped you would find
And I know it's no fun
When your first son
Gets up to no good
There are times I get carried away

Leave it all behind you
Startin' fresh in someone else's town
And though we may be leavin'
I'll be right beside you
Honey it can be tough
Without your friends beside you
So when you're feelin' rough
Until you come around
So long  darling
Macky's been a bad  bad boy
And when they're preaching
Be sure to change me
Should rearrange me
Or so they thought
So don't go telling me how this boy should be leading
His own life
Sometimes rough but generally speaking I'm fine
If you don't agree with the things that go on within my life
Sort me  place me
Give me a sign
Repeat the mantra
When you're stepping out of line
Give me  a number
Something to be
May help out the country boy
But it won't work out on me

For the beat of a heart
Like hers
Start it over to the rhythm
To the beat of a heart
Like hers
And believe me
I've been waiting for her
Believe me
I've been waiting for her
Listen closely for the rhythm
To the beat of a heart
Like hers
Could I quit it?
Start it over
To the beat of a heart
Like hers
And believe me
I've been waiting for her
Believe me
I've been waiting for her
Believe me
I've been waiting for her
Believe me
I've been waiting for her
The more I come to know myself
The more it seems my love grows for you
And surely I'd be dead  baby
Had I gone with someone else
For this and more  my love's owed to you
K  anytime it feels as though my love has gone away
Got to know your heart  baby
Still so much for me to learn
And as I do  my love stays with you
And surely I'd be dumb  baby
Had I made another turn
Glad the turn that I made was you
K  anytime it feels as though my love has gone away
K  anytime it feels as though my love has gone away
If you really love her
But if your heart just ain't sure
Let her know
Growing by the hour
Love just like a flower
But when the flower dies
You've got to say goodbye
And let her go
Let her go
Let her go
Tell her that you'll be there
If you'll really be there
Separation's supposed to
Make the heart grow fond
But it don't
So tell her that you love her
If you really love her
But if your heart just ain't sure
Let her go

And she’s been good to me
Far as I can tell she’s happy
Livin’ with her Macky
So please don’t take my love away
Let my baby stay

Please don’t take my love away

Feeling lonely
Separated from my one and only

Easy conversation  ain't exactly where we're at

Oh  man
You're making me crazy
Really driving me mad
That's alright with me
It's really no fuss
As long as you're next to me
Just the two of us
And I'm down on my hands and knees
Begging you please  baby

Must be bringing you down
If it’s so
Then come on give this lover boy a try

If you'd always kept it straight  you'd never learn
You'd run the risk of all the risks you take
Don't feel like all the time you put in went to waste
The way your heart was beating all those days
And suddenly it beats another pace
It's not like you'd ever try to forget her
But these days are better without one another
Hey man  so now you've got it off your chest
Your heart can finally get some rest
Same heart that started this whole mess
And although  a broken heart needs time to mend
Yours wasn't ever really broken  was it?
You lose a love  you gain a friend
It's not like you'd ever try to forget her
But these days are better without one another
Without one another
Without one another
One last kiss from her lips
Another dream you're putting down
After all this time  it turns out all you found
Is one more love out to break your heart
Set it up just to watch it fall apart
Another try  another go
Never thought you'd feel this low
Another dream put to bed
After all this time  it turns out all you had
Is one more love out to break your heart
Set it up just to watch it fall apart
One more love out to break your heart
Set it up just to watch it fall apart
Only you can treat me like you do
And only she  only she
Only she chose me when I'm blue
'Cause I'm done crying over her
I'm done crying over her
My hands hurt  I think I'll go lay down
'Cause I'm done crying over her
Here I am  brand new day
That only she  only she
Only she chose me when I'm green

Hell of a story  or is it boring?
Can't claim to care  never been reluctant to share
Passing out pieces of me  don't you know nothing comes free?
What Mom don't know has taken its toll on me
It's all I've seen that can't be wiped clean
It's hard to believe what it's made of me
Passing my life  living it out with her side
Listening closely  hearing her mostly
Can’t shake concern  seems that every time that I turn
I'm passing out pieces of me  don't you know nothing comes free?
What Mom don't know has taken its toll on me
It's all I've seen that can't be wiped clean
No conversation to ease up your mind
And nobody seems to see the outside of it
Preoccupied  and nobody's hiding it
Preoccupied  nobody's hiding it
Preoccupied  nobody's hiding it
Opened your mind  filled it with bullshit
Locked up your heart  without even knowing it
It must be a sign  the days that we're living in
Preoccupied  and nobody's hiding it
Preoccupied  and nobody's hiding it
Preoccupied  nobody's hiding it
We can try this over
Lovin' on the sidelines
Another one of my kind

Just one street on my mind
