lyrics
" he held me screaming in his arms
 is it just alright?
 is that alright?
 I can still see the sun on the water
 I just couldn't help myself
 but I'm better now
 you're oh so fine
 is that alright?
 I can still see the sun on the water
I knew you had spirit
Oh won't you let your colors run
And I don't know why
And I know
Everything is good
Everything's just as it should be
When you're alone with me
Everything is good
Everything's just as it should be
When we're alone
All I wanted was your time
Everything is good
Everything's just as it should be

I'll wait it out ‘til you come 'round
It pays to look up in the big city
Everything moves so fast
It pays to look up
'Cause you don't know what you might see
When you look around
And I know
Everything is good
Everything's just as it should be
When you're alone with me
Everything is good
Everything's just as it should be
When we're alone
I never thought that I would say outside my head
I'm doing things with you I never thought we'd do
I'm seeing into you
And I know
Everything is good
Everything's just as it should be
When you're alone with me
Everything is good
Everything’s just as it should be
When we're alone
All I wanted was your time
Everything is good
Everything's just as it should be
You're alone with me
You're alone with me
You're alone with me
Doesn't mean that I won't try
To set your world on fire every once in a while
We lie on the kitchen floor
Hot air rises and it's going to be hot as hell here soon
We're gonna need some relief
The best that I can
You can keep moving on like you do
The road goes as far as the eye can see
And the flowers in their bed
They're drooping and dying and fading away
This weather's no good for growing things

I'll be there in a New York minute
And get there in our own sweet time
It's hard to catch your breath in the big bad city
If it were me
There'd be no second-guessing
If it were me
You wouldn't have to wonder
If it's worth your time
If you're even on his mind
So meet me at the boardwalk
I'll be there in a New York minute

But we could make it all look easy
So meet me at the boardwalk
I'll be there in a New York minute
And get there in our own sweet time
It's hard to catch a breath in the big bad city
If it were me
There'd be no second-guessing
If it were me
We were rubbing our eyes
Our mouths were dry from the sugar and the popcorn
And we felt a little guilty
About spending that whole sunny day inside
The movie we were watching
About Bonnie and Clyde
They were driving down a backroad
They thought they were home free
The police knew they were coming
They were hiding in the trees
And they shot them down
One hundred and thirty rounds
They shot them down
So we might as well say
What's on our minds
'Cause there's no way to know
When it's your time to go
When it's your time to go
Later we were walking on the streets of Monterey
The trees beside the water
Reminded you of childhood holidays
To a little stretch of beach
Where we could lose ourselves

 you are the first thing and the last thing that I'd see
 put my foot down to the floor
 I feel like I been here before

 oooh
 you were humming to yourself
 I could tell by how you sounded on the phone

When you stumble down those streets tonight
Just know you'll be on my mind
You'll be on my mind
The streets still radiate with heat  we hang onto the summer
Pour me a tall dry Vermouth and take me undercover
Spend another night with you in our sweet disorder
The seaside always fills the air all through the Gothic Quarter
Oh  somehow  I got to walk you home
And oh  I guess I forgot to take it slow
Oh  you take me places I can't go alone  alone
Hey  Catalonia  I can hear you across the ocean
All the storiеs that we left behind  I trust you'rе my alibi

Toll midnight in the churches
Another stroll to nowhere  under olive trees and arches

And oh  I guess I forgot to take it slow

Just know you'll be on my mind
You'll be on my mind
On my mind
A frantic beating in my chest
A panicked reeling in my brain
Perspective lost but nothing gained
I was so stuck inside my shell
Then the ground began to sway
I realized what mattered most to me
When the stars began to fall right out of the sky
And the seas were rising up I had one thing in mind
When the road began to crumble in front of my eyes
There was only one person I wanted to find
The prеcious moments that we shared
You slowed time down inside my head
I wish I'd found this clarity
While I still had you close to me

There was only one person I wanted to find
You were the brightest way
You dropped a stone into the well
We'd wait for the sound it made
It felt like a clean white page
You came along
Showing me all the ways I could fall
You made me feel new
You came along
Showing me all the ways I could fall
You made me feel new
There were people singing opera in the streets
And I kissed you by the fountain in the square
A part of my heart will always be there
Just wanted you to know
The times I feel helpless
Nothing but dark skies
On the nights that seem endless
(Ooh-ooh) You are my daylight
We were watching as the waves came rolling in
You said you were happy here
You were wondering if we'd met when were kids
Did I think that we would've been friends?

Nothing but dark skies

Don't change a thing for me
Don't change for you

Thought I was a certain kind of guy
Strong and silent type  but you got me talking now
Yeah  it's in the way you look at me
I can see that you feel everything I feel
And it's no surprise
When you're this close  every touch is amplified
I don't know when we'll be here again  so I memorize
Every inch of your body  show me every side of you
Yeah  I don't know what tomorrow knows
Where these feelings go
But I plan on being 'round

 you'll know
It felt nice  felt so nice
And it was getting dark  you wrapped your long legs
Around me  I held on tight
Lying in my bed  the unfamiliar sheets
Were so cool on your skin
When your daddy called  said you were at a friend's
And we walked the long way home
Going on my first impression  I recall you wearing white
There will always be another time for us to fall in love
But it never cuts you quite as deep as that first time
You'll find out that the deepest cut is the first time
First times always cut the deepest
Breathe me with your hands  show me a safe place
And can you recognise the look upon my face?
It's on my lips  it's in my eyes
This bar will never break  won't you say it one more time?
Won't you say my name? Won't you say my name?

Two falling sparks  one willing fool

That I would love you from afar

I released my new album  Nation of Two
Which is super exciting and... Loving playing these new songs and
We're playing a lot of new ones for you tonight
As well as some other songs from my first album
This one is a song  is a new one
Is about a relationship that's over
And even though it's over  you don't regret the excitement
And the overwhelming feelings and the fun
Experienced at the timе  it's a song called Like Gold
Time to lеt it go
It won't let go of me
Hanging by a thread
Cutting the cord and then falling back into the
Black 'cause if I don't
If I wait 'til it feels right
I'll be waiting my whole life
Closing my eyes  remember how we were like
Gold  when you see me
Hi  if you need me
Babe  that's the way it was
That's the history
Blue  how we used to roar
Like an open fire

Like the back of my hand knew the roads
I swerved my bike and lost control
Over the handles in the air
A lady who came walking by found me lying there
And the nurse at the hospital said
Now your father is waiting in the next room
We drove so slowly through these streets
In the suburbs of our dreams
At night my father closed his eyes
He saw the new car in the drive
My mother standing in the doorway
And the voice I can hear in my head
Now you know we'll be sleeping in the next room
Now tomorrow is as it is coming 'round soon

See the car turn in the driveway

And I've always been that little boy
And I wait just to watch it fall across your face
Take our time with the sweet delay
I pull you close 'cause the day can wait

Because when I'm in a room with you
That missing piece is found
Nothing can bring us down
It’s like when you're far away from me
I get lost in the crowd
Because when I'm in a room with you
That missing piece is found
I won't waste a minute when you're here
And we're finally in the clear

No ray of sunlight's ever lost

I need to ask her what's goin' on
Are we goin' strong?

Lookin' out at first light
