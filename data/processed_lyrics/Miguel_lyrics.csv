lyrics
"Because I'm afraid of you
Cause I'm afraid of what this could mean
And I'm afraid of what this could do
I'm going to hell with you
Only you can save me I'm a sinner
Only you can save me I'm a sinner
These bittersweet notions of forever
Blossom and find me in my dreams
I'm going to hell with you

I never thought I see that day that you my old girl
Now I'm stuck here hollerin' at ol' girl
Got one  got two  three  four girls
Shotgun in the drop made a right
Hut-one  hut-two  told them **** take a hike
Then it's on to the next—on—on to the next one
Hard to move on when you always regret one
I wonder sometimes
I wonder if I was wrong
Tryna do right by you got me here
Now all I am is alone
'Cause her eyes  and those hips
And that ass  don't compare  at all  no
And at best  all they do is distract me but now
Deep down  when I face it

All I want is you

Now that you're gone  gone  gone
'Cause being your friend is killin' me softly
Hear voices  wonder where I went wrong
It was my fault and the wrong time
I wonder so often  regret gets exhaustin'
'Cause her eyes  and those hips
And that ass  don't compare  at all  no
And at best  all they do is distract me but now
Deep down  when I face it
All I want is you  mmh
All I want is you  now
All I want is you now  sugar
Now that you're gone  gone  gone
All I want is you  ooh-ooh  ooh
All I want is you  now
All I want is you now  baby
'Cause they don't smile  huh  or smell like you
And they don't make me laugh  or even cook like you
And they don't photograph  nah  they don't sex like you
Let's face it (Yeah) I can't replace it (Yeah)
That's why all I want is you now
I hit the club when you left me thinkin' that could heal shit
Tryna celebrate my Independence Day  Will Smith
Baby girl  who I'm kiddin'? Still sick  real shit
All my new hoes seem to get old real quick
And could it be  you everything that these plain bitches couldn’t be?
Is it a sign from the Lord that I shouldn’t be?
Lost in the player way  sorta get old to me
Got me on layaway  girl you got a hold on me
I say  I'm wrong  you say  Come again?
Damn  said I was wrong  look don't rub it in
I got a lot on my mind  got a flock full of dimes
Like a line full of hoes  how they comin' in
Just sayin'  don’t wanna have me then somebody will
I'm playin'  weight on my chest like I body build
I'm prayin'  you ain’t content with tryna do your thang
And come back baby  boomerang  'rang  huh
That's why all I want is you now
All I want is you  now
All I want is you now  sugar
Ooh  ooh
Ooh  ooh  oh
Yeah  now that you're gone  gone  gone
Lay your face on the pillow
Push the covers where they belong
I can't take my eyes off you
We both know what we came here for
To weigh the truth and the lie
Only truth is allowed
Hallowed fate knows no doubt
'Cause your body's ready for war
And my body's built to endure
Make me feel like I've been anointed
You make me feel like I'm a god
Make me proud like I've been anointed

Cool contrails in the sky  yeah
It's breaking news all over TV
We were hit by surprise
Alright
I was at Townhouse down in Venice Beach  oh no
Stealing moments with you know who
We won the war but not a day goes by
That I don't think I shoulda been with you
When the City of Angels fell
When the City of Angels fell
When the City of Angels fell
I was busy letting you down  woman
When the City of Angels fell
When the City of Angels fell
I was nowhere to be found
Alright
A vast shadow cast over my city
I guess they came here looking for trouble
No time for goodbyes

Drinking my favorite tequila (alright)
I didn't text you back that night  did I?
I stayed behind when everyone left fled for Nevada
Hoping to find you in the rubble
Hoping  that I could just hold you for a while
'Cause when the City of Angels fell
When the City of Angels fell
When the City of Angels fell
I was busy letting you down  woman
When the City of Angels fell
When the City of Angels fell
I was nowhere to be found
These moments in vibrant hues
And gun play turns into pillow talk
And pillow talk turns into sweet dreams
Sweet dreams turns into fucking in the morning
We talk street art and sarcasm
Crass humor and high fashion
As we laugh over shot guns and tongue kisses
Pick a star in the sky
We could both say goodbye all night
I wish I could paint our love
These moments and vibrant hues
And gun play turns into pillow talk
And pillow talk turns into sweet dreams
Sweet dreams turns into fucking in the morning
Fucking in the morning
I don't wanna wake you
I just wanna watch you sleep
It's the smell of your hair
And it's the way that we feel
I've never felt comfortable like this

'Less you try and put your back on me then I'ma take it

Ok what's up with it? Just let me set the mood
We talk recent movies and old tunes
Emulate 50 Shades over Jodeci grooves
Come and take this work
Fuck around and be late to work
As the conversation fades let's play you hang up first
I can put you back to sleep if that's a consolation
Fucking in the morning
I don't wanna wake you
I just wanna watch you sleep

Pick up the phone  show me it was real
Pick up the phone
Yeah  I don't wanna put no pressure on ya
I just wanna put a blessing on ya
Since our last undressin' session
I'm not really sure if you've been checkin'
I'm progressin'  I just heard my songs is poppin' out in Macedonia
And even Serbia  I don't mean to burden ya
If you got a man since then  I understand
Last thing I wanna do is get you jammed
'Specially if he's a fan  he'll prolly never wanna hear my shit again
And  I need every single SoundScan
But if you single and you down  then
I'm in your town fiendin' for another round
I was countin' down the days
Been more patient than a Browns fan
Where that chip at?
Prolly on your shoulder 'cause I forgot to hit back
Left you on read  apologies are said
For message never sent  now...

Hello  stranger
It's been a minute since we last kicked it
And by the way  just got in town
And I won't let cumulus clouds all in the sky ruin my vibe
Usually  I don't do this often
But since recruiting isn't an option
Due to unusual rain and thunder
'Cause I got the plug  I made the call for green
I'm talkin' late-night voyeur  let me lay a great time on you
Mmm  say it
I wanna f... all night (say it)
I wanna f... all night (uh-huh  uh-huh)
I wanna f... all night (say it)

And just as I recall  that ass is still amazing
Lovin' shit  you know I'm crazy
So go 'head and pour the drink up
'Cause I got the plug  I made the call for green
I'm talkin' late-night voyeur  let me lay a great time on you
In case my lack of reply had you catchin' them feelings
Know you've been on my mind like Kaepernick kneelin'
Or police killings  or Trump sayin' slick shit
Manipulatin' poor white folks because they ignant
Blind to the struggles of the ones that got the pigment
Lately I've been stressin' 'cause it seems so malignant
I need to feel your essence in my presence if you're with it
I guarantee you won't regret you did it if you come through
I wanna f... all night (say it)
I wanna f... all night (uh-huh  uh-huh)
I wanna f... all night (say it)
I wanna f... all night

The leaves don't change here  so I never saw it coming
Just the cruel rain pouring  you say that it's over
How could it be over  when I never saw it coming?
Sweet California  sour California
Sweet California  bitter California
Sweet California
I should've known better  I should've known better
Cause the leaves don't change here
Heart caught in a riptide  cold Pacific waters
Keep on pulling me under  drowning in my sorrows
Eager waves keep on crashing  you say that it's over
How could it be over? I never saw it coming
Sweet California  sour California
Sweet California  bitter California
Sweet California

The leaves  they don't change here

Too square to be a hood nigga  what's normal anyway?
Too opinionated for the pacifist  too out of touch to be in style
Too broke for the rich kids  I don't know what normal is
What's normal anyway? What's normal anyway?
I mean what's normal anyway? What's normal anyway?
What's normal anyway?
I'm in a crowd and I feel alone  I look around and I feel alone
I never feel like I belong  I wanna feel like I belong
Somewhere  somewhere
I'm in a crowd and I feel alone  I look around and I feel alone
I never feel like I belong  I wanna feel like I belong
Too immoral for the Christians  but too moral for the cut-throat
Too far out for the in crowd  what's normal anyway?
Too involved in my own life to spend time with my family
Too concerned about what others think
What's normal anyway? What's normal anyway?
I mean what's normal anyway? What's normal anyway?
What's normal anyway?
I'm in a crowd and I feel alone  I look around and I feel alone
I never feel like I belong  I wanna feel like I belong
