lyrics
"Now we own stores and fuck the baddest whores
I was on tour with niggas that sold raw
Try to crucify me like I'm Jesus the way she cross me
I'm too bossy and too thorough
Diamonds like water and they jumpin' out the gym
Shootin' like Harden if your head was the rim
Now every move I make I'm in the news with it
Even if I ain't do it they be like You did it!
My teacher always used to tell me You gon' lose nigga!
That's why I never went to school nigga
And why I'm rappin' like I got somethin' to prove nigga
Went and bought the mansion with the pool in it
Move with it 'cause these niggas wanna take my life
No weapon formed against me every time I pray at night
And make 'em fuck their best friends like they was dykes
Reachin' for the Glock every time I play the light
I'm on 12 o'clock every time I play them bikes
I'm gettin' chips off music like Rap Snacks
Wins and losses!

They wanna see me fold
And I will never sell my soul
I'm on some shit that they ain't seen before
And I don't need these whores
The young niggas goin' all out for us
So when you see me out don't ask me about no Nicki
Fuck I look like tellin' my business on Wendy
.40 bust your windows out: Jazmine Sullivan
Sippin' 1942 like it's lean
I done seen all these niggas try to downplay my dreams
So I'ma give it to 'em every time I'm on the scene
Some suckers wanna be me and some suckers wanna leave me
Now every killer in my city tryna look for his ass
Had to starve all day just to get to it fast
Ever since I met Ross and signed the dotted line
Do the math on it!
They wanna see me fold
And I will never sell my soul
I'm on some shit that they ain't seen before
And I don't need these whores
The young niggas goin' all out for us
When you get a dollar they gon' hate
Bought my mom the crib with that gate
They wanna see me fold
And I will never sell my soul
I'm on some shit that they ain't seen before
And I don't need these whores
Tell me how you want it  yeah
Call me and I'm on my way
Tell me that you need me  yeah
I'll give it to you night and day
All day  24/7
Uh-huh-uh
Lovin' the shit out you  fuckin' the shit out you
For seven days straight  and now I can't even live without you
And if we ever broke up  I won't have a kid without you
You forever in my heart  I won't forget about you
I be crushin' you on Monday like it's Wednesday
You pressed about that nigga  what your friends say?
Oh  G63 is what your Benz say
I'm so happy you ain't listen to your friends  babe
Need you right here by my side  'cause out of sight is out of mind
And out of spite you hit decline  but I was hype
I hit your line a few more times than you hit back I'm gon' respond

Tell me how you want it  yeah

Uh  yeah
You be throwin' that shit back like it's a Thursday
I be treatin' you like everyday your birthday
Them hoes ain't fuckin' with you on your worst day
I got you on a new level like what Ferg say
When you fell down  I pick you up
Put on your crown  and lift you up
I put a rock all on your finger  so much ice could push a puck
24/7  what's the 411?
When you see me kneel like Kaepernick  call a reverend
See  I got a milli' in a stash for a weddin'
But I know you in the worst way
Yeah  our anniversary
'Bout to suit up on my birthday
'Cause I know they keep you thirsty
Ain't no playin'  this is us

All day  24/7

What I found out-
I took a vow that from now on
I crush A1 hoes (true)
Rock A1 clothes (true)
Drive A1 whips (true)
And still pour A1 sauce on my shit
I come from the bottom (Poppin the bottles!)
Crushing all these hoes  rocking all this ice
So I'm just riding round in my Rolls  about to get on my bike
Just to touchdown in my hood and I put that on my life
My diamonds all clear nigga  smack my chain you dead nigga
I don't know what you heard  and I don't know what you thought
My new young chick look exactly like Rihanna
Ass like Nicki  but she yellow like Madonna
I take her to the mall  buy her all types of designers
I jump right back like 36  lean hard when I turn the whip
If I ain't have my rap deal  then I still be serving bricks
My gold Role cost 60 racks  my rose gold cost 40

All that champagne  these bitches thirsty
I prolly pull up Roberto over Cavalli
Puffin' on Cali  prolly out in the valley
Sippin' on something drowsy  bitches twerkin' like Miley
Twerk  twerk for a real nigga sellin' work
Promise I won't tell a word
I been on that trill shit  way back
North Philly nigga  but I'm laid back
Get shot in your head drivin' your Maybach
Homey D Clown know I don't play that
Call your dog   I call my dawg and he'll buy a birdy
Try to school me  I'm getting out here early
Mink draggin'  tell PETA I'm swaggin
All these karats like I'm tryna lure in a rabbit (Dag!)
Just to put it (Put it where?) On my jacket (On my jacket)
(What they askin?) What you doin? (What you doin?) Doin' fashion
Okay  I walk with a limp and I talk with a slur
I might wear every single chain and mix it up with my fur
I might get every single drink and mix it up til I blur
I tell the bitch get on my lap  but don't you get on my nerves
I need that bag full of green like a lawnmower
John Doe and all Sean Doe it  and I keep it G
Got her down for it
But if I don't have that rubber on it I feel under dressed
They all Goyard too cause I ain't cheap
Finally Famous Aura Gold is my I-N-C
And I put everything in motion like I-N-G
And when we flyin' private you could bring the gun on with us
I got this freak to 3rd base  she tryna run home with us
And I got comma on comma on comma on comma... on comma
And I ain't talking about no run on sentence
Yeah  nigga hot headed so I need that Chings Chili
Put my P up on her head like that bitch is reppin' Philly
And I wheelie in that pussy like my nigga Meek Milly
On my way to meet millis
Lawyer drafting up the deep deep dealies
I got rich decided that ain't rich enough
Dead Pres  who you diggin up?
Who that nigga that you hating on  but just  can't get enough?

I'm at your house on the hill  I fucked your girl and your neighbor
You thinkin' Khloe don't know me  I'm in the car dashin' haters

And they say bad girls ain't no good
Good girls ain't no fun
I still can't find a nigga that touch that

Never trust but I'm working on it
Fell in love with that ride game
They still think you a church girl
We linking up on your days off
And I still give you that work girl
Do it like that video
Wanted that for a long time
First year we both fronted
We had feelings we didn't show
Second year we couldn't hide it
Funny part they didn't know

'Cause every night I go to sleep  go to sleep
I can see it like a movie in my dreams
Put my face in the dirt on the ground
You can break my body
But you can't lock the soul of a man down (Yeah  uh)
Follow your dreams  not your addictions
How we gon' follow our dreams locked in a prison?
They tried to swallow me whole  God be my witness
Deprive me out of my dreams but I'm relentless
I want the money  ain't never want attention
So I don't pay attention to comments and all the mentions
'Cause they ain't see my vision
I was washin' dishes 'til my rags turned into riches
Glad when it was Christmas
We ain't even barely get presents  but we was gifted
Welfare baby  we workin' with what they give us
Made me some commas  judge still gave me a sentence
No period  city girls don't get scared when it's really real
When your bank account twenty mil' and your house up on a hill
And your fam in the driveway  you walk out and see the grill

My bank account  it was on super-zero
Ain't never panic  I'm a superhero (Uh)
Target my goals and I'ma shoot the arrow
When God turned the heat up on me  he said You De Niro
Play your part  got some brains like the scarecrow
And never ever let your competition take your heart (Take your heart)
Say I believe in myself
When everybody stop believin'  never leave on yourself
They had my back against the wall  I had to lean on myself
Almost made me put my dreams on the shelf  I'm trippin' (I'm trippin')
Laws of attraction  you just think I'm rappin'
I'm just puttin' out the energy so I can grab it
Everything that's in my memory that I imagined
It's finally here  hundred million in a year
I still believe  still believe in you and me
'Cause every night I go to sleep  go to sleep
I can see it like a movie in my dreams
Put my face in the dirt on the ground
You can break my body
But you can't lock the soul of a man down
As I lay (As I lay) me down to sleep (Down to sleep)
Pray the Lord (Pray) my soul to keep (Soul to keep)
Fallen ones  (Fallen ones) rest in peace (R.I.P.)

'Cause I'm back down on my own again
This is the blues I'm playing
When the night is cold and lonely
(This is a Dollar Bill beat)
Was it the money that made me a savage?
Poppin' them Percs and I made it a habit
Totin' them pistols and serving them addicts
Do magic like alakazam
I'm in the kitchen compressin' a birdie
Take out a nine and I sell it for thirty
To light up the city like Meechie in '03
Young nigga but I put it down
We was on it when it weren't 'round
All of sudden niggas wanna come around

When the night is cold and lonely
Gave you the plug
Try to be real with some niggas and put 'em on money
And show 'em some love
I knew you would show who you was
It's only a matter of time before niggas get lined
And hit with them slugs
'Member they told me that we would fail
'Member they said we would see a cell
Down with that semi like Cam Newton
I'm in the field like the NFL
Niggas is sick' and I wish em well
I made a wish in a wishing well
I put a brick in a wishing well
Been through some shit and I'm sick of jail
No disease but I'm sick of cells
Sick and tired of sending niggas mail
Calling niggas just to get a bail
I just seen a nigga get a L
Never coming homeand minute on the phone
Sick and tired of seeing niggas fail
Sick and tired of seeing niggas lose
Sinning like we tryna get to hell
This is my blues
'Cause I'm back down on my own again
This is the blues I'm playing
 boi (Yeah)

Uh  make it out the hood  they say you Hollywood
How dare you niggas tell me that I got it good
Gotta check and treat these niggas like I'm Robin Hood
When it was time to stand up for me  see  nobody stood
And I was lookin' at you niggas  all the ones I fed
Had me grindin' all them nights when you was going to bed
And if you think I owe you something  nigga gon' ahead
Treat you like I never knew you  put it on your head
And I got Papi on my line like  'When you comin' home?'
My mama see it in my face  she know that somethin' wrong
Bodies droppin' in my city all summer long
Out on bail but I still gotta keep somethin' on
'Cause I can't let 'em take my life  you might get left you make that right
When he got left it wasn't right  but he was tryna live that life
I call up Coon to book that jet  we like three deep  we take that flight
Used to land in California to play that studio all night  we stayin' down
For the love of them millions  ain't layin' down
Left you in the hood  what you sayin' now?
And niggas wanted the smoke  you said  Stand down  uh
Cold heart  never get cold feet when the pressure come
It was beef  I had to tell niggas  You better come
Sister said they gettin' over  it's like you lettin' them
Some shit I had to learn my lesson from  uh
Checkin' in  checkin' out  I just had to check you out
2012  it was 50 niggas when I'm steppin' out
Forgot the time you asked me for a check and I ain't lend it out
I ain't even know you was upset  that's what this shit about?
A green piece of paper can turn you to a hater
When you can't bring up one time you returned me for a favor
So I pray these niggas real close  talkin' closer than my neighbors
'Cause I know the signs when niggas switch sides  catch them vapors

Used to be my dawg  you was in my left titty
Scream  Ride or die  I thought you would ride with me
Found out you was jealous  you wouldn't even grind with me
And when I copped the 6 you wanted the 550
See  I look at it like this
What I'm supposed to spend a thousand nights in the studio rappin' my lights out?
Goin' city to city  can't take my son to school when I want to  can't see my mama  my family when I want to
They give a nigga my money  then act like he hangin' with me
I ain't never been sweet
Far as I can remember  every time I went to jail I had to stand up in that bitch by myself
I ain't never even think about a nigga callin' my baby mama to pick my son up to take him to the movies
Go play basketball while I'm doin' this time in the cell
Actin' like I owe you somethin'
See  it hurt my heart to see some of my closest friends turn their back on me about that attention needle
Or a green piece of paper with a slave master on the front of that shit
I used to hear niggas  niggas that I was feedin'  I heard 'em whisperin'  Meek Mill finished
I was like  And damn  I was feedin' you  bro
All I did was keep grindin'
Through the storm  nigga  I'm like Derrick Rose on a 50-point night on a daily basis  nigga
For the love of the millions  royalty over loyalty  never get it confused
I got real friends and family that'll never turn their back on me for the love of the money
I got a homie that's doin' life—he can't offer me no money  he can't offer me nothin' but a friendship and a relationship
I talk to him seven days a week
So don't come to me talkin' 'bout no money shit  nigga
So if you feel some type of way about my money  we goin' to the furthest extent to protect that plate that goes in front of my son on the table  nigga
One love to all my family and friends that stayed down through all the madness
While I had to sacrifice and put it all on the line
One time for my mom and sister that never changed on me  even before I had money
Ride or die  no matter what
Dreamchasers for life  you dig?
Uh  I told niggas stop askin' me where niggas at
If you don't see 'em in the pictures with me  that mean they faded away
I got niggas I distanced myself from  we love each other  it's all love but everybody can't make it
I never had a role model
I was loading gold hollows in my little Glock-40
A little shorty  heart colder than December in the morning
And I think it was December when they swarmed me
Niggas is jealous  fuck can they tell us
With them dreams they try to sell us? Probably why I'm rebellious
To a fraud nigga  I lost niggas when I got paper
It's like more money I made  they got faker
And it's crazy when your best friend turn into your top hater
Wanna roll out on you and smoke you like top paper
Damn  what a feeling when you and your homie chilling
And you know he got thoughts of probably robbing and killing you
Momma said don't ever  ever let them belittle you
And stay away from them haters cause they'll riddle you
Last year was like a bad year
Even though I touched more paper than a cashier
Small circle  I ain't never really 'round squares
They say there's levels to this shit  you niggas downstairs
Different floors for different bulls
Different tours on different jets  my niggas saw
Different city with different bitches and different whores
Sometimes I look in the mirror  Meek Milly  this your car?
Look at your arm  check out your neck  look at your charm
And to think my niggas started off with cooking raw
When it was hard the coach told me to get the ball
I step back for the three  watch it go swish and fall
And that was and-one  they thinking how we get this far?
We was just down by three and they thought we took a loss
They couldn't D me like Earl Boykins  I'm sticking soft
Tried to pick me off like Champ Bailey but I'm Randy Moss
And I ran it all for the touchdown  what now?
Gold AP all bust down  fuck clowns

My heart getting cold  and the streets getting colder
They said I wouldn't make it no way
I think my heart getting colder  my heart getting cold
Told them I would make it one day  only Lord knows
Dedicated  determinated and disciplined
When Diddy  Hova  and Baby talking  I'm listening
When I be in the jungle  the Devil be whispering
Slugs flying by me I hear them  they whistling
That was a close call
Stand up nigga so I won't fall
My teacher told me I would never go far
Seen him last week  he was my chauffeur  I was like told y'all
Mommy was a booster  daddy was a shooter
So they couldn't blame me when I went and copped a Ruger
Looking at my homies  see the ghost of Freddy Krueger
Cause if he catch you sleeping he's gon' knock out your medulla
Oblongata  I'm a father and my son don't see a lot of
If I don't get he gon' probably end up with a chopper
In a field out in Philly do you feel me?

Getting high even though it might derail me
And I won't ever let these bitches see the real me  do you feel me?
Times change like the Rollie did

Ayo  it gets fucked up when your own family start calling you up
Shit  money's the root of all evil
Family start telling you you acting different nigga
You're goddamn right I'm acting different
With all this motherfucking money

Your mother  your father  that shit hurts you to the core man
When they start acting like something that you ain't never motherfucking seen
You done grew up motherfucker
They gave birth to you  know what I'm saying?
You got raised  you done played in the park with them
This money thing  this shit will fuck you up man

You sure you want this son? You sure you want this money?
You sure you want this fame? You sure you want this power?
Shit have your own mama talking to you like you ain't shit

Don't let this money bring us down
Shit  everybody eats B  everybody eats  everybody eats

And them streets all night like we ain't have nowhere to live
I remember Sundays we ain't have nothing but Liv
Thirty thousand was the tab and you ain't have nothing to give
I ain't trip  I ain't trip  I pour bottles  I ain't sip
I let niggas shine bright  you still act like I ain't shit?
Let you have them little hoes  they was all on my dick
And your main wanted to fuck me nigga  I ain't hit
Twenty chains  eight watches  can't fit on my wrist
When I speak about them things I never said it's my shit
I said it's ours nigga and when you're ready we're gonna ball nigga
Like Kobe Bryant  Metta Peace and Gasol  nigga
But I know just what I saw nigga
It was envious  you looked sideways and I remembered it
The reason that my heart's cold now on some December shit
You used to give thanks for giving on some November shit
Talking about the twenty-fifth  matter of fact the twenty-sixth
Maybe it's the twenty-eighth  fuck it though my money's straight
As long as Papi smiling
I'mma be on airplane mode flier than a pilot
I've seen it  I've seen it
Jealousy in your eyes  I swear that look was deceiving
And I was surprised man I ain't want to believe it
You said you would ride but shit  I know you ain't mean it
But yeah nigga I've seen it
My heart getting cold  and the streets getting colder
They said I would't make it no way
I think my heart getting colder  my heart getting cold

If you got enough cigars we can all smoke
Ain't nothin' all good when you all broke
So we could never be equal
Never bite the hand that'll feed you
Never fear a man if he bleed too

When she walked up to that casket seen her son and fell down
I drop tears for my niggas that ain't here
And still think about you even though that it been years
'Cause half the niggas that I grew up with is all dead
All this pain and all this stressin' I should have a bald head
'Cause when my Aunt Rhonda died she looked Tak in his eyes
Prolly part of the reason we drink and we get high
When I find the nigga that killed my daddy know I'ma ride
To let you know that I don't feel you nigga
So when I see you nigga it's gon' be a homicide
You made me man of the house and it was grindin' time
So I'ma let this flame hit you just to let this pain hit you
And for all them cloudy days I'ma let this rain hit you nigga

Death to anybody that oppose my spirit
My future looking brighter than this rose I'm staring at

So I went and bought me a Dawn and flipped that hat to the back
Fuck 'em
Shoot a pussy nigga in his head if he cross us
Take that shit to trial if the feds making offers
Streets calling and they said they want some real shit
Young bull looking like he hit a real lick
'Cause we was fucking up them dishes in my grandmama kitchen
When I had a foreign them bitches know I ain't see them bitches
So I'ma ball on 'em
And all my niggas stayed down with me
Know I be there if they call on me

Made it to a nine and we litty
