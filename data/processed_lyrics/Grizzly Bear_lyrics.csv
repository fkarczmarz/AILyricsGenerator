"Across the wasteland
Forever gone
They're home and walk along
Plod ever onward
Across some tundra
The light is long
But it's not long before it's gone
Well fine
It calls you back to mind
This time
Too young and thoughtless
To comb your memories
I know it's wrong
Just give until it's gone
Some tired mantra
Calls ever onward
Shout it loud
Just make it up somehow
Well alright
You might also like
And it'll call you back to mind
This time
That all you trust is a cynical phrase
When all you hope is that everything breaks
No wrong or right
Just do whatever you like
No wrong or right
Just do whatever you like
Tell me it's all just a lie
You can't scare me none
A staged race has no thunder
This is the case of our blunder
It's a fire for what?
Time for faith we thought
About face  makes me wonder
And in this case  there is no thunder
A bit of grace in our blunder
It's a fire for what?
Time for faith we thought
It's a fire for what? (For what?)
Time for faith we thought (We thought)
It's a fire for what? (For what?)
In a bedroom  a telephone
You made a call and I just stood by
I stripped the sheets and emptied out the sty
And the crowds that light the carnival are
Calling us home  calling us home
And all we want's another voice
Even wasting my time with you
Doesn't matter if I think it through
You took the car around another bend
Ran it in the ground  let's pretend
And the crowds that light the carnival are
Calling us home  calling us home
And all we ask  another voice
I can't get out of what I'm into with you
I can't get out of what I'm into with you
I can't get out of what I'm into with you
It bares teeth extra sharp that'll cut you in the heart
It attacks really quick  try and fight it with a stick
There's no use  give it up  this is life and this is love
You are my alligator
Every moment brings a bitter choice
The knowledge you can't win with what remains
Walk beside your shadow life
Lay your body on the burning ground
That separates this mind from all that's passed
Appear tame  it shows (shows)
Please don't feign  the ropes (the ropes)
Always the same  I know (know)
I'm shooting them myself  I should have made it matter
I'm shooting them myself  I should have made it matter
(I'm shooting them myself  I should have made it matter )
Chance and sow  nothing changing
(I'm shooting them myself  I should have made it matter )
There's no time to go (to go)
Through the designs we know (we know)
Never mind  although (although)
Maybe this time  we'll grow (grow)
I'm shooting them myself  I should have made it matter
I'm shooting them myself  I should have made it matter
(I'm shooting them myself  I should have made it matter )
Chance and sow  nothing changing

Hold on tight with
You left me adrift
Growing inside of me
Never ever letting go
Medicine is not what I need
Inhale your older self
Cut it up and let it go
Focused on the point that won't be found
Moving slowly with clear resolve
What's out in front of you?
A black sheet
A perfect man is not hard to find
You'll never know the feel
To be a good guy inside
A panorama of all our faults
Looks the same to me
 darling
 darling
 darling
 darling
 darling
We'll drop her down to the bottom
We'll drop her down like she's nothing
And the water is all
Oh  the water is still in a wilder deep
We'll swim around like two dories
We'll swim around like two dories
Let loose in the bay
We'll miss the eddy
There is no plenty
Even keel already  go
I can't be here all hours (Oh  such a riot)
I can't discern this trouble (Oh  what a riot)
I can't be here all hours (Oh  such a riot)
I can't describe
I can't be here all hours (Oh  such a riot)
I can't describe this problem (Oh  what a riot)

Dishes and time
Just let it go
Cords in a bind
I know  I know
Knots that we make
The doors won't close
Fatal mistakes
The pipes all froze
Let's recreate
Just let it go
An easier time
Because I still can't find you
There is time  so much time
There is time  so much time
All of the kids on the waterfront shyly raise their hands
Done asking for your permission  please understand
If we're all faltering  how do I help with that?
If it's all or nothing  then let me go
If we're all faltering  why'd I help with that?
If it's all or nothing  then let me go
There was time  it took time  impossible
There is time  so much time

Done asking for your permission  please understand
If we're all faltering  how do I help with that?
If it's all or nothing  then let me go
If we're all faltering  why'd I help with that?
Maybe you can fix that
My chest hurts a lot tonight
I fell on a car again
Maybe you can fix that
I fell on a car again
Nothing ever feels the same
Maybe you can fix that
Nothing ever feels the same
Come again all over me
I swear I'll change just wait and see
And if I don't please make amends
With everything we had again
I swear it was just a game
I have to fix that
I swear it was just a game
Come again all over me
I swear I'll change just wait and see

 hands in the middle
 another juggle
 can't connect it
 nine in a wreck and
 motion insolvent
 I'll just be cleaning
Tangled up in a pile
It's early
Make no sound
Living in a pile
It's chaos but it works
Planes flying overhead so early
Dreadful sound
Four cypresses seen from a neighbor's yard
No memory
Planes flying overhead so early
Make no sound
Four cypresses torn from the roadside
Great thundering noise from the hillside
Some thousands of years built it up
Some crumbling form to be torn down
Living in a pile
Tangled in a pile
Fathers and keepers packed in that crowded room
Upcountry drifters in permanent repose
(Eyes on the lost sons  trained in the tricks of the world)
Strung out and restless until the feast arrives
The only ride in town
Object of all desire
Our fears that make us cruel
Object of all desire
The only ride in town
Object of all desire
This frontier life
The sound of nothing
Wasting time
There is no hiding
All is forbidden  all is forgotten
The only ride in town
Object of all desire
Our fears that make us cruel
Object of all desire
The only ride in town
Object of all desire

I have nothing left to hear
I'm chasing all the words
But everything you say I only see
But honestly it's fine
And when I mention how I love you
It's all I do
Even as I stray
We have the cold to keep
I'm not sure I still believe
My most is nothing more
Than a place we've been before
We'll draw and drag it on
I'm telling you I'm trying to hear this out
I want nothing more to doubt
A little bit of shame
Which of your selves is truly gone
Come help me on
To let lie what's done
In some great beyond
You're still there still as you were
You might also like
At the end of the line
It's as if there's no time at all
Nothing left to win
Every pleasure burned to the wick
Content to be alone
A quiet picture drawn each day before it ends
To remind me once again
Why I'm even here
Which of your selves is truly gone
Come help me on
To let lie what's done
In some great beyond
And it felt like a kiss
He hit me
But it didn't hurt me
He couldn't stand to hear me say
That I had been with someone new
And when I told him
I had been untrue
He hit me
And it felt like a kiss
He hit me
And I knew he loved me
If he didn't care for me
I could have never made him mad
But he hit me
And I was glad
And it felt like a kiss
He hit me
And I knew I loved him

Return  don't make me beg

And they'll try  they'll all try
To keep us apart
But yes we can
You brought us this far
We'll do what we can
Return  don't put me on
Return  don't make me beg
And they'll try  they'll try

You think it's alright  you think it's alright

He always had his quiet corner
Pride of my countrymen
My little brother will be born again
Just give us back our quiet corner
Pride of my countrymen
My little brother will be born again
Just give us back our quiet corner
Now go back to the other side of my bed
I'll go back to the place where you get started
I could hear all your words echo on down
And then my heart rate dropped to a crawl
Move too fast
Here we are
Can't let go
Take the past
Own your scars
Let it show
Could I ask of you not to cut into me
Dividing all of my body for me
I was left here to go through all the pieces
Nothing more to spare
I keep looking for reasons to come 'round
To make sense of your internal row
But it's a maze and there's nothing to be found
It just leads me away from my end goal
Move too fast
Here we are
Can't let go
Take the past
Own your scars
Let it show
You might also likeLike a rogue wave you
Wash right over me
Losing all sense of what my body could feel
I was able to drift away from here
I have lost all control
The cipher walks alone
The cipher lies so long awake
She can't help
One night to lie so long awake
Just thinking
Just thinking
Rush of wind passing over me  restless night
Restless night
Restless night
My love's another kind (My love's another kind  another kind)
My love's another kind (My love's another kind  another kind)
My love's another kind (My love's another kind  another kind)
And I can't find the harp
I don't know where it's gone
I've looked everywhere Mr. Forbes
But I can't find your clamshells
Your file or your drill
And your sheepskin-lined coat is eluding me still
I've looked in the chest where I thought it should be
I've looked everywhere Mr. Forbes
But I can't find the  and oh why oh why
Can't I think what I did with that ol' skill and die
And of course you can't go without that
I should have never tried
I took the cake
Finished every slice
I moved away
Still paying off the fines
For every day
I stare at my face
Looking through my eyes
I move at a pace
That I cannot survive
I'm holing away
I do it all the time
Let love age
And watch it burn out and die
I woke to the sound of dogs
To the sound of distant shots and passing trucks
We walked with the mourning sound
It's the sound of distant shots and passing trucks
We walked with the mourning sound
It's the sound of distant shots and passing trucks

I'll own our fate
Could never deny
This isn't a place

And watch it burn out and die
We walked with the mourning sound
It's the sound of distant shots and passing trucks
We walked with the mourning sound
It's the sound of distant shots and passing trucks
We walked with the mourning sound
I pick up a pen
I write your name down
With a sense of dread
Could see you for an hour
Conversation stalls
And after so long
There's nothing really there
Face to face
We'll watch our bodies break
Not a care in the world
That's the way you play
Face to face
But you left me broken
We'll watch our bodies break
But you left me helpless
Not a care in the world
That's the way you play
Half a mile away
Could see you every day
We never go there
And yet I don't care
With every passing day
Our history fades away
And I'm not sure why
There's nothing left to say

Makes up for such short goodbyes
You can't come home again
Each time it's different

Fall away while you're asleep

Baby it's a long way to South America
Every option I have costs more than I've got
All I have to give
Seems to be all over you and everyone else
I guess I'm guilty spreading thin with my love
Surely we'll be alright
Make a decision with a kiss
Maybe I have frostbite
And when I shuffled on back home
I made sure all of my tracks in the snow were gone
Tissue and bones it was a tryst
This isn't a gunfight
Checking it off of my list
Unable to rewrite
My love's another kind
From the first morning light
I can follow along
Chance to stumble and find
What turns out to be wrong
And my love's another kind
(My love's another kind)
You can't talk to me now
You can search for a while
When you're rambling around
But when push comes to shove  this is getting old
I wouldn't have it any other way
No  I wouldn't have it any other way
No  I wouldn't have it any other way
And when you call I'll be there
There
I wouldn't have it any other way
No  I wouldn't have it any other way
The sky took hold
Of all my little daily fears
They never seem to go
A dusty vista
You hunger for the core
I never meant to take it so far
A mirror never shows
Who I am beneath the surface
Hiding out so long inside my mind
Every day I stay blind to it
Habit comes and tears me open wide
All the time
Your heart is racing
The time just froze
And left me with little doubt
That there's anywhere to go
I'm pushing forward
To leave this home
I never meant to stay so long
My reflection never shows

Since I was a young boy it was always there

Just wandering free
Though I'm far gone
You sleep nearer to me
If I could find peace
If this night leaves
But I can't help myself
So I'll walk out
These wandering dreams
Up the north road
Dressed gold and green
If I could lie still
As that great hill
But I can't help myself
Collapsed here on the stone
Delivered to this place
A vision dark and cloaked

Made me dizzy when I woke
And I live to see your face
And I hate to see you go
But I know no other way
Than straight on out the door
And I can't help myself
And I can't help myself
 a great divide
 a small respite
 it's fine
 I'll just deny
Our haven on the southern point is calling us
And faced with all the obvious she'll carry us
In regards to the last word
It's not the last you'll hear
I'd never find any other

I'll be sure to try and explain myself to dispel
Blame it on the day
Blame it on the day
Step down  just once learn how to be alone
Step down  just once learn how to be alone
Come get what's lost  what's left before it's gone
But what makes each step worth the time and regret still shows
In the cradle of my unruly jest you belong
Take it as it is
Make another fist
Step down  just once learn how to be alone
Step down  just once learn how to be alone
Step down  just once learn how to be alone
And lean on
Your tired hands that crawl and grasp
The soft ground
By the look on your face
You set out on a path
Never to arrive
By the look on your face
The burden's on your back
And the sun is in your eyes
Stretched out  far and wide
The light that scorched the sand
So bright  so long
I'm never coming back
Every stone and every step (Every stone and every step)
I won't recall
Emptied of every thought (Emptied of every thought)
Just soft ground

It overflows  it overflows
It always runs
It overflows  it overflows

Silver and silent
Endless abundance overflows
Silver and silent rushing on
Endless abundance overflows
Always surrounds you  always glows
Look on your face
Burden's on your back
Sun is in your eyes
Stretched out  far and wide
The light that scorched the sand (Sun is in your eyes)
So bright  so long
I'm never coming back (Sun is in your eyes)
So bright  so long
This has got to end next time you're needing more
They can take it up with me any time
You're needing
Try giving me a chance to get out
I want it
There ain't nothing wrong
Every time I got it home
I could take one look at the things that we started
But you know that I lost that key that promised home
Give a little more as your eyes grow colder
Take the sheets from the bed
Throw them all to the fire
Watch the room light up
As the flames grow warm and tired
Try giving me a chance to get out
I want it
There ain't nothing wrong
Every time I got it home
You might also likeI could take one look at the things that we started
Check again to see
Leave me with no words
And I know I've made it all a lie
And I always want to rescind
The floodgates need repair
There's nothing there besides
And I want to hide it all away
Taking back all of the silly things I used to say
And I'll give you all of my time
Because I'm foolish and never know how to resign
One that makes no sense but it feels good anyhow
And I'll leave it all as it should be
You always make it alright
Is that the way it is?
Let's get along again
Even though you moved around the bend
Why is that the way it is?
The morning always shows all
I wanna show you my best side
I wanna be the guy who's right
I want you to see things clearly
I wanna make it alright
Don't you be so easy
Don't you know that I can make it better?
Don't you ever leave me
Don't you feel it all come together?
Don't you be so easy
Don't you know that I can make it better?
Don't you ever leave me
Oh-oh-oh
Save up all the days
A routine malaise

Where does that hound run?

Please make your mind up
Is there anything left at all?
Everything all at once
And I might
Leave you two times
So dark my eyes
Never leave the light on
Please make your mind up
Weary when I do us wrong
But we try
Everything all at once
But I might
Leave you two times
So dark my eyes
Cloistered from yourself
You never even try
Best just lie down
And close your eyes for once

You could beg for forgiveness as long as you like

And what was left?
A perfect cleft
We all fall through
While you wait on the answers that I'll pretend to find
Keeping up with the motions still occupies our time
You could hope for some substance as long as you like
Or just wait out the evening and always ask me why
So I'll ask you kindly to make your way

No surprise  this is often how it's done
Lately  it's about all I can take
I will move  mend and mold this break
Shell with another crack
I'm small  but I can keep track
Too soon  everyone just step away
I'm sure this isn't the last play
Take it all in stride
Speak  don't confide
We barely have a case
It's done before we try

And even then I can't trace
You're walking away
I put my ears to the ground
Always pushing down

I found the worst half in me
I'm cut off at the knees

Against your words and beliefs
I didn't want to freeze

Never seem to see (And why?)
Do I always feel it all the same
The blisters in my eyes (Recite)
A guide that has only led me stray
And even as I limp (you smile)

Never seem to see (And why?)
