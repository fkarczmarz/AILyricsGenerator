lyrics
"Cut from the cloth of the winter's cold
Bound by the voice that no one hears
I've been around in a way for years
Stray from the heart the more that you know
All gussied up with no place to go
Tableside with one of your dreams
Get what you want and not what you need
Parlor games and 6 o'clock news
Hands of a stranger touching you
Wide awake encased in a dream
Everything is not as it seems
All your time is heaven sent
Days and nights all start to blend
It's not like this town to set you free
You know what this is
Miles away from places you have been
The call was made to pull the shades
The start of something new
Still nothing makes me feel the way

The ones they say have come here before
All gather 'round the corridor
I can't seem to place your name
Know the face that I can't explain
The light inside has lost its glow
You know what this is
Miles away from places you have been
The call was made to pull the shades
The start of something new
Still nothing makes me feel the way
The seasons change
My mind erased
The stars all fade
But one remains the same
Unveil the face
Only to say
Nothing takes the place?
Whine and whine and whine  weep over everything
Bloody Mary breakfast busting up the scene
Brothers fighting  when's a baby gonna sleep?
Hidden ship that sails away
Said it's a culmination of a story
And a goodbye session
It's a tick of our time and the tick in her head
That made me feel so strange
It's a one in a million
Oh  it's the rolling of your Spanish tongue
That made me wanna stay
Oh  she's only seventeen
Whine and whine and whine  weep over everything
Bloody Mary breakfast busting up the scene
Brothers fighting  when's a baby gonna sleep?
Hidden ship that sails away
Said it's a culmination of a story
And a goodbye session
It's a tick of our time and the tick in her head
That made me feel so strange
It's a one in a million

I could call you baby  I could call you dammit
It's a one in a million
Oh  it's the rolling of your Spanish tongue
All I ever needed
All I ever wanted
Too dumb to surrender
She shakes
Like the morning railway
Checking me out
Someone on her shoulder
The lamp
Flickers in the bedroom
She must feel as awkward
Whorehouse Arizona
Now go
Stand up to a giant
Say that I'm a fighter
Too drunk to remember
Too drunk to
Shake hands
My face
Staring on the pavement
Tasted something awful
I hate when that happens
She waves
Thinkin that it's sexy
She must be plum crazy
I kind of think I like her
The boys come out
That's where we like to play
Wanna tag along? I said No way.
One drop dead high
A price you're gonna pay
Been around the world  been around the world
I stormed the gates inlaid in pearl
(Been around the world  been around the world
Been around the world  been around the world)
All around the world all around the world
I lost myself and found a girl
(Been around the world  been around the world)
Keep dancing  like it's ya last time
With softened eyes  swimming in delight
When the curtain falls  I'm on your scene
What sweet surprise sashay to me
Been around the world  been around the world
I stormed the gates inlaid in pearl
(Been around the world  been around the world

If you get the chance
We're going to spit on the rivals
All I want to know
Is how far you want to go
Fighting for survival
Underneath the stars
Where we parked the cars
Ain't showing signs of stopping
Pretty little girls
Naked to their curls
Ready to lay in a coffin
If you want to go
I'm going to go
I've got a fire burning
Go on take my hand
When we see the band
Baby's going to be a big one
When we see the lights
And we hear the fights
It's going to be a stunner
I've got something here
If you give me one more beer
I'm going to call the runner

Everybody's been here at least once before
But we've been here more
Your heartbreak rolls down the window
I've seen it all go and come back around
And I've heard the sound
The tip of your tongue  the top of your lungs
Is doing my head in
I said love don't mean nothing
'Less there's something worth fighting for
It's a beautiful war
When I hold the warmth of your body
There is nobody that I'd rather hold
Shattered and cold

Stop lights are swaying and the phone lines are down
Floor is crackling cold
With the moon I run
Far from the carnage of the fiery sun
Driven by the strangle of vein
Open up your eyes
I see a storm bubbling up from the sea
And it's coming closer
And it's coming closer
You shimmy shook my boat
Leaving me stranded all in love on my own

Hand over your heart  let's go home
Everyone noticed  everyone has seen the signs
I've always been known to cross lines
I've never ever cried when I was feeling down
I've always been scared of the sound
Jesus don't love me  no one ever carried my load
I'm too young to feel this old
Is it you
Is it me
Or does
Nobody know

It's a comeback story of a lifetime

Are all blinded by the light
There are eyes in every corner
Bloated brains and rotten smiles
There are coats of many colors
Flying high up in the sky
Look at all these shattered faces
They all look so out of place
They've got nothing left to live for
They'll be dead before they wake

Whole new kind of feeling is on the way
I'm not scared of knowing
If we’re ever getting out
We could be here forever without a doubt
Time is often higher learning
I'm still barely making grades
Just about imagination anyway
We are circling the wagons
Lining up in single file
Members of the jury are standing trial
Waiting on a memory
Said if you love me and you're willing to dance
We could take it to the high sеas

The only one you see
And don't you let those tears quench the thirsty ground
And don't you be so scared that you can't make a sound

Fickle freshman  probably thinks she's cooler than you
A hay ride at 5  everybody's coming around
So go press your skirt  word is there's a new girl in town
I call shotgun  you can play your R&B tunes
The fellowship time  it always comes a little too soon
The land of the creeps  freshened up from baby-faced shave
Put your eyes on me and I know a place where we can get away
Just say  I want you
Just 'xactly like I used to
'Cause baby  this is only bringing me down
Homeboy's so proud  he finally got the video proof
The night vision shows she was only ducking the truth

In the dark of the night  I could hear you calling my name
With the hardest of hearts  I still feel full of pain
So I drink and I smoke and I ask you if you're ever around
Even though it was me who drove us right in the ground
But all the while  I was dreaming of revelry
With the wind in my back  I don't ever even bat an eye

Paleness of the old moonlight
Everything just felt so incomplete
Dreaming of revelry
Dreaming of revelry
Dreaming of revelry
Crushed by the crown of the wandering man who was never coming back
Stuck on the line spending all of his time with his back to the throne
With the flash of the round everybody in town said Leave it alone
Your heart will never say so
Your heart will never let it go
My heart will never say so
My heart will never let it go
I got caught in the middle of a hurricane fight facing the ground
Beast of the wild with a porcelain smile as it passes around
The truth in disguise from the billowing eyes isn't working on me
Don't you think you gotta give
Give me something I want

And I was searching for a woman who was willing to love
So I could take her like a woman
I was looking for a bad girl looking for a bad boy
Someone who could tangle the night away
I've got the eyes on me of a jealous man
I'll break down like a woman
I'll break down like a woman
I've been several miles and plenty more
And I found myself face-first on the floor
Searching for something
But never finding something
I'm just trying to get myself back home
And get a little one

The kiddie-like play

Talkin'
You
Your sex is on fire
The dark of the alley
The breakin' of day
Head while I'm drivin'

Soft lips are open
Them knuckles are pale
Feels like you're dyin'
You're dyin'
You
Your sex is on fire
Consumed
With what's to transpire

I used to see you every day
I danced around your folk and soul
I danced to all your fucking soul
I left you with your nose a-bleedin'
And your toes a-creepin' around
Hand my down my pants
And get me off this street
I'm passed out in your garden
Soft
So I'd pop myself in your body
Behind the fringe of a whiskey high
Mutilating cat-like eyes
You try to drag me into your bohemian dancing
You let your perfect nipple show

Looking for a good time lover
A right now man
Running like bulls of Pamplona
Try as I might to control you
You're like smoke in my eyes
Closed every time
Face of a starchild
Never seen a bad moon rise
It's the right time now
Time away from here has never felt so long
Find your souvenir and make your way back home

Working the floor on the weekend
No one can spin it like we can
No time to explain
You put a face to the name
The weight of the evening
I can be your good time lover
Your right now man
Time away from here has never felt so long
Quiet in the air never too far gone
Chasing through the night out there on your own
Find your souvenir and make your way back home

Better late than never (Never)
This is just a taste
The good vibrations all over you
Act like you mean it
You mean it
You've got a story you never tell
I've never seen it
Seen it
I see through smiles on every face
I don't believe it
Believe it
With a kiss as unclean as the words that you say
I don't mind sentimental girls at times
Your flags are flying across the plains
I've got a secret picking in my brain
I wanna see you
See you
The exit sign is on my face
I just wanna be there
Be there

Taper jean girl  with a motel face
Aha  shake
Bury your eyes in a secret place
Aha  shake
Black as night on a summer day
Cunts watch their bodies  no room for make-up
I think he's tasted  tasted the watcher
Heart  Heartbreak
Knocking 'em down like the seventh grade
Heart  Heartbreak
Cigarettes and song with a winter's chafe

Keep like my daughter and a run away

Heavy the load you tow
And the red horse is always close
And the fire don't burn below
Two hundred miles to clear
Chasing a sound I hear
When the call brings them all to tears
And the hopes they all turn to fears
And they're walking around
With their heads in the cloud screaming
Must catch the bandit
Reckless abandon
Rundown and stranded
Must catch the bandit
Tracks in the dirt for days
Sniff out the fire ablaze
And it carries a heavy weight

You'll be the one to always complain
All out of fags and I just can't wait
Cancel the thing that I said I'd do
I don't feel comfortable talking to you
Unless you got the zipper fixed on my shoe
Then I'll be in the lobby drinking for two
Golden fallen heart
Fresh off the plane in my fuzzy rush
Everyone's gathered to idolize me
I hate the way you talk your Japanese scream
It's been too long since I left the shed
You kick the bucket and I'll swing my legs
Always remember the pact that we made
Too young to die but old is the grave

Thinking about a better day
When you had it in your bones

Persian ivy running widly
Ashes left behind
Come a little closer  come a little closer
Closer now to the edge
Winds are blowing  fires glowing
Dancing in your head
Grand occasion conversation
Light the crowded room
No one knows which way we're going
But we'll get there soon
Run from the mountain  poison the fountain
Just for the peace of mind
Back of the alley  they seem to rally
All people of their kind
Close your еyes and what do you see?
Is it a man or masked machine?
Is thе world I belong to just a shade of light?
It's just time in disguise

Cheap trick hookers are hanging out
At the bar near the Greyhound station
And the bare-chested boys are going down
On everything that their mama believes
Pack of smokes and a little bump of cocaine
Help you feel not so strange
Unless somebody's standing near
She's all tied to a chair
Like a trani on ten
All the bubbas got their heads in a nod
They don't know what they love or deserve to get
Chances are that that worm in his lap
Doesn't even know which fish that he'd like to bite tonight

I've seen your kind at your very best
This long goodbye is overdue
You never came when I called on you
The bastard wind is on your back
The rabid dog has caught your track
The golden age of old advice
Don't give no cause or alibi
One more night  one more night
One more night  will you stay here?
We've crystalized  it's dawned on you
You have the face of someone new
The pleasures of this life I'm told
Will spit you out in the middle of the road
A scenic place the sky grows cold
