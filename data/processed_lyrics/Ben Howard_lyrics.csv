"Or not to care
To be there
In the distant and uncertain
To be aware
In an old Iberian hotel room
That the devil
Is not behind the curtain
She said walk in small steps
And fear floating
We made a pact
As Saturn approaching
Leaned on the sky
And smoking a cigarette
Said it's late
You should be going
The wind is howling
The house is showing
(High numbers)
Boat to an island on the wall
Hand striking in slow motion
Future singing in a field
Shooting season's open

To care
Or not to care
To be aware
You were supposed to laugh
Said the fortune to his sailor
This is the black mountain path
Or these are the sunny shores to nowhere
Well
Boat to an island on the wall
A hand striking in slow motion
Future singing in a field
Shooting season's open
Boat to an island on the wall
A hand striking in slow motion
I would like to be
Someone kind over cavalier
Not scared of the blood
The creak and the thud inside your chest
Clearly calm I'm keeping terrorised
The ageless thaw of winter
Here in light hung a soft divide
The billowed curtain call
Hold me down
Was I born to lie?
Here at all
Here at all
My fear in lights
All I said comes home
I can't do this alone
Asleep inside
I was born to lie
Now prove me wrong
Prove me wrong
But it's in your nature
Blooms inside your blood
Hold me in harm's way baby
All is now harmed

Blooms inside your blood
Hold me in harm's way baby
Someone who'd clearly been there before
I didn’t feel I had to ask him why
I have never understood why we need to know
The reasons for everyone else's strifes
Sometimes you don't need sympathy
To get the words right
Caught in anguish
He was
Sometimes that’s enough
And he was singing
Her body bleachin' out into the waves
It's still the loudest thing
Somewhere drinking
The sunny afternoon
Into oblivion
But that's not your fault
How could that be my fault?
So we walked into a house party
And all the young girls turned up late and drank us all to some kind of stand still
With looks of Heard it all before
And distant ideas of death and thrills
And somehow I did feel like yesterday was ours
But it's gone
Yesterday was ours
All along
And they were singing

Don’t go out and sing alone
Ain't we rolling through lost and found
Don't go out and head on into the town
There'll be bands playing
It's a heartache if that's what you like
Is it all worth saving?
Bird on a wing
Such a fine and peaceful thing
Ain't we rolling through lost and found
Don't go out and head on into the town

A darkened plume to stay
Hope here needs a humble hand
Not a fox found in your place
Black flies on the windowsill
That we are

Comfort came against my will

So very long
And hold  hold your lips so tightly

You can never be alone
'Cause it's just the bones you're made of
And you laugh like you've never been lonely
That's alright honey
That's alright with me
Oh you laugh like there's hope in the story
That's alright honey
That's alright with me
Oh you laugh like I'll be there to hold you always
Always here
And go silent as death on the first day of the snow
Oh go leave these fires burning
A house of embers and coal
And covert  covert all those boys that search for love
In your room
Cause lust is just a child's game

 reeling home against your glow
 breath tied up in summer’s hold
 in sepia tones
 I'd say before I go
 breath tied up in summer’s hold

 I'll say before I go
Out to where you see
The curl of the world
We're alone
Just like you said
Life lasts
Only one thing left to roll
Last year to learn
You were the boat that breached

We will never be the change to the weather and the sea

Agatha and I go
Down to the courtyard slinging
Last year's Sundays in the river of time
Agatha and I go
Down to the citadel Sunday
Red church bells and the moon on the rise
If you were to tell her
The days are numbered
I'd break the teeth in your fake ass smile
Maybe in a rare wind
Maybe in a month of Sundays
Maybe in a war I would still read the wrong signs
But I don't mind it
Being in the darkness baby
To be by your side
I would walk the Nile twice
Days of lantana
Each saint with a cross and a hammer
Radiation of the Cherenkov kind
So we go walking
Birds at the window talking
Jubilations in the faint June shine

Down to the citadel winning
Things that graciously came to mind
Gathering the day in
Some make arrangements
Some know the way and they just walk a straight line
Well  Curly's a baker's boy
Living for the harvest nights
Turns to me and says something like
The world only turns twice
Once for the laughter
Once for the memories after
All the rest is just kicking through the weather and the fines
So we go dancing
Twist turns and all things fancy
I blame the baker boy  that's what I had on my mind
You in the here now
Me in the far bar
I'd wait forever if they gave me enough time
Outside walking
Birds at the window talking
Iterations of the faint June shine

But it's the roots that will bind us here
To the ground
Depth over distance was all I asked of you
And I may be foolish to fall as I do
Still there's strength in the blindness you fear
If you're coming too
If you're coming too
Breaks from the arms of the Lord
To know this ride we're on
Depth over distance was all I asked of you
And everybody round here's acting like a stone
Just let it grow sometimes
Breaks from the arms of the Lord
To know this ride we're on

And I may be foolish to fall as I do
Still there's strength in the blindness you fear
If you're coming too
Oh if you're coming too
Breaks from the arms of the Lord
To know this ride we're on
To know this ride
So garishly clean
White as the horses
That carry me away
Come and go with the days
A mind's will to play
All I am is the bones you made for me
Just driftwood for the sea
Heavy as the horses
That carry me away

That I could not hold you
My orange tree
Left in the darkened room for three of us to share
Oh  maybe you were free
Before my blackened wing covered you
I took the sing from your song
I made a bed
Where you don't belong
Oh  poor me  she fell beneath the wheels to help me up
Black Sea  I failed to be the light you found in love
Oh poor me  she fell beneath the wheels to help me up
Black Sea  the monster killed the melody you loved
Now I'm going places on my own
Blinded  now I see
That death moves amongst us
And with such ease the rife does surround us

Calling
Clearing

To fill the sky in
Well there was no one to see

Picking psilocybin

Time to make a new plan
Said the gravedigger man
How am I to make a killing
What with all of this living?
It's abysmal the state of the union
And the dogs begin to howl
As they walked through empty mile
At last the trees did lean in to make a suggestion
Near the hoodlums and the gangs
Those that read all the books stacked to the ceiling
Well they've been cutting us down
They've been messing us around
And they asked us all to stay a-sleeping
Treason
There's time to wail around then
There's a time to be aware
There's a time to make everything nice and even
Feeling good and proud and tall
Found a meaning to a long forgotten secret
I was waking in the bath
When I heard them on the outside of the district
Far out
Far out
Far out
We're together all as one
If we don't act now
It'll be tomorrow
So I left and closed the door
When I walk into the nearest forest clearing
There was nothing there to see
Just a boy beyond the trees
Picking psilocybin
Far out
Far out
Tell me is there vacancy
Out in the house beyond the trees
I'm in the forest of asking
As we walked up the footpath through the fields
How the rain did reveal your heart
And the rope swing from the balance held the weight
Shadows fall and a cold wind blows
Maybe oh everybody goes
Oh but we were young
Oh oh we were young
Oh we were young
Oh oh we were young
That rope you tied around your neck
And it took them three days to find you
Tired torch lights and dog scents
Oh they let you down from the highest branches
Cold eyes and frozen arms
And my my my your beauty was so dumbfoundin'
Lace white dress and your hair as long as Follaton Woods
And the whole town just stood there crying
Looking at the darkness
For something wholesome and good
That rope you tied around your neck
Morning white mist came in across the plains
Blue skies and rain
Oh and it was the strangest day
And you woulda left your heart out
Oh you woulda left your heart out
You woulda left your heart out
You woulda laughed your heart out*
You woulda laughed your heart out*
Looking like a simple being
Should have known better
You were talking to the spirit kingdom
The movement large
The weather dull
Pick again until the cards can form our meaning
Looking out on a Belleville crowd
You are the follies fixture
Looking out on a Belleville crowd
Never knew how much I had missed you
Walk with me to the burning spire
We can count the dеad on Ender's pyre
The dusty towns whеre the number's found
Don't quite match the missing
The muddied snow
My Easter's cull
Walk with me until I can find some meaning

Past the flat-footed charterhouse boys
From towns where the mothers can't stand
The sight of each other
Baby wants to last
In the hearts of the wild and free
She knows that time takes all of us
Through every long hot heavy summer
Over garden fences made to buff the bastard breeze
Of chance encounters
Baby wants to dance
Past the Tuesday morning supermarket crowd
She knows we'll all sleep through the days
And be two-step drip fed our laughter
Says she wants to last
Last how you want to
She's a light in the young boy's eyes
Through every long hot heavy summer
Over garden fences made to buff the bastard breeze
One last gasp
I was watching Syria
Blinded by the sunshine strip
And you  you were in the kitchen
Oh your mariner's mouth
The wounded with the wounder's whip
And that's how summer passed:
And oh  maybe it was peace at last
Who knew
Then  hello love
My invincible friend
Oh  hello love
The thistle and the burr
Oh  hello love
For you I have so many words
Oh hey  I wasn't listening
I was stung by all of us
The blind leading out the bored
And as per usual
You were skipping and laughing
Eyes at the bedroom door
Don't take it so seriously  no
Only time is ours  the rest we'll just wait and see!

Clothes are off  my health receding

Of Caribbean Nica Libres

Down dust and pine cone tracks

Awoke to the fog where all around us
The boom of summertime
We stood
Steady as the stars in the woods
So happy-hearted and the warmth
Rang true inside these bones
And as the old pine fell we sang
Just to bless the morning
Hot sand on toes  cold sand in sleeping bags

Are all you'll always have
Smoke in my lungs  the echoed stone
Careless and young  free as the birds that fly
With weightless souls

Just to bless the morning
We grow  grow steady as the morning
Here we grow  grow older still
We grow  grow happy as a new dawn
Grow  grow older still
We grow  grow steady as the flowers
Here we grow  grow older still
We grow  grow happy as a new dawn
Grow  grow older still
Only love  my only love
Darling  I feel you under my body
Only love  my only love
Give me shelter  or show me heart
Watch me fall apart  watch me fall apart...
And I'll be yours to keep
A wind in the shadows  whale song in the deep
A wind in the shadows  whale song in the deep
Darling  you're with me  always around me
Only love  my only love
Darling  I feel you under my body

Give me shelter  or show me heart
Watch me fall apart  watch me fall apart
And I'll be yours to keep
A wind in the shadows  whale song in the deep

I come alone here
Water takes the shape of all that it surrounds
Yeah I know  I've been trying so hard
To keep in time with all of the hours in your day
Hold it in  they wouldn't let you out among the crowd

The wailing sun
Echoes from the park seem so absurd
The bus takes hours
Can't spend my time
On everybody else
If buildings fell
At least we'd be in matrimony

As a child
But I really can't remember why

Turns out we don't all
Fight like dogs in the end
Most of us want to roll out
Roll under the grass
No bridge in your song
Spirulina won't cure my heartbreak
I was a dreamer when I learned to take
In between her and the fireplace
There are factors that conditioned me
And the blank ones
Cartwheel out of the furnace
