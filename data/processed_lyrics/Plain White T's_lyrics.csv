lyrics
"Give me more loving than I've ever had
Make it all better when I'm feeling sad
Tell me that I'm special even when I know I'm not
Make it feel good when I hurt so bad
Barely gettin' mad
I'm so glad I found you
I love being around you
You make it easy
It's as easy as one  two  one  two  three  four
There's only one thing (One) to do (Two)
Three words (Three) for you... (Four)
(I love you) I love you
There's only one way (One) to say (Two)
Those three words (Three) and that's what I'll do... (Four)
(I love you) I love you
Give me more loving from the very start
Piece me back together when I fall apart
Tell me things you never even tell your closest friends
Make it feel good when I hurt so bad
Best that I've had
I'm so glad I found you
I love being around you
You make it easy

(I love you) I love you
(I love you) I love you
One  two  three  four
(I love you) I love you
Just trying to think of something to do
Just to keep me from thinking of you
'Cause you're all that's on my mind
One thought of you is all it takes
To leave the rest of the world behind
Well I didn't mean for this to go
As far as it did
And I didn't mean to get so close
And share what we did
And I didn't mean to fall in love
But I did
And you didn't mean to love me back
But I know you did
I'm sitting here trying to convince myself
That you're not the one for me
And the more I want you here with me
You know the holidays are coming up
I don't want to spend them alone
Memories of Christmas time with you
Will just kill me if I'm on my own

And I didn't mean to fall in love
But I did
And you didn't mean to love me back
I know it's not the smartest thing to do
We just can't seem to get it right
But what I wouldn't give to have one more chance tonight
One more chance tonight
I'm sitting here trying to entertain
Myself with this old guitar
But with all my inspiration gone
It's not getting me very far
I look around my room and everything
I see reminds me of you
We've got nothing left to prove
Well I didn't mean for this to go
As far as it did
And I didn't mean to get so close
And share what we did
And I didn't mean to fall in love
But I did
And you didn't mean to love me back
But I know you did
And I didn't mean to meet you then
Then when we were just kids
And I didn't mean to give you chills
The way that I kiss
And I didn't mean to fall in love
But I did
And you didn't mean to love me back but I know you did
Don't say you didn't love me back 'cause you know you did
Put me to sleep again
Take me away
Off to a dream and then I'll fly
So high across the sky
And wake in a new place
Where mistakes of my past are erased
Don't drop me
Don't stop me
Just hold me
So cozy
Airplane  airplane
Don't you go down today
Take me away
Off to a better place
You know
Just where I'd like to go
Please get me there on time
Don't delay me from losing my mind

It would be easy for me to be sorry
If you could see all the possibilities
We might not still be standing where we started
Don't let me go for this
Don't let me go for this
Maybe we're all that we needed
Two wrongs don't make a right
But I don't care tonight
Maybe we're all that we needed
You could say we were just a big mistake
I think it's worth making
Worth repeating
I would say good things come to those who wait
I would say anything if you'd believe it

If you could see all the possibilities
We might not still be standing where we started

I don't care tonight
That's when we feel alive
That's when the tops go down
I break a dollar at the bar
And make the jukebox sing
So tell Rosie what you want
The first round's on me
We're gonna light up these streets baby
Shake the dust off all your dreams baby
We're gonna lose a little sleep baby
On these American nights!
Under the stars and stripes
We live and die with our friends
There's nothing we can't do
As soon as the sun sets
I'm gonna find me a girl
I'm gonna try to make her laugh
And once she gives me that look
I'm gonna take her hand
'Cause everything about her reminds me
Of all the broken romance behind me
I'm giving love another chance to find me
On these American nights!

We've got main street lit up like a fire
Nothing compares to breathing the air
When I'm back in my hometown
Someday my kids will run like I did
On these streets and old playgrounds!
I wanna drive all night
Turn up the radio loud
Love's hanging in the breeze
I shut the whole world out
So come and ride with me baby
I'm saving you the front seat baby
Feeling nothing but free baby
On these American nights!
But every time i look into your eyes
I see a world thats changing more and more
I see world I've never seen before
And i know and i know
When i go to sleep at night
I pull the blankets up tight
I dream of times when i can hold you in my arms
And i will look at you and you at me
And we can be together permanently
And i know and i know
And i know that it must be Audrey
She's the only one for me
And i know and i know
And i know that i must be Audrey
Yeah it must be Audrey
Yeah it must be Audrey
She's the only one for me
She's the only one for me
She's the only one for me
 I've loved once. I'll never love again.
 but they'll awake and see
 and we'll never make it home
 they felt the same
 but I'll awake and see
 it's how easy the tables turn
 it's the fine art of letting go
Standing in the street with your tits out?
What you gonna do when the sun comes up?
Trying to get a ride with the fuck-ups
Once you know the way out
It’s even harder to stay out
Once you know the things they're saying
You know all of the games they're playing
What you gonna do when the buzz wears off
And you wake up in the corner with your clothes off?
What you gonna do when the truth sets in
And nobody’s around to sink your teeth in?

Oh
I wanna see you again
I wanna see you again
And all of the heat came back again
All that it takes is just one kiss
And I'm putty in your hands
I'm under your spell
You send me spinning
I keep coming back like a boomerang
I keep coming back like a boomerang
'Round around around and back again
Around around around and back again
You're treating me like I'm your little toy
You tell me I'm not like other boys
You don't even bother with goodbyes

And now my heart is racing
And after you I'm chasing
You got to catch me when I fall
You send me spinning

'Round around around and back again
Around around around and back again
Around around around and back again
I've seen a man shoutout
Afraid of losing the woman he loves
I've seen a woman lying
To her man flat out
About who she's been with
And where she was
I've seen them both fight
And try to figure it out
This fight isn't going anywhere
I've seen a child's eyes
Watching his parents freak out
I know they see him but they just don't care
It won't stop if they don't stop yelling
It's not the way of working your problems out
I can't stand being around this yelling
So I'm finding my way out
I'm gonna drive and never ever slow down
I'm gonna drive until I breakdown
Packing my things and getting out of this town
I'm gonna drive until I breakdown

And just help him get out

I've seen a suicide
They couldn't figure it out
He blamed himself because they couldn't get along
I've seen his parents eyes
Trying to figure it out
Where did our baby go and what went wrong?
It won't stop if they don't stop yelling
It's not the way of working your problems out
I can't stand being around this yelling
So I'm finding my way out
I'm gonna drive and never ever slow down
I'm gonna drive until I breakdown
Packing my things and getting out of this town
I'm gonna drive until I breakdown
I'm gonna drive until I breakdown
Hold it inside until I breakdown
Not gonna try until I break down
Say my goodbyes until I breakdown
(baby come on)
I'm gonna drive and never ever slow down
I'm gonna drive until I breakdown
Packing my things and getting out of this town
I'm gonna drive until I breakdown
I'm gonna drive and never ever slow down

Oh woah
Christmas won't be the same without you
Gold and red ribbons wrapped around you
When we're apart it breaks my heart
Christmas won't be the same without you
(Oh woah) Give me some of that Christmas feeling
(Oh woah) Tired of giving and not receiving
Who am I gonna cuddle up to if I can't have you?
Christmas won't be the same without you
Now all I do is think about you
And I don't know why we said goodbye
Christmas won't be the same without you
(Oh woah) Give me some of that Christmas feeling

Who am I gonna cuddle up to if I can't have you? (Ohh)

Take me anywhere but here
Put me in the front row
Make my problems disappear
Without a safety net
For the price of admission
I wanna witness life or death
All the pretty girls get cut in half
While the sad clowns make us laugh
I wanna make friends with the freaks
I wanna throw down with the clowns that I meet
I wanna have a party in the middle of the street
I wanna have a party in the middle of the street
I wanna have a party in the middle of the street
Invite all the carnies and the crazy acrobats
And bearded ladies and the fire-breathers
All the people just like me
Are you ready to risk it all
And be a human cannonball?
Sharpen up those knives
And throw them at the fool against the wall
We're all against that wall

I am always there for you
Whether you're laughing or you're screaming
No one else could take your place
I will always see your face
When I'm awake and when I am dreaming
'Cause I believe there's a place for you and me
In this crazy world
If you come running back to me I'll be here waiting
'Cause I still believe in a love worth saving
If you could see the sad look on my face
You'd be in your car headed back to my place
'Cause I'm on my knees and my love's not fading
If you could see the sad look on my face
You'd be in your car headed back to my place
I can't stand to watch you go
'Cause in my head deep down I know
I don't wanna live without you

If you could see the sad look on my face
You'd be in your car headed back to my place
Come back to me
I'm on my knees
If you could see the sad look on my face
Is greater than or equal to
The sum of every love we knew
Back when we were young
And if we multiply
I hope to God they get your eyes
And we get something that you can't divide
'Cause baby you are the one
And we can dance off time
To songs I make up for you
'Cause every word I write
Chord I strike is for you
Your sun-kissed skin
My souvenir of where we've been
You make me feel born again
And when the angels sing
(Feels like heaven pouring down)
When the church bells ring
(And my queen is crowned)
Well I could be your king
Just like when we were young

To songs I make up for you
'Cause every word I write
Chord I strike is for you
And we can dance off time
To songs I make up for you
And every word I write
Chord I strike is for you
But actions speak louder in case you haven't heard
I'm all alone
While you're out on the town drinkin' with your friends
You can say all these beautiful things
But they don't mean nothing
Gotta back it up
But you keep backing down
Tell me how this ends
If you think it's possible than anything is possible
But I think you're impossible
I hope you prove me wrong
You only call me after you've had a few
You only want to hang out when you've got nothing to do
Don't tell me you love me and act like you don't
Same old thing happens every night
I'm heated up
And you just leave me there to take care of myself
Just let me know if I should hit the road or if you want my help

Sick of feelin' so bad
What's the point of bein' sad?
Got this day and I don't wanna waste it
Wanna have fun without gettin' wasted
There ain't no rain fallin'

What's it like in New York City?
I'm a thousand miles away
Times Square can't shine as bright as you
I swear it's true
Hey there Delilah
Don't you worry about the distance
I'm right there if you get lonely
Give this song another listen
Close your eyes
I'm by your side
What you do to me
Hey there Delilah
I know times are getting hard
Someday I'll pay the bills with this guitar
We'll have it good
We'll have the life we knew we would
My word is good
Hey there Delilah
I've got so much left to say
If every simple song I wrote to you
Would take your breath away
I'd write it all
We'd have it all

A thousand miles seems pretty far
But they've got planes and trains and cars

And we'll just laugh along because we know
That none of them have felt this way
That by the time we get through
The world will never ever be the same
And you're to blame
Hey there Delilah
You be good and don't you miss me
Two more years and you'll be done with school
And I'll be making history like I do
You'll know it's all because of you
We can do whatever we want to
Hey there Delilah here's to you
This one's for you
 but girl

I've been thinking bout your flyness
Dreamin' bout the first time we was vibin'
On the phone sayin' the words love is silent
But wow that chick so stylish
Even made my drama your problems
And the equation you help me solve it
You've been there before the popular Tyga
I was not ballin'
Oh It's What You Do To Me
Oh It's What You Do To Me
Oh It's What You Do To Me
Oh It's What You Do To Me
What You Do To Me
(Hey There Delilah)
Ouch feel like my heart is cryin'
Cause your light years away from where I am
Well that's what it seems like Ms. Delilah
There's no other thing like a Ms. Delilah
This court outta divide me from Ms. Delilah
No I'm turnin into a Mr. Violent
All cause I was sprung on Ms. Delilah

 onto paper I would draw you
Would you come and pillage the village with me?
We'll bury the treasure and go down together
If I was a pirate
If I was an outlaw robbing a bank
Would you be my Bonnie? Help me get away?
Would you pull the trigger and blow 'em away?
If I was an outlaw
How bad would I have to be?
How bad?
If I was a vampire roaming the night
Would you be my prey? Put your neck on the line?
Live in the shadows and die in the light?
If I was a vampire
If I was a wanted man on the run
Would you take the fall if we were under the gun?
And drop down beside me in the nooses they've hung?
If I was a wanted man on the run

Would you be my alibi and lie on the stand?
Swear on your life that I'm an innocent man?
If I was a killer
How bad would I have to be?
How bad?

But that isn't to say that it's not on their minds
Maybe it would wise for you to be in the room next time
Join the land of the living
And what if you fall
Ain't it the falling that's the best part
They won't leave you behind
But I wouldn't push your luck
Can you tell me is there anybody in my home
All that I do is listen
Can you tell me is there anybody in my home
To join the land of the living
They won't leave you behind
But that isn't to say that it's not on their minds
Maybe it would wise for you to be in the room next time

And what if you fall

Then I'll give up everything
And you'll never hear me sing
All these songs about you
So just take this time and think
Just take this time and think
Think about the things that we had
The good times before they went bad
They're not gone just yet
It's all up to you
Think about the dreams in our heads
Why don't you go ahead
And make them come true
I still believe in you
This is my last call to you
Then I'll give up everything
And you'll never hear me sing

Like livin' in the Midwest Club
Goin' on our honeymoon in Paris
Makin' out when we're grown up
Listening to the best man speech
From Darren
Think of everything we had
Knowing how it feels to be in love
And kisses that would drive us mad
Going to the Metro
Giving up what we will
Never have again
Will it ever be the two of us again?
This is my last call to you
Then I'll give up everything
And you'll never hear me sing
All these songs about you
So just take this time and think
Plans we made but didn't see through

People talking  chitter chatter
She calls shotgun  people scatter
She go bang bang  'til it splatters

She got me losing faith
Making the same excuses
For the same mistakes
Before it all goes dark
Before I fade away

This girl's a legend in the late night scene
And you can see she aimed to please
'Cause she just wouldn't take her eyes off me
She made the music come to life
She moved her body like a butcher knife
Chopping up every guy in sight
She was mysterious
I could not resist to save my life
I don't know what this girl was after
She's so sexy
I had to have her
Natural disaster
Now when she left me on the floor
She knew I'd follow her right out that door
She'd always leave you craving more

Saying that you just got home
You're lucky I'm even still awake
Awake enough to answer the phone
But I knew it would be you
'Cause I was hoping that you'd call
Hoping you'd say that you were sorry
But you don't apologize at all
And it's not okay and it's not alright
What have you been doing with those guys all night?
If they're really just friends
Why wouldn't you choose me over them?
Please don't do this again
Try to give you the space you need
But you end up walking all over me
Please don't do this to me

So drunk you're ready to pass out
Tellin' me you had a great time

It seems like just yesterday
I was laughing with you
Playing games at Grandma's house
I hope I'm just like you
And do they have radios in heaven?
I hope they do
'Cause they're playing my song on the radio
You left before I had a chance
To say goodbye
But that's the way life usually is

And you can't look back

She begs me to come down
Warm sun and wind in my ear
We'll watch the world from above
As it turns to the rhythm of love
We may only have tonight
All mine
Play the music low
And sway to the rhythm of love
My heart beats like a drum
A guitar string to the strum
A beautiful song to be sung
She's got blue eyes deep like the sea
That roll back when she's laughing at me
She rises up like the tide
The moment her lips meet mine
We may only have tonight
All mine
Play the music low
And sway to the rhythm of love

Play the music low

 it's all been done before
 it's all been done before
But when that lonely clock strikes
That's when I wish you were here
The angel knows it's not right
But the devil's in my heart tonight
Whispering things in my ear
So I down my cup
And then I hit you up
Saying stupid stuff...
I should've never called you
I should've listened to my head
When it said leave it alone
Here I go missing you again
God only knows what I said
I should've just gone to bed
I should've just gone to bed

Never really think of you
I keep you out of my head

Reservation made for two
Throw some money in the meter
Fifteen minutes late to meet her
Runnin' past the movie theater
Nervous in the elevator
Will I like her? Will I hate her?
Will she leave me for the waiter?
Waiting for me at the bar
All my worries disappear 'cause we're here
Don't know where it's gonna go
But it feels good not to know
Don't know where it's gonna go
But it feels good not to know

I thought maybe you would stick around
I should've known you would let me down
A heartbreaker when the lights go out
I don't know why I just can't move on

Now you've become another sad song
Just another girl that did me wrong

No shade to crawl in underneath
I've got scars from a pocket knife
Where you carved your heart into me
If all you wanted was love
Why would you use me up
When all I wanted to be was your giving tree

Whose covers you're between
And it's sad laying in his bed
If all you wanted was love

These are the wonders of the younger
Daydreams of castle and sad crystal balls
While your heroes on posters stand guard on your walls
These are the wonders of the younger
And I wonder why we just leave it all behind?
And I wonder how we could all go back right now?
Werewolves and vampires are out for the kill
These are the wonders of the younger
Walkin' the plank off an old pirate ship
With a fistful of gold and her kiss on your lips
These are the wonders of the younger
And I wonder why we just leave it all behind?
And I wonder how we could all go back right now?
