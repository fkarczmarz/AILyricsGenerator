lyrics
"Some habits that you just can't lose
There's no telling what a man might use
After the thrill is gone
The flame rises but it soon descends
Empty pages and a frozen pen
You're not quite lovers and you're not quite friends
After the thrill is gone
What can you do when your dreams come true
And it's not quite like you planned?
What have you done to be losing the one
You held it so tight in your hand well
Time passes and you must move on
Half the distance takes you twice as long
So you keep on singing for the sake of the song
After the thrill is gone
After the thrill is gone
You're afraid you might fall out of fashion
And you're feeling cold and small
Any kind of love without passion

Same dances in the same old shoes
You get too careful with the steps you choose
You don't care about winning but you don't want to lose
After the thrill is gone
After the thrill is gone
And they said you were gonna put me on a shelf
But let me tell you I got some news for you
And you'll soon find out it's true
And then you'll have to eat your lunch all by yourself
'Cause I'm already gone
And I'm feelin' strong
I will sing this vict'ry song
Woo hoo hoo  my my
Woo hoo hoo
The letter that you wrote me
Made me stop and wonder why
But I guess you felt like you had to set things right
You can see the stars and still not see the light
(That's right)
And I'm already gone
And I'm feelin' strong
I will sing this vict'ry song

Heaven knows it wasn't you who set me free
So oftentimes it happens that we live our lives in chains
And we never even know we have the key
But me  I'm already gone
And I'm feelin' strong
I will sing (I will sing) this vict'ry song
'Cause I'm already gone
Yes  I'm already gone
And I'm feelin' strong
I will sing this vict'ry song
'Cause I'm already gone
Yes  I'm already gone
Already gone
All right  nighty-night
Already gone
Already gone
Holding you close in my dreams
Thinking about all the things that we said
And coming apart at the seams
We try to talk it over
But the words come out too rough
I know you were trying
To give me the best of your love
Beautiful faces
Look at the way that we live
Wasting our time on cheap talk and wine
Left us so little to give
That same old crowd was like a cold dark cloud
That we could never rise above
But here in my heart
I give you the best of my love
You get the best of my love

I'm going back in time
And it's a sweet dream
It was a quiet night
And I would be all right
If I could go on sleeping
But every morning
I wake up and worry
What's gonna happen today
You see it your way
And I see it mine
But we both see it slippin' away
You know we always had each other baby
I guess that wasn't enough
I give you the best of my love
You get the best of my love

You've been out ridin' fences for so long now
These things that are pleasin' you can hurt you somehow
Don't you draw the queen of diamonds  boy
She'll beat you if she's able
You know the queen of hearts is always your best bet
Now it seems to me some fine things
Have been laid upon your table
But you only want the ones that you can't get
Your pain and your hunger  they're drivin' you home
Your prison is walkin' through this world all alone
Don't your feet get cold in the wintertime?
The sky won't snow and the sun won't shine
It's hard to tell the nighttime from the day
You're losin' all your highs and lows
Ain't it funny how the feelin' goes

High or low  it was the same
Easy money and faithless women
Red-eye whiskey for the pain
Two brothers lying dead in Coffeyville
Two voices call to you from where they stood

Better keep on moving  Doolin-Dalton
'Til your shadow sets you free
And if you're fast  and if you're lucky
You will never see that hanging tree
Well  the towns lay out across the dusty plains
Like graveyards filled with tombstones  waiting for the names
And a man could use his back or use his brains
'Til Bill Doolin met Bill Dalton
He was working cheap  just biding time
Then he laughed and said  I'm going
And so he left that peaceful life behind  'hind

Southern California will see one more day
Dreamland  and bus'ness is booming
The birds are a singing as I drift away
She looks another year older
From too many lovers who used her and ran
And she's always willing to hold you again
So give her this dance
She can't be forsaken
Learn how to love her
With all of her faults
She gave more than she's taken
And I'll go down doing the Hollywood Waltz
Springtime and the lady is grieving
The lovers just stand there with nothing to say
They got what they wanted
They're packing and leaving
To look for another to love the same way

Warm smell of colitas
Rising up through the air
Up ahead in the distance
I saw a shimmering light
My head grew heavy and my sight grew dim
I had to stop for the night
There she stood in the doorway
I heard the mission bell
And I was thinkin' to myself
This could be Heaven or this could be Hell
Then she lit up a candle
And she showed me the way
There were voices down the corridor
I thought I heard them say
Welcome to the Hotel California
Such a lovely place (Such a lovely place)
Such a lovely face

From far away
Wake you up in the middle of the night

Welcome to the Hotel California
Such a lovely place (Such a lovely place)

They livin' it up at the Hotel California
What a nice surprise (What a nice surprise)
Bring your alibis
Mirrors on the ceiling
We are all just prisoners here
Of our own device
And in the master's chambers
They gathered for the feast
They stab it with their steely knives
But they just can't kill the beast
Running for the door
I had to find the passage back
To the place I was before
We are programmed to receive
You can check out any time you like
But you can never leave
Tearing our love apart
Aren't we the same two people who live
Through years in the dark? Ahh-ah
Every time I try to walk away
Something makes me turn around and stay
And I can't tell you why
When we get crazy  it just ain't right
(Try to keep your head  little girl)
You don't have to worry  just hold on tight
(Don't get caught in your little world)
Cause I love you

I know there must be something better
But there's nowhere else in sight
It's survival in the city
When you live from day to day
City streets don't have much pity
I was born here in the city
With my back against the wall
Nothing grows and life ain't very pretty
No one's there to catch you when you fall
Somewhere out on that horizon
Far away from the neon sky
I know there must be something better
And I can't stay another night

Still he just couldn't get off

Learn to be still
We are like sheep without a shepherd
We don't know how to be alone
So we wander around this desert
And wind up following the wrong gods home
But the flock cries out for another
And they keep answering that bell
And one more starry-eyed messiah
Meets a violent farewell

Shadows moving on the sand
Somebody whispering the twenty-third psalm
Dusty rifle in his trembling hands
Somebody trying just to stay alive
He got promises to keep
Over the ocean in America
Far away and fast asleep
Silent stars blinking in the blackness of an endless sky
Pilgrims and prodigals creeping toward the dawn
And it's a long road out of Eden
Music blasting from an SUV
On a bright and sunny day
Rolling down the interstate
In the good old USA
Having lunch at the petroleum club
Smoking fine cigars and swapping lives
Give me another piece of that pecan pie!

Assuring us these aches inside are only growing pains

Back home I was so certain
The path was very clear
But now I have to wonder
What are we doing here?
I'm not counting on tomorrow
And I can't tell wrong from right
But I'd give anything to be there in your arms tonight
Weaving down the American highway
Through the litter and the wreckage and the cultural junk
And now we're driving dazed and drunk
Been down the road to Damascus
The road to Mandalay
Met the ghost of Caesar on the Appian way
But the road to empire is a bloody stupid waste
But all the knowledge in the world is of no use to fools
You were searching for a place to hide
Lost and lonely  now you've given me the will to survive

Given to a man with hands as cold as ice

To comfort an old friend who's feelin' down

The love of a girl
But men get lost sometimes
As years unfurl
One day he crossed some line
And he was too much in this world
But I guess it doesn't matter anymore

(One of these nights)
One of these nights
One of these crazy old nights
Against your skin so brown
And I want to sleep with you in the desert tonight
With a billion stars all around
'Cause I got a peaceful easy feelin'
And I know you won't let me down
'Cause I'm already standin'
On the ground
And I found out a long time ago
What a woman can do to your soul
You don't already know how to go
And I got a peaceful easy feelin'
And I know you won't let me down
'Cause I'm already standin'
On the ground

I get this feelin' I may know you
As a lover and a friend
But this voice keeps whisperin' in my other ear
Tells me I may never see you again
'Cause I get a peaceful easy feelin'
And I know you won't let me down
'Cause I'm already standin'
I'm already standin'
On the ground
My baby's gone  I have no friends
To wish me greetings once again
Choirs will be singing Silent Night
Christmas carols by candlelight
Please come home for Christmas
Please come home for Christmas
If not for Christmas  by New Year's night
Friends and relations send salutations
Sure as the stars shine above
The time of year to be with the ones you love
So won't you tell me you'll never more roam
Christmas and New Year's will find you home
There will be no more sorrow  no grief and pain
And I'll be happy  happy once again
Seems like we've come a long way
My  but we learn so slow
And heroes  they come and they go
And leave us behind as if we're supposed to know
Why
Why
Why do we give up our hearts to the past?
And why must we grow up so fast?
And all you wishing well fools with your fortunes
Someone should send you a rose
With love from a friend  it's nice to hear from you again
And the storybook comes to a close
Gone are the ribbons and bows
Things to remember  places to go
The moon burned so bright and the time went so slow
And I swore that I loved her and gave her a ring
The bluebird was high on the wing
Whatever happened to Saturday night?
Finding a sweetheart and holding her tight
Whatever happened to Saturday night?
The years brought the railroad  it ran by my door
Now there's boards on the windows and dust on the floor
And she passes the time at another man's side
And I pass the time with my pride
What a tangled web we weave
Go 'round with circumstance
Someone show me how to tell
The dancer from the dance
Whatever happened to Saturday night?
Choosing a friend and losing the fight
Whatever happened to Saturday night?

Southward as you go
There is moonlight and moss in the trees
Down the Seven Bridges Road
Now I have loved you like a baby
Like some lonesome child
And I have loved you in a tame way
And I have loved you wild
Sometimes there's a part of me
Has to turn from here and go
Running like a child from these warm stars
Down the Seven Bridges Road
There are stars in the southern sky
And if ever you decide you should go
There is a taste of thyme-sweetened honey
 two that wanna stone me
 take it easy
 I'm a standing on a corner in Southern California
 I'm climbin' in take it easy
 I'm running down the road trying to loosen
 got a world of trouble on my mind
 take it easy

I've got seven women on my mind
Four that wanna own me  two that wanna stone me
One says she's a friend of mine
Take It easy  take it easy
Don't let the sound of your own wheels drive you crazy
Lighten up while you still can
Don't even try to understand
Just find a place to make your stand and take it easy
And such a fine sight to see
Slowin' down to take a look at me
I gotta know if your sweet love is gonna save me
We may lose  and we may win
Though we will never be here again

When the bright lights have faded to blue
I was thinking 'bout a woman who might have
Loved me and I never knew
You know I've always been a dreamer
(Spent my life running 'round)
And it's so hard to change
(Can't seem to settle down)
But the dreams I've seen lately
Keep on turning out and burning out
And turning out the same
So put me on a highway
And show me a sign
And take it to the limit one more time
You can spend all your time making money
You can spend all your love making time
If it all fell to pieces tomorrow
Would you still be mine?
And when you're looking for your freedom
(Nobody seems to care)
And you can't find the door
(Can't find it anywhere)
When there's nothing to believe in
You're coming back for more

Starin' slowly 'cross the sky
I said goodbye
He was just a hired hand
Workin' on the dreams he planned to try
The days go by
Every night when the sun goes down
Just another lonely boy in town
And she's out runnin' 'round
She wasn't just another woman
And I couldn't keep from comin' on
It's been so long
When it comes down to dealin' friends
It never ends
​
Take another shot of courage
Wonder why the right words never come
You just get numb
It's another tequila sunrise
This old world still looks the same
Or maybe it just hurt so bad she couldn't cry
And she became the girl from yesterday
He took a plane across the sea
To some foreign land
She stayed at home and tried so hard to understand
How someone who had been so close could be so far away
And she became the girl from yesterday
She doesn't know what's right
She doesn't know what's wrong
She only knows the pain that comes from waiting for so long
And she doesn't count the teardrops
That she's cried while he's away
Because she knows deep in her heart
That he'll be back someday
Talking to a memory that's never coming home
She dreams of his returning and the things that he might say
And the band was playing rhythm and blues
You got down and did the gator and half an hour later
You were barfing all over your girlfriend's shoes
But the Greeks don't want no freaks
The Greeks don't want no freaks
Just put a little smile on them rosy cheeks
Cause the Greeks don't want no freaks

She was the pride and the passion of Dixie
She did exactly what her daddy had planned
She was the perfect little sister until somebody missed her
And they found her in the bushes with the boys in the band
But the Greeks don't want no freaks
So put a great big smile on them rosy cheeks
Cause the Greeks don't want no freaks

An old true friend of ours was talkin' on the phone
She said you found someone
And I thought of all the bad luck
And the struggles we went through
And how I lost me and you lost you
What are these voices outside love's open door
Make us throw off our contentment
And beg for something more?
I'm learning to live without you now
But I miss you sometimes
I've been tryin' to get down to the Heart of the Matter
But my will gets weak
And my thoughts seem to scatter
But I think it's about forgiveness
Forgiveness
These times are so uncertain
There's a yearning undefined
... People filled with rage
We all need a little tenderness
How can love survive in such a graceless age
The trust and self-assurance that can lead to happiness
Pride and competition cannot fill these empty arms
And the work I put between us
Doesn't keep me warm

One in Rhode Island
Where the old world shadows hang
Heavy in the air
She packed her hopes and dreams
Like a refugee
Just as her father came
Across the sea
She heard about a place
People were smiling
They spoke about the red man's ways
And how they loved the land
And they came from everywhere
To the Great Divide
Seeking a place to stand
Or a place to hide
Down in the crowded bars
Out for a good time
Can't wait to tell you all
What it's like up there
And they called it paradise
I don't know why
Somebody laid the mountains low
While the town got high
See Eagles LiveGet tickets as low as $233You might also like
And then the chilly winds blew down
Across the desert
Through the canyons of the coast
To the Malibu
Where the pretty people play
Hungry for power
To light their neon way
And give them things to do
Some rich men came and raped the land
Nobody caught 'em
Put up a bunch of ugly boxes
And they called it paradise
The place to be
They watched the hazy sun
Sinking in the sea
You can leave it all behind
And sail to Lahaina
Just like the missionaries did
So many years ago
They even brought a neon sign
Jesus is coming
They brought the white man's burden down
Brought the white man's reign
Who will provide the grand design?
What is yours and what is mine?
'Cause there is no more new frontier
But we have got to make it here
We satisfy our endless needs
And justify our bloody deeds
In the name of destiny
And in the name of God
And you can see them there
On Sunday morning
And stand up and sing about
What it's like up there
They call it paradise
I don't know why
You call someplace paradise
I used to stay out till the break of day
Oh  that didn't get it
It was high time I quit it
I just couldn't carry on that way
Oh  I did some damage
I know it's true
Didn't know I was so lonely
Till I found you
You can go the distance
We'll find out
In the long run (In the long run)
We can handle some resistance
If our love is a strong one (Is a strong one)
People talking about us
They got nothin' else to do
When it all comes down
We will still come through

Tracks that ran down the boulevard had all been washed away
Out of the silver light  the past came softly calling
And I remember the times we spent inside the Sad Café
And we would sing right out loud  the things we could not say
We thought we could change this world with words like love and freedom
We were part of the lonely crowd inside the Sad Café
Oh  expecting to fly
We would meet on that beautiful shore in the sweet by and by
Some of their dreams came true  some just passed away
And some of them stayed behind  inside the Sad Café
{Acoustic Solo}
The clouds rolled in and hid that shore
Now that Glory Train  it don't stop here no more
Now I look at the years gone by and wonder at the powers that be

There must be someplace you can go
In the middle of the tall drinks and the drama
There must be someone you know
God knows you're looking good enough
But you're so smooth and the world's so rough
You might have something to lose
What you gonna do in those shoes?
Got those pretty little straps around your ankles
Got those shiny little chains around your heart
You got to have your independence
But you don't know just where to start
Desperation in the singles bars
An' all those jerkoffs in their fancy cars
You can't believe your reviews
Once you started wearing those shoes

Tell you anything you wanna hear
They give you tablets of love
They're waiting for you
Got to score you
Handy with a shovel and so sincere

At exactly the wrong time
Have been completely blind
So if you see me walking all alone
And I don't know what I might be on
She signed me to a contract
Baby said it would all be so life long
I looked around then for a reason
When there wasn't something more to blame it on
But if time makes a difference while we're gone
Tell me now and I won't be hanging on
And I don't know what I might be on
1320 North Columbus was the address
That I wrote down on my sleeve
I don't know just what she wanted
It might have been that it was getting time to leave

And I watched as the smoker passed it on
And I don't know what I might be on
Like a circle goes around
You were lost until you found out
What it all comes down to
One by one the lonely feelings come
Day by day they slowly fade away
You never know what might be found there
She was dancing right in time
And the moves she made so fine
Like the music that surrounds her
Should I stay or go? I really want to know
Would I lose or win if I try and love again?
It's only moments that you borrow
But the thoughts will linger on
Of the lady and her song
When the sun comes up tomorrow
To see through all these tears
Don't let go
Sometimes you need a friend
Gonna try
Gonna try
 but you're not
 I see a broken heart
 it's such an easy part
 pain and desire
 I'll tell you mine
 your been-around-the-world friends
 I see a broken heart
 we're not so far apart
 what kind of love have you got?
 I see a broken heart
 but I'm not
 we're not so far apart
 you're just a victim of love
 now you're a victim of love
Another summer's promise almost gone
And though I heard some wise man say
That every dog will have his day
He never mentioned that these dog days get so long
I don't know when I realized the dream was over
I just watched it slowly fade away
And I've been waiting in the weeds
Waiting for my time to come around again and
Hope is floating on the breeze
Carrying my soul high up above the ground and
I've been keeping to myself
Knowing that the seasons are slowly changing
Even though you're with somebody else
He'll never love you like I do
I've been biding time with the crows and sparrows
While peacocks prance and strut upon the stage
If finding love is just a dance
Proximity and chance
You will excuse me if I skip the masquerade

And I've been waiting in the weeds
Waiting for the dust to settle down along the
Back roads running through the fields
Lying on the outskirts of this lonesome town
And I imagine sunlight in your hair
You're at the county fair
You're holding hands and laughing
And now the ferris-wheel has stopped
You're swinging on the top
Suspended there with him
And he's the darling of the chic
The flavor of the week is melting
Down your pretty summer dress
I've been stumbling through some dark places
Now I'm following the plow
I know I've fallen out of your good graces
It's alright now
And I've been waiting in the weeds
Waiting for the summer rain to fall upon the
Wild birds scattering the seeds
Answering the calling of the tide's eternal tune
The phases of the moon
The chambers of the heart
The egg and dart of small gray
Spiders spinning in the dark
In spite of all the times the web is torn apart
And I've been waiting in the weeds
Waiting for the time to come around again and
Hope is floating on the breeze
Carrying my soul high up above the ground and
I've been keeping to myself
Knowing that the seasons are slowly changing
Even though you're with somebody else
With your little head down in your hand
Oh  my God  you can't believe
It's happening again
Your baby's gone  and you're all alone
And it looks like the end
And you're back out on the street
And you're trying to remember  oh
How do you start it over?
You don't know if you can
You don't care much for a stranger's touch
But you can't hold your man
You never thought you'd be alone
This far down the line
And I know what's been on your mind
You're afraid it's all been wasted time
The autumn leaves have got you thinking
About the first time that you fell  fell
You didn't love the boy too much
No  no  you just
Loved the boy too well

Before you went out on your own
Sometimes to keep it together
We've got to leave it alone
So you can get on with your search  baby
And I can get on with mine
And maybe someday we will find
Sparks fly from her fingertips
Echoed voices in the night
She's a restless spirit on an endless flight
See how high she flies
She got the moon in her eye
She held me spellbound in the night (Woo-ooh)
Dancing shadows and firelight
Crazy laughter in another room (Woo-ooh)
And she drove herself to madness with a silver spoon
See how high she flies
She got the moon in her eye
