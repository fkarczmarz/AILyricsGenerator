"No one else will know these lonely dreams
No one else will know that part of me
I'm still driving away and I'm sorry every day
I won't always love these selfish things
I won't always live not stopping
It was my turn to decide
I knew this was our time
No one else will have me like you do
You'll sit alone forever if you wait for the right time
What are you hoping for?
Holding on tight
Don't give away the end
The one thing that stays mine
Amazing still it seems
I'll be 23
I won't always love what I'll never have
I won't always live in my regrets

Holding on tight
Don't give away the end
Trying to find some peace along the way
Wish I knew how long I'm supposed to wait
Holding on but just barely
There's always a reason to let it change
There's always a reason for the pain
Never had anything to prove
But never was anyone like you

I keep my focus on the simple things
 looking around?
 you got to start sometime
 nostalgia won't let you down
 over and over
 over and over
On the drive back  I'll think it through
What you wish for won't come true
Live with that – with that
And on a Sunday  she thought it through
Now as I drive back  there's thirty-six less hours
I have to change the course I send myself
I gotta live with that – with that
The haze clears from your eyes on a Sunday
The haze clears from your eyes on a Sunday
On a Sunday
On a Sunday  go once around
'Cause when the ride's done  the hopes that you have carried
They fall out from your hands back to the ground

Then get found in unlikely places
A little presumption's all you need
To end up empty
Who really says they hope they'll meet the one
For the first time at a bar drinking early?
Easy enough to say Hey man  I'm done
And never hear them say
We go all the way
When to let the feelings show?
We take it all the way
Oh-oh  oh-oh
We get discouraged by the pointlessness
And we're pretty quick to judge things pointless
There's what I want and what I need
And the latter takes a while to see
It doesn't matter how often  how old
It starts with an awkward beginning
I believe that what I've learned has worth
And what I choose to do means something

One of us has to drive
One of us gets to think
I'll force a laugh to break the silence
It's gonna get harder still
Before it gets easy
You can't keep safe what wants to break
I'm alone in this
I'm as I've always been
Right behind what's happening
She's all lost in this
She's all like she'll always be
A little far for me to reach
I was just a boy like every other

I thought I was ten times smarter

It's only special once 'cause there's an ending
And we realize we're in a future memory
I can only use what I learn from you
And the rest I quietly accept and burn through
I can only be so much potentially
From the rest  I patiently request delivery
Don't worry where we end up
This ending up's not real

So we move to a cliffside
A shoreline nowhere
A freezing drive ahead with every crossing

Could we meet?
Show me all the things you see

Who believes with a shaken faith

I could leave you here with your 'people'

Eating away at my mind

There's blankets in back we can use
The cold can kill us before fumes
Now's the right time for a good song
Got something to say what I can't
Kiss me with your cherry lipstick
Never wash you off my face
Leave you with the love we made
Come alive on the driver's side
So close I taste your breath
Wine must go right to your head
It'd be easy if you get mad
But three fingers point back to you
We could stay here
Stay out all night
No one will know
Us and the moonlight

Kiss me with your cherry lipstick
Never wash you off my face
Leave you with the love we made
I set my watch by a street-side clock
A needle in echo groove
You pierce my heart like a willing arm
Your ticking makes my blood move
There's no way out this fade out
Be happy to get what you do
Make him notice with both fists
'Cause quitting alone will never get you dry
Never get you dry
Give me everything you've got now
I don't feel a single thing
Drag me out into the cold rain
Let it hover over me
Kiss me with your cherry lipstick
Never wash you off my face
Leave you with the love we made
Leave you with the love we made
I know
Gonna smile and not get worried
I try but it shows
Anyone can make what I have built and better now
Anyone can find the same white pills
It takes my pain away
And she's not breathing back
Anything but bother me
(It takes my pain away)
I can't let it bother me
I never thought I'd walk away from you
I did
But it's a false sense of accomplishment every time I quit
Anyone can see my every flaw
It isn't hard
Anyone can say they're above this all
It takes my pain away

I know I've made mistakes
I've always been afraid
(I've always been afraid)
A thousand nights or more
I travel east and north
But please answer the door
Can you tell me?
You say that love goes anywhere
But you're killing everything in me
Get down on your knees
Whisper what I need
Something pretty
(Something pretty)
I feel that when I'm old
I'll look at you and know the world was beautiful

Are you happy where you're standing still?
Do you really want the sugar pill?
I'll wake up tomorrow and I'll start
Tonight it feels so hard
As the train approaches Gare Du Nord
As I'm sure your kiss remains employed
Am I only dreaming?
You say that love goes anywhere
But you're killing everything in me
Happen and pass leaving me the same
Of course it must be something else
Leading questions I might ask myself
Sure and certain
Wander 'til we're old
Lost and lurking
Wonder 'til we're cold
What you do works for a time
Until you drop without a warning sign
If you keep going on like this
I'll be one more thing for you to miss

It never was your fault
But still a part to play
You carry it so close
You can read its name
In a lot of ways
You're still that lost kid

Gonna stand this ground
Gonna say it loud

Nowhere and then nowhere
Living trapped inside the chase

Got a picture of the look when I knew I'd lost you

I want out
I fall asleep with my friends around me
Only place I know  I feel safe
I'm gonna call this home
The open road is still miles away
Hey  nothing serious
We still have our fun
Oh  we had it once
But windows open and close

You told me often how it was
But I wasn't ready to hear it so plain
Amazing the effort we put in

You are free
And it's anything you think that means

To be who you want
What you need

But I'm the one that's gotta walk it
