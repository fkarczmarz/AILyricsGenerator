" one not on the list
 no one knows
 as he slowly fell apart
 for a while
 no one else
 sealed up tight
 as he slowly fell apart
Beautiful and strange
Upside down and not all here
What's wrong with me and you is crystal clear
Sometimes I'm in a room where I don't belong
And the house is on fire and there's no alarm
And the walls are melting too
How 'bout you?
'Til I got my invitation to the lunatic ball
And my friends are comin' too
How 'bout you?
You hope it disappears
It's just another unknown

Upside down and not all here
Sometimes I'm in a room where I don't belong
And the house is on fire and there's no alarm
And the walls are melting too
How 'bout you?
'Til I got my invitation to the lunatic ball
And my friends are comin' too
How 'bout you?
We're all just passin' through
Passengers on a ship of fools
We're all just passin' through
Passengers on a ship of fools
Sometimes I'm in a room where I don't belong
And the house is on fire and there's no alarm
And the walls are melting too
How 'bout you?
'Til I got my invitation to the lunatic ball
And my friends are comin' too
On a ship of fools
So we can move a little faster
I make it real
I'm not a glorious disaster
What part of living says you gotta die?
I plan on burning through another nine lives
Bloodshot against the clear blue sky
Dead scared cause I'm fearless in the head
Crack in the vision
Who said the motivation's all wrong?
Not your decision
The detonation of a time bomb
Which way is up
When your high is low?
It's time to find it
Are you ready to go?

Bloodshot against the clear blue sky
Dead scared cause I'm fearless in the head
It's the speed and the sound that I'm dying to try
It's the love of the chase that created the ride
Bloodshot against the clear blue sky
Dead scared cause I'm fearless in the head
I'll face the weather before me
In a while now  I'll race the irony
And buy back each word of my eulogy
All the uninvited tragedies
Step outside
Ask yourself now where would you be without
Days like this
When you finally collide with the moment you can't forget?
So do I remind you of
Someone you never met  a lonely silhouette?
And do I remind you of
Somewhere you wanna be  so far out of reach?
Oh-oh  I wish you'd open up for me
'Cause I wanna know you
Amaryllis
Bloom
Stay a while now  undress your colors
'Cause they're like no others I've ever seen
I could get used to your company

You've got it made
Yeah  the world is a stage
Where you can act out loud and rattle the cage
And remove any doubt that you're enraged
Like a fool  I guess  at the end of the day
You might be woke but not awake
Pray if you need it
Beg if you want it
Scream if you're for it
Devastation
Pray if you need it
Beg if you want it
Scream if you hate it
Desperation  the wrong information
Pray for your family and cry yourself to sleep
Pledge your allegiance to the flag under your feet
Is this apocalypse now? Who let the animals out?
Hip hip hooray  say something shocking

Don't be afraid  it's just America burning

Just a single second so you see
Far across that line
Turn it up so you can hear the bells
Crashing through the clouds
Acid rain down the drain
Careful what you say and who you say it

Hey!
Hey!
It’s 8 A.M
This hell I’m in
Seems I’ve crossed the line again
For being nothing more than who I am
So break my bones
And throw your stones
We all know that life ain’t fair
But there is more of us
We’re everywhere
We don’t have to take this
Back against the wall
We don’t have to take this
We can end it all
All you’ll ever be
Is a faded memory of a bully
Make another joke
While they hang another rope
So lonely
Push him to the dirt

Some questions are better left  without a reason
And I would rather reveal myself than my  situation
Now and then I consider  my hesitation
The more the light shines through me
I pretend to close my eyes
The more the dark consumes me
I pretend I'm burning  burning bright
I wonder if the things I did were just  to be different
To spare myself of the constant shame of  my existence
And I would surely redeem myself in my  desperation
Here and now I'll express  my situation
The more the light shines through me
I pretend to close my eyes
The more the dark consumes me
I pretend I'm burning bright

God knows I've tried
It's all that I can say
So I'll be on my way
I finally put it all together
But nothin' really lasts forever

I had to say goodbye for the last time
I kept my whole life in a suitcase
Never really stayed in one place

And now I know that I'm alive
I'm on the front line
Don't worry I'll be fine
The story is just beginning
I say goodbye to my weakness

And now I see the world through diamond eyes
Every night of my life
I watch angels fall from the sky
Every time that the sun still sets
I pray they don't take mine

Don't worry I'll be fine

Keep your dyslexia next to your imaginary friends
They all talk shit about the shape I'm in

They're breathin' rarified air
So pack your bags and leave a note
And thank the ones that kept you afloat
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

And gather all your hopes and dreams
They can keep you company

All alone I pierce the chain
And on and on the sting remains
And dying eyes consume me now

State of my head
It's been a long  bumpy ride
Sitting back in the saddle
It's time to get down  dirty up
Our knees in the battle
Come on  round up the boys
Gonna make the walls rattle
Oh  our flag is tattered
And our bones are shattered
But it doesn't matter
'Cause we're moving forward
Round 'em up  let's go
Oh  my eyes are seeing red
Double vision from the blood we've shed
The only way I'm leaving is dead
That's the state of my  state of my
State of my head
They don't know where we've been
We got that concrete-street skin

So I'd know yesterday was over
I put all your books on the top shelf
Even the one with the four-leaf clover
I took all your pictures off the wall
And wrapped them in a newspaper blanket
I haven't slept in what seems like a century
And now I can barely breathe
Just like a crow chasing the butterfly
Dandelions lost in the summer sky
When you and I were gettin' high as outer space
I never thought you'd slip away
I guess I was just a little too late
Your words still serenade me
Your lullabies won't let me sleep
I've never heard such a haunting melody
You know I can barely breathe

Not a scapegoat
Not a thing wrong
Except you're cutthroat

'Cause this ain't one for all
We got a ways to go

In thе miles between me and you
Here come the saints
Of violence and innuendo

You live in a world
Where empathy goes to die

Shoot the sad boy
Stab the pretty girl
Go buy some new toys

The guilted and faded notion of someone I once knew
All the perfect moments are wrong
All the precious pieces are gone
Everything that mattered is just a city of dust covering both of us
Did you hide yourself away?
I can't see you anymore
Did you eclipse another day?
I used to wake up to the color of your soul
Did you hide yourself away?
Are you living through the ghost?
Did you finally find a place above the shadows
So the world will never know...
The world will never know you like I do
So many silent sorrows you'll never hear from again
And now that you lost tomorrow  is yesterday still a friend?
All the bridges we built were burned
Not a single lesson was learned
Everything that mattered is just a city of dust covering both of us
Did you hide yourself away?

Even though it was framed and covered in dust
It’s the map in my mind that sends me on my way
They say it’s never too late to stop being afraid
And in the blink of an eye the past begins to fade
So have you ever been caught in a sea of despair?
And your moment of truth
Is the day that you say “I’m not scared”
Put your hands in the air if you hear me out there
I’ve been looking for you day and night
‘Cause I’m not gonna leave you behind
If I told you that you’re not alone
And I show you this is where you belong
Put your hands in the air one more time
I’ve seen a million miles met a million faces
Took all I knew to reach all these places
And I’d do it again if it brings me back to you

The strongest whiskey Kentucky can make
That's a recipe
To put a vagabond on his hands and knees
I saw a side of him he never showed
Full of sympathy
For a world that wouldn't let him be
That's the man he was
Have you heard enough?
To judge a life that you can't change
What a shame
To have to beg you to see
We're not all the same
What a shame
There's a hard life for every silver spoon
There's a touch of grey for every shade of blue
That's the way that I see life
And for this workin' man they say could barely stand
There's gotta be a better place to land
Some kind of remedy
