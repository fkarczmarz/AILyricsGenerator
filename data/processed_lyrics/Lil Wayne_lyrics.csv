lyrics
"They can't stop me
Even if they stopped me...
Run up in a nigga house and shoot his grandmother up
What! What! I don't give a motherfuck
Get your baby kidnapped and your baby-mother fucked
Fuck is up? Beat him up like a million uppercuts
Get on my level? You can't get on my level
You gon' need a space shuttle or a ladder that's forever
Don't you ever fix your lips unless you 'bout to suck my dick
It's the New Orleans nightmare
I'ma make sure we ball 'til we fall like tears
No sitting at the table if you bringing nothing to it
And I get straight to it like it's nothing to it

Young Money
Cover up my face like a ninja
I ain't switchin' up my hairstyle
But my niggas let it bang off
When my album drop these bitches is gon' cry in the car
You was tryin' too hard (Mm)
Me and Tunechi winnin' though
Slimes out here twinnin' though
These bitches pussy though
Pushed them out my pussy though
Niggas want my cookie though
'Cause it taste like cookie dough
Niggas don't mean my race when they say She blacked
I've been that bitch since ice cream with the sprinkles

I just fucked like five hoes in my mansion
Pop some X with my exotic dancer
Now she screamin' Rest In Peace to Honda
Put my face up in her pussy and my thumb in her ass
Now she butter pecan
Wearing high socks on the front porch
Two cups with the mud flowin'
The plug ain't charge me nothin' for it
I cried tears of fuckin' joy
Don't ask me where I'm fuckin' goin'
I pull up with my skaters
Make 'em beat you with their fuckin' boards
Sharp shooters like pool sharks
Shoot you down in the Walmart
Shoot you down in the parkin' lot
Shoot you down in the food court
Hit your crib in the Steamboat
Then disappear on the speedboat
Act a jackass like Steve-O
Then disappear like Neo
Leave a red flag on your screen door
Leave a red flag around your queen's throat
Leave a blood stain on your mink floor
Like a red stain on clean snow
And we walkin' around with bloody fangs
Throwin' up Eastside like stomach pains
I just fucked like five hoes in my mansion
Pop some X with my exotic dancer
Now she screamin' Rest in Peace to Honda
Switch her whip out put her in a Mercedes
Now she screamin' Rest in Peace to Mazda
Put her ass up in a dumb Mercedes
Now she screamin' Rest in Peace to Smart Car
Now she screamin' Rest in Peace to Kia
Switch her whip out put her in a Mercedes
Now she screamin' Rest in Peace to Uber
Six-six-foot  seven-foot  eight-foot bunch
Ahem
Excuse my charisma  vodka with a spritzer
Swagger down pat  call my shit Patricia
Young Money militia  and I am the commissioner
You no wan' start Weezy 'cause the 'F' is for finisher
So misunderstood  but what's a world without enigma?
Two bitches at the same time  synchronized swimmers
Got the girl twisted 'cause she open when you twist her
Never met the bitch  but I fuck her like I missed her
Life is the bitch  and death is her sister
Sleep is the cousin—what a fuckin' family picture
You know Father Time  and we all know Mother Nature
It's all in the family  but I am of no relation
No matter who's buyin'  I'm a celebration
Black and white diamonds  fuck segregation
Fuck that shit  my money up  you niggas just Honey Nut
Young Money runnin' shit  and you niggas just runner-ups
I don't feel I done enough  so I'ma keep on doin' this shit
Lil Tunechi or Young Tuna Fish  ha!
Six-foot  seven-foot  eight-foot bunch (Yeah)

Okay
I lost my mind  it's somewhere out there stranded
I think you stand under me if you don't understand me
Had my heart broken by this woman named Tammy
But hoes gon' be hoes  so I couldn't blame Tammy
Just talked to Moms  told her she the sweetest
I beat the beat up  call it self-defense
Swear  man  I be seein' through these niggas like sequins
Talkin' to myself because I am my own consultant
Married to the money  fuck the world  that's adultery
You full of shit  you close your mouth and let yo' ass talk
Young Money eatin'  all you haters do is add salt
Stop playin'  bitch  I got this game on deadbolt
Mind so sharp  I fuck around and cut my head off
Real nigga all day and tomorrow
But these ma'fuckers talkin' crazy like they jaw broke
Glass half empty  half full  I'll spill ya
Try me and run into a wall  outfielder
You know I'ma ball 'til they turn off the field lights
The fruits of my labor  I enjoy 'em while they still ripe
Bitch  stop playin'  I do it like a king do
If these niggas animals  then I'ma have a mink soon
Tell 'em bitches I say put my name on the wall
I speak the truth  but I guess that's a foreign language to y'all
And I call it like I see it  and my glasses on
But most of y'all don't get the picture 'less the flash is on
Satisfied with nothin'  you don't know the half of it
Young Money  Cash Money... uh
Bitch  real G's move in silence like lasagna
People say I'm borderline crazy  sorta kinda
Woman of my dreams  I don't sleep  so I can't find her
You niggas are gelatin  peanuts to an elephant
I got through that sentence like a subject and a predicate
Yeah  with a swag  you would kill for
Money too strong  pockets on bodybuilder
Jumped in a wishin' well  now wish me well
Tell 'em kiss my ass  call it kiss and tell
Yeah  word to my mama  I'm out of my lima bean
Don't wanna see what that drama mean  get some Dramamine
Llama scream  hotter than summer sun on a Ghana queen
Now all I want is hits  bitch  Wayne signed a fiend
I-I play the side for you niggas that's tryna front  and see
Son of Gun  Son of Sam  you niggas the son of me
Pause for this dumber speech  I glow like Buddha
Disturb me  and you'll be all over the flo' like Luda
And I keep a killer ho  she gon' blow right through ya
I be mackin'  'bout my stackin'  amount I pack like a mover
Shout to ratchet for backin' out on behalf of my shooter
Niggas think they high as I  I come laugh at your ruler
These niggas out they mind  I done told these fuck niggas so many times
Bitch  I'm a man  I visit urinals abroad
Tune told me to  I'm shootin' when the funeral outside
I'm uptown  thoroughbred  a BX nigga
Young Money!
You dig?
Tougher than Nigerian hair
My criteria compared to your career just isn't fair
And the almighty power of that ch-cha-cha-cha-chopper

And it ain't trickin' if you got it
But you like a bitch with no ass: You ain't got shit
Who that said they gon' beat Lil Wayne?
I don't owe you like two vowels
And I'd rather be pushin' flowers
Than to be in the pen sharin' showers
Tony told us this world was ours
And the Bible told us every girl was sour
Don't play in her garden and don't smell her flower
Call me Mr. Carter or Mr. Lawn Mower
Even Gwen Stefani said she couldn't doubt me
They don't see me but they hear me
They don't feel me but they fear me
Is the one that leads back to you
And I know the only compass that I need
Is the one that leads back to you  back-back
But that's neither here nor there  she been contemplatin' short hair
She said she tryna be different but she just like the rest of these bitches
But that's neither here nor there  and my dick is her chair
It be sexual warfare  I be loaded like software
Got so many hoes I'm hoein'  but she the only one worth knowin'
I ain't tripping  but she be tripping
They ain't got shit on me  but she keep sniffing
Them hoes say I'm a dog  but how come I don't chase 'em?
I lick her with no chaser  I pick her out a line up
But she been wanting to break up since Dolce and Gabbana
I'm dying to meet her girl  but she want me to meet her momma
Swear I may go Issey Miyake  Bond no. 9
The weed is funky  but I'm smelling fine

I'm not tryna find nobody else to beat

Believe me
It's been me and Young Tune off the rip
That's the man that put me in this shit

V Live just took me for a cheque
Mothafuck award shows and mothafuck the press like that
Mothafuck the rest
I'd give what I collect before I give up my connect
Niggas know what that mean like they deaf
Nigga I'll fire this nina like it's her first day
On the job and the bitch overslept
Need a horn and a drumroll
I don't step on one rose
I'm the only one that get the job done
I don't know a nigga that can cover for me
Tape a couple kilos to the bitch stomach
She look like she got a bun in the oven from me
All you gotta do is pay me every week
I had these bitches havin' babies every week
Gone
I live it up like these are my last days
If time is money  I'm an hour past paid
Ugh  gunpowder in my hourglass
Niggas faker than some flour in a powder bag
Yeah  I put it down like my hands hurting
I'm on a natural high  but I land perfect
Some of us are lovers  most of y'all haters
But I put up a wall  and they just wallpaper
So love or hate me  I stay hate-free
They say we learn from mistakes  why  that's why they mistake me
I got some weight on my shoulders  to me it's like feathers
All hail Weezy  call it bad weather
I stick to the script  I memorize the lines
Cause life is a movie that I've seen too many times
You're on the outside looking in  close the blinds
And I'm a blunt-blowin'  Polo-drawers-showin'

High above the ground but I'm under her charisma
Her sound is in surround when I'm in her solar system

And the U-turn sign's lookin' like a smile
Nowhere to turn but around and round

I'm number 9-27-82
Color blind even if I may be blue
Need my family tree next to a money tree
With a bunch of leaves in the Garden of Eden
I sip from the Fountain of Youth
Bury me in New Orleans
Bring me back to life
Got to lose a life just to have a life

Lord knows who I'm there for
I give my last breath of air for
Mama tell me to be careful
Voice in my head give me an earful
But I got mind control over my control
I lost control but knew I'd find control
I let God control what I cannot control
And triple extension on my motherfuckin' afterlife
Hate in my heart  love in my mind
I seen nights full of pain  days are the same
You keep the sunshine  save me the rain
I search but never find  hurt but never cry
And it's worse  but better times seem further and beyond
The top gets higher the more that I climb
The spot gets smaller and I get bigger
Tryna get in where I fit in  no room for a nigga
But soon for a nigga it be on  ma'fucker

My country 'tis of thee
Sweet land of kill 'em all and let 'em die

The end of time is like a hour away  damn
Military-minded  lost and can't find it
The stars on the flag are never shinin'
Uh  I saw a butterfly in Hell today
Will I die or go to jail today?
'Cause I live by the sword and die by the sword
Heard police was lookin' for me  I'ma hide by a broad
Shootin' stars in my pocket  bitch  sit on my rocket
I'm wired out the socket  but still shockin'
Everybody wanna tell me what I need
You can play a role in my life but not the lead
If there's food for thought then I'm guilty of greed

Get them on the line  stay two cars behind
And tell them hoes  Don't be so obvious!
She handle the business and don't ever tell
She bite the bullet and cough up the shell
And if he say yeah   then we meet 'em there
She feed him lies with his silverware
Know a bitch named Liz
This nigga think she his 'cause she tell him that it is
And then she tell me  and I be all ears
Then I go and tell my people  and they already know it
And then I call Liz  and she say he coming over
We waiting outside  watch him pull up
Walk up to the door  and right before he knocked
She open the door naked  she left it unlocked
They started French kissing so he didn't see moi
And then she let him in  they stopped on the couch
Music up loud with his head in the clouds
Turn that shit down  and I scared the piss out him
Piss a nigga off  put the gun to his frown
I ain't here to fuck around  caught you with your pants down
You know what it is  put your fucking hands up!
Then he looked dead at her and he shook his head at her
She a good actress  and you a dead actor
You'll be dead after we get what we after
I got way too many bitches that do anything for me  nigga
But think for me  nigga
Send her to you like she ain't for me  nigga
I hope you alone like bankruptcy  nigga
Mona Lisa  I done painted the picture
Mo-Mona Lisa  out the frame on these niggas
Pussy got you out of character  nigga
You fall for these hoes off your ladder  my nigga
Take everything that you have 'til you don't even have
An opinion  we have your attention
And now you looking down a barrel though  nigga
Now she looking for her pantyhose  nigga
We just looking for the casserole  nigga
Ah  every day she wake up with a different color makeup
And a promise he gon' take her to the movie and the mall
For a minute on the clock  Black Mamba with the ball
Probably on an internet blog
In a minute  he gon' be admitting that he love her
(Mona Lisa)
Pussy good enough  it got him sinning in the walls
And he digging in it like he living in it  make a new religion with it
Man  a nigga 'bout to go against God
Poetry in the pear trees
Sweet tone like a hummingbird when she asked him
Did he want to make love in a yellow taxi?
Never gave two fucks  jumped in the backseat
Woke up in the morning to The Great Gatsby
Then he dogged it again like the bitch Lassie
I'm a dog in the wind  I'm a pet laughing
I'ma call up again like I did last week
Make good with the friend  and I'm all jazzy
Britney with the twin and the girl  Ashley
Found out that I fucked  he was unhappy
Bitch  I never let the bullshit get past me
'Bout no motherfucking double standard  acting
Fucking on another nigga  that's a negative alone
But you sucked his dick? That's just nasty
You fucking with Wayne's!? (No!)
He on your fucking ringtone!? Is that the shit that you do!?
Touching yourself  looking at Kendrick videos
Jump on the internet  watching his interviews
I don't know what the fuck lately gotten into you
Tell me who love you  I bet I love harder
Forgot all the shit that I did for your daughter?
The Pampers  the Pedialyte and my momma
Daycare after school and she never did charge ya
You scandalous as fuck  and I hope you blow up
You know what? I give up  let me go get my gun
I got one in the chamber I'm planning on aiming
Goddammit  you know that the damage is done
Bitch  I'm emotional 'cause I'm in stress
I'm not supposed to go through this  I guess
So in conclusion
Since you like rappers that's killing that pussy  I'm killing myself
Mona Lisa  Mona Lisa
Ooh  fake smile (Ooh)

I'ma need a coupe  I won't need a roof
I got the flow  I'm tryin' to see the roof
Didn't wear a bulletproof so I got shot and you can see the proof
Blind eyes could look at me and see the truth
Wonder if Stevie do?
Man  I got summer hatin' on me cause I'm hotter than the sun
Got spring hatin' on me 'cause I ain't never sprung
Winter hatin' on me 'cause I'm colder than y'all
I'm being hated by the seasons
So fuck y'all who hatin' for no reason

Married to the money  a true love story

Just had a bowl of riches  and a cup of wealth
And the F is for Fuck yourself

What is my meaning? My reason?
Naked bitches really love ones
Sometimes our loved ones don't love us
I'm fuckin' more than I'm makin' love
Sometimes I make my rubber wear a rubber
Even though I make it look easy
But understand looks are deceiving
Lookin' like I'm lookin' for some grievance
Doctor ain't prescribin' what he ain't realizin'
Pain inside me got me thinkin' 'bout me
I'm a gangsta dyin' 'cause all gangsters die
Feel like a anchor tied to my finger
Got me sinkin' to the bottom of my drink
I know a lotta niggas think I got a lotta niggas
There's strength in numbers but it's honor over strength
I hope it gave you chills
The dirt under your feet could be the grave you fill
You don't know how dead you feel 'til you're dead for real
What's the life expectancy when you don't expect shit?
Don't get too high to look over blessings
They so precious
Where the weed? I feel like I'm gettin' a sober headache
Lookin' in the mirror at the one that know me better

I bought me a double-R
'Cause I went from rags to riches
And these niggas nag like bitches
Actin' like little fags like Richard
And all of my bitches be bad as vision
You got a problem
I can fix it like a mathematician
I am-munition
Call me ammo for short
Trukfit shirt  camo the shorts

Bow! Get the fuck though  I don't bluff  bro
Aimin' at your head like a buffalo
You a roughneck  I'm a cutthroat
You're a tough  guy  that's enough jokes
Then the sun die  the night is young though
The diamonds still shine in the rough  ho
What the fuck though? Where the love go?
It's a shit show  put you front row
Talkin' shit  bro? Let your tongue show
Money over bitches  and above hoes
That is still my favorite love quote
Put the gun inside  what the fuck for?
I sleep with the gun  and she don't snore
What the fuck  yo? Where the love go?
Trade the ski mask for the muzzle
It's a blood bath  where the suds go?
It's a Swizz beat  there the drums go
If she's iffy  there the drugs go
If she sip lean  double-cup toast
I got a duffle full of hundos
There the love go  where's the uproar?

Yellow diamonds up close  catch a sunstroke
At your front door with a gun stowed
Knock  knock. Who's there? is how it won't go
This the jungle  so have the utmost
For the nutzos  and we nuts  so
What the fuck  bro? It's where I'm from  bro
We grow up fast  we roll up slow
We throw up gang signs  she throw up dope
Dreadlock hang down like you dun know
Put the green in the bag like a lawnmower
Hair trigger pulled back like a cornrow
Extra clip in the stash like a console
Listenin' to Bono  you listen to Donald
What the fuck  bro? Where the love go?
Swizzy  he the chef  I like my lunch gross
Just look up  bro  there the Scuds go
I see the shovel  but where did bruh go?
Hmm  to the unknown
Only way he comin' back is through his unborns
If you see what's in my bag  think I'm a drug lord
It's empty when I give it back  now where's the uproar?
What the fuck though? Where the love go?

Down here waiting for her to come like payday
Hoping this juice is sweeter than baked cake
She say Tunechi go slower and Tunechi went faster
I give her wood when he wouldn't
I hope that pussy tastes like pudding
And I get that ho the boot
I'ma leave that ass smoking like a Amsterdam tourist
This shit is target practice and your bitch is my gun range
This pussy so clean like soap in your mouth
If that dick like a tree watch me build a treehouse
I stay on that dick like a fucking balance beam nigga
Dedication 5!
Since '05!
Know that!
You feel like Kool-Aid in a wine glass with your fine ass
You fine as two grapes gettin' stomped out by a giant cask
You the best dressed with your breasts showing
They don't ask for a pass when your ass waltz in my dress room
You the best bride and I'm the best groom
Wedding presents got my best man at the Best Buy
Buyin' the Best of Fresh Prince for the bedroom
And a car with no backseat and some leg room
And some strawberries and some chocolate
And a fridge and some broccoli
'Cause I know you like vegetables even though I don't
I won't say I won't eat it if you chef it
Brown as the bosom I flew in on
Nose round like the wheels that my rims spin on
So we could kick the butler out and we can make a muffin
Maybe bake a dozen
You feel like Kool-Aid in a wine glass

I just happen to love you
I just happen to love you
I just happen to love you
I just happen to love you
Give you the world if it was for me
Thinking about yo ass and how it look like a big smile
Do you really love me? I tried to change the subject
So I said some crazy shit to her like
What if you and I were just letters?
You remind me of... my memory ain't what it used to be
And when she figure out that she been swindled
I'll be cleaning that love bird shit off of my window
I-I love you too...
I just happen to love you
I just happen to love you
I just happen to love you
I just happen to love you
I mean how many times
How many times I gotta
How many times I gotta say it for it to count?
Are you counting?
I loved the pictures
I was just thinking about you when you sent them too
You don't believe me? I know"
