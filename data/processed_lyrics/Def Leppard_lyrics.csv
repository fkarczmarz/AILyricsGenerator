lyrics
"I'm gonna make my own movie
I wanna star in a late night show
And all I need is my video
Curtain up let the camera roll
Because all I need is some
Come on and shock me
Let the cameras roll
With your wine and your caviar
So cut me in on the action

I need action
Let the camera roll
I need a little
 do you want
 everybody wants a piece of the action
 I was suicidal cause you was my idol
 there was a time I would have walked the line
 everybody wants a piece of the action
 do you want action?
 everybody needs
 everybody needs
Such a lust for life  the circus comes to town
We are the hungry ones  on a lightning raid
Just like a river runs  like a fire needs flame
Oh  I burn for you
I cry wolf  given mouth to mouth
Like a moving heartbeat  in the witching hour
I'm running with the wind  a shadow in the dust
I never sleep
Huh! Oh! Cry wolf baby  cry tough
Going to take your love and run

He's laughing at me and dancing on my sneakers
And his sixties songs are blowing up my speakers
Respect for authority
You're just playing your dirty tricks

Whoa
Confusion in his mind  the blind leads the blind
He's got evil in his eyes  got a reason to despise
There's danger in the air
Can you feel it in the air?

Danger
(Such a strange emotion)
Can you feel it in the air?
(Oh  yeah)
Oh  he was locked inside a room without a door
His innocence he suffered for  in a world of black and white
They were wrong and he was right
Just looking for a clue  it's a nightmare come true
He's going underground to track that danger down
Can you feel it in the air?

You hear footsteps in the night  see shadows on the wall
And the ghostly sound of silence  as the mist begins to fall
Then a scream rang out like thunder but the lightning was too late
As the rain came down on the crimson ground was the hand of fate
And a crowd of people gathered around but Billy couldn't wait

And drift away leaving an illusion
To close my eyes a touch away from wanting you
Don't try to look away when you're face to face

Moving to the rhythm of your heartbeat
Going to move into your room

 sugar
But a bottle of whiskey lies heavy obstructing my view
I've got a bottle of pills to give me my thrills
And I know that I'm leading a life that kills
Wasted - I've wasted my time
Wasted - I'm shooting a line
Wasted - I'm stuck in a hole
Wasted - I'm losing control
You see I don't like the thought of leaving you here alone
Well I've seen things down here that are fit for a queen
I've seen things down here that should never be seen
Wasted - I've wasted my money
Wasted - I've wasted you honey
Wasted - I'm out of my brain

I'm running in thin air
There's nothingness everywhere

I feel so uninvited
A wound that never heals
I need a little shelter
Just for a little while
Sometimes I hide the sadness
Behind a painted smile
If you cast the first stone
I will roll it away
I will kneel at your throne
Hold my hands up and pray
I will hold back the tide
Push the oceans aside
Save the day
But I can be stronger
You’re all that I am
You’re all that I see
The keys to the kingdom
Are waiting for me
So don’t hold me back
Don’t hold me down
Just hold me and don’t let go

Screams the words I believe

Got my hands on your heart gonna take it

You could have a change of heart  if you would only change your mind
Cause I'm crazy 'bout you baby  time after time

Can't stop the hurt inside
When love and hate collide
