lyrics
"Has somewhere to go
And the faster the world spins
The shorter the lights will glow
And I'm swimming in the night
Chasing down the moon
The deeper in the water
The more I long for you
Because not everything that goes around comes back around  you know
Holdin' on too long is just a fear of letting go
Because not everything that goes around comes back around  you know
One thing that is clear  it's all downhill from here
The love line in your hand
Cleverly disguised
All the promises of stone
Crumble in the light
Because not everything that goes around comes back around  you know
Holdin' on too long is just a fear of what to show
Because not everything that goes around comes back around  you know
Not everything that goes around comes back around  you know
One thing that is clear  it's all downhill from here
Tell me it ain't nothing  that's what I wanna hear
Take the lie to the grave
That's what an old friend told me  look what it did for him
Oh-oh-oh-oh  oh-oh-oh-oh
The truth hurts so bad  wouldn't you say?
So why tell it?
If ignorance is bliss  then I'm in
Heaven now
Run  you'll never escape
You'll see you go nowhere  so new you appear
Broke  laid to waste
Turn into sweet nothings  kiss you goodbye
Oh-oh-oh-oh  oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh  oh-oh-oh-oh
The truth hurts so bad  wouldn't you say?
So why tell it?
If ignorance is bliss  then I'm in
Heaven now

Keep goin' over and over again
The never ending places I've never been
No one's catchin' on  callin' my bluff
The Devil made me holier than every man

What'd you do? Say it with a smile  boy

A new religion's prescribed to those without the faith
A hero holding a knife  and blood is not enough
Is it too late to go back? Is it too late to go?
There's no one here (There's no one here)
And people everywhere (People everywhere)
You're on your own
Let's see if I'm hearing this right  you suggest I should take
A never-ending supply to carry out the dead
Your idols burn in the fire  the mob comes crawlin' out

Holding hands
Skippin' like a stone
On our way
To see what we have done
The first to speak
Is the first to lie
The children cross
Their hearts and hope to die
Bite your tongue
Swear to keep your mouth shut
Ask yourself
Will I burn in Hell?
Then write it down
And cast it in the well
There they are
To twist the tale
Into firewood
Fan the flames
With a little lie
Then turn your cheek
Until the fire dies
What it was
I will never say

Nothing inside
And there's no reason to cry
Just fade away like love
Clutching  hanging
By a nail in this life
Desperate always
Always looks that way
Free fall from the nest  then glide to the left
A shine catch the eye  so flow to the right
Flying high  realize there are no more mountains to climb
When there's nothing I can do
Accept  enjoy the view
When there's nothing I can do
I smile
Minutes  seconds
And so little time
Give your secrets away?
Well  whisper in my ear
Every living thing will die
From the king of the jungle to butterfly
The only sin is waiting too long

We fail  we rise
I'm a vulture  so I hear goodbyes
There's no end to life
On and on  always life
Bewilderness comes to reclaim everything
Burning bridge lights up the sky
Zip your lip until you've picked a side
You get right up then sit back down
A revolution is one spin around
You get back up then sit right down
A revolution is one spin ('round)
Beat the kids to the punch
You get right up then sit back down
A revolution is one spin 'round
You get back up then sit right down

I was born in the desert  May
17 in '73
When the needle hit the groove  I commenced a-movin'
I was chasing what's callin' me
Oh-oh-oh  feet don't fail me now
One foot in the gutter  one in the clouds
Feet don't fail me now

You wander through the darkness of wilderness behind your eyes
I know you're afraid  but you gotta move on

How to do it right
You're a holy roller
If you're bettin' to lose
If you're hangin' around
I'm holdin' the noose
Come a little bit closer
And get untied
In a hearse rollin' over
Just a track in the line  fuck it

Nobody's coming down the hall
And nobody echoes in my head
Nobody ever needed it
I got what was
I want to take what's left (Ready now)
Beautiful senses are gone
Canary in a gilded cage
Singin'
I will poison you all

This halo 'round my neck

Ooh
We're all a little tangled
But I'm for letting go
Here we come
A modern movement to give it away
You've got somethin'  that I understand
Hold it in tightly  call on command
Leap of faith  do you doubt?
Cut you in  I just cut you out
Whatever you do
Don't tell anyone
Whatever you do
Don't tell anyone
Look for reflections in your face
Canine devotion  time can't erase
Out on the corner  or locked in your room
I never believe them  and I never assume
Stuck in belief  there is a lie
Promise is promise  an eye for an eye
We've got somethin' to reveal
No one can know how we feel

Has left me crawlin'
Staring straight at the sun
Every dog has his day
I paid attention
Cost me so much to hate
For so long
I saw only wrong
But now to remind

Close your eyes and see the skies are fallin'

Nothing blank I don't know
It's hard deflecting

'Cause I'm all alone in this crowd
Who are you to me? Who am I supposed to be?
Where's this going to? Can I follow through?
Or just follow you for a while?
Does anyone ever get this right?
I feel no love
The illusion that you feel is real
To be vulnerable is needed most of all
If you intend to truly fall apart
You think the worst of all is far behind
The vampire of time and memories
