lyrics
"Taking our time doing whatever we want
You put your hand on top of my hand
You put your hand on top of my hand
No dark side for us
No fights just because
I love how love feels
So can we stay in this dream like we are 17?
Where we never get angry or bitter or lonely
Can we stay in this dream like we are 17?
Where we keep goin' nonstop down the block
Sneaking our way into every single club
And I have one too many I think
We didn't know we could get messed up from it
And all we really wanted was
You might also like
No sleepless nights
I miss how that feels
So can we stay in this dream like we are 17?
Where we never get angry or bitter or lonely
Can we stay in this dream like we are 17?
We can go in for another round
We can go in for another round
Didn't even care that we made the traffic stop
You put your hand on top of my hand
So can we stay in this dream like we are 17? (Can we stay?)
Where we never get angry or bitter or lonely
Can we stay in this dream like we are 17?
We can go in for another round
When your hopes are in despair
If your desires have strings
'Cause any wish that's got your heart
On the edge of breaking
Is a wish worth making
To be something someday somewhere
Even kings and queens
Daydream to be free from their royal chairs
Even when you're not sleeping
Is a drеam worth dreaming
Playing in thе sun
Then we grow up with wild dreams
Just waiting for our day to come
You might also like
So if hope schemes against time
But just show them they're better when paired
'Cause if they both can hold your heart
There's no way you're not sowing
A dream that will never stop growing
On the edge of breaking
 what you've done
 I don't need your previous logistics
 oh
 that I should try to empathize
 I'm the only thing you see
I tell 'em to fuck off  I'm holding hands with my depression
And right when I think I've overcome it
Anxiety starts kicking in to teach that shit a lesson
Oh  I try my best just to be social
I make all these plans with friends and hope they call and cancel
Then I overthink about the things I’m missing
Now I'm wishing I was with 'em
Feel like I'm always apologizing for feeling
Like I'm out of my mind when I'm doing just fine
And my exes'll say that I'm hard to deal with
And I admit it  yeah
They don't understand why I can't sleep through the night
I've been told that I could take something to fix it
All my friends they don't know what it's like  what it's like
Always wanted to be one of those people in the room
That says something and everyone puts their hand up
If you hate someone  put your hand up
If you're scared  put your hand up

Feel like I'm always apologizing for feeling
Like I'm out of my mind when I'm doing just fine
And my exes will say that I'm hard to deal with
And I admit it  it's true
They don't understand why I can't sleep through the night
And I thought that I could take something to fix it
All my friends they don't know what it's like  what it's like
I got all these thoughts  running through my mind
All the damn time and I can't seem to shut it off
I think I'm doing fine most of the time
I think that I'm alright  but I can't seem to shut it off
I got all these thoughts  running through my mind
All the damn time and I can't seem to shut it off
I think I'm doing fine most of the time
I say that I'm alright  but I can't seem to shut it off
They don't understand why I can't sleep through the night
I've been told that I could take something to fix it
All my friends they don't know what it's like  what it's like
Li-i-i-i-ike
What it's like  what it's like
Hmm-mm-mm  mmm
What it's like
In your apartment on the weekends
Lift up my dress to see where you've been
That's what I want and that's where I am
Bite off an apple right from your fridge
Come here and taste it right off my lips
Spill your emotions into my hands
That's what I want
I smell like a rose  can I have you in doses?
No  I don't wanna fight  but I will if you like
I don't swim  I just dive right into those blue-green eyes
Kissing in summer  so innocent
In your apartment on the weekends
Lift up my dress to see where you've been
That's what I want and that's where I am
Bite off an apple right from your fridge
Come here and taste it right off my lips
Spill your emotions into my hands
That's what I want

And da da da da da da
The sun in our eyes  this love is blind
Let's not decide whether we're too far gone
'Cause I'd rather be
Kissing in summer  so innocent
In your apartment on the weekends
Lift up my dress to see where you've been
That's what I want and that's where I am
Bite off an apple right from your fridge
Come here and taste it right off my lips
Spill your emotions into my hands
That's what I want (That's what I want)
Oh oh  oh  oh da-da-dumn
That's what I
Dum da-da-dum  oh
'Cause there's somethin' too real to let it slide
I don't need your words to get me goin'
Let your body language set the tone
Save all your emotions for the motion
Don't make me go at this alone (Okay)
Up and down in your direction
I keep lookin'
Up and down in your direction
And I feel you watchin' too
Are you thinkin' the same thing I'm thinkin'?
Are you? Are you? Are you? Are you?
Are you openin' doors to your feelings?
Are you? Are you? Are you? Are you?
Are you thinkin' the same thing I'm thinkin'?

My subconscious goes
And yours goes
Are you thinkin' the same thing I'm thinkin'?
Are you? Are you? Are you? Are you?
Are you openin' doors to your feelings? (To your)
Are you? Are you? Are you? Are you?
Are you thinkin' the same thing I'm thinkin'?
I know that I'm the reason that you're so insecure
Think that I'd know better as I get a little older
I'm sorry I'm a bitch to ya
I know that I'm the reason you don't smile anymore
Think I'd learned my lesson 'cause now I'm feeling empty
You say all of these things are just in my mind
Kiss me 'til I'm alright
I just wanna love my body like you love my body
I wanna look in the mirror and tell it that it's beautiful like you do
I wanna love my body like you love my body
Wanna make it feel like it's incredible like you do (Oh)
Love my body like I love your body
I'm sorry I don't let you go out with your friends
And you said I harp on you too much
So you put a sweatshirt on 'cause you gave up
And you stayed in it 'til you waked up

I just wanna love my body like you love my body
I wanna look in the mirror and tell it that it's beautiful like you do (Oh)
I wanna love my body like you love my body
To love you and let you go
But you’re cloudin' up my judgement every time
You give me chills when you look at me like that
I don't know how I feel
Somebody left me feeling empty
And somebody ripped me at the seams
But you're bringing back all my feelings
You're bringing back all of my feelings
I'm deep divin' into your emotions
But you're bringing back all my feelings
You're bringing back all of my feelings
It’s becoming less
Less about what I know and more about what I think
I think that I go crazy every time your lips on mine

Uh
Can't you see it from where you stand?
Can't you see it from where you stand? (Shy away)
You haven't been you in a while
I know that you know I'm knowin' too (?)
I miss the things we used to do
Before the Hell that got hold of you (?)
I miss the things we used to do
Make love til Monday
Fight on a Tuesday
Hold on for two days
Scream in the worst way on Thursday
Fall back in love on a Friday
Now it gets hard to see you this vulnerable
I would do anything for you
Don't even have to ask me
I would walk to the end for you
'Cause I care about you so Deeply
And if you needed me right there
Scream my name from a distance
'Cause I care about you so Deeply
Care about you so Deeply

A touch on the skin if you really want
A laugh that can make life less exciting

But I love the unknown

Fall back in love on a Friday
Now it gets hard to see you this vulnerable

Scream my name from a distance
'Cause I care about you so Deeply
I guess that I should probably write one 'cause
I'm feelin' pretty lonely
He's the only thing that holds me right now
Now I'm not really one for drinkin' songs but
I guess if I'm not wrapped here in your arms then
I can't talk about love
And who wants to talk about love?
I don't want us
Don't wanna think about you right now
And I'd show up at your house
All screamin' at your door
I thought that we were good enough
I thought that you needed love
Don't wanna think about you right now

Now I'm not really one for drinkin' songs but
Heartbreak is annoying
And I'll feel it in the morning
Swallow it down like a bitter pill
At least it'll taste better than this feeling will
And I don't like myself when I'm just standing still
Don't wanna think about you right now
And I'd show up at your house
All screamin' at your door
I thought that we were good enough
I thought that you needed love
I know that when I wake up there's gonna be seven texts and three calls to you
And I'm not gonna know what to do
And I'll make up some excuse about how that was meant for someone else
It's a sad day when your papa sees you cry
Over yet another guy  add another tally line
That's about five that he can beat down
If he sees 'em in the street now (Eh)
And it's a sad day when you start to realize
That you got a certain type  ain't avoiding what you like
I could sniff mine out in a line-up
And take 'em home with me  I might just
I want  I want  I wanna love me right
Don't want you on my mind
Hoping for change (I do  yeah)
I want  I want  I wanna love me right
Not getting sleep at night
Hoping for change (Ah)
'Cause I like (Uh)
Guys with big lips that treat me like shit
That only want my hips when it's convenient for them
People I can fix that leave when they're good again
I keep falling for boys and mistaking 'em for men
Mistaking 'em (I like them)

Where I can't go out with the opposite sex
I want that fucked up kinda love
Where you get mad at me for something you did
Then I chase you down the block trying to apologize
For what?
All of my friends say I probably shouldn't be with you

I don't usually stay for mornin' coffee
But I don't wanna waste you
On feelings I can't do
I don't say this about just anybody (Huh-uh)
Would you follow suit if it felt right?
What you've been waitin' for isn't even mine anymore
'Cause I lost my heart in a love fight (I lost my heart in a love—)
You don't even know how bad I want this (Want this)
But Confucius says stop being cautious

Heartbeat as cold as a glacier
You told me I was your savior
We used to burn up like paper
So don't let this fire burn out yet
'Cause we've got a lot to burn
Don't let this fire burn out yet
So we don't have to say that at least we tried
How much does it take for a heart to break?

Love me and sometimes you hate me

Something so sacred  so hard to replace
Fallin' for him was like fallin' from grace
All wrapped in one  he was so many sins
Would have done anything  everything for him
And if you ask me  I would do it again
No need to imagine 'cause I know it's true
They say  All good boys go to Heaven
But bad boys bring heaven to you
It's automatic  it's just what they do
They say  All good boys go to Heaven
But bad boys bring heaven to you
You don't realize the power they have
Until they leave you and you want them back
Nothing in this world prepares you for that
I'm not ashamed that he wasn't the one
Had no idea what we would become
There's no regrets  I just thought it was fun
No need to imagine 'cause I know it's true
They say  All good boys go to Heaven
But bad boys bring heaven to you
It's automatic  it's just what they do

It's automatic  it's just what they do
They say  All good boys go to Heaven
What was your teacher's name in third grade?
Do you cry when movies hit home?
Do you hate your family on holidays?
Have you ever had an existential crisis?
Have you ever really had a lover like this?
'Cause we could be history in the making
'Cause we could be history in the making
At what age did you have sex?
Did you have a teenage phase with cigarettes?
Do you ever miss your ex?
Do you have a fear of dying with a long list of regrets?
A million things you never said?
Does it keep you up? Are you thinking 'bout it when we lay in bed?
'Cause we could be history in the making
'Cause we could be history in the making

Screaming and fighting for nothing at all
Last night was a hard one
Pinning each other against the wall
We make each other small
I know we make each other fall
When we don't resolve what was said
How are we to just forget?
When the night is ringing in our heads
I'm too opinionated
And your mama's gonna hate it
You don't fit in with my friends
I see them gettin' jealous
'Cause you take up all my weekends
You remind me of my past
That's how I know that this won't last
And I know I should go pack
But where's the fun in that?
Feel some type of way whenever you're with me
You can't read my emotions
Whether I keep them closed in
Or out there in the open
You're so back and forth

I can’t figure it out

By the time that we figure it out
I'm looking in your eyes
I'm ready to be hurt again (Ready to be hurt)
Feel some type of way whenever you're with me
But I guess it was more like a curse and less like a blessin'
And It was perfect on paper  but there weren't any layers
And how can a kiss of an angel feel more like a stranger?
I try to take it all away
Take it all away
But it all went up in flames
And I fell hard like
Icarus
I got to close to your heart and now I've turned to dust
I didn't know that your love could be so dangerous
And all your golden promises  they just turn to rust
And I got burned like Icarus
I got burned by your love
Stop what you're sayin'  I'm done with the stayin'
I finally see you for who you are
And not the person I thought you were
And maybe you just drop things to watch how they're breakin'

Watch me as I'm flyin' away from your love
Mmm  flyin' away from your love

But everything feels like a lie these days
Don't know how not to feel that way  oh

But everyone feels like a liar these days
Don't know how not to feel that way

I can still be your shoulder
I'll be by your side even if I'm not next to you
Have I spent too much time on what we used to be?
Am I making up details in the memories?
Have I got too caught up on the you and me thing?

I need space  I told you yesterday
Slow the pace down  but then I see your face
Can we do that tomorrow? (Can we do that tomorrow?)
'Cause now you're moving in on my skin
I move back with my lips
It goes against my better judgement
And I'm gonna be cliché here for a minute
And tell you that I've been hurt before
So I think I'm gonna need another minute
To not hurt no more
'Cause all I do is jump right into your arms
Jump into something real
Even though I'm cautious  I just like the way it feels
You make me forget that I'm not ready for love

Jump into something real
Even though I'm cautious  I just like the way it feels
You make me forget that I'm not ready for love
Jump  jump up in this foreign
Used to sleep on couches  now the boy is really tourin'
If they sleep on me  I tell them haters go and sleep it away
If it ain't no trust  then that girl can't be my love
'Posed to put my love above but instead you gon' sleep it away
Yeah  I'm dealing with another lil' heartbreak
Man  I wish I'd never met you in the first place
And that karma gonna get you in the worst way  mmm
Don't throw your love away  don't throw your trust away
You always run away  I wish you would fucking stay
But I guess we need another break
'Cause all I do is jump right into your arms

Even though I'm cautious  I just like the way it feels
You make me forget that I'm not ready for love

I thought love was Shakespearean
More or less a painful experience
Only ever real if you're delirious
The summer before you
I let it take up very little oxygen
Never had someone like you to treat me like Solomon
But little did I know
You would be the one I'd confide in
Learn how to try with
Little did I know
It was you before I ever decided

Still scared of forever
Keep my ex's letters
In the third drawer of my dresser
First one hit me hard
Second was a feather
Playing operation
Tryna put me back together
Closed off and exposed
Salty and I'm seared
Love is weird
Don't know how I wound up here
Love is weird
It shows up and disappears
Love is strange for some
It ranges from making love to tears
People in my past
Put 'em in a coffin
Laid 'em all to rest
But I still think about 'em often
We were on our toes
Tryna make a good impression
Now we're kissin' under lampposts
And we're asking deeper questions

Always holding over your head
Everything we've been through
I wish I could be that tender  stable girl
So can I cut you some slack?
Get all that weight off your back? Oh  oh
Lift the tension in the air
That I put there  that I put there
No  I don't have to go home

I always ruin good things

Now that's finished
I drank a glass of gin
Now my head is spinning
With you in it
I'll never forget your Beamer
Coming down my street
To pick me up on a date
I didn't know I was hungry
For someone to love me
'Til you were on a plate  eh

Cover my tattoo about you with another

Raised with a little more common sense
Isn't always on defense
Sits up straight and knows how to take a compliment
Jealous but the right amount isn't scared of missing out
Missin' out's scared of missing her  yeah
Doesn't buy things to fill voids
Doesn't hate the sound of her own voice
If the me I am  walked out that door
That's the kind of woman I'd leave me for
Doesn't cry when someone leaves  isn't contradictory
Mind takes a break when she falls asleep
Always takes her own advice  crosses T's and cuts her ties
Figured out sympathize from empathize
Doesn't keep those letters in a drawer
Doesn't keep a closet full of things she bought and never wore
Gives all of her attention to the people that are with her
She still loves to dance  she still loves her sister

You keep popping up in certain situations
I know we cut off all communication
But you leave traces in different places
I made my bed in arms that hold me tighter
I'm happy I don't need to justify it now
Not like I was when I would just defy it
Then I'm reminded
Every time I find somebody new
I hope that the memory of you will leave me alone
I hope that the memory of you will leave me alone
But you're always an undertone
I know that I'm the type for sentimental
But I'm trying not to get too existential
