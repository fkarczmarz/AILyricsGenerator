lyrics
" like the flash of a blink
 lingerie and a mink
 hit both brakes
 like below waist
 like Chipotle
 your jeans so tight
 and your mind is fucking beautiful
 oh how you thrill me
 take me anywhere
 ooh you make me feel invincible
 and your mind is fucking beautiful
 oh-oh-oh
Ah  ah  you’re beautiful
Hop on the back of my bike
Let the good wind blow through your hair
With an ass like that and a smile so bright
Ride on through the middle of the night
Let the moonlight kiss your skin
When you dance like that  your jeans so tight
You’re beautiful
And your mind is fucking beautiful
And I can’t pretend
That doesn’t mean a thing to me  to me  yeah
You’re beautiful
Good Lord  you’re fucking beautiful
And I can’t pretend
I like when you run red lights
Don’t stop ’til you thrill me  oh  how you thrill me
Always in control  how you do it  I don’t know
But I don’t care  take me anywhere

But we just threw the blame (Ay) back and forth
We treated love (Ay) like a sport

You called yesterday to basically say
That you care for me but that you're just not in love
Immediately  I pretended to be feeling similarly
And led you to believe I was okay
To just walk away from the one thing
That's unyielding and sacred to me
Well  I guess I'm trying to be nonchalant about it

And I'm going to extremes to prove I'm fine without you
Steady breaking me on down
But in reality I'm slowly losing my mind

Underneath the guise of smile gradually I'm dying inside
Steady breaking me on down

So  what do you do when somebody you're devoted to
Suddenly just stops loving you and it seems they haven't got a clue
Of the pain that rejection is putting you through
Do you cling to your pride and sing I will survive
(Gotta get control and roll roll roll on)
Do you lash out and say How dare you leave this way
(Gotta get control and roll roll roll on)
(Gotta get control and roll roll roll on)
Do you hold on in vain as they just slip away
(Gotta get control and roll roll roll on)

Gonna break you down  down  down
Only if you let it (don't let it)
Everyday crazy situations rocking my mind
Trying to break me down
But I won't let it  forget it
If you feel the same way that I do
Then let me hear y'all all sing too
Hoping for the sun  but it looks like rain
P.O.D. but it's still the same
Came this far  but it's been a long road
Troubles gonna come but we gotta stay strong
Hold on-on
Aw yeah  I often feel the pressures  y'all
But nevertheless Krayzie won't fall
It's over  it's ending here  here
I said it's over  it's ending here  here
So I'll be on my way
And maybe we can meet up in the future one day
But for now I'm bailing! Bailing!
Bailing! Baby gotta get up
Can't take no more
I'm headed for the door
Come and take a look into this humble eye
Tell me  if we lived a lie would our souls unite?
Every new day is a test for me
So I just pray to the Lord for him to bless me  please
There's struggles I'm going through lately
Breaks me down  set me free
Let me be  let me be
Who else do we have to rely on
Whose shoulder can a thug go cry on
Came to get my vibe on
While you look into my eyes
Won't underestimate this soldier story
I'mma tell you right now I'mma stand up
Wrong if I let my lead bust
Pac said keep your head up
Don't let this world get the best of you
All my struggles  I'm through
If it's over  over  over
Don't breakdown yet it's over
Well  I guess I'm trying to be nonchalant about it

They become your life
It's easy to succumb to overwhelming fears inside
Blindly I imagined I could
Keep you under glass
Now I understand to hold you
I must open up my hands
And watch you rise
Spread your wings and prepare to fly
For you have become a butterfly
If you should return to me
We truly were meant to be
So spread your wings and fly
Butterfly
I have learned that beauty
Has to flourish in the light
Wild horses run unbridled
Or their spirit dies
You have given me the courage
To be all that I can
And I truly feel your heart will
Lead you back to me when you're
Ready to land

How 'bout you?
You took my love for granted
You left me lost and disenchanted
Bulldozed my heart as if you planned it
My prince was so unjustly handsome
Who was that knight in shining armor?
I could've sworn you'd love me harder
Might as well down this Caymus bottle
I ain't the type to play the martyr
How 'bout you get the fuck out?

If you look inside your heart
You don't have to be afraid
Of what you are
There’s an answer
If you reach into your soul
And the sorrow that you know
Will melt away
And then a hero comes along
With the strength to carry on
And you cast your fears aside
And you know you can survive
So when you feel like hope is gone
Look inside you and be strong
And you'll finally see the truth
That a hero lies in you
It's a long road
When you face the world alone
No one reaches out a hand for you to hold
You can find love
If you search within yourself
And the emptiness you felt
Will disappear

Gave you everything that you needed
I was even down to repeat it
Said you would always be mine

Try and try so hard to keep our love alive
If you don't know me at this point
Then I highly doubt you ever will
I really need you to give me that unconditional love I used to feel
It's a mistake if we just erase it (Hey  hey)
From our hearts and minds I know
We said let go but I kept on hangin' on
Inside I know it's over  you're really gone
It's killing me cause there ain't nothing that I can do

I still believe
Someday you and me
Will find ourselves in love again

Someday you and me
Will find ourselves in love again

I'm filled with all the joy I could find

And now it's too late to hold you
Never had I imagined
Living without your smile
Feeling and knowing you hear me
And I know you're shining down on me from Heaven
Like so many friends we've lost along the way
And I know eventually we'll be together (Together)
One sweet day
(And I'll wait patiently to see you in Heaven)
Assumed you'd always be there (Always there)
I thought you'd always be there
But I always cared (But I always cared)

It wasn't raining yet
(Yet)
But it was definitely a little misty on
(But it was definitely)
That warm November night
And my heart was pounding
(Pounding)
My inner voice resounding
Begging me to turn away
But I just had to see your face
To feel alive
And then you casually walked in the room
And I was twisted in the web
Of my desire for you
(And I was twisted)
My apprehension blew away
I only wanted you
To taste my sadness
As you kissed me in the dark
Every time I feel the need (and every time)
I envision you caressing me
And go back in time (back in time)
To relive the splendor of you and I
On the rooftop that rainy night

And so we finished the Moët and
I started feeling liberated
And I surrendered as you took me in your arms
(You took me in your arms)
I was so caught up in the moment
I couldn't bear to let you go yet (so I)
So I threw caution to the wind
And started listening to my longing heart
And then you softly pressed your lips to mine
And feelings surfaced I'd suppressed
For such a long long time
(And I was lifted)
And for a while I forgot
The sorrow and the pain
And melted with you as we stood
There in the rain
Every time I feel the need (and every time)
I envision you caressing me
And go back in time (back in time)
(Back)
On the rooftop that rainy night
(Every time)
Every time I feel the need (and every time)

And go back in time (back in time)

Last night I dreamed that I
(Last night I... dreamed that I...)
Whispered the words I love you
(That I love you boy...)
And touched you so very (touched)
Subtly as we were kissing goodbye

On the rooftop that rainy night
Every time I feel the need (and every time)
I envision you caressing me
And go back in time (back in time)
To relive the splendor of you and I
With nowhere to run
When you're distraught
And in pain without anyone
When you keep crying out to be saved
But nobody comes
And you feel so far away
That you just can't find your way home
Once you say
I can make it through the rain
I can stand up once again
On my own and I know
That I'm strong enough to mend
And every time I feel afraid
I hold tighter to my faith
And I live one more day
And I make it through the rain
And if you keep falling down
Don't you dare give in
You will arise safe and sound
So keep pressing on steadfastly
And you'll find what you need to prevail

But it is not confirmed  then the tables turned
Just look at me now  try to hold me down
But I am not going to stop  because I’m going to climb
To the mountain top  to the mountain top  now let go
Can’t fall down  stay triumphant  keep on living

Throwing big money as she dances on the pole
Lime green Lamborghini dances in the road

Blow a hundred racks she don’t know a footlocker
Red bottom boss house big as Baltimore
With a blonde bombshell trying to bomb with your boy
In the James Bond Beamer chrome wheel two seater
Smoking like Pimp C  spoken like a trill nigga
On a cloudy day baby I can make it rain

Then was Hummers and Benzes

Sweet destiny
Carried me through desperation
To the one that was waiting for me
It took so long
Still I believed
Somehow the one that I needed
Would find me eventually
I had a vision of love
And it was all that you've given to me
Prayed through the nights
Felt so alone
Suffered from alienation
Carried the weight on my own
Had to be strong
So I believed
And now I know I've succeeded
In finding the place I conceived
I had a vision of love
And it was all that you've given to me

And it was all that you've given me

Holding you so close to me
Prayed through the nights
So faithfully
Knowing the one that I needed
Would find me eventually
I had a vision of love
And it was all that you've given to me

I didn't mean it when I said I didn't love you so
I shoulda held on tight  I never shoulda let you go
I was lyin' to myself
I couldn't have fathomed I would ever be without your love
Never imagined I'd be sitting here beside myself
Guess I didn't know you  guess I didn't know me
But I thought I knew everything I never felt
The feelin' that I'm feelin' now that I don't hear your voice
Or have your touch and kiss your lips 'cause I don't have a choice
Oh  what I wouldn't give to have you lyin' by my side
When you left  I lost a part of me (Together)
