"Strawberry lipstick state of mind (State of mind)
I get so lost inside your eyes
Would you believe it?
You don't have to say you love me
You don't have to say nothing
You don't have to say you're mine
Honey (Ah-ah-ah)
I'd walk through fire for you
Just let me adore you
I'd walk through fire for you
Just let me adore you
Like it's the only thing I'll ever do
Like it's the only thing I'll ever do
Your wonder under summer skies (Summer skies)
Brown skin and lemon over ice
Would you believe it?

Just let me adore you
Holdin' me back
Gravity's holdin' me back
I want you to hold out the palm of your hand
Why don't we leave it at that?
Nothin' to say
When everything gets in the way
Seems you cannot be replaced
And I'm the one who will stay  oh-oh-oh
In this world  it's just us
You know it's not the same as it was
In this world  it's just us
You know it's not the same as it was
As it was  as it was
You know it's not the same
Answer the phone
Harry  you're no good alone
Why are you sitting at home on the floor?
What kind of pills are you on?
Ringin' the bell
And nobody's coming to help
Your daddy lives by himself
He just wants to know that you're well  oh-oh-oh

Go home  get ahead  light-speed internet
I don't wanna talk about the way that it was
Leave America  two kids follow her
I don't wanna talk about who's doin' it first
(Hey)
As it was
You know it's not the same as it was
That all your friends are gonna like
But they'll tell you that they hate it
When they don’t just because it’s mine
And I swear that I’m not thinking about you all the time
Maybe change your mind
Now I'm getting older
Am I getting over you? (La La Na Na)

 loof
 they think you're so easy
 they're just misunderstanding
 you're back at it again
 you still open the door
 and you go
 are they just pretending?
 you're back at it again
So hard to leave it  that's what I always do
So I keep thinking back to a time under the canyon moon
I heard Jenny saying  Go get the kids from school
And I keep thinking back to the time under the canyon moon
I'll be gone too long from you
Staring at the ceiling  two weeks and I'll be home
And I'm still thinking back to the time under the canyon moon

We're not talkin' lately
Don't you call him what you used to call me

There's a piece of you in how I dress

Tell me what you want and you got it  love
I want all of you  gimme all you got
That's cinema

Don't know why  but it feels so right to me
Something in the way you move
I like it when you dance for me (I just think it's—)

I’m wrapped up stuck in love with myself
I never saw this coming around
But I miss her skin on me now
I do what she wants anywhere
Back seat of the car and up in the air
But I miss how she kissed everywhere

You're in your airplane seat
I was nose-bleedin'
Looking for life out there
Readin' your horoscope
You were just doing cocaine in my kitchen
You never listen
I hope you're missing me by now
You'd be the spoon
Dip you in honey so I could be sticking to you
Ain't gonna sleep till the daylight (Ooh)

All of a sudden these lights are blinding me
I never noticed how bright they would be
I saw in the corner there is a photograph
No doubt in my mind it's a picture of you
It lies there alone in it's bed of broken glass
This bed was never made for two
I'll keep my eyes wide open
I'll keep my arms wide open
'Cause I'm tired of feeling alone
I promised one day that I'd bring you back a star
Seems like these days I watch you from afar
Just trying to make you understand

Oh  tell me something I don't already know
Oh  tell me something I don't already know
Brooklyn saw me  empty at the news
There's no water inside this swimming pool
Almost over  had enough from you
And I've been praying  I never did before
Understand I'm talking to the walls
I've been praying ever since New York

And you're not here
And there's no one to blame but the drink in my wandering hands
Forget what I said
It's not what I meant
What am I now? What am I now?
What if I'm someone I don't want around?
What if I'm down? What if I'm out?
What if I'm someone you won't talk about?
And I'm well aware I write too many songs about you
And the coffee's out at the Beachwood Cafe
And it kills me 'cause I know we've run out of things we can say

I'm looking for something to buy
You've got my devotion
I don't want to fight you
And I don't want to sleep in the dirt
We'll get the drinks in
So I'll get to thinking of her
We'll be a fine line
We'll be a fine line
We'll be a fine line
We'll be a fine line
We'll be a fine line

One  two—
Yesterday  it finally came  a sunny afternoon
I was on my way to buy some flowers for you
Thought that we could hide away in a corner of the heath
There's never been someone who's so perfect for me
But I got over it and I said
Give me something old and red
I pay for it more than I did back then
There's just no getting through
Without you
A bottle of rouge
Just me and you
Sittin' in the garden  I'm a couple glasses in
I was tryna count up all the places we'vе been
You're always there  so don't ovеrthink
I'm so over whites and pinks

‘Cause I’m not here for sympathy
‘Cause I don’t want to hear about him
How he’s holding you better at night
And I don’t want to hear about him
In these songs you continue to write
I was with you when you wrote that line
It was me that you had on your mind
So I don’t want to hear about him
That nice dress in my Wildest Dreams
Lipstick stains you left still on my sheets
When I hear “amazing eyes”
It breaks my heart evеry time
‘Cause I don’t want to hear about him
How hе’s holding you better at night
And I don’t want to hear about him

And these songs you continue to write

It was me that you had on your mind
I don’t want to hear about him
Is he holding you better at night?
Is it me running into your mind?
Wearing less than you wore before
Shoes sitting by the door
Never put them on
We would stay in my house for days
Spilling breakfast on pillowcases
Your stuff don’t taste the same
Now that you’re gone
I guess I’m prone to overthinking
One thing goes wrong and I can’t adjust
I’ve lost the taste for the good in us
And I’m sorry
We had a hunger then
Only each other then
Couldn’t get enough when we started
Always a hunger then
Now it’s just emptiness
We had a hunger then
We could ruin a perfect night
On my birthday I made you cry
You told me you learned to drive
I guess you lied
I could never get sick of you
I just bit off more than I could chew
And as one year turns into two

Runnin' through my heart
Lights up and they know who you are
Know who you are
You sit high atop the kitchen counter
Stay green a little while
You bring blue lights to dreams
Starry haze  crystal ball
Somehow  you've become some paranoia
A wet dream just dangling
But your gift is wasted on me
I was thinkin' about who you are
Your delicate point of view
I was thinkin' about you
I'm not worried about where you are
Or who you will go home to
I'm just thinkin' about you
Just thinkin' about you
Did you dress up for Halloween?
I spilled beer on your friend  I'm not sorry
A golf swing and a trampoline
Maybe we'll do this again
Tracksuit and a ponytail
You hide the body all that yoga gave you
Red wine and a ginger ale
But you would make fun of me  for sure

Or who you will go home to
I'm just thinkin' about you
Just thinkin' about you
Maybe you don't know what's lost till you find it
Take a walk on Sunday through the afternoon
We can always find somethin' for us to do
We don't really like what's on the news  but it's on all the time
I take you with me every time I go away
In a hotel  usin' someone else's name
I remember back at Jonny's place  it's not the same anymore
Baby  you were the love of my life  woah
Maybe you don't know what's lost till you find it
It's not what I wantеd  to leave you behind
Don't know whеre you'll land when you fly
But  ​baby  you were the love of my life
It's unfortunate (Ooh)
Just coordinates (Ooh)
I don't know you half as well as all my friends
I won't pretend that I've been doin' everything I can
To get to know your creases and your ends
Are they the same?

And you're trying to lift off the ground on those old two wheels
Nothing 'bout the way that you were treated ever seemed especially alarming till now
So you tie up your hair and you smile like it's no big deal
You can let it go
You can throw a party full of everyone you know
And not invite your family 'cause they never showed you love

You showed me a power that is strong еnough to bring sun to the darkest days

Give me that adrenaline  that adrenaline

We've said it before
Each time with different meaning
I found out too late
This is what you wanted
And there’s no parade
No one to watch me falling down
And as my body hits the ground
Doesn’t make a sound
There’s nothing to live for
Thought I’d be fine
To get through the night
Alone on the hotel floor
It’s gonna be long
It’s gonna be hard
It’s gonna be painful
