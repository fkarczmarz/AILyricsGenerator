lyrics
"Uh (Uh)
I think somebody lying
Smell somebody lying
I don't see no fire
Off-white Sunseeker at the marina
Lucalis dwellings in Brooklyn just to book me some pizza
Who could reach us? Only God could teleport this type of freedom
Who am I if I don't go to war?
There's opportunity when livin' with loss
I discover myself when I fall short
Three angels watchin' me all the time
Definition of peace
Tell me who gon' stop me? I come from love
But I live in circadian rhythms of a shooting star
But the industry's cooked as I pick the carcass apart
Fuckin' with good people make good people go to bat
Are you finally ready to play have-you-ever? Let's see
Have you ever thought that OVO is workin' for me?
Everyone inside your team is whispering that you deserve it
It was fun until you started to put money in the streets
Then lost money 'cause they came back with no receipts
But war-ready if the world is ready to see you bleed
Know the wires in your circle should puzzle you
A hundred niggas that you got on salary
And twenty of 'em want you as a casualty
And one of them is actually next to you
And two of them is practically tired of your lifestyle
Just don't got the audacity to tell you
You're playin' nerdy with Zack Bia and Twitter bots
But your reality can't hide behind wifi
It's time that you look around on who's around you
Eight doobies to the face  fuck that
Got a high tolerance when your age don't exist
Man  I swear my nigga trippin' off that shit again
Pick him up  then I set him in cold water
Then I order someone to bring him Vicodin
Hope that take the pain away
From the feelin' that he feel today
You know when you part of Section.80
You feel like no one can relate
Marijuana endorphins make you stronger  stronger
I'm in the house party trippin' off
My generation sippin' cough syrup like it's water
Never no pancakes in the kitchen
Man  not one of our lives is caught up
In the daily superstition that the world is 'bout to end
Who gives a fuck? We never do listen
'Less it comes with an 808 (A melody and some hoes)
PlayStation and some drank (Technology bought my soul)
Lookin' around and all I see is a big crowd that's product of me
And they probably relatives relevant for a rebel's dream
Purple Label on her back  but that tab is light blue
She take it straight to the head  then she look at me
She got ADHD

Eight doobies to the face  fuck that
Got a high tolerance when your age don't exist
(They always told me ADHD did it)
Woah  woah-woah
And then she started
And then she started feelin' herself like no one else in this apartment
Why you say that? She said  Where my drink at?
I'ma tell you later  just tell your neighbors and the police relax
Hope that I get close enough when the lights turn down
And the fact that she just might open up when the Nuvo start to drown
Her body  and I know the both of us really deep in the mood now
It's nothin' we can do now  somebody walked in with a pound (Woah)
You know why we crack babies? Because we born in the '80s
The ADHD crazy
Eight doobies to the face  fuck that
Got a high tolerance when your age don't exist
(They always told me ADHD did it)
Woah  woah-woah
You can have all my shine  I'll give you the light
You can have all my shine  I'll give you the light
Alls my life  I—
Hard times like  Yah!
Bad trips like  Yah!

I'm fucked up  homie  you fucked up
But if God got us  then we gon' be alright
Nigga  we gon' be alright
Nigga  we gon' be alright
We gon' be alright
Do you hear me  do you feel me? We gon' be alright
Nigga  we gon' be alright
Huh? We gon' be alright
Nigga  we gon' be alright
Do you hear me  do you feel me? We gon' be alright
Uh  and when I wake up
I recognize you're looking at me for the pay cut
But homicide be looking at you from the face down
What MAC-11 even boom with the bass down?
Schemin'  and let me tell you 'bout my life
Painkillers only put me in the twilight
Where pretty pussy and Benjamin is the highlight
Now tell my momma I love her  but this what I like  Lord knows
Twenty of 'em in my Chevy  tell 'em all to come and get me
Reaping everything I sow  so my karma coming heavy
No preliminary hearings on my record
I'm a motherfucking gangster in silence for the record  uh
Tell the world I know it's too late
Boys and girls  I think I've gone cray
Drown inside my vices all day
Won't you please believe when I say

Nigga  I'm at the preacher's door
My knees gettin' weak  and my gun might blow
But we gon' be alright

Do you hear me  do you feel me? We gon' be alright

Huh? We gon' be alright

Do you hear me  do you feel me? We gon' be alright
What you want you  a house⁠? You  a car?
Forty acres and a mule? A piano  a guitar?
Anything  see my name is Lucy  I'm your dog
Motherfucker  you can live at the mall
I can see the evil  I can tell it  I know it's illegal
I don't think about it  I deposit every other zero
Thinking of my partner  put the candy  paint it on the Regal
Digging in my pocket  ain't a profit big enough to feed you
Every day my logic get another dollar just to keep you
In the presence of your chico  ah!
I don't talk about it  be about it  every day I sequel
If I got it then you know you got it  Heaven  I can reach you
Bick back and Chad  I trap the bag for y'all
I rap  I black on track so rest assured
My rights  my wrongs  I write 'til I'm right with God
Wouldn't you know
We been hurt  been down before
Nigga  when our pride was low
Lookin' at the world like  Where do we go?
Nigga  and we hate po-po
Wanna kill us dead in the street fo sho'
Nigga  I'm at the preacher's door
My knees gettin' weak  and my gun might blow
But we gon' be alright
Nigga  we gon' be alright

Do you hear me  do you feel me? We gon' be alright
Nigga  we gon' be alright
Huh? We gon' be alright
Nigga  we gon' be alright
Do you hear me  do you feel me? We gon' be alright
I keep my head up high
I cross my heart and hope to die
Lovin' me is complicated
Too afraid of a lot of changes
I'm alright  and you're a favorite
Dark nights in my prayers
I remembered you was conflicted
Misusing your influence  sometimes I did the same
Abusing my power  full of resentment
Resentment that turned into a deep depression
Found myself screamin' in the hotel room
I didn't wanna self-destruct
The evils of Lucy was all around me
Martin had a dream
Kendrick have a dream
All my life I want money and power
Respect my mind or die from lead shower
I pray my dick get big as the Eiffel Tower
So I can fuck the world for seventy-two hours
My mind is livin' on cloud nine and this 9 is never on vacation
Start up that Maserati and – vroom-vroom! – I'm racin'
Poppin' pills in the lobby and I pray they don't find her naked
And I pray you niggas is hatin'  shooters go after Judas
Jesus Christ  if I live life on my knees ain't no need to do this
Park it in front of Lueders  next to that Church's Chicken
All my life I want money and power
Respect my mind or die from lead shower
I pray my dick get big as the Eiffel Tower
So I can fuck the world for seventy-two hours

Put fire to that ass  body cast on a stretcher
And her body got that ass that a ruler couldn't measure
And it make me cum fast  but I never get embarrassed
And I recognize you have what I've been wantin' since that record
That Adina Howard had pop it fast to impress her
She rollin'  I'm holdin' my scrotum imposin'
All my life I want money and power
Respect my mind or die from lead shower
I pray my dick get big as the Eiffel Tower
So I can fuck the world for seventy-two hours
Goddamn I got bitches  damn I got bitches
Damn I got bitches: wifey  girlfriend and mistress

I roll in dough with a good grind
And I run that ho with a baton
That's a relay race with a bouquet
Biatch! No way  biatch! No way
Biatch! No way  biatch! Okay
I'm never livin' life confined
It's a failure even if I'm blind
How to sell your game right on time
Biatch! Go play  biatch! Go play
Biatch! Go play
Biatch  I look like O. J.​
Killin' everything from pussy to a mothafuckin' Hit-Boy beat
She pussy poppin' and I got options like an audible  I be
All my life I want money and power

Who's prob'ly gonna sin again

Love me on the East like I'm Chuck D
Dominicans wish that I was born there
I'm lookin' to be the god MC
You look at my hat and see thorns there
I look at the game and see porn there
I'm fuckin' this industry hard
You thought I was fresh out the yard
They tell me you nice and I'm like wait

Rumors on the ground gettin' too loud
Can't hear myself think
Empty my memory bank
Sittin' next to Hillary smellin' like dank
I'll wait
I've been in my wave like twenty years straight
I've been on my vibe like twenty years straight
Don't fuck up my high (Fuck up my high)
Still be straight (Still be straight)
Don't waste my breath
I don't know how many moons a nigga got left
Back to this joint
Smokin' this shit like I'm tryna prove a point
Hahaha
Niggas pissed off
I ministered this generation by far
Leader of the new school
I am the Globetrotters' best 'cause I didn't drop the ball
Told niggas when I was sixteen that I'd write a sixteen
To put a nigga right on the big screen
In the paddy wagon with six teens
Shoulda been in the pen but now my pen writin' with morphine
Picture lil' ole me giving a fuck for what a fuck nigga gotta say
You ain't get killed in Vegas or in a Suburban
So many washed up with detergent
Empty out another magazine like blah
Let a young nigga get by (Doot!)
I kill 'em all when they try to kill my vibe (Doot! Doot!)
The last that would try to pass a good job
If Shawn's a black Beatle then I need a 10-second drum solo
Who's prob'ly gonna sin again
Things I don't understand
Sometimes I need to be alone
Look inside of my soul and you can find gold and maybe get rich
Look inside of your soul and you can find out it never exist
How can I paint this picture when the color blind is hangin' witcha?
Why you resent every makin' of his? Tell me your purpose is petty again

And they waitin' on Kendrick like the 1st and the 15th
I'll take your girlfriend then put that pussy on the pedestal
My New Year's resolution is to stop all the pollution
Get yo' freestyles ready!
 woo woo
 I’m just changing the channel
 meditating with candles lit
000 hours in training
 is it money or skill?
 it’s real
 my style is never mistakable
 you know me well
 my lineage prove itself
 I flowed tighter than virgin lips
 that’s how it played nowadays
 my gun is off the waist nowadays
 I'm talking
 every other hour since Eddie Bauer
 breaking the padlock
 entire lion
 I’m the one
 bitch you better off voting for Donald Trump
 God bless Americans
 I’m David Blaine-ing all you hoes
 niggas wanna deplore him
 but industry shit ain’t for him
 only one me
 never leasing my foreign
 corporations extort them
 I alien mighty morphin’
 hundred bill to the doorman
 they call me back in the morning
 pace myself it’s important
 saucy all of my garments
 this fucking studio haunted (Ah!)
 gotta be the yams
 damn
 yeah
 but even the valley peaking me
 nigga this TDE
 don’t make me do demonstrations
 this party is reservated
 I gotta slay it
 gotta show you fuckers I’m not to play with
 King Kunta the fuckin’ greatest
Is it weakness?
You decide
Are we gonna live or die?
So I was takin' a walk the other day
And I seen a woman—a blind woman
Pacin' up and down the sidewalk
She seemed to be a bit frustrated
As if she had dropped somethin' and
Havin' a hard time findin' it
So after watchin' her struggle for a while
It seems to me that you have lost something
I would like to help you find it
You've lost… your life
*Gunshot*
Is it wickedness?
Lamar stated his views on police brutality
Loyalty  got royalty inside my DNA
Cocaine quarter piece  got war and peace inside my DNA
I got power  poison  pain  and joy inside my DNA
I got hustle  though  ambition flow inside my DNA
I was born like this  since one like this  immaculate conception
I transform like this  perform like this  was Yeshua new weapon
I don't contemplate  I meditate  then off your fucking head
This that put-the-kids-to-bed
This that I got  I got  I got  I got—
Realness  I just kill shit ’cause it's in my DNA
I got millions  I got riches buildin' in my DNA
I got dark  I got evil that rot inside my DNA
I got off  I got troublesome heart inside my DNA
I just win again  then win again like Wimbledon  I serve
Yeah  that’s him again  the sound that engine in is like a bird
You see fireworks and Corvette tire skrrt the boulevard
I know how you work  I know just who you are
See  you's a  you's a  you's a—
Bitch  your hormones prolly switch inside your DNA
Problem is  all that sucker shit inside your DNA
Daddy prolly snitched  heritage inside your DNA
Backbone don't exist  born outside a jellyfish  I gauge
See  my pedigree most definitely don't tolerate the front
Shit I've been through prolly offend you  this is Paula's oldest son
I know murder  conviction
Scholars  fathers dead with kids and
I wish I was fed forgiveness
Born inside the beast  my expertise checked out in second grade
When I was nine  on cell  motel  we didn’t have nowhere to stay
At twenty-nine  I've done so well  hit cartwheel in my estate
And I'm gon' shine like I’m supposed to  antisocial extrovert
And excellent mean the extra work
And absentness what the fuck you heard
And pessimists never struck my nerve
And Nazareth gonna plead his case
The reason my power's here on earth
Salute the truth  when the prophet say

Tell me somethin'
You motherfuckers can't tell me nothin'
I'd rather die than to listen to you
My DNA not for imitation
Your DNA an abomination
This how it is when you in the Matrix
Dodgin' bullets  reapin' what you sow
And stackin' up the footage  livin' on the go
And sleepin' in a villa
Sippin' from a Grammy  walkin' in the buildin'
Diamond in the ceilin'  marble on the floors
Beach inside the window  peekin' out the window
Baby in the pool  godfather goals
Only Lord knows I've been goin' hammer
Dodgin' paparazzi  freakin' through the cameras
Eat at Four Daughters  Brock wearin' sandals
Yoga on a Monday  stretchin' to Nirvana
Watchin' all the snakes  curvin' all the fakes
Phone never on  I don't conversate
I don't compromise  I just penetrate
Sex  money  murder  these are the breaks
These are the times  level number nine
Look up in the sky  ten is on the way
Sentence on the way  killings on the way
Motherfucker  I got winners on the way
You ain't shit without a body on your belt
You ain't shit without a ticket on your plate
You ain't sick enough to pull it on yourself
You ain't rich enough to hit the lot and skate
Tell me when destruction gonna be my fate
Gonna be your fate  gonna be our faith
Peace to the world  let it rotate
Sex  money  murder  our DNA
Until I found it's me versus me
We gon' put it in reverse
And I am telling you once again
That my—
Life is one funny ma'fucker
The object was to process and digest poverty's dialect
Federal policies raid buildings and drug professionals
Anthony was the oldest of seven
A four-year-old tellin' his nanny he needed her
His family history: pimpin' and bangin'
Even got some head from a smoker last weekend
That was back when he turned his back and they killed his cousin
He beat the case and went back to hustlin'
And hoppin' out while harrassin' the corner blocks
Crooked cops told Anthony he should kick it
He brushed 'em off and walked back to the Kentucky Fried Chicken
Drove to California with a woman on him and five-hundred dollars
Hustlin' on the side with a nine-to-five to freak it
Three-piece special with his name on the shirt pocket
That's when affiliation was really at gears of war
Ducky was well-aware
They robbed the manager and shot a customer last year
He figured he'd get on these niggas' good sides
You take two strangers and put 'em in random predicaments
Inside recording studios where they reapin' their benefits
Then you start remindin' them about that chicken incident
Whoever thought the greatest rapper would be from coincidence?
While I grew up without a father and die in a gunfight
*Gunshot*

They won't take me out my element
I don’t think I could find a way to make it on this earth

I know you been havin' a lot on yo' mind lately

I'll prolly die from witnesses leavin' me falsed accused
I'll prolly die from thinkin' that me and your hood was cool
Or maybe die because these smokers are more than desperate
I'll prolly die from one of these bats and blue badges
Or maybe die from panic or die from bein' too lax
I'll prolly die tryna buy weed at the apartments
I'll prolly die tryna defuse two homies arguin'
I'll prolly die 'cause that's what you do when you're 17

Now
Accumulated 10 times over throughout the years
My newfound life made all of me magnified
How many accolades do I need to block denial?
The shock value of my success put bolts in me
Take it from me and leave me worse than I was before?
Scared to go back to Section 8 with my mama stressin'
30 shows a month and I still won't buy me no Lexus
What is an advisor? Somebody that's holdin' my checks
Just to fuck me over and put my finances in debt?
I read a case about Rihanna's accountant and wondered
How did the Bad Girl feel when she looked at them numbers?
The type of shit'll make me flip out and just kill somethin'
What they say 'bout me reveal if my reputation would miss me
What they see from me would trickle down generations in time
What they hear from me would make 'em highlight my simplest lines
'Cause my DNA won't let me involve in the light of God
Searchin' for resolutions until somebody get back
Wonderin' if I'm livin' through fear or livin' through rap
Damn
God damn us all
So until we come back to these commandments
Until you come back to these commandments
Because He said He's gonna punish us
Are the true children of Israel
The children of Israel
Because we chose to follow other gods
That's why we're in the position that we're in
We gonna be at a lower state in this life that we live
God bless you

I feel like a chip on my shoulders
I feel like I'm losin' my focus
I feel like I'm losin' my patience
I feel like my thoughts in the basement
Feel like I don't wanna be bothered
I feel like you may be the problem
And fuck you if you get offended
I feel like friends been overrated

Feel like I'ma learn you a lesson
Feel like only me and the music though
I feel like your feelin' ain't mutual
I feel like the enemy you should know
Feel like the feelin' of no hope
The feelin' of bad dope
A quarter ounce manipulated from soap
I'll force-feed 'em the poison that fill 'em up in the prison
I feel like it's just me
Fillin' the void of bein' employed with ballin'
Fill up the banks with dollars
Fill up the graves with fathers
Fill up the babies with bullshit
I feel like this gotta be the feelin' where 'Pac was
The feelin' of an apocalypse happenin'
I can put a regime that forms a Loch Ness
Maybe it's too late for 'em
I feel like the whole world want me to pray for 'em
But who the fuck prayin' for me?
Ain't nobody prayin' for me
Who prayin' for me?
I don't know why you trying to go big  nigga  you ain't shit
Walking around like you God's gift to Earth  nigga  you ain't shit
You ain't even buy me no outfit for the Fourth
I shouldn't be fuckin' with you anyway
I need a baller-ass  boss-ass nigga
You's a off-brand-ass nigga  everybody know it
Your homies know it  everybody fuckin' know
Fuck you  nigga  don't call me no more
You won't know  you gonna lose on a good bitch
My other nigga is on  you off
What the fuck is really going on?
This dick ain't free
You lookin' at me like it ain't a receipt
Like I never made ends meet
Eating your leftovers and raw meat
This dick ain't free
Livin' in captivity raised my cap salary
Celery  tellin' me green is all I need
Evidently  all I seen was Spam and raw sardines
This dick ain't free  I mean  baby
You really think we could make a baby named Mercedes
Without a Mercedes Benz and twenty-four-inch rims
Five percent tint  and air conditioning vents?
Hell fuckin' naw  this dick ain't free
I need forty acres and a mule
Not a forty ounce and a pitbull
Bullshit  matador  matador
Had the door knockin'  let 'em in  who's that?
Genital's best friend  this dick ain't free
Pity the fool that made the pretty in you prosper
Titty juice and pussy lips kept me obnoxious
Kept me up watchin' pornos in poverty  apology? No
Watch you politic with people less fortunate  like myself
Every dog has its day  now doggy style shall help
This dick ain't free
Matter of fact  it need interest
Matter of fact  it's nine inches
Matter of fact  see our friendship based on business
Pension  more pension  you're pinchin' my percents
It's been relentless  fuck forgiveness  fuck your feelings
Fuck your sources  all distortion  if you fuck it's more abortion
More divorce courts and portion
My check with less endorsement left me dormant
Fuck you think is in more shit?
Porcelain pipes pressure  bust 'em twice
Choice is devastated  decapitated the horseman
Oh America  you bad bitch  I picked cotton and made you rich
Now my dick ain't free

Critics want to mention that they miss when hip-hop was rappin'
Motherfucker  if you did  then Killer Mike'd be platinum
Y'all priorities fucked up  put energy in wrong shit
Hennessy and Crown Vic  my memory been gone since
Don't ask about no camera blocking at award shows
'Less you askin' me about power  yeah  I got a lot of it
I'm the only nigga next to Snoop that can push the button
Had the Coast on standby
K. Dot  what up? I heard they opened up Pandora's box
I box 'em all in  by a landslide
I make the call and get the Coast involved  then history repeats
But I resolved inside that private hall while sitting down with Jay
He said  It's funny how one verse can fuck up the game
I been A-1 since day one  you niggas boo-boo
I remember you was conflicted
Misusing your influence
Sometimes I did the same
Abusing my power full of resentment
Resentment that turned into a deep depression
Found myself screaming in a hotel room
I didn't want to self-destruct
The evils of Lucy was all around me
So I went running for answers
Until I came home
But that didn't stop survivors guilt
Going back and forth
Trying to convince myself the stripes I earned
Or maybe how A-1 my foundation was
But while my loved ones was fighting a continuous war
Back in the city
 paralyzin' my thoughts
 y'all
 dirty Marcellus called me Dumbo
 can't forget
 he didn't hear me
 stressin' about dry land
 powder blue skies that crack open
 I knew he was smokin'
 I didn't believe it
 Beat it
 I want a single bill from you
 nothin' more
 how much a dollar cost?
 the air you breathe
 his eyes followed me with no laser
 I notice that his stare is contagious
 feelin' some type of disrespect
 it'd be aimin' at his neck
 takin' it if they could
 how much a dollar cost?
 the air you breathe
 indecisive and power trippin'
 I should keep it relentless
 who the fuck I'm kiddin'?
 I need all of mines
 reekin' from your skin
 your gimmick is mediocre
 I seen you from a mile away losin' focus
 and I lack empathy
 Your potential is bittersweet
 Every nickel is mines to keep
 the Holy Spirit
 and I'll tell you just how much a dollar cost
 embrace your loss—I am God
 I said my grace
 guess I'm not all what it's all meant to be
 help me change to right my wrongs
It been that day for me
I get way too petty once you let me do the extras
My left stroke just went viral
Right stroke put lil' baby in a spiral

I should've listened when my grandmama said to me:
Took his homies to the show and this is what they said:
Fuck am I 'posed to do when I'm lookin' at walkin' licks?
The constant big money talk 'bout the mansion and foreign whips
One more sucker wavin' with a flashy wrist
My defense mechanism tell me to get him
Quickly because he got it
But it's gon' take a lot 'fore this pistol go cold turkey
Now I can watch his watch on the TV and be okay
But see I'm on the clock once that watch landin' in LA
Remember steal from the rich and givin' it back to the poor?

She said
Talented but still under the neighborhood ruse
You can take your boy out the hood
But you can't take the hood out the homie

Or maybe how A-1 my foundation was
But while my loved ones was fighting the continuous war back in the city
I was entering a new one
A war that was based on apartheid and discrimination
Made me wanna go back to the city and tell the homies what I learned
The word was respect
Just because you wore a different gang color than mine's
Doesn't mean I can't respect you as a black man
Forgetting all the pain and hurt we caused each other in these streets
If I respect you  we unify and stop the enemy from killing us
But I don't know  I'm no mortal man
Maybe I'm just another nigga”
Shit and that's all I wrote
I was gonna call it Another Nigga  but it ain't really a poem
I just felt like it's something you probably could relate to
Other than that  now that I finally got a chance to holla at you
I always wanted to ask you about a certain situa—
What you mean by that? What the ground represent?
The ground is gonna open up and swallow the evil
Right
That's how I see it  my word is bond
I see—and the ground is the symbol for the poor people
Right
The poor people is gonna open up this whole world
And swallow up the rich people
'Cause the rich people gonna be so fat (Mhm)
And they gonna be so appetizing (Mhm)
The poor gonna be so poor  and hungry
Right
You know what I'm saying  it's gonna be like
You know what I'm saying  it's gonna be
There might—  there might be some cannibalism out this muhfu—
They might eat the rich  you know what I'm saying?
Do you see yourself as somebody that's rich
Or somebody that made the best of they own opportunities?
I see myself as a natural-born hustler
A true hustler in every sense of the word
I took nothin'  I took the opportunities
I worked at the m-most menial and degrading job
And built myself up so I could get it to where I owned it
I-I went from having somebody managing me
To me hiring the person that works my management company (Right)
I changed everything  I realized my destiny
In a matter of five years  you know what I'm saying?
Now it's time to make millions for myself  you know what I'm saying?
I made millions for the record companies (Mhm)
I made millions for these movie companies (Mhm)
Now I make millions for  for us (Mmm)
And through your different avenues of success
How would you say you managed to keep a level of sanity?
By my faith in God  by my faith in the game
And by my faith in all good—  all good things come to those that stay true
Right
You know what I'm saying?
And it was happening to me for a reason
I was punching the right buttons and it was happening
I'm finna go straight through
Would you consider yourself a fighter at heart or somebody that
Somebody that only reacts when they back is against the wall?
And not only me  but it goes down my family tree
You know what I'm saying  it's in my veins to fight back
We fighting a war  I'm fighting a war I can't win
And I wanna lay it all down
In this country  a Black man only have like
Five years we can exhibit maximum strength
And that's right now while you a teenager  while you still strong
While you still wanna lift weights  while you still wanna shoot back
'Cause once you turn thirty it's like
They take the heart and soul out of a man
Out of a Black man in this country
And you don't wanna fight no more
And if you don't believe me  you can look around
You don't see no loud mouth thirty-year old motherfuckers (Mhm)
I can truly tell you that there's nothing but turmoil goin' on so  I want to ask you
What you think is the future for me and my generation today?
I think that niggas is tired of grabbin' shit out the stores
I don't think America know that
I think America think we was just playing
And it's gonna be some more playing but
It ain't gonna be no playing
It's gonna be murder  you know what I'm saying?
You know what I'm saying  it's gonna happen(Mmm)
Only hope that we kinda have left is music and vibrations
A lot of people don't understand how important it is  you know
Sometimes I can like  get behind a mic and I don't know what type of energy
I'ma push out or where it comes from
Trip me out sometimes
Because it's spirits  we ain't even really rappin'
We just letting our dead homies tell stories for us (Damn)
I wanted to read one last thing to you
It's actually something a good friend had wrote
Describing my world
It says:
“The caterpillar is a prisoner to the streets that conceived it
Its only job is to eat or consume everything around it
In order to protect itself from this mad city
While consuming its environment
The caterpillar begins to notice ways to survive
One thing it noticed is how much the world shuns him
But praises the butterfly
The butterfly represents the talent  the thoughtfulness
And the beauty within the caterpillar
But having a harsh outlook on life
The caterpillar sees the butterfly as weak
And figures out a way to pimp it to his own benefits
Already surrounded by this mad city
The caterpillar goes to work on the cocoon
Which institutionalizes him
He can no longer see past his own thoughts  he's trapped
When trapped inside these walls certain ideas take root  such as
Going home  and bringing back new concepts to this mad city
The result?
Wings begin to emerge  breaking the cycle of feeling stagnant
Finally free  the butterfly sheds light on situations
That the caterpillar never considered
Ending the internal struggle
Although the butterfly and caterpillar are completely different
They are one and the same
What's your perspective on that?
I got some true stories to tell
You're back outside  but they still lied

Don't ask for your favorite rapper

And this is rigor mortis and it's gorgeous when you die
Ali recorded and I'm Morpheus  the matrix of my mind
I'm out the orbit  you an orphan and a hairdresser combined
I'm on the toilet when I rhyme  if you the shit  then I decline
I climax where you begin and then I end on cloud nine
And that's important when you morph into an angel in the sky
And don't be forging all my signatures  my listeners reply
And tell me that you biting style  you got a hell of an appetite
And I'ma be here for a while  just buckle up before the ride
Or knuckle up if you can fight  we always making 'em duck or die
A suit and tie is suitable and usual in suicide
CSI just might investigate this fucking parasite
(He dead  amen)
That's what they telling me
Aim it at your celebrity  this is studio felony
Ferragami so many and cool enough for the '70s
Dead 'em all and especially
Leave a call on his mother voicemail that say that he rest in peace

And I go visit the nearest creek  and I get busy on many MC
Really ballistic  anybody can see

I met her at this house party on El Segundo and Central
She had the credentials of strippers in Atlanta
Ass came with a hump  from the jump she was a camel
I want to ride like Arabians  push an '04 Mercedes-Benz
Ciara had played in the background
The parade music we made had us all wearin' shades now  cool
Where you stay? She said  Down the street from Dominguez High
Okay  I know that's borderline Compton or Paramount
Then quickly start battin' her eyes
I strictly had wanted her thighs around me
Seventeen with nothin' but pussy stuck on my mental
My motive was rather sinful  What you tryna get into?
She didn't tell  just gave me her Nextel
The summer had passed  and now I'm likin' her
Conversation we havin' probably enticin' her
Who can imagine? Maybe my actions'll end up wifin' her
It's deep-rooted  the music of bein' young and dumb
We know a lot 'bout each other  her mother was a crack addict
She live with her granny and her younger two brothers
Her favorite cousin Demetrius is irrepetible
Family history of gangbangin' did make me skeptical
But not enough to stop me from gettin' a nut
I wanna come over  what's up?
That's what I told her soon as this episode
Of Martin go off  I'm tryna get off
I was in heat like a cactus
My tactics of bein' thirsty probably could hurt me
But fuck it  I got some heart
So now I'm down Rosecrans in a Caravan
Passin' Alameda  my gas meter in need of a pump
I got enough to get me through the traffic jam
I'm thinkin' 'bout that sex
Thinkin' 'bout her thighs or maybe kissin' on her neck or maybe what position's next
Sent a picture of her titties  blowin' up my texts
I looked at 'em and almost ran my front bumper into Corvette
Enthused by the touch of a woman  she's a masseuse
And I'm a professional pornstar when off the Goose
I had a fifth in the trunk like Curtis Jackson for ransom
I'm hopin' to get her loose like an Uncle Luke anthem
I'm two blocks away  two hundred and fifty feet
And six steps from where she stay  she wavin' me 'cross the street

All I—all I—all I—
All I have in life is my new appetite for failure
Is in the bottom of a bottle and the greenest indo leaf
As the window open  I release everything that corrode inside of me
I see you jokin'  why you laugh? Don't you feel bad? I prob'ly sleep
In God I trust  but just when I thought I had enough
They stomped the homie out over a bitch?
Now we can drop  ye we can drop you back off
We gon' do the same ol' shit
I'ma pop a few shots  they gon' ru—they run opposite way
Fall right in ****'s lap

One day it's gon' burn you out  out  out

Bougie bitches with no extensions
Hood niggas with bad intentions  the perfect combination
Before we sparked a conversation
We seen three niggas in colors we didn't like
Then started interrogatin'
I never was a gangbanger  I mean
I never was stranger to the fonk neither  I really doubt it
Rush a nigga quick and then we laugh about it

Yeah  we finally got that nigga faded
I think he hit the wrong blunt though
Ooh  which one?
Well  which one he talkin' about?
I was finna hit the one with the shenanigans in it
I pray he ain't hit that
Nah  that nigga straight  he ain't hit that one
Got the shenanigans? Give that nigga the shenanigans!
Nigga  I think we should push back to the city  fo' real doe
Nigga  for what?
What that nigga— what's that Jeezy song say  nigga?
Last time I checked I was the man on these streets!
Yeah  yeah  that shit right there
I'm tryna be the nigga in the street
There he go. Man  you don't even know how the shit go
Look  here's the plan  luv
'Cause I know he tryna fuck on Sherane tonight
That's what he's not gon' do
Then we all gon' meet back at the block at about 10:30
That's straight  but we should meet up around 12
I'm tryna fuck on somethin' too
Nigga  sit yo dumb-ass back down!
Nigga  you ain't doin' shit tonight!
Matter of fact  nigga  get in the mothafuckin' car!
We finna get active!
I want everything black  I ain't need black (Down to our knees)
I hate everything black (We don't believe)
Black  I want all things black
I don't need black  I want everything black
I don't need black  our eyes ain't black
I own black  I own everything black
Six in the morn'
Fire in the street
And sometimes I get off watchin' you die in vain
It's such a shame  they may call me crazy
They may say I suffer from schizophrenia or somethin'
Black don't crack  my nigga
I'm the biggest hypocrite of 2015
Once I finish this  witnesses will convey just what I mean
Been feelin' this way since I was sixteen  came to my senses
Heritage of a small village  pardon my residence
Came from the bottom of mankind
You hate me  don't you?
You hate my people  your plan is to terminate my culture
You're fuckin' evil
I want you to recognize that I'm a proud monkey
You vandalize my perception but can't take style from me
And this is more than confession
I mean I might press the button just so you know my discretion
I'm guardin' my feelings  I know that you feel it
You sabotage my community  makin' a killin'
You made me a killer  emancipation of a real nigga

And man a say they put me inna chains cah we Black
Imagine now  big gold chains full of rocks
How you no see the whip  left scars 'pon me back
But now we have a big whip parked 'pon the block
All them say we doomed from the start cah we Black
I'm the biggest hypocrite of 2015
Once I finish this  witnesses will convey just what I mean
I mean  it's evident that I'm irrelevant to society
That's what you're tellin' me  penitentiary would only hire me
Curse me 'til I'm dead  church me with your fake prophesizing
That I'ma be just another slave in my head
Institutionalized manipulation and lies
Reciprocation of freedom only live in your eyes
You hate me  don't you?
I know you hate me just as much as you hate yourself
Jealous of my wisdom and cards I dealt
Black and successful  this Black man meant to be special
How can I tell you I'm making a killin'?
You made me a killer  emancipation of a real nigga

I'm the biggest hypocrite of 2015
This plot is bigger than me  it's generational hatred
I'm African-American  I'm African
I'm Black as the heart of a fuckin' Aryan
I'm Black as the name of Tyrone and Darius  excuse my French
I know you hate me  don't you?
You hate my people  I can tell 'cause it's threats when I see you
I can tell 'cause your ways deceitful
Know I can tell because you in love with that Desert Eagle
Thinkin' maliciously  he get a chain then you gon' bleed him
It's funny how Zulu and Xhosa might go to war
Two tribal armies that wanna build and destroy
Remind me of these Compton Crip gangs that live next door
Beefin' with Pirus  only death settle the score
So don't matter how much I say I like to preach with the Panthers
Or tell Georgia State Marcus Garvey got all the answers
Or try to celebrate February like it's my B-Day
Or jump high enough to get Michael Jordan endorsements
Or watch BET 'cause urban support is important
So why did I weep when Trayvon Martin was in the street
When gang-banging make me kill a nigga blacker than me?
Hypocrite!
I won’t tell the truth 'bout you
Don't tell a lie on me
I won’t tell the truth 'bout you
The legendary status of a hip-hop rhyme savior
Travel round the atlas in this spaceship
Been devoted to fuckin' up bundles of paper
Pi equals three-fourteen
The devil's pie is big enough to justify the whole thing
This seed in this soil is classified
I'm satisfied when I strategize my kid’s future
I ain't sanctified enough to say that I won't shoot ya
I done vandalized the industry full circuit
The earthiest slash thirstiest nigga you know versus this
Scum of a land that transcend two surfaces

What you hearin' now is a paranormal vibe
You know what the risk is
The whole world gone mad
Donald Trump is a chump
Electorial votes look like memorial votes
But America's truth ain't ignorin' the votes
How many leaders gon' tell you the truth after me?
The legendary status of a hip-hop rhyme savior
Me and Top Dawg playin' rock-paper-scissors in court
A real hustler lose money just to go get some more
In my E-Y-E's—it's not a game
Lee Baca on trial tryna portray a boxer
Beatin' up on my niggas while the CO's watch him
Go celebrate witcha team and let victory vouch you
(Sit yo punk-ass down)
So that means you ain't bigger than rapping (What else?)
So that means no more playin' the back scenes (What else?)
My spot is solidified if you ask me (What else?)
My name is identified as That King
A difference between accomplishments and astonishments
Y'all got 'til April the 7th to get y'all shit together
Let's get it!
And my perspective may differ from yours
I wanna say thank you to everyone that's been down with me
All my fans  all my beautiful fans
Anyone who's ever gave me a listen  all my people
I come from a generation of pain  where murder is minor
Rebellious and Margielas'll chip you for designer
Belt buckles and clout  overzealous if prone to violence
Make the wrong turn  be it will or the wheel alignment
Residue burned  mist of the inner-city
Miscommunication to keep homi' detective busy
No protection is risky
Get used to hearin' arsenal rain
Homies done fucked your baby mama once you hit the yard
That's culture
Twenty-three hour lockdown  then somebody called
Said your lil' nephew was shot down  the culture's involved
I done seen niggas do seventeen  hit the halfway house
Get out and get his brains blown out  lookin' to buy some weed
Car wash is played out  new GoFundMe accounts'll proceed
A brand-new victim'll shatter those dreams
The culture

Look what I done for you
I said I do this for my culture
To let y'all know what a nigga look like in a bulletproof Rover
In my mama's sofa was a doo-doo popper
Friends bipolar  grab you by your pockets
No option if you froze up  always play the offense
Niggas goin' to work and sellin' work  late for work
The streets got me fucked up  y'all can miss me
I wanna represent for us
New revolution was up and movin'
I'm in Argentina wiping my tears  full of confusion
Water in between us  another peer's been executed
History repeats again
Make amends  then find a nigga with the same skin to do it
But that's the culture  crack a bottle
Hard to deal with the pain when you're sober
That's the problem
Our foundation was trained to accept whatever follows
Dehumanized  insensitive
Scrutinize the way we live for you and I
Enemies shook my hand  I can promise I'll meet you
In the land where no equal is your equal
Never say I ain't told ya  nah
In the land where hurt people hurt more people
Fuck callin' it culture
I want the hood
Look what I done for you (Look what I done for you)
Look what I done for you
Take the drums out
Celebrate new life when it come back around
The purpose is in the lessons we learnin' now
Sacrifice personal gain over everything
Just to see the next generation better than ours
I wasn't perfect  the skin I was in had truly suffered
But all-in-all  my productivity had stayed urgent
Face your fears  always knew that I would make it here
Where the energy is magnified and persevered
Consciousness is synchronized and crystal-clear
Euphoria is glorified and made His
Reflectin' on my life and what I done
Them same views made schools change curriculums
But didn't change me starin' down the barrel of the gun
Should I feel resentful I didn't see my full potential?
Should I feel regret about the good that I was into?
Everything is everything  this ain't coincidental
I woke up that morning with more heart to give you
As I bleed through the speakers  feel my presence
To my friends  make sure you countin' them blessings
To my fans  make sure you make them investments
And to the killer that sped up my demise
I forgive you  just know your soul's in question
I seen the pain in your pupil when that trigger had squeezed
And though you did me gruesome  I was surely relieved
I completed my mission  wasn't ready to leave
But fulfilled my days  my Creator was pleased
I can't stress how I love y'all
I don't need to be in flesh just to hug y'all
The memories recollect just because y'all
Celebrate me with respect
The unity we protect is above all
And Sam  I'll be watchin' over you
Make sure my kids watch all my interviews
Make sure you live out our dreams we produced
Keep that genius in your brain on the move
And to my neighborhood  let the good prevail
Make sure them babies and the leaders outta jail
Look for salvation when troubles get real
'Cause you can't help the world until you help yourself
And I can't blame the hood the day that I was killed
Y'all had to see it  that's the only way to feel
And though my physical won't reap the benefits
The energy that carry on emits still
'Cause you've taught me to
Smokin' weed with you
'Cause you've taught me to)
Down the block and you look outside
Then roll it up for me when I'm stressed

Toward three W's in life
You know blow job need an application
And eating pussy make appetite

No boat  I float better than he would
No life jacket  I'm not the God of Nazareth
But your flood can be misunderstood
Walls telling me they full of pain  resentment
Need someone to live in them just to relieve tension
Me  I'm just a tenant
Landlord said these walls vacant more than a minute
These walls are vulnerable  exclamation
Interior pink  color coordinated
I interrogated every nook and cranny
These walls want to cry tears
These walls happier when I'm here

Knock these walls down  that's my religion
Walls feeling like they ready to close in
I suffocate  then catch my second wind
I resonate in these walls
I don't know how long I can wait in these walls
I've been on the streets too long
Looking at you from the outside in
They sing the same old song
About how they walls always the cleanest
I beg to differ  I must've missed them
I'm not involved  I'd rather diss 'em
I'd rather call on you  put your wall up
'Cause when I come around  demolition gon' crush

If your walls could talk  they'd tell you it's too late
Your destiny accepted your fate
Burn accessories and stash them on the yard
Take the recipe  the Bible and God
Wall telling you that commissary is low
Race wars happening  no calling CO
No calling your mother to save you
Homies to say you're irrepetible  not acceptable
Your behavior is Sammy the Bull like
A killer that turned snitch
Walls is telling me you a bitch
You pray for appeals hoping the warden would afford them
That sentence so important
Walls telling you to listen to Sing About Me
Retaliation is strong  you even dream 'bout me
Killed my homeboy and God spared your life
Dumb criminal got indicted same night
So when you play this song  rewind the first verse
About me abusing my power so you can hurt
About me and her in the shower whenever she horny
About me and her in the after hours of the morning
About her baby daddy currently serving life
And how she think about you until we meet up at night
About the only girl that cared about you when you asked her
And how she fuckin' on a famous rapper
Walls can talk (Talk)
I remember you was conflicted
Misusing your influence
Sometimes I did the same
Abusing my power  full of resentment
Resentment that turned into a deep depression

It ain't nothin' but a Compton thang
Fresh outta school 'cause I was a high school grad'
Sleepin' in the living room of my mama's pad
Security guard for a month and ended up leavin'
Cocaine laced in marijuana
And they wonder why I rarely smoke now
Imagine if your first blunt had you foamin' at the mouth
I made allegiance that made a promise to see you bleedin'
You know the reasons but still'll never know my life
Kendrick a.k.a. Compton's Human Sacrifice
Cluck heads all up and down the block and shit
One time's crooked and shit
Block a nigga in
And niggas that rep colors is doin' the same thang
Couple of IV's with the fuckin' spray-can
And a bird and ten grand's where a mothafucka stand
Perceive me to be innocent Kendrick you seen in the street
With a basketball and some Now and Laters to eat?
Would you say my intelligence now is great relief?
And it's safe to say that our next generation maybe can sleep
With dreams of bein' a lawyer or doctor
Instead of boy with a chopper that hold the cul-de-sac hostage
Kill 'em all if they gossip
Constantly drinkin' and drive
Probably go to the projects

You ain't the one that got fucked up
What you holdin' it for?
Niggas always actin' unsensitive and shit
Don't even trip
 let me be honest
 your dad is not responsive
 son
 son
 that's bad religion
 you could be a bitch even if you got bitches
 fuck what Ozempic did
 get a gym membership
 that's how he treat your moms
 be sure
 but ninety-five is lost
 your strength come from within
 but your daddy ain't one of them
 you'll carry yourself as king
 I hope you don't undermine them
 so you know how it feels to be in alignment
 hopin' a man can see you and not be blinded
 you gave birth to a master manipulator
 and more paper
 the man that like to play victim
 hypersexualizes 'em with kinks of a nympho fetish
 he should die so all of these women can live with a purpose
 I'ma tell y'all one lil' secret
 know that you're playin' your sister
 it's only a matter of time
 keep the family away
 keep the family away
 keep the family safe
 and could change your father's mind
 but he lives inside confusion
 but that's the life he's used to
 sometimes it don't need a reason
 this the reason I made Mr. Morale
 it's hope later
 just play this song when it rains
 I don't have a hatin' bone in my body
 but you showin' up as a seven-year-old
 whorehouse
 therapy's a lovely start
 strip the ego from the bottom
 but wanna be liked so bad that it's puzzlin'
 let's recap moments when you didn't fit in
 just disrespectin' your mother
 don't know which family will love ya
 I wanna see what's under them achievements
 you lied about your surgery
 all is perjury
 you lied about your crew members
 loving you is complicated
 loving you is complicated
 loving you is complicated
 loving you is complicated
 loving you is complicated
 place shame on you still
 feel like you don't feel
 breakin' on marble floors
 tellin' me that I'm yours
 I'm convinced your tolerance nothin' special
 I can name several
 I'll start with your little sister bakin'
 forever despise you—I don't need ya!
 don't let them deceive ya
 made you more complacent
 loving you is complicated

 I'm 'bout to hurl
 but I ain't as fucked up as you
 I think your heart made of bullet proof
 You gotta go
Pimp-pimp (Hooray)
(Hooray)
Pimp-pimp (Hooray)
Pimp-pimp
I'm sick and tired of being tired
Prophesize if we live or not
Promise momma not to fear nobody
Seen black turn 'em Burgundy
Stuck inside the belly of the beast
Can you please pray for me?
Get God on the phone
Said it won't be long
My hood going brazy
Where did we go wrong?
Get Top on the phone
Tell the squad come home
We gon' ball again 'fore he call us home
Get God on the phone
I just got a raise (I just got a raise)
Spent it all on me (I spent it all on me)
Diamonds all appraised (Diamonds all appraised)
And I'm bossing up (And I'm bossing up)
Seen black turn 'em Burgundy
Stuck inside the belly of the beast
Can you please pray for me?
Get God on the phone
Said it won't be long
My hood going brazy
Where did we go wrong?
Get Top on the phone

Parallel park like an alien came visit
Palisade views with some sex
I lost a lot of love for missionary
This the first time I confess
Me and Top is like a Kobe and Phil
Fuck with me and he will kill you himself
TDE the mafia of the west
I did a lot of dumb shit in my past
Dave just bought a new 911
Almost thought I’d seen another plane crash
Q just bought a brand new McLaren
Rock-a-lack about to buy the projects
Moosa got his son dripping in gold
Ali 'bout to let his hair down on hoes
Might blow the whole no whammy on Soul
Might tell Obama be more like Punch
Sounwave caught a Grammy last year
2Teez told me that I'm the one
I can put a rapper on life support
Guarantee that's something none of you want
Ten homies down and they all serving life
What is like twenty-five hundred a month?
What if I empty my bank out and stunt?
What if I certified all of these ones?
Serving it like I belong in the basement
Or live at the Days Inn
(Get Top on the phone)
Who doing the drums?
Man put that nigga on the drums man"
