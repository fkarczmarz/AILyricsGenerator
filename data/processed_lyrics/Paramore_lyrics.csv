lyrics
"Does it mean you wanna slow dance?
Maybe you just want a little extra time to focus
On our romance
What do you mean I got it backwards?
You know we're gonna be forever
Why are you telling me goodbye?
Are we really over now?
Maybe I can change your mind
Soon as you walk out my door
I'm gonna call a hundred times
Now I walk under a pink sky
Lovers float along and pass me by
I pour my heart out to your voicemail
Let you know I caught a bus to your side of town
And now I'm standing at your doorstep
With Los Angeles behind me
'Cause I really need to see you
You might also like
Just so I can smell your skin
I swear I'll never love again
Maybe I can change your mind
As soon as you walk out my door
I'm gonna call a hundred times
I'm not one of those crazy girls
I'm not one of those crazy girls
I'm not one of those crazy girls
I'm not one of those crazy girls
Maybe I can change your mind
As soon as you walk out my door
I'm gonna call a hundred times
Maybe I can change your mind
Soon as you walk out my door
I'm gonna call a hundred times
Ooh
Now I'm one of those crazy girls
Now I'm one of those crazy girls
Now I'm one of those crazy girls
Everything was fine until you came around
And I've been chasing after dreamers in the clouds
After all  wasn't I the one who said
To keep your feet on the ground?
Man  you really brought me back down
Hold on to hope if you got it
Don't let it go for nobody
They say that dreaming is free
But I wouldn't care what it cost me
You got me tied up  but I stay close to the window
And I talk to myself about the places that I used to go
I'm hoping someday maybe I'll just float away
And I'll forget every cynical thing you say
When you gonna hear me out?
Man  you really bring me down
Hold on to hope if you got it
Don't let it go for nobody
They say that dreaming is free
But I wouldn't care what it cost me

Reality will break your heart
Survival will not be the hardest part
It's keeping all your hopes alive
When all the rest of you has died
So let it break your heart
Hold on to hope if you got it
Don't let it go for nobody
Hold on to hope if you got it
Don't let it go for nobody
They say that dreaming is free
 a-just wait  just wait a while
 uh  uh
 you might be the one who's runnin' things
 you could ring anybody's bell and get what you want
 it's easy to ignore trouble

 don't go cryin')
 don't you cry)
 don't you go cryin'
 don't  don't go cryin' to your mama
I'll beg you nice from my knees
And when the world treats you way too fairly
Well  it's a shame I'm a dream
All I wanted was you
All I wanted was you
I think I'll pace my apartment a few times
And fall asleep on the couch
And wake up early to black-and-white reruns
That escape from my mouth (Oh  oh)
All I wanted was you
All I wanted was you
All I wanted was you
All I wanted was you
I could follow you to the beginning
Just to relive the start
And maybe then  we'd remember to slow down
At all of our favorite parts

Your subscription to redemption has been renewed

I memorized all your lines

Little dignity
Little dignity
You got no integrity
(Ah)
(Ah)
(Ah)
Somewhere too far for us to find
Forgotten the taste and smell
Of a world that she's left behind
It's all about the exposure
She's ripping wings off of butterflies
Keep your feet on the ground
When your head's in the clouds
And we'll dig a deep hole
To bury the castle
Bury the castle
Go get your shovel
And we'll dig a deep hole
To bury the castle
Bury the castle

Coiled up on the dirty ground
Her prince finally came to save her
And the rest you can figure out
But it was a trick
To build your home brick by boring brick
Or the wolf's gonna blow it down
Keep your feet on the ground
When your head's in the clouds
And we'll dig a deep hole
To bury the castle
Bury the castle
Go get your shovel
And we'll dig a deep hole
And we'll bury the castle
Bury the castle
Woah
Woah
Because your real life is tragic
You can't feel it with your heart
And I won't believe it
Go get your shovel (You'll be better off without me now)
And we'll dig a deep hole
To bury the castle
Bury the castle
Go get your shovel (You'll be better off without me now)
And we'll dig a deep hole
To bury the castle
Bury the castle
 well
 but not what I wanted
 more
 you can ignore it
 more

I can't think of getting old
It only makes me want to die
And I can't think of who I was
Can't look back
Can't look too far ahead
I got the point
I got the message
I'm just a little bit caught in the middle
I try to keep going  but it's not that simple
I think I'm a little bit caught in the middle
I gotta keep going or they'll call me a quitter
Yeah  I'm caught in the middle
I was dreaming life away
All the while just going blind
Can't see the forest for the trees
Behind the lids of my own eyes

I think I'm a little bit caught in the middle

No  I don't need no help
I can sabotage me by myself
I don't need no one else

In a single year  I've aged one hundred
My social life: a chiropractic appointment

When you're clouding up my mind?
I can't win your losing fight
All the time
Nor can I ever own what's mine
When you're always taking sides
But you won't take away my pride
Not this time
How did we get here
When I used to know you so well?
But how did we get here?
The truth is hiding in your eyes
And it's hanging on your tongue
Just boiling in my blood
But you think that I can't see
What kind of man that you are
If you're a man at all

Hey

When I used to know you so well?
I think I know

I see in you
It might kill me
I think we have an emergency
'Cause I won't stop holding on
So are you listening?
So are you watchin' me?
'Cause I won't stop holding on
This is an emergency
So are you listening?
And I can't pretend
That I don't see this
But it's really not your fault
That no one cares to talk about it
To talk about it
'Cause I've seen love die
Way too many times
When it deserved to be alive
(When it deserved to be alive)
And I've seen you cry
Way too many times
When you deserved to be alive
Alive

 I feel so fake happy
 I been doin' a good job of makin' 'em think
 better hope I don't blink
 it's easy when I'm stompin' on a beat
 if I smile with my teeth
 what's the use?
 dress up my fears
 I'm gonna draw my lipstick wider than my mouth
 they'll never see me frown

Made up of only big white walls
And in the hall
There are people looking through
The window in the door
They know exactly what we're here for
There's no place else you'd rather be
You're always on display
For everyone to watch and learn from
Don't you know by now?
You can't turn back
Because this road is all you'll ever have
Just living proof that the camera's lying
'Cause this is your night so smile
'Cause you'll go out in style
You'll go out in style
Separate from the world
The constant battle that you hate to fight
Just blame the limelight
There's no place else you'd rather be

And now you can't turn back
Because this road is all you'll ever have
Just living proof that the camera's lying
'Cause this is your night so smile

Just breathe it in

So now let's see you walk it
I said let's see you walk it
You do all this big talking
So now let's see you walk it
I said let's see you walk it
Just living proof that the camera's lying
'Cause you'll go out in style
Pearls before swine  all flowers die
Tapped the last good vein
Don't know how to shut it off
Yeah  once you get me going
(I don't know how to stop  I don't know how to stop)
Once you get me going
(I don't know how to stop  I don't know how to)
All for your sake
Became the very thing that I hate
I lost my way
Spinnin' in an endless figure eight
I won't miss the feelin'
My flimsy spine  unsuspicious mind
I was only bein' kind
But you mistook me for weak
And once I get going  mm
I don't know how to stop  I don't know how to stop
Going
I don't know how to stop  I don't know how to

Burnin' at both ends tonight
How could I? How could I?
If I'm made of thin ice
How could I? How could I?
You'd be wise if you thought twice
All for your sake
Became the very thing that I hate
I lost my way
Spinnin' in an endless figure
What remains
And now I think I'm losing my shape
Not a trace
 now find a way around
 what's the problem? You got a lot of nerve
 you can't run away
 you can't run away
 you can't run away
 you can't run away
 so much faith
 my sorry eyes can see
 you can't run away
 you can't run away
 you can't run away
 you can't run away
 so much faith
 so much faith
 so much faith
And I cried 'til I couldn't cry  another heart attack
If I lay on the floor  maybe I'll wake up
And I don't pick up when you call 'cause your voice is a gun
Every word is a bullet hole  shot a hole in the sun
If I never look up  maybe I'll never notice
And you  you want forgiveness
But I  I just can't do it yet
There's still a thread that runs from your body to mine
And you can't break what you don't see  an invisible line
If I follow it down  will we just be alright?
But it could take me all your life to learn to love
How I thought I could love someone  I haven't even begun
If it's all up to us  we might as well give up
And you  you want forgiveness
(I can barely hang on to myself)
But I  I can't give you that
(I can't give you  I can't give you that)
And you  you want forgiveness
(I'm afraid that I'll have nothing left)
But I  I just can't do it yet

But I  I just can't do it yet
I left town with a dime to my name
Said I'm done with all of my fake friends
Self-righteous pawns in a losing game
Got my band and a light that won't go out
Been burning since the day I was born
'Cause I'm not a little girl no more
Some of us have to grow up sometimes
Some of us have to grow up sometimes
Stood in line for so long just to picket
Something I won't ever understand
Aren't you tired of always being mad at the world?
Won't you just admit you don't care?
So don't feel sad for me
I got a love I would die for and a song to sing
Maybe we're both just living out our dream

Some of us have to grow up sometimes
Some of us have to grow up sometimes
Exactly where we left off
I know you're shaking my hand like it is the first time
Are we alright?
Are you recounting all my faults?
And are you racking your brain just to find them all?
Could it be that I've changed?
Or did you? (Woo)
Stop asking why
Why we had to waste so much time
'Cause we can't keep holding on to grudges
Time is a bastard
I won't break my neck to get around it
But aren't we so brave to give up a fight
And let the years go by without us?
'Cause now I feel you by my side
And I don't even care if it's been a while
I can feel that we've changed
And we're better this way (Woo)

If we only had a way to make it all fall faster every day
If only time flew like a dove
Let's make it last forever
We'll make it last forever
Holding on to patience wearing thin
I can't force these eyes to see the end
If only time flew like a dove
Let's make it last forever
We'll make it last forever
And we've got time on our hands
(We've got time) Got nothing but time on our hands

That could describe the hurt
The dullest knife just sawing back and forth

Before I only knew to hesitate
Pin back in the grenade
And all the ways I'd keep you safe
I keep you safe from me
But I never needed to
But you always knew the truth
I got too good at fighting chemicals

Wading through the fog and then it disappeared
Naked when I'm here

At once so crystal clear?

She's got a body like an hourglass  it's ticking like a clock
It's a matter of time before we all run out
When I thought he was mine  she caught him by the mouth
I waited eight long months  she finally set him free
I told him I couldn't lie  he was the only one for me
Two weeks and we caught on fire
She's got it out for me  but I wear the biggest smile
Woah  I never meant to brag
But I got him where I want him now
Woah  it was never my intention to brag
To steal it all away from you now
But God  does it feel so good
'Cause I got him where I want him now
And if you could  then you know you would
'Cause God  it just feels so
It just feels so good

Woah  I never meant to brag
But I got him where I want him now
Woah  it was never my intention to brag
To steal it all away from you now
But God  does it feel so good
'Cause I got him where I want him now
And if you could  then you know you would
'Cause God  it just feels so
I am going away for a while
But I'll be back  don't try and follow me
'Cause I'll return as soon as possible
See  I'm trying to find my place
But it might not be here where I feel safe
We all learn to make mistakes
And run from them  from them
With no direction
We'll run from them  from them
With no conviction
'Cause I'm just one of those ghosts
Traveling endlessly
Don't need no roads
In fact  they follow me
And we just go in circles
Now I'm told that this is life
And pain is just a simple compromise
So we can get what we want out of it
Would someone care to classify
Our broken hearts and twisted minds?
So I can find someone to rely on

And run to them  to them
Full speed ahead
Oh  you are not useless
We are just
Misguided ghosts
Traveling endlessly
The ones we trusted the most
Pushed us far away
And there's no one road
We should not be the same
But I'm just a ghost
And still they echo me
 I was wrong

 beats for only you
 beats for only you

 oh
Felt it was fitting to continue that correspondence
Can't help I'm sentimental
Thanks for talking with me today
I hope this is helpful for you
I also hope that Birdie is happy and healthy
And staying out of trouble to a reasonable extent
What I wrote was sort of my way of finally being able to address how it feels to have…
Another misspelled band burning their own houses down
Another pine-box tune to fill the cemetery day
Another thorny field to scatter fruitless seed
To drop a nickel in our basket and we'll do our RIOT! dance
In scores of catatonic smile-covered ankle-bitten ships
Throw your pedestal of stone in the forgetful sea
As protection from the paper-thin perfection you project on me
A semi-conscious sorrow sleeping in the bed I've made
And you'll say that's what I get when I let ambition win
And drown my dull reflection in the naïve expectation in your eyes
I had a butcher's heart and no one thought they knew me

…To see myself in the reflection of people's eyes
Realizing that what they see may not even be close to the image I see in myself
And I think I might actually be more afraid to let my own self down than anything else
I feel like the man in the story who saw a bear floating in the river and thought it was a fur coat
The river was rushing toward a waterfall
And my friend stood on the shore and shouted to let go of the coat and swim back to land
Such fragile broken things
A beauty half betrayed
Butterflies with punctured wings
Still there are darkened places
Deep in my heart
Where once was blazing light  now
There's a tiny spark
Oh  glory
Come and find me
Oh  glory
Come and find me
Dancing all alone to the sound of an enemy's song
I'll be lost until you find me
Fighting on my own in a war that's already been won
What a mess  what a mystery we've made
Of love and other simple things
Learning to forgive
Even when it wasn't a mistake
I question every human
Who won't look in my eyes
Scars left on my heart formed
Patterns in my mind

Like the moon  we borrow our light
I am nothing but a shadow in the night
So if you'll let me  I will catch fire
Or make any with precision
So I don't go where you don't want me
You say that I've been changing
That I'm not just simply aging
Just keep on cramming ideas down my throat
Woah
You don't have to believe me
Next time you point a finger
Next time you point a finger
I'll point you to the mirror
If God's the game that you're playing
Because it has to be so lonely
To be the only one who's holy
It's just my humble opinion
But it's one that I believe in
You don't deserve a point of view

I dove in again 'cause I'm not into givin' up
Coulda got the same rush from any lover's touch
Why get used to somethin' new? 'Cause no one breaks my heart like you
(I'm under water) No air in my lungs
(My eyes are open) And I'm givin' up
(You are the wave) I could never tame
As if the first blood didn't thrill enough
I went further out to see what else was left of us
Never found the deep end of our little ocean
The illusion can shatter before we begin

It's not your fault and if it was  I wouldn't care
My heart is bigger than the distance in between us
I know it 'cause I feel it beating
So strong it'll knock you down
So strong  so strong
Over here  I can't count the miles away from where I wanna be
I bet your skin is warm and that you're smiling
Yeah  that's what I always loved the most about you
Baby  if I'm half the man I say I am (Woah)
If I'm a woman with no fear just like I claim I am (Woah)
Then I'll believe in what you say  there's nothing left for you to do
The only proof that I need is you
I'll get in my car  drive it faster than I ever did before
Head out west until I finally reach the shore
And then I'll swim out to wherever you are
And we'll ride the undercurrent down
To the floor  making friends with all the unfamiliar creatures
And pushing back on the unnecessary pressure
Come up for air just so you know we won't drown

My daddy cry and curse at the wind
He broke his own heart and I watched
As he tried to reassemble it
And my mama swore that she would
Never let herself forget
And that was the day that I promised
I'd never sing of love if it does not exist
You are the only exception
You are the only exception
You are the only exception
Maybe I know somewhere
Deep in my soul that love never lasts
And we've got to find other ways
To make it alone or keep a straight face
And I've always lived like this
Keeping a comfortable distance
And up until now  I had sworn
To myself that I'm content with loneliness
Because none of it was ever worth the risk
