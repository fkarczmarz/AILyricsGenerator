lyrics
"Kinda always like it used to be
Sipping wine  killing time
Tryna' to solve life’s mysteries
How’s your life? It’s been a while
God it’s good to see you smile
I see you reaching for your keys
Looking for a reason not to leave
If you don’t know if you should stay
If you don’t say what’s on your mind
Baby just breathe
There’s no where else tonight we should be
You wanna make a memory
I dug up this old photograph
Look at all that hair we had
It’s bittersweet to hear you laugh
Your phone is ringing  I don’t wanna ask
If you go now  I’ll understand
You might also like
You wanna make a memory?
You wanna steal a piece of time?
You could sing a melody to me
And I could write a couple lines
You wanna make a memory
If you don’t know if you should stay
And you don’t say what’s on your mind
Baby just breathe
There’s no where else tonight we should be-
(We shouldn't be) we should be
You wanna make a memory?
You wanna steal a piece of time?
You can sing the melody to me
And I could write a couple lines
You wanna make a memory
But you can't see his blood
It's nothing but some feelings
That this old dog kicked up
It's been raining since you left me
Now I'm drowning in the flood
You see I've always been a fighter
But without you I give up
I can't sing a love song
Like the way it's meant to be
I'll be there till the stars don't shine
Till the heavens burst
And the words don't rhyme
Now your pictures that you left behind
Are just memories of a different life
One that made you have to say goodbye
What I'd give to run my fingers through your hair
When you say your prayers try to understand
You might also like
When he says the words you've been needing to hear
I'll wish I was him 'cause those words are mine
To say to you 'till the end of time
If you told me to cry for you
I could
If you told me to die for you
I would
Take a look at my face
There's no price I won't pay
To say these words to you
But baby if you give me just one more try
We can pack up our old dreams and our old lives
We'll find a place where the sun still shines
I'll be there till the stars don't shine
Till the heavens burst
And the words don't rhyme
Always
There's protests in the street
Her conscience has been looted
And her soul is under siege
I can't breathe
God damn those 8 long minutes
Lying face down in cuffs on the ground
Bystanders pleaded for mercy
When did a judge and a jury
Become a badge and a knee
On these streets?
Use your voice and you remember me
American reckoning
I'll never know what it's like
To walk a mile in his shoes
And I'll never have to have the talk
So it don't happen to you
Three little words written 'cross the chest
Of a twelve year old who hasn't lived life yet
Am I next? Am I next?
You might also like
Use your voice and you remember me
American reckoning
Is this a moment or movement?
Is this the tide or a flood?
Is our American reckoning?
Our story written in blood
Or in love
Or in peace
Use your voice and you remember me
Use your voice and you remember me
American reckoning
Bad medicine is what I need
There ain't no doctor that can cure my disease
(Bad medicine)
I ain't got a fever got a permanent disease
It'll take more than a doctor to prescribe a remedy
I got lots of money but it isn't what I need
Gonna take more than a shot to get this poison out of me
First you need (That's what you get for falling in love)
Then you bleed (You get a little but it's never enough)
On your knees (That's what you get for falling in love)
And now this boy's addicted cause your kiss is the drug
Bad medicine is what I need
There ain't no doctor that can cure my disease
You might also like
I don't need no needle to be giving me a thrill
And I don't need no anesthesia or a nurse to bring a pill
I've got a jones for your affection like a monkey on my back
There ain't no paramedic gonna save this heart attack
When you need (That's what you get for falling in love)
Then you bleed (You get a little but it's never enough)
On your knees (That's what you get for falling in love)
Now this boy is addicted and your kiss is the drug
Bad medicine is what I need
I need a respirator cause I'm running out of breath
You're an all night generator wrapped in stockings and a dress
When you find your medicine you take what you can get
'Cause if there's something better baby well they haven't found it yet
Bad medicine is what I need
There ain't no doctor that can cure my disease
Bad medicine is what I need
Your love's the potion that can cure my disease
Hold on
I'm not done
One more time
With feeling
Come on
Help me out now
Your love is like bad medicine
Bad medicine is what I need
You got the potion that can cure my disease
Your kiss is what I need
 not just another grain of sand (that's right)
 but I'm here to take a stand
 she's missin' those technicolor kisses
 he's feelin' like a broken promise
 starin' down his doubt
 not just another grain of sand (that's right)
 pour a glass of wine
 everything is alright
 not just another grain of sand (that's right)
 but I'm here to take a stand
 our love can move a mountain
 if you believe in we
 just wrap your arms around me
 we can
 not just another grain of sand (That's right) (Oh yeah)
 not just another grain of sand (that's right)
 but I'm here to take a stand
 if you believe in we (Our love can move a mountain)
 just wrap your arms around me (Because we can) ('Cause we can)
 we can
Trying hard to capture the moment this morning I don't know
'Cause a bottle of Vodka is still lodged in my head
And some blonde gave me nightmares
I think that she's still in my bed
As I dream about movies they won't make of me when I'm dead
While some marching band keeps its own beat in my head while we're talking
About all of the things that I long to believe
About love and the truth and what you mean to me
And the truth is baby you're all that I need
I want to lay you down in a bed of roses
For tonight I sleep on a bed of nails
Oh I wanna be just as close as
The Holy Ghost is
And lay you down
On a bed of roses
A king's ransom in dimes I'd given each night just to see through this payphone
Still I run out of time or it's hard to get through
Till the bird on the wire flies me back to you
I'll just close my eyes and whisper
You might also like
I want to lay you down in a bed of roses
For tonight I sleep on a bed of nails
Oh I want to be just as close as
The Holy Ghost is
And lay you down
On a bed of roses
The barkeeper's wig's crooked
And she's giving me the eye
I might have said yeah
But I laughed so hard I think I died
Ooh yeah
Now as you close your eyes know I'll be thinking about you
While my mistress she calls me
To stand in her spotlight again
But you know that don't mean I'm not lonely
I've got nothing to prove for it's you that I'd die to defend
I want to lay you down in a bed of roses
For tonight I sleep on a bed of nails
Oh I want to be just as close as
The Holy Ghost is
And lay you down
I want to lay you down in a bed of roses
For tonight I sleep on a bed of nails
I want to be just as close as
The Holy Ghost is
And lay you down
Let me be clear
Your days are numbered
The end is near
The walls around ya
Are closin' in
It's too late for prayin'
Now they come to take me back
I sleep with one eye open
For my daughter and my three sons
It's the only life they've known
Blood in the water
Who's jumpin' in?
The devil's made his final offer
Now the sharks are circlin'
Blood in the water
Our fates are sealed
The devil's greatest trick
Was just to say he wasn't real
Satan always used to love to say he wasn't real
You might also like
Lies are in the forecast
The truth left with the tide
I hear your shadow sold your secrets
And he's gonna do some time
They say the noose fits like a necktie
With some old familiar faces
Blood in the water
Who's jumpin' in?
The devil's made his final offer
Now the sharks are circlin'
Blood in the water
Our fates are sealed
The devil's greatest trick
Was just to say he wasn't real
Satan always used to love to say he wasn't real
I'm no cable news reporter
They got nothin' new to say
I'm the voice of the new order
The star of Anarchy Today
I'm the comments you keep readin'
At the bottom of the page
I'm a Russian hack by trade
A Russian hack by trade
Blood in the water
Who's jumpin' in
The devil's made his final offer
Now the sharks are circlin'
Blood in the water
Our fates are sealed
The devil's greatest trick
Was just to say he wasn't real
Blood in the water
Blood in the water
Now there's blood in the water
When I was just a kid
When friends were friends forever
And what you said was what you did
We cut each other's hands
And held tight to a promise
Only brothers understand
But were so young (So young)
One for all and all for one (For one)
Just as sure as the river's gonna run
Blood on blood
One on one
We'd still be standing
When all was said and done
Blood on blood
One on one
And I'll be here for you
Until Kingdom come
Blood on blood

One for all and all for one (For one)
Just as sure as the river's gonna run
Blood on blood

When all was said and done
Blood on blood

And I'll be here for you
Until Kingdom come
Blood on blood
In a long haired rock and roll band
Through the years and miles between us
It's been a long and lonely ride
But if I got that call in the dead of the night
I would be right by your side
Blood on blood
Blood on blood
Blood on blood
One on one
We'd still be standing
When all is said and done
Blood on blood
One on one
And I'll be here for you
Until Kingdom come

Rainy night and we worked all day
We both got jobs because there's bills to pay
We got something they can't take away
Our love  our lives
Close the door  leave the cold outside
I don't need nothing when I'm by your side
We got something that'll never die
Our dreams  our pride
My heart beats like a drum (All night)
Flesh to flesh  one to one (And it's alright)
And I'll never let go cause
There's something I know deep inside
That you were born to be my baby
And baby  I was made to be your man
We got something to believe in
Even if we don't know where we stand
Only God would know the reasons
But I bet he must have had a plan
'Cause you were born to be my baby
And baby  I was made to be your man

Our time  our way
So hold me close better hang on tight
Buckle up  baby  it's a bumpy ride
We're two kids hitching down the road of life
Our world  our fight
If we stand side by side (All night)
There's a chance we'll get by (And it's alright)
And I'll know that you'll be live
In my heart till the day that I die
'Cause you were born to be my baby
And baby  I was made to be your man
We got something to believe in
Even if we don't know where we stand
Only God would know the reasons
But I bet he must have had a plan

And they boarded up the schools
Small towns are rollin’ up their sidewalks
One less paycheck comin' through
I know you're feelin’ kinda nervous
We're all a little bit confused
We gotta make it through
As we wave outside the window
Older loved ones stay inside
Moms and babies blowin' kisses
May be saving someone's life
They had to cancel graduation
It ain't fair to Skype the prom
Our kids sit homе in isolation
TV news is always on
When you can't do what you do
You do what you can
When you can't do what you do

They built a hospital on East Meadow in Central Park last night
I saw a Red Cross on the Hudson
They turned off the Broadway lights
Another ambulance screams by
There by the grace of God go I
Although I'll keep my social distance
What this world needs is a hug
Until we find the vaccination
There's no substitute for love
So love yourself and love your family
Love your neighbor and your friend
Ain't it time we loved a stranger?
They're just a friend you ain't met yet
When you can't do what you do
You do what you can
When you can't do what you do
You do what you can
When you can't do what you do
Water into wine
Some say it's the devil's blood
They're squeezing from the vine
Some say it's a savior
In these hard and desperate times
You see it helps me to forget
That we're just born to die
I came here like so many did
To find a better life
To find my piece of easy street
And finally be alive
I knew nothing good comes easy
All good things take some time
To die in it's the crime
You can't help but prosper
Where the streets are paved with gold
They say the oil wells ran deeper here
Than anybody's known
Now I packed up on my wife and kid
And left them both back home
The ghosts are all I know

Now the oil's gone

All the jobs are gone
Still we're hanging on
Down in dry county
They're swimming in the sand
Praying for some holy water
To wash these sins from off our hands
In dry county
The promise has run dry
Where nobody cries
And no one is getting out of here alive
(Not this time)
In the blessed name of Jesus
I heard a preacher say
We are all God's children
I hoped that he knew
Something as he drank that cup of wine
I didn't have too good of a feeling
As I head out to the night
I cursed the sky to open
I begged the clouds for rain
I prayed all night for water
For this burning in my veins (Every night's the same)
It was like my soul's on fire
And I had to watch the flames
All my dreams went up in ashes
And my future blew away
Now the oil's gone
And the money's gone
All the jobs are gone
Still we're hanging on
Down in dry county
They're swimming in the sand
Praying for some holy water
To wash theese sins from off our hands
In dry county
The promise has run dry
Where nobody cries
And no one's getting out of here alive
A man spends his whole life
Waiting praying for some big reward
But it seems sometimes
That payoff leaves you feeling
Like a dirty whore
If I could choose the way I'd die
Make it by the gun or knife
Because the other way there's too much pain
Night after night after night after night
They're swimming in the sand
Praying for some holy water
To wash these sins from off our hands
In dry county
The promise has run dry
Where nobody cries
And no one's getting out of here
Dry County
No one is getting out of here
Dry County

Who  are you to tell me if it's black or white?
Mama  can you hear me? Try to understand
Is innocence the difference between a boy and a man?
My daddy lived the lie  that's just the price that he paid
Sacrificed his life  just slaving away
Ohh  if there's one thing I hang onto
That gets me through the night
I ain't gonna do what I don't want to
I'm gonna live my life
Shining like a diamond  rolling with the dice
Standing on the ledge  I show the wind how to fly
When the world gets in my face
I say  have a nice day
Have a nice day
Take a look around you  nothing's what it seems
We're living in the broken home of hopes and dreams
Let me be the first to shake a helping hand
Anybody brave enough to take a stand
I've knocked on every door  on every dead end street
Looking for forgiveness
What's left to believe?

When the world keeps trying  to drag me down
I gotta raise my hands  I'm gonna stand my ground
Have a nice day
Take a look into these eyes
They burn with fire (Yeah)
Until the end of time
And I would do anything
To have you in these arms tonight
Baby I want you
Like the roses want the rain
You know I need you
Like a poet needs the pain
And I would give anything
If you were in these arms tonight
I'd get down on my knees for you
And make everything alright
If you were in these arms
I'd tell you that I'd never leave you
And love you until the end of time

We stared at the sun

I'd get down on my knees for you
And make everything alright
If you were in these arms
I'd tell you that I'd never leave you
And love you until the end of time
If you were in these arms tonight
Your clothes are still scattered all over our room
This whole place still smells like your cheap perfume
Everything here reminds me of you
And there's nothing that I wouldn't do
And these were our words
I'd get down on my knees for you
And make everything alright
If you were in these arms
I'd tell you that I'd never leave you
And love you until the end of time
If you were in these arms tonight
If you were in these arms tonight
If you were in these arms tonight
If you were in these arms
Baby
Like the roses need the rain
Like the seasons need to change
Like a poet needs the pain
I need you
In these arms tonight
 this ain't a song for the broken-hearted
 I did it my way
 this is for the ones who stood their ground
 'cause they never backed down
 make no mistake
 I did it my way
 I did it my way
 it's like the open highway
 I did it my way
No silent prayer for the faith-departed
I ain't gonna be just a face in the crowd
You're gonna hear my voice when I shout it out loud
It's my life  it's now or never
I ain't gonna live forever
I just want to live while I'm alive
(It's my life) My heart is like an open highway
Like Frankie said  I did it my way
I just wanna live while I'm alive
It's my life
This is for the ones who stood their ground
For Tommy and Gina who never backed down
Tomorrow's getting harder make no mistake
Luck ain't even lucky  got to make your own breaks
It's my life  it's now or never
I ain't gonna live forever
I just want to live while I'm alive
(It's my life) My heart is like an open highway

(It's my life) My heart is like an open highway
Like Frankie said  I did it my way
I just wanna live while I'm alive
Then you would understand
I'd never mean to hurt you
I might not say I'm sorry
And I might forget the little things
Or keep you hangin' on the line
In a world that don't know Romeo and Juliet
Boy meets girl and promises we can't forget (Can't forget)
We are cast from Eden's gate with no regrets
I'd die for you
I'd cry for you
I'd do anything
I'd lie for you
You know it's true
I'd die for you
I'd cry for you

You know it's true

I might not be a savior

'Cause our love is like a hunger
In a world that don't know Romeo and Juliet
Boy meets girl and promises we can't forget (Can't forget)
We are cast from Eden's gate with no regrets
I'd die for you
I'd cry for you
I'd do anything
I'd lie for you
You know it's true
I'd die for you
I'd cry for you
If it came right down to me and you
You know it's true
I'd die for you
I'd cry for you

I'd lie for you
You know it's true
I'd die for you
I'd cry for you
If it came right down to me and you
You know it's true
It's only for you
I heard your suitcase say goodbye
You say true love is suicide
You say you've cried a thousand rivers
And now you're swimmin' for the shore
You left me drownin' in my tears
And you won't save me anymore
I know you know we've had some good times
Now they have their own hidin' place
But I can't buy back yesterday
But I wanted to be your Valentine

Sometimes I wait forever  to stand out in the rain
So no one sees me crying  trying to wash away this pain
Mother  father (Everybody needs somebody to love)
There's things I've done I can't erase
(Everybody needs somebody to hate)
And every night we fall from grace
(Everybody's bitchin' 'cause they can't get enough)
It's hard with the world in your face
Trying to hold on  trying to hold on

These tears fallin' from my eyes
They're taking me by surprise
It's time for me to step aside
Lift your veil and let you fly
Let the preacher say love's favorite line
You may kiss the bride
I do's and a band of gold
A promise to have and hold
A sight that I won't forget
White rice on thе old church steps
We'll say each word and hold a glass up high
You may kiss the bride

There's been shelter from the storm
A place to run for cover
'Til the rain clouds had moved on
Now when I get that feelin'
Before the first drop hits the ground
Wherever there's a soldier
Who won't give up the fight
Wherever there's a darkness
That's tryin' to find the light
Wherever there is hurtin'
There's healing on the way
Like sunshine breakin' through a cloudy day
Let the rain fall all around

A teardrop in the sea

Words that cut like a knife and still ring in your ear

Saw a vagabond king wear a styrofoam crown
Wondered if I might end up the same
There's a man out on the corner
Singing old songs about change
Everybody got their cross to bare these days
She came looking for some shelter
With a suitcase full of dreams
To a motel room on the boulevard
I guess she's trying to be James Dean
She's seen all the disciples
And all the wannabes
No one wants to be themselves these days
Still there's nothing to hold on to but these days
These days  the stars seem out of reach
These days  there ain't a ladder on the streets
These days are fast  nothing lasts in this graceless age
There ain't nobody left but us these days

I should have listened when you said good night
You really meant good bye
But only fools are know-it-alls and I played that fool for you
If the love that I've got for you is gone
And if the river I’ve cried ain’t that long
This ain't a love song
Like we got away with the perfect crime
But we were just a legend in my mind

The clowns wore smiles that wouldn't fade
It made me so mad because I wanted it bad for us baby

We were taught to shoot our rifles
Men and women side by side
Thought we'd be met as liberators
In a thousand-year-old fight

Could save my sergeant's life

Where's my how things used to be?
Save your children from this life
That we can be unbroken
My service dog's done more for me
Than the medication would
There ain't no angel that's comin' to save me
But even if they could
I live my life for each tomorrow
So their memories will live on
Now we're brothers and we're men
To be of service in the end?
Whoa-oh-oh-oh
Whoa-oh-oh-oh
Whoa-oh-oh-oh
Whoa-oh-oh
Whoa-oh-oh-oh
Whoa-oh-oh
When I was younger
You better speak up
Don't be a number
My daddy told me
When there was thunder
Go be the lightning
Don't run for cover
Who's gonna help the helpless
Sometimes we're all alone
These days we're all just looking
For a place that we call home
Now we can't climb over
And you can't go 'round
Build them up
We'll tear them down
Brick by brick
Gonna watch them fall
Build more bridges
And tear down walls

Are the mountains that we climb
These walls
Are the great divide
Brick by brick
Gonna watch them fall
Build more bridges
Tear down walls
The space between us
Is getting wider
We need the spark to
Light the fire
Show me the promise
Give me some feeling
There's too much hurting
We need some healing
Who's gonna help the helpless
Sometimes we're all alone
These days we're one step closer
To that place that we call home
Now we can't climb over
And you can't go 'round
Build them up
We'll tear them down
Brick by brick
Gonna watch them fall
Build more bridges
And tear down walls
These walls
Are the mountains that we climb
These walls
Are the great divide
Brick by brick
Gonna watch them fall
Build more bridges
Tear down these walls
I remember when the world was smaller
And we both felt 10 feet taller
Now we can't climb over
And you can't go 'round
Build them up
We'll tear them down
Brick by brick
Gonna watch them fall
Build more bridges
And tear down walls
These walls
Are the mountains that we climb
These walls
Are the great divide
Brick by brick
Gonna watch them fall
Build more bridges
Tear down these walls

Every day it seems we're wastin' away
Another place where the faces are so cold
I'd drive all night just to get back home
I'm a cowboy
On a steel horse I ride
I'm wanted dead or alive
Wanted dead or alive
Sometimes I sleep  sometimes it's not for days
The people I meet always go their separate ways
Sometimes you tell the day by the bottle that you drink
I'm a cowboy
On a steel horse I ride
I'm wanted (Wanted) dead or alive
Wanted (Wanted) dead or alive
Oh  and I ride

Ooh  I'm a cowboy
On a steel horse I ride
I'm wanted (Wanted) dead or alive
But I walk these streets  a loaded six-string on my back
I play for keeps 'cause I might not make it back
I've been everywhere  (Oh yeah) still I'm standin' tall
I've seen a million faces and I've rocked them all
'Cause I'm a cowboy
On a steel horse  I ride
I'm wanted (Wanted) dead or alive
And I'm a cowboy
I got the night on my side
And I'm wanted (Wanted) dead or alive
And I ride (And I ride)  dead or alive
I still drive (Still drive)  dead or alive
Dead or alive
Dead or alive
Dead or alive
This one goes out to the ones in need
This one goes out to the sinner and the cynical
This ain't about no apology
This road was paved by the hopeless and the hungry
This road was paved by the winds of change
Walking beside the guilty and the innocent
How will you raise your hand when they call your name?
We weren't born to follow
Come on and get up off your knees
When life is a bitter pill to swallow
You gotta hold on to what you believe
Believe that the sun will shine tomorrow
And that your saints and sinners bleed
We weren't born to follow
You gotta stand up for what you believe
This one's about anyone who does it differently
This one's about the one who curses and spits
This ain't about our livin' in a fantasy
This ain't about givin' up or givin' in

We weren't born to follow
You gotta stand up for what you believe
We were finding our own way
There's no wind  there's no rain
In the eye of a hurricane
Every time you climb that mountain
There's another one left to climb
Don't go looking for tomorrow
Leaving yesterday behind
Writing every page together
Those days were not to last forever
Diamonds in the rough
When we were us
Burn the house and torch the skyline
There was more than fire in our eyes
Love meant more than lust
When we were us
We were one  born and raised
More than blood runs through these veins
Cuts can heal  scars will fade
What we had will never change
Seasons pass and time will move on
You don't ever have to let it go
You can only go so far now
Till you're on your way back home

I was looking for something I couldn't replace
I was running away from the only thing I've ever known
Like a blind dog without a bone
I was a gypsy lost in the twilight zone
I hijacked a rainbow and crashed into a pot of gold
Who says you can't go home?
Who says you can't go home?
There's only one place they call me one of their own
Who says you can't go home?
Who says you can't go back?
Been all around the world and as a matter of fact
There's only one place left I want to go
Who says you can't go home?
There isn't one of these lines that I would erase
I lived a million miles of memories on that road
With every step I take I know that I'm not alone

 you give love a bad name
 then put me through hell
 you can't break free
 there's nowhere to run
 the damage is done
 you give love a bad name
 you act so shy
 you're a loaded gun
 there's nowhere to run
 the damage is done
 shot through the heart and you're to blame
 bad name
 bad name
 bad name"
