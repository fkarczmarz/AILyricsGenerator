"That alone makes us major
We can all sit at the table
And grow in his favor
Say yeah (yeah)
Say yeah (yeah)
Say yeah (yeah)
Say yeah (yeah)
Are one and one equals three
I feel it like lightning in the forest
And they can know to pick a note to harmonize a chorus
Don't you know that we're able?
That alone makes us major
We can all sit at the table
And grow in his favor
Say yeah (yeah)
Say yeah (yeah)

Like a solar system thoughts surrounded by you
Won't no another star up there say it ain't true
We shine so bright they can't ignore us
Who could be against us when you know who is for us?
Don't you know that we're able?
That alone makes us major
We can all sit at the table
And grow in his favor
Say yeah (yeah)
Say yeah (yeah)

The love that we have like the clouds in the sky

Got my inspiration in the studio with me tonight  feelin' good
Got a lot to smile about
Talk to y'all niggas
Yessir  hey
My best friend say I'm bottled up  I need a fuckin' therapist
But I can't think of nobody I wanna share this with
Why should I open up on somebody else's carelessness?
Mama workin' all day  Daddy out in the streets
Imagine ten years old  full of doubt and defeat
Growing up around criminals  with clout and deceit
My grandma Loucelle used to tell me  You about what you weep
Added faith to my life and doubt got subtracted
Wanna skip your mind from crying? Better learn something  son
You be beatin' on my couches  why don't you try hit the drums?
As I got better  her body was eaten by leukaemia
Seventh grade  it was cursed and sad
But the gift within it was when I first met Chad
But even Chad could tell you that my Christmas was jinxed
'Cause Grandma Loucelle died on 12-19
I can't help but wonder what kind of black cloud I was under
'Cause fifteen years later  the other died that summer
Bummer

My best friend told me (What?)
You be actin' tough  that's fine (Uh-huh)
But the weight of the world can really crush one's mind
See  you won't even know you hurt sometimes
Until you in conversations  it comes out in a line
That's Atlantis Apartments  we live in half the back
That's where the 12-year-olds there  they be flashing crack
The place we love the most  the hood was built to smash us flat
But I escaped 'cause I chased what made me passionate
Now I got my skate team and spit these acid raps
So many niggas will rise  so many them niggas try
So many them niggas ended up duck-taped and tied
My best friend told me (What?)
You be actin' tough  that's fine (Uh-huh)
But the weight of the world can really crush one's mind
See  you won't even know you hurt sometimes (Uh-huh)
Until you in conversations  it comes out in a line
Jesus will arrange it  but Jesus won't change it
You mad  nigga don't articulate in Sans Script
I.E. we best friends  speak best friend language
I'm a happy nigga  you can't approach me in anguish
Whoever said anything worth working for would be painless?
Can't be mad at the world 'cause you and your girl ain't famous
'Cause you both on Bape  BBC and chain-less
Also you're Range-less  therefore switch lane-less
Know you brain-less dangerous 'cause you pull out the stainless
All of a sudden' you smart  now you do something heinous
First time you get caught  now your ass is famous
No longer chain-less  and the bus switching lanes is a bad look
Your girl with ya man sellin' lane-less  stop
Nigga  rewind and reverse slides three times
Reassess your thinking and trust me  it'll be fine
Now you scrunching your face  tryna ace attainment
When you should be tryna find a place to base your shame  nigga
Success is tangible  don't wait for fame
I thought you would receive it better if I ain't say your name
You unsure of yourself  sit still and think
Review those actions if it fit  put your name in the blank
My best friend told me (What?)
You be actin' tough  that's fine (Uh-huh)
But the weight of the world can really crush one's mind
See  you won't even know you hurt sometimes (Uh-huh)
Until you in conversations  it comes out in a line
Star Trak is who we are
Star Trak is who we are  ooh

A winner never quits

No cactuses  just dust

Thank you for this day

One more time  tell you
We've been down together for so long
Solid and strong
The lights went on
Wasn't your memory you forgot about
When you were down and out
You left dirt in my mouth
I know you're probably saying G
'Cause you really didn't believe
Well  don't you know what they say about the show?
You have decided to stay  you wanna be home
But don't take it no way  me and my bros

Distracted and confused
Gotta make yo' mind up
This is yours to lose
Things will always pop up
Like snowflakes they will move
What you gonna do?

Can't tell what two dudes not allow
You don't like crowds
But you gotta get out
You could change the world if you change your route
You gotta leave your house
Go outside out
I know you're probably saying G
'Cause you really didn't believe

Mister entrepreneur
In this position with no choice

Shows with no hues that look like you do
'Til we all vertically integrated from the floor up
Like gang signs 'cept I bang mines for both ya
Stop sittin' around waitin' for folks to throw you a bone
If you can't buy the building at least stock the shelf (Word)
Is too small a term to completely describe the act
You in the presence of Black Excellence and I'm on the board
Don't let me go
Who cares what they see?
Who cares what they know?
Your first name is Free
Last name is Dom

Who cares if they don't see you?
Don't you know that they're the same?
I need it like I breathe it
Who cares if they don't see you?
You gotta tap in and learn the way
Like a gust of wind
You head me off sometimes
Like a gust of wind
You push me back every once in a while
Like a gust of wind
You remind me there's someone up there
Who ushers in
The air I need to power my sail
When I open the window
I wanna hug you
'Cause you remind me of the air
I said yeah
'Cause when I'm feelin' real low
I remember I love you
I put my hands in the air
And you were there
But I didn't know
I didn't let it go
Then I realized I'm trying to fight it
Just so they can learn to ride it
I had to let it go
Like a gust of wind
You head me off sometimes
Like a gust of wind
You push me back every once in a while

You remind me there's someone up there

So much for effort
Isn't it clear we're here again
Our thing right where we left it
To go there
If it breathes then it is our witness
We have unfinished business
You and I
And so my word is that I'll cross those bridges
With zero regret for limits
My dear it seems we're here again
Was there a glitch in my method
Isn't it clear we're here again
Let's get new GPSes
So next time you see this place remember we we're alone
We'll bring our children from home

Billionaire Club  muchacho
Assorted flavors in these helados
Inspire young minds  and stack my nachos
With the raw determination of a vato
Run across the border with bricks in his poncho
Face like a shot when it's bussin' my glocko
Planning these things 'til I die
When the Holy Father hand me my wings
Giving me music like drugs in the hand of a fiend  they shoot it up
Got more hits than a zip  who want a nug'?
I can go back in time  you be Judge Ito
It repeats the minutes  something like your TiVo
But it's three-hundred thousand more with no remote
Jacob and Lorraine  I used to deal with Tito
But he clowned me and told me that my money's Fritos
Now the Enzo doors go up like a D-Lo
Ree-on  same song sung by my man Nigo
SLR  when the doors go up it's like a fresh L jar

Nigga  you don't know me
First trick on the ramp is the rockin' rollie
Keep one on my staff with a new pro chromey
It bequeaths me to mention that I've been bitten
But affords me to chuckle at what critics have written
He dresses insane  but his music admire
Ask Anna Wintour from Vogue and Esquire
And Vanity Fair  you like Kennedy here
But you should guess who's in the insanity chair
Now it ain't about what I want
Still thumbin' through my life like it's drugstore porn
It's one thing to say that you did it
It's one thing to lie about your digits
It's one thing to say that you live it
It's another for you fuckers to admit it
But I admit I got all this paper
Plus the prettiest faces that's offered by nature
Wanna meet 'em in my house  I got space like NASA
But it don't make me happier by itself  it's sadder
Or like my sister Stace when she lost her pappa
Or Ben dad gettin' a stroke  and nothin' to trap her
John could do  it's ironic but true
It's a simple clue between us and imposters
We hop in the air and don't care what it cost us
Now I'm with N.E.R.D. with a pit full of moshers
I guess you could say that we fly like saucers
Zappin' at niggas  we're classin' at vigor
The cash and crash whippers  the Thrasher Mag gripper
Go 'head and say it  You a rappin' ass nigga
Yessir

Some nights I cry

M-C-A fingering that b-up or that c-up
Fiends creep up with their flesh lookin beat up
And my tennis ball is stuffed with enough work to fill a tea cup
He stuff it in his stem soon as he took it from me
Yellow teeth chapped lips and his nose is runny
He smiled as if he was payin' homage
He said in the back of the apartment
Where they be selling ganja
But beware of the AK held by Haitian Thomas
Son gotta keep him high in them bottoms or some old pajamas
I said shit ma nigga take another hit
We ran up in that crib with them Uzis and them Sigs
Give up the work or we tyin' up the kids
But if you aspire to hustle that's a
How-to to you

Its incredible how I etch my plans out
To be physically subtle and financially stand out
You should see me stick the baguettes on my hands out
And literally carve a structure so no one can touch ya
Teenage girls'll love ya and models wanna fuck ya
Ice cream ya way on to somebody's magazine cover
So much money that the lid threatens eruption
And the bank says you don't
Have to call like you're Usher
And I ain't kill or sell drugs to nobody
But I know niggas that kill and stretch work like pilates
Nigga the crack house was literally right beside me
When them fiends hit that shit they kick just like karate
Who issued too much quicker than luis rank and m belly
'Cause though I paperchase my memories won't fail me
This that shit make you wanna hustle
Carry squirt guns shootin' metal wit muffles
Trunk full of cash wit a couple of duffles
So we can sip wine and eat a bundle of truffles
We gonna show you how to hustle (Holla back)

In the hood wake up to the hammer noise
Sound like the work of my jerks the swagger boys
Pull up in them eyes wide open
Stack of toys
If your girl want to leave with us that's her choice
The feelin throbbin' I got it and poppin' phenomenon
Nigga signed a million dollar check wit his pajamas on
Film it like a porno no need to re-word it
Nigga the Enzo just came and I ain't have to jerk it
Yeah niggas you heard it the perversion of stars
I guess if I go in my garage it'd be a ménage
Niggas can't hate on this like summer in '84
Knee highs and potato chips
New cript and Florida were the soul core corridors
Tell Jacoblight on the platinum keep the fire in the chain
Yikes I mean ice on the motherfucker gleam
I guess if my ice is fire it leave you niggas stinged
If you remove the between you see I achievin' you dreams
This that shit make you wanna hustle
Carry square guns shootin' metal wit muffles
Trunk full of cash wit a couple of duffles
So we can sip wine and eat a bundle of truffles
We gonna show you how to hustle (Holla back)

Pusha  Skateboard P
Give it to 'em
You're that girl
Who thinks the world
Is something beautiful
And that's all  baby
But you're lookin' far abroad
Wishing upon the wrong star
'Cause you don't know
That's not how it goes
So  I can't explain
Why things remain the same and others change
He made it that way
But the perplexities of the world
Leaves more oysters and pearls
And I don't know
That's just the way it goes
But I know you can
Stay with me
Lock the door
Take the key
I am yours
Feel it  babe

And blow with the breeze
And come back next spring
But the perplexities of life
Brings more days that form new skies
So who's to know
I suppose that you could
Stay with me
Lock the door
Take the key
I am yours
Feel it  babe
It is yours
It is yours

Up  up and away
I'll be the wind that blows your sail
The pixie dust of Tinker Bell
I'll be the wind beneath your wings (Pusha)
The vivid colors of your dreams  oh (Let's go)
Baby  let's pour it up
Lift them Gallardo doors up
Paris for them Louis as soon as the tour's up
The million dollar frames is his and her the same
I took it on the chin when I heard about the lame
And no  I ain't here to try to rewrite your past (Nah)
That don't measure up to all the nights that we laughed
When considering love  you take the good with the bad
I've been disappointed by every bitch I ever had
Either she was dick crazy or cheddar mad
Shame what they did for them jeans and them leather bags
Reverse it  I want perfect
That was half the reason I bought half them purses
That chapter is over  it was worth it
My new angel surfaced
She ain't have to rehearse it
My baby's real
That's why I put the chill on her
So good make a nigga wanna kneel on her—not yet
Stay with me
Lock the door
Take the key
I am yours
Feel it  babe
It is yours

Chattin' but nothing's happened
'Cause I promise I'll be gentle

Yeah
Ever been in love before?
I wanna holla at you  ma
You know it's hard for a player to admit that sometimes
But I'ma spit that sometimes  y'know what I'm sayin?
There's something 'bout this girl man  from around my way
She from around the way
Ever try to hold back your feelings  but it just wouldn't stay
It wouldn't stay  wouldn't stay
But when I finally found the words to say
You can try to run and hide  it won't make a difference
You can lie to yourself  let me reason
Sure it hurts when it comes to your attention
That you're in love with the girl
Yes sir  that's her
But it wasn't like that back when I met her
The lavish life from all the dough spun
Before the double R had to hitchhike thumb
Her friends didn't like niggas like us
But I arrested the coochie and her feelings got cuffed
Spider web sex must have got caught up
But there's more to it I remember once
Sayin' Let's shit on the peons
Let's go to Vegas and watch Celine Dion
Make 'em say What we on?
You say no like you was doin' it for eons
Fuck it I just hum and let the watch give off the neons
When it rains it pours  I laugh to myself when I change the score
You said my sex was a lot but my brain gave you more
And somethin' 'bout how your ex was a toy  I guess he played games
It's only diamond dice here not tryin' to justify
But when you shut your eye you can touch the sky
You in trouble ma  and you should pray about speed
But if that's 'bout you  what that say about me?

See I'm a crip in dark blue Chucks
And I does what I does yeah I might say cuz
It's really weird cause a nigga got love
Snoop Dogg's a crip and the girl was a blood
She told me that her baby daddy was a thug
Now it is what it is and it was not was
I'm hollerin' at lil mama like what
Monday morn stack tryna get my cheese back
All these memories breed seed to the rhythm rhyme pleaser
Lay back while we sippin' on a breezer
Fresh four pack sittin' in the freezer
Ain't that Kadija I heard she was a skeezer
She used to hit them licks wit' the visas
When I seen her wit the homies I was like Jesus
It's been a little minute since I seen her
Hope her man don't run up cause I'll have to pull the nina
There's something 'bout this girl man  from around my way
Ever try to hold back your feelings  but it just wouldn't stay

And it's about what you and I decide
And it's important for you to remember we did this together
I'm a sinner
Sometimes I only did what was required
I'm a sinner
Sometimes I sat down when I got tired
Should've stayed standing up
To do the job for which I was hired
But the good Lord
Thank you for relighting my fire
Grab someone you love
There's something special on the other side of this moment
And it's about what you and I decide
And it's important for you to remember we did this together
There's a brush fire
TV's watching it escalate
Smoke signals going up (read the signs)
It'll take your breath away
But they don't know how we act now
We'll turn our tomorrow into yesterday
Don't you nest away

Ayo
Never in a million years  I'll imagine I'll get my thrills
By listening to squeals of the PJ wheels
As we land  I duck down  I stick my head up
My dick is being sucked down by a bitch named What Now
I look in her eyes and her eyes are like an orange star
Look at the reflection of my foreign car  the R&R
I stick my feet out  you know the Bapes that's made of eel
You know the new shits with Nigo face right on the heel
I was in marching band  I was a skateboarder
Jesus made wine  I couldn't make water
Oxymoronic  I'm here to destroy all you hate hoarders
You niggas was cool in school  now you niggas take orders
I'm not dissin' your job
But now you listen and nod
Some Outer Limits shit  I know this position is odd
Don't gasp for air

I know niggas is like  there's no returning when I
Bought that white 5-50
So white that the coke heads just might try sniff
Or ordered the Phantom coupe  that's smoke pipe grey
And the interior was like crack rock beige
At least that's what it looked like when it was on that page
I combed the whole brochure and it did not say  oh well
Life's a bitch  but not too extreme
Life's got a fat ass
Trust me  I'ma fuck full steam
I make the world cream and scream while I'm gettin' my cream
I'm Coming To America  call me Prince Akeem  yessir
It's kinda weird  'cause this our dream
Kinda prophetic  you get it
'Cause this  I've seen
These type of visions  since I was teen
I told my teacher what I saw  she said I missed Visine
Laughed with the class  but with the slightest clue
You be buying my shit  and I be rappin' to you

I know you heard the story about the dude with the attitude
Pharrell  he don't even know you but he mad at you
He got robbed and it seems that he has accused
He's really frustrated and all that he has is you
So  things propel and things excel
The next thing bang comes out the barrell
And my man they accused sittin' tight up in jail
Ironically close  my man Lou can hear him yell
I ain't do it but somebody dropped him flat
I felt the wind from it  that was God cocking back
I got a call from Virginia grandma went back
The line was fluctuated but it just now went flat
See  her body went down and her soul went up
She sent angels around me so evil could not touch
I don't lie no more and I'm horny when I fuck
Wealthy niggas with a conscience  yeah  you know what's up
The wires across  and it's breeding a plague
The conscience is hungry  and it's eating away
Trying to make sense of it  but it's speedy in vain
Up all night with the books and you read 'til the day
But still ya high sadity 'cause you got a lil' paper
Push a cat in the corner  trust me  it's the nature
Never underestimate the things you do
Read Job verse 2  inhale the ooh  and go
You can do it  too  young love
You can do it  too  young love
Just watch what you do  young love
