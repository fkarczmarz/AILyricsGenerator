Will it get me far?
Should I lose some weight?
Am I gonna be a star?
I tried to be a boy
I tried to be a girl
I tried to be a mess
I tried to be the best
I guess I did it wrong
It's why I wrote this song
Looking for sympathy
A little company
I tried to find a friend
It's more easily said
It's always been the same

I tried to stay on top
I tried to play the part
But somehow I forgot
Just what I did it for
And why I wanted more
Do I have to change my name?
Will it get me far?
Should I lose some weight?
Am I gonna be a star?

I drive my Mini Cooper and I'm feeling super-duper
I'd like to express my extreme point of view
I'm not a Christian and I'm not a Jew
I'm just livin' out the American Dream
And I just realized that nothin' is what it seems
Do I have to change my name? (American life)
Am I gonna be a star? (I live the American Dream)
Do I have to change my name? (American life)

Do I have to change my name?

So tired of broken hearts and losing at this game
Before I start this dance
I take a chance in telling you
I want more than just romance
You are my destiny
Cupid  please take your aim at me
Cherish the thought
Of always having you here by my side
Oh baby  I cherish the joy
You keep bringing it into my life
I'm always singing it  cherish your strength
You got the power to make me feel good
And baby  I perish the thought
Of ever leaving  I never would
I was never satisfied with casual encounters
I can't hide my need
For two hearts that bleed
With burning love
That's the way it's got to be
Romeo and Juliet  they never felt this way I bet
So don't underestimate my point of view

Cherish is the word I use to remind me of your love
You're givin' it
You're givin' it to me boy
Keep giving me all-all-all your joy
Give me faith
I will always cherish you
Romeo and Juliet  they never felt this way I bet

Strangers making the most of the dark
Two by two  their bodies become one
I see you through the smokey air
Can't you feel the weight of my stare?
You're so close but still a world away
What I'm dying to say  is that
I'm crazy for you
Touch me once and you'll know it's true
I never wanted anyone like this
It's all brand new
You'll feel it in my kiss
I'm crazy for you
Crazy for you
Trying hard to control my heart
I walk over to where you are
Eye to eye we need no words at all
Slowly now  we begin to move
Every breath I'm deeper into you
Soon we two are standing still in time

Crazy for you  baby

It's gon' be the last night I wait up for you
Spent a long time wakin' up
Used to think that I was not enough for you
Now I see that I'm just way too much
Now I see that I'm who I can trust
And you got a lot of wrong you're tryna make good
But if you think I've been foolish
And you only fool me once
I guess it's shame on you
And you keep on tryna do it
'Cause you're driving me crazy
You must think I'm crazy
Você me põe tão louca
Você pensa que eu sou louca
And I won't let you drive me crazy

It's a beautiful dream  but a dream is earned
I can dress like a boy  I can dress like a girl
Keep your beautiful words  'cause I'm not concerned
'Cause your world is such a shame
'Cause your world's obsessed with fame
'Cause your world's in so much pain
'Cause your world is  'cause your world is
Up in flames
It's a beautiful game (Hmm) that I never learned
People tell me to shut my mouth (Shut your mouth)  that I might get burned
Keep your beautiful lies (Hmm) 'cause I'm not concerned
'Cause your world is such a shame
'Cause your world's obsessed with fame
'Cause your world's in so much pain
'Cause your world is  'cause your world is—
I will﻿ not denounce the things that I have said
I will not renounce my faith in my sweet Lord
He has chosen me to fight against the English
And I'm not afraid at all to die 'cause I believe Him
God is on my side and I'll be His bride
I am not afraid 'cause I have faith in Him
You can cut my hair and throw me in a jail cell
Say that I'm a witch and burn me at the stake
It's all a big mistake
Don't you know to doubt Him is a sin?
I won't give in

They are so naive
They think we are not aware of their crimes
We know  but we are just not ready to act
The storm isn't in the air  it's inside of us
I want to tell you about love and loneliness
But it's getting late now
Can't you hear outside of your Supreme hoodie
The wind that's beginning to howl?
Sweeter and sweeter and sweeter and sweeter
I can't help falling in love
I fall deeper and deeper the further I go
Kisses sent from heaven above
They get sweeter and sweeter the more that I know
When you know the notes to sing
You can sing most anything
That's what my mama told me
'Round and 'round and 'round you go
I let my father mold me
Daddy couldn't be all wrong
And my mama made me learn this song
That's why
I can't help falling in love
I fall deeper and deeper the further I go

Kisses sent from heaven above
They get sweeter and sweeter the more that I know
Someone said that romance was dead
And I believed it instead of remembering
What my mama told me
Let my father mold me
Then you tried to hold me
You remind me what they said
This feeling inside
I can't explain
But my love is alive
And I'm never gonna hide it again
Daddy couldn't be all wrong
And my mama made me learn this song
That's why
I can't help falling in love
I fall deeper and deeper the further I go
Kisses sent from heaven above
They get sweeter and sweeter the more that I know
Deeper and deeper and deeper and deeper
Never gonna hide it again
Sweeter and sweeter and sweeter and sweeter
Never gonna have to pretend
Deeper and deeper and deeper and deeper
Never gonna hide it again
Sweeter and sweeter and sweeter and sweeter

You've got to just let your body move to the music
You've got to just let your body go with the flow
I can't keep from falling in love with you
Teach me how to pray
I've been stranded here in the dark
Take these walls away
I've been swimming in the ocean
'Til I'm almost drowned
Give me something I can believe in
Teach me how to pray
And we can sniff glue and we can do E and we can drop acid
And make the devil pray

When I try to explain how I feel
That I still need your love after all that I've done
You won't believe me
All you will see is a girl you once knew
Although she's dressed up to the nines
At sixes and sevens with you
I had to let it happen  I had to change
Couldn't stay all my life down at heel
Looking out of the window  staying out of the sun
So I chose freedom
Running around  trying everything new
But nothing impressed me at all
I never expected it to
Don't cry for me Argentina
The truth is  I never left you
All through my wild days
My mad existence
I kept my promise
Don't keep your distance
And as for fortune  and as for fame
I never invited them in
Though it seemed to the world  they were all I desired
They are illusions
They're not the solutions they promised to be
The answer was here all the time
I love you and hope you love me

Have I said too much?
There's nothing more I can think of to say to you
But all you have to do is look at me to know
I traded fame for love
Without a second thought
It all became a silly game
Some things cannot be bought
I got exactly what I asked for
Wanted it so badly
I suffered fools so gladly
I've changed my mind

Erotica  romance
My name is Dita  I'll be your mistress tonight
I'd like to put you in a trance
If I take you from behind  push myself into your mind
When you least expect it  will you try and reject it?
If I'm in charge  and I treat you like a child
Will you let yourself go wild  let my mouth go where it wants to?
Give it up  do as I say
Give it up and let me have my way

Do you believe in love?
'Cause I got something to say about it
And it goes something like this
Put your love to the test
Make him express how he feels
And maybe then you'll know your love is real
You don't need diamond rings
Or eighteen karat gold
Fancy cars that go very fast
What you need is a big strong hand
To lift you to your higher ground
Make you feel like a queen on a throne
Make him love you 'til you can't come down

Second best is never enough
Put your love to the test
Make him express how he feels
And maybe then you'll know your love is real
Express yourself
You've got to make him express himself
And when you're gone he might regret it
Think about the love he once had
He'll be back on his knees
To express himself
You've got to make him express himself
What you need is a big strong hand
To lift you to your higher ground
Make you feel like a queen on a throne

Then I went to the far left
I tried to recover my center of gravity
I guess I'm lost
I had to pay the cost
The thing that hurt me most
Was that I wasn't lost
I came from the Midwest
Then I went to the Far East
I tried to discover my own identity
I guess I’m lost
I paid a handsome cost
The thing that hurt the most
Was that I wasn't lost
I wasn't lost
It was a different feeling
A mix of lucidity and craziness
To choose my own life like a full circle
Aquilo que mais magoa
É que eu não estava perdida
Aquilo que mais magoa
É que eu não estava perdida

How can life be what you want it to be?
You're frozen when your heart's not open
You're so consumed with how much you get
You waste your time with hate and regret
You're broken when your heart's not open
Now there's no point in placing the blame
And you should know I suffer the same
Let all the hurt inside of you die

You only see what your eyes want to see
How can life be what you want it to be?
If I could melt your heart
Too much for a man to take
Everything's bound to break
You're all that I can trust
Facing the darkest days
Everyone ran away
I know you're scared tonight
I'll never leave your side
I'll be your fire when the lights go out

'Cause I was always your little girl
But you should know by now
I'm not a baby
You always taught me right from wrong
I may be young at heart
But I know what I'm saying
The one you warned me all about
The one you said I could do without
We're in an awful mess
And I don't mean maybe  please
But I made up my mind  I'm
Keeping my baby  ooh
I'm gonna keep my baby  mm
He says that he's going to marry me
And we can raise a little family
Maybe we'll be all right
It's a sacrifice

Do my tears of mourning sink beneath the sun?
She's got herself a universe gone quickly
For the call of thunder threatens everyone
And I feel like I just got home
And I feel
And I feel like I just got home
And I feel
Faster than the speeding light she's flying
Trying to remember where it all began
She's got herself a little piece of heaven
Waiting for the time when Earth shall be as one
And I feel like I just got home
And I feel
And I feel like I just got home
And I feel
Quicker than a ray of light
Quicker than a ray of light
Quicker than a ray of light

The spell has been broken  I loved you so
Freedom comes when you learn to let go
Creation comes when you learn to say no
You were my lesson I had to learn
I was your fortress you had to burn
Pain is a warning that something's wrong
I pray to God that it won't be long
Do you wanna go higher?
There's nothing left to try
There's no place left to hide
There's no greater power
Than the power of good-bye
Your heart is not open  so I must go
The spell has been broken  I loved you so
You were my lesson I had to learn
I was your fortress
There's nothing left to lose
There's no more heart to bruise
There's no greater power
Than the power of good-bye

Listen
I've had other guys
I've looked into their eyes
But I never knew love before
'Til you walked through my door
I've had other lips
I've sailed a thousand ships
But no matter where I go
'Cause it's true love
You're the one I'm dreaming of
Your heart fits me like a glove
I've heard all the lines
I'm so excited 'cause you're my best friend

You've been through a lot
I'll tell you stories sometimes  y'know?
Seemed like yesterday  I was a baby on the street
I took a holiday  I was steppin' to the beat
I had to pay my rent  on the lower east side
I threw my tag around  let B-boys take me for a ride
I started writing songs  I kinda got into the groove
They tried to criticize my every single move
But then I realized I had nothing left to lose
It took me by surprise when I became the news
I was fearless like a renegade
I had a feeling that I can't explain
I didn't listen to what people said
I was constant as the northern star
I had a fire burning in my heart
I never gave up fighting in the dark

I expressed myself  came like a virgin down the aisle
Exposed my naked ass  and I did it with a smile
And when it came to sex  I knew I walked the borderline
And when I struck a pose  all the gay boys lost their mind
I justified my love  I made you say a little prayer
They had me crucified  you know I had to take you there
I opened up my heart  I learned the power of good-bye
I saw a ray of light  music saved my life (Music saved my life)
I was fearless like a renegade
I had a feeling that I can't explain
I didn't listen to what people said (What you did?)
I was constant as the northern star
I had a fire burning in my heart (Yeah)
I never gave up fighting in the dark (Let's go)
In 1994  I came through the door (What?)
With that born beats versus scratches
My mom's from the Carolina's  pops from Natchez
And QB's where I started flowin'
But I was scared the cops was gonna kick my apartment door in
Had a baby girl by a crazy girl  then I got married
Heavily accosted  that ended in a bad divorce
I know how to pick 'em  don't I?
Never gave a fuck about public pressure
Or the ridicule  I'm too big to lose
Now who's the fool?
And I ain't never been happier  no lie
I'm just your humble servant  I'm Nas
If y'all burn down Ferguson  I'ma riot
My life cannot be compared to anybody
Any trapper (trapper)  any rapper (rapper)
Anybody  saw many bodies
Many coffins  heads or tails
Penny tosses  either that or jail
Not many options on the block I came from
And I turned to a rap messiah  spit rapid fire
And I roll right back to the block I came from
I was fearless like a renegade (Try to tell 'em)
I had a feeling that I can't explain
I didn't listen to what people said
I was constant as the northern star
I had a fire burning in my heart (Yeah)
I never gave up fighting in the dark (Let's go)

Strike a pose

It's called a dance floor
