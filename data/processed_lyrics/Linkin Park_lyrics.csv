lyrics
"Shining with the light from the sun
The sun doesn't give light to the moon assuming
The moon's gonna owe it one
It makes me think of how you act to me
You just turn around and start askin' me about
Things that you want back from me
Sick of you actin' like I owe you this
Find another place to feed your greed
While I find a place to rest
I wanna be in another place
I hate when you say you don't understand
(You'll see it's not meant to be)
A place for my head
Step on people like you do and
Run away all the people I thought I knew
I remember back then who you were
How quiet it is all alone

Sick of you actin' like I owe you this
Find another place to feed your greed
While I find a place to rest
Sick of you actin' like I owe you this
Find another place to feed your greed
While I find a place to rest
I wanna be in another place
I hate when you say you don't understand
(You'll see it's not meant to be)
A place for my head
I wanna be in another place
I hate when you say you don't understand
(You'll see it's not meant to be)
A place for my head
Stay away!
Sick of you actin' like I owe you this
Find another place to feed your greed (A!)
While I find a place to rest
Sick of you actin' like I owe you this
Find another place to feed your greed (Stay away from me!)
And a long memory
I been searching for an answer
Always just out of reach
Blood on the floor
Sirens repeat
I been searching for the courage
To face my enemies
When they turn down the lights
I hear my battle symphony
All the world in front of me
If my armor breaks
I'll fuse it back together
Battle symphony
Please just don't give up on me
And my eyes are wide awake
For my battle symphony
For my battle symphony
They say that I don't belong
Say that I should retreat
That I'm marching to the rhythm
Of a lonesome defeat
But the sound of your voice
Puts the pain in reverse
And for better or worse
You might also like
When they turn down the lights
I hear my battle symphony
All the world in front of me
If my armor breaks
I'll fuse it back together
Battle symphony
Please just don't give up on me
And my eyes are wide awake
Pick myself up off the ground
Pick myself up off the ground
When they turn down the lights
I hear my battle symphony
All the world in front of me
If my armor breaks
I'll fuse it back together
Battle symphony
Please just don't give up on me
And my eyes are wide awake
For my battle symphony
Hand grenade pins in every line
Throw 'em up and let something shine
Goin' out of my fuckin' mind
Filthy mouth  no excuse
Find a new place to hang this noose
String me up from atop these roofs
Knot it tight so I won't get loose
Truth is  you can stop and stare
Bled myself out and no one cares
Dug the trench out  laid down there
With a shovel up out of reach somewhere
Yeah  someone pour it in
Make it a dirt dance floor again
Say your prayers and stomp it out
When they bring that chorus in
I bleed it out  diggin' deeper just to throw it away
I bleed it out  digging deeper just to throw it away
I bleed it out  diggin' deeper just to throw it away
Just to throw it away  just to throw it away
I bleed it out
Go  stop the show
Choppy words and a sloppy flow
Shotgun opera  lock and load
Cock it back and then watch it go
Death is rollin' in every verse
Candy paint on his brand new hearse
Can't contain him  he knows he works
Doesn't matter how hard I try
Half the words don't mean a thing
And I know that I won't be satisfied
So why try ignorin' him?
Make it a dirt dance floor again
Say your prayers and stomp it out
When they bring that chorus in

I've opened up these scars
I'll make you face this!
I've pulled myself so far
I'll make you face this now!
I bleed it out  digging deeper just to throw it away
I bleed it out  diggin' deeper just to throw it away
I bleed it out  diggin' deeper just to throw it away
Just to throw it away  just to throw it away
I bleed it out  diggin' deeper just to throw it away

Just to throw it away  just to throw it away
I bleed it out
I bleed it out
I'm picking me apart again
You all assume I'm safe here in my room
Unless I try to start again
I don't want to be the one the battles always choose
I don't know what's worth fighting for or why I have to scream
I don't know why I instigate and say what I don't mean
So I'm breaking the habit
I'm breaking the habit tonight
I try to catch my breath again
I hurt much more than anytime before
I had no options left again
I don't want to be the one the battles always choose

'Cause I'm the one at fault
I'll never fight again
And this is how it ends
I don't know what's worth fighting for or why I have to scream
But now I have some clarity to show you what I mean
So I'm breaking the habit
I'm breaking the habit
As explosions broke in the sky
All that I needed
Was the one thing I couldn't find
And you were there at the turn
Waiting to let me know
We're building it up
To break it back down
We're building it up
To burn it down
We can't wait to burn it to the ground
The colors conflicted
As the flames climbed into the clouds
I wanted to fix this
But couldn't stop from tearing it down
And you were there at the turn
Caught in the burning glow
And I was there at the turn
Waiting to let you know

And struck me down when I kissed that ring
You lost that right to hold that crown
I built you up but you let me down
And fan the flames as your blazes burn (Burn)
And you were there at the turn
Waiting to let me know
We're building it up
To break it back down
We're building it up
To burn it down
We can't wait to burn it to the ground
And fan the flames as your blazes burn (Burn)
We can't wait to burn it to the ground
And fan the flames as your blazes burn (Burn)
Do I follow my instincts blindly?
Do I hide my pride from these bad dreams
And give in to sad thoughts that are maddening?
Do I sit here and try to stand it?
Or do I try to catch them red-handed?
Do I trust some and get fooled by phoniness?
Or do I trust nobody and live in loneliness?
Because I can't hold on when I'm stretched so thin
I just end up gettin' hurt again
I can't hold on to what I want when I'm stretched so thin
It's all too much to take in
With thoughts of failure sinking in
You might also like
And to go blindly seems senseless
If I hide my pride and let it all go on
Then they'll take from me 'til everything is gone
If I'm killed by the questions like a cancer
Then I'll be buried in the silence of the answer
I can't hold on to what I want when I'm stretched so thin
It's all too much to take in
With thoughts of failure sinking in
How do you think I've lost so much?
I'm so afraid I'm out of touch
How do you expect I will know what to do
When all I know is what you tell me to?
Don't you know!?
I can't tell you how to make it go!
I can't seem to convince myself why!
I can't tell you how to make it go!
I can't seem to convince myself why!
I'm stuck on the outside
I can't hold on to what I want when I'm stretched so thin
It's all too much to take in
With thoughts of failure sinking in
I can't hold on to what I want when I'm stretched so thin
It's all too much to take in
Take me down to the fighting end
Wash the poison from off my skin
Show me how to be whole again
Fly me up on a silver wing
Past the black where the sirens sing
Warm me up in a nova's glow
And drop me down to the dream below
'Cause I'm only a crack
In this castle of glass
Hardly anything there for you to see
For you to see
Bring me home in a blinding dream
Through the secrets that I have seen
Wash the sorrow from off my skin
And show me how to be whole again
'Cause I'm only a crack
In this castle of glass
Hardly anything there for you to see

 they will not heal
 confusing
 I can't seem
 my walls are closing in
 so insecure
 they will not heal
 reacting
 I stand beside my own reflection (My own reflection)
 my walls are closing in
 so insecure
 they will not heal
 they will not heal
 confusing what is real
Sometimes  I need you to stay away from me
Somehow  I need you to go
(Don't stay) Forget our memories  forget our possibilities
What you were changing me into
Just give me myself back and don't stay
Forget our memories  forget our possibilities
Take all your faithlessness with you
Just give me myself back and don't stay
Sometimes  I feel like I trusted you too well
Sometimes  I just feel like screaming at myself
Somehow  I need to be alone
(Don't stay) Forget our memories  forget our possibilities
What you were changing me into
Just give me myself back and don't stay
Forget our memories  forget our possibilities

Replacing this pain with something numb
It's so much easier to go
Than face all this pain here all alone
Something has been taken from deep inside of me
I would take all my shame to the grave
It's easier to run
Replacing this pain with something numb
It's so much easier to go
Than face all this pain here all alone

Sometimes I remember the darkness of my past
Bringing back these memories I wish I didn't have
Sometimes I think of letting go and never looking back
And never moving forward so there'd never be a past
I would take all my shame to the grave
Just washing it aside
All of the helplessness inside
Pretending I don't feel misplaced
Is so much simpler than change
It's easier to run
Replacing this pain with something numb
It's so much easier to go
Than face all this pain here all alone
It's easier to run
Retrace every wrong move that I made
It's easier to go
A little bit of disregard
That everyone can see these scars
I am what I want you to want
What I want you to feel
To just believe this is real
Turn your back like you always do
Face away and pretend that I'm not
But I'll be here 'cause you're all that I've got
I can't feel the way I did before
Time won't heal this damage anymore
I am a little bit insecure
A little unconfident
I am what you never wanna say
But I've never had a doubt

I can't feel the way I did before
I can't feel the way I did before
Time won't heal this damage anymore
I can't feel
Time won't heal
Now sometimes these thoughts in my head speak so loud
Every little thing that I think about
Just builds on top of the pain and doubt
Even though I wanna just let it out
I try to act like I don't mind it  try to keep my mouth so quiet
But sittin' there in my silence just seems to amplify it
When I thought that keepin' this inside would make it better (ti stnaw eno oN)
I never thought that I would end up ruining it forever (siht ot neppah reven ll'tI)
But every time I think I got everything put back together (ti stnaw eno oN)
I end up making more regrets  making more regrets
Falling from grace  I watch it all come apart
Knowing I could've changed it all from the start
Fighting myself  I always lose
Fighting myself  I always lose
I didn't want you to think I'm worn out so easily (ti stnaw eno oN)
I wish I'd held it in so you never knew what built up inside of me (siht ot neppah reven ll'tI)
Now I don't know how it overflowed  spilled out unwillingly (ti stnaw eno oN)
But now everything that I learned to hate came out for you to see
I don't want you to promise you can change everything and make it better (ti stnaw eno oN)
'Cause you can bet I'm gonna end up ruining it forever (siht ot neppah reven ll'tI)
And every time you think you got everything put back together (ti stnaw eno oN)

I can't run with this weight on my back
I can't see 'cause I'm focused on the past
I can't breathe  I need to break free
From the anger that is constantly inside me
I can't run with this weight on my back
I can't see 'cause I'm focused on the past
I can't breathe  I need to break free
From the anger that is constantly inside of me
Falling from grace  I watch it all come apart
Knowing I could've changed it all from the start
I can't breathe  I need to break free
From the anger that is constantly inside of me
Falling from grace  I watch it all come apart
Knowing I could've changed it all from the start
I can't breathe  I need to break free
Sometimes I wonder why this is happenin'
It's like nothin' I could do will distract me when
I think of how I shot myself in the back again
'Cause from the infinite words I could say
I put all the pain you gave to me on display
But didn't realize instead of settin' it free
I took what I hated and made it a part of me
Never goes away
Never goes away
And now you've become a part of me (You'll always be right here)
You've become a part of me (You'll always be my fear)
I can't separate myself from what I've done
I remember when it started happenin'
I'd see you in every thought I had and then
The thoughts slowly found words attached to them
And I knew as they escaped away
I was committin' myself to 'em and every day
I regret sayin' those things 'cause now I see that I
Took what I hated and made it a part of me

I've let you go
And now you've become a part of me (You'll always be right here)

I can't separate myself from what I've done
I've let myself become you
I've let myself become lost inside these thoughts of you
And suddenly tomorrow's a moment washed away
But we both keep on waiting for something we won't find
The light on the horizon was brighter yesterday
And we both keep on waitin' for what we left behind
The light on the horizon was brighter yesterday
Standing at the end of the final masquerade

At the core  I've forgotten (In the middle of my thoughts)
Taken far from my safety (The picture's there)
The memory won't escape me (But why should I care?)
From the top to the bottom (Bottom to top  I stop)
At the core  I've forgotten (In the middle of my thoughts)
Taken far from my safety (The picture's there)
The memory won't escape me (But why should I care?)
There's a place so dark  you can't see the end
(Skies cock back) And shock that which can't defend
The rain then sends dripping acidic questions
Forcefully  the power of suggestion
A small spot of light floods the floor
And pours over the rusted world of pretend
And the eyes ease open  and it's dark again
From the top to the bottom (Bottom to top  I stop)
At the core  I've forgotten (In the middle of my thoughts)
Taken far from my safety (The picture's there)

Eyes burning up
The darkness holding me tightly
Until the sun rises up
Movin' all around  screamin' of the ups and downs
Pollution manifested in perpetual sound
The wheels go round and the sunset creeps
A little piece of paper with a picture drawn
Floats on down the street 'til the wind is gone
And the memory now is like the picture was then
When the paper's crumpled up  it can't be perfect again
From the top to the bottom (Bottom to top  I stop)
At the core  I've forgotten (In the middle of my thoughts)
Taken far from my safety (The picture's there)
The memory won't escape me (But why should I care?)

Everyone feels so far away from me
Heavy thoughts sift through dust and the lies
Tryin' not to break  but I'm so tired of this deceit
Every time I try to make myself get back up on my feet
(I) All I ever think about is this  all the tiring time between
And how trying to put my trust in you just takes so much out of me
Take everything from the inside
And throw it all away
'Cause I swear  for the last time
I won't trust myself with you
Tension is building inside  steadily
Everyone feels so far away from me
Heavy thoughts forcing their way out of me
Tryin' not to break  but I'm so tired of this deceit

Pack it up and disappear
You better have some place to go
'Cause you can't come back around here
Good goodbye
(Don't you come back no more)
Enemies trying to read me
You're all looking highly illiterate
Blindly forgetting if I'm in the mix
You won't find an equivalent
I've been here killing it
And it makes you so mad
Somebody else could be stepping in front of you
And it makes you so mad that you're not the only one
There's more than one of you
And you can't understand the fact
You've got a lot to discuss on the bus
Headed back where you're from

A period is after every sentence
Did my time with my cellmate
Maxed out so now we finished
Every day was like a hail date
Every night was like a hailstorm
Took her back to my tinted windows
Make way for the new queen
Consequence when you ain't there for him
Were you there for him?
Did you care for him?
You were dead wrong
(Don't you come back no more)
So say goodbye and hit the road
Pack it up and disappear
You better have some place to go

Yo
Let me say goodbye to my demons
Let me say goodbye to my past life
Let me say goodbye to the darkness
Tell 'em that I'd rather be here in the starlight
Tell 'em that I'd rather be here where they love me
Tell 'em that I'm yours this is our life
And I still keep raising the bar like
Never seen a young black brother in the chart twice
Goodbye to the stereotypes
You can't tell my kings we can't
Mandem we're linking tings in parks
Now I got a tune with Linkin Park
Like goodbye to my old hoes
Goodbye to the cold roads
I can't die for my postcode
Young little Mike from the Gold Coast
And now I'm inside with my bro bro's
Gang
So say goodbye and hit the road
Pack it up and disappear
You better have some place to go
'Cause you can't come back around here
Good goodbye
Good goodbye

Good goodbye
Good goodbye

Lightweights step it aside when we come in
Feel it in your chest  the syllables get pumpin'
People on the street  they panic and start runnin'
Words on loose-leaf sheet complete comin'
I jump in my mind and summon the rhyme I'm dumpin'
Healing the blind  I promise to let the sun in
Sick of the dark ways we march to the drummin'
Jump when they tell us that they wanna see jumpin'
Fuck that  I wanna see some fists pumpin'
Risk something  take back what's yours
Say somethin' that you know they might attack you for
'Cause I'm sick of being treated like I have before
Like it's stupid standin' for what I'm standin' for
Like this war's really just a different brand of war
Like it doesn't cater to rich and abandon poor
Like they understand you in the back of the jet
When you can't put gas in your tank
These fuckers are laughin' their way to the bank and cashin' the check
Asking you to have compassion and have some respect
For a leader so nervous in an obvious way
Stutterin' and mumblin' for nightly news to replay
And the rest of the world watchin' at the end of the day
You might also like
Amen  amen
Amen  amen
Amen
In my livin' room watching  but I am not laughin'
'Cause when it gets tense  I know what might happen
The world is cold  the bold men take action
Have to react or get blown into fractions
Ten years old  something to see
Another kid my age drugged under a Jeep
Taken and bound and found later under a tree
I wonder if he had thought the next one could be me
Do you see the soldiers that are out today?
They brush the dust from bulletproof vests away
It's ironic  at times like this you'd pray
But a bomb blew the mosque up yesterday
But enough pride inside not to let that show
My brother had a book he would hold with pride
A little red cover with a broken spine
On the back  he hand-wrote a quote inside
When the rich wage war  it's the poor who die
Meanwhile  the leader just talks away
Stutterin' and mumblin' for nightly news to replay
The rest of the world watchin'  at the end of the day
Amen  amen
Amen  amen
Amen
With hands held high into a sky so blue (Amen)
As the ocean opens up to swallow you (Amen)

Stacking up problems that are so unnecessary
Wish that I could slow things down
I wanna let go but there's comfort in the panic
And I drive myself crazy
Thinking everything's about me
'Cause I can't escape the gravity
I'm holding on
Why is everything so heavy?
Holding on
To so much more than I can carry
I keep dragging around what's bringing me down
Holding on
Why is everything so heavy?
You say that I'm paranoid
But I'm pretty sure the world is out to get me
It's not like I make the choice
To let my mind stay so fucking messy
I know I'm not the center of the universe
But you keep spinning 'round me just the same
I know I'm not the center of the universe
But you keep spinning 'round me just the same

 I don't know why
 I designed this rhyme
 all I know
 it's so unreal
 d-didn't even know
 it all fell apart
 it doesn't even matter

 I don't know why
 I designed this rhyme

I've got an aching head
Echoes and buzzing noises
I know the words we said
But wish I could've turned our voices down
This is not black and white
Only organized confusion
I'm just trying to get it right
And in spite of all I should've done
I was not mad at you
I was not trying to tear you down
The words that I could've used
I was too scared to say out loud
If I cannot break your fall
I'll pick you up right off the ground
If you felt invisible
I won't let you feel that now

You didn't get your way
And it's an empty feeling
You've got a lot to say
And you just want to know you're being heard

And in spite of all I should've done
I was not mad at you
I was not trying to tear you down
The words that I could've used
I was too scared to say out loud
If I cannot break your fall
I'll pick you up right off the ground
If you felt invisible
I won't let you feel that now
(Invisible)
This is not black and white
There are no clear solutions

When you were waiting on the edge of the unknown
Do you feel cold and lost in desperation?
Remember all the sadness and frustration
And in a burst of light that blinded every angel
As if the sky had blown the heavens into stars
You felt the gravity of tempered grace falling into empty space
No one there to catch you in their arms
Do you feel cold and lost in desperation?
Remember all the sadness and frustration
Do you feel cold and lost in desperation?
Remember all the sadness and frustration
And let it go
Let it go
Let it go
Let it go

After my dreaming  I woke with this fear
What am I leaving when I'm done here?
When my time comes  forget the wrong that I've done
Help me leave behind some reasons to be missed
And don't resent me  and when you're feeling empty
Keep me in your memory  leave out all the rest
Leave out all the rest
Don't be afraid
I've taken my beating  I've shared what I made
I'm strong on the surface  not all the way through
I've never been perfect  but neither have you
When my time comes  forget the wrong that I've done
Help me leave behind some reasons to be missed
Don't resent me  and when you're feeling empty

Pretending someone else can come and save me from myself
I can't be who you are
A hole that wasn't there before
And I keep reaching for the light
But I can't find it anymore
There's an emptiness tonight
A heavy hand that pulls me down
They say it's gonna be alright
But can't begin to tell me how
And I ask myself out loud...
Have I been lost all along?
Was I lost all along?
Was I looking for an answer when there never really was one?

The way there was when you were here
'Cause I'm just sitting in the dark

You were that foundation
Never gonna be another one  no
I followed  so taken
So conditioned  I could never let go
Then sorrow  then sickness
Then the shock when you flip it on me
So hollow  so vicious
So afraid  I couldn't let myself see
(Oh-oh-oh) That I could never be held
Forget the rest  let them know my Hell
(Oh-oh-oh) There and back  yet my soul ain't sell
Let the rest be the tale they tell
That I was there  sayin'
In these promises broken  deep below
Each word gets lost in the echo
So one last lie I can see through

And I've come back  unshaken
Let down and lived and let go

I don't hold back  I hold my own
I can't be mapped  I can't be cloned
I can't C-flat  it ain't my tone

Hold myself up and love my scars
Let the bells ring wherever they are
'Cause I was there  sayin'

So one last lie I can see through
This time  I finally let you go!
(Go  go)

No  you can tell 'em all now
I don't back up  I don't back down
I don't fold up and I don't bow
I don't roll over  don't know how
I don't care where the enemies are
Won't forget how I got this far
For every time  sayin'
In these promises broken  deep below
Each word gets lost in the echo
So one last lie I can see through
Something I can not repair
Even though it will always be
I pretend it isn't there (This is how I feel)
I'm trapped in yesterday (Just a memory)
Where the pain is all I know (This is all I know)
And I'll never break away (Can't break free)
'Cause when I'm alone
I'm lost in these memories
Living behind my own illusion
Lost all my dignity
Living inside my own confusion
Of the damage I've received
Broken promises they made
And how blindly I believed (This is all I know)
I will never break away (Can't break free)

I remembered each flash
As time began to blur
Like a startling sign
That fate had finally found me
And your voice was all I heard
That I get what I deserve
So give me reason to prove me wrong
To wash this memory clean
Let the floods cross the distance in your eyes
Give me reason to fill this hole
Connect the space between

Across this new divide

But memories left abandoned
There was nowhere to hide

I'm hanging off the edge
Storm clouds gather beneath me
Waves break above my head
Headfirst hallucination
I wanna fall wide awake now
You tell me it's alright
Tell me I'm forgiven tonight
But nobody can save me now
I'm holding up a light
Chasing out the darkness inside

For answers yet to come
I chose a false solution

We saw brilliance when the world was asleep
There are things that we can have but can't keep

Something in here's not right today
Why am I so uptight today?
Paranoia's all I got left
I don't know what stressed me first
Or how the pressure was fed
But I know just what it feels like
To have a voice in the back of my head
Like a face that I hold inside
A face that awakes when I close my eyes
A face that watches every time I lie
A face that laughs every time I fall
(And watches everything)
So I know that when it's time to sink or swim
That the face inside is here in me
Right underneath my skin
It's like a whirlwind inside of my head

You're growing desperate from the fight
Remember you're loved and you always will be
This melody will bring you right back home

I can't wait to see tomorrow
I can't wait to see tomorrow"
