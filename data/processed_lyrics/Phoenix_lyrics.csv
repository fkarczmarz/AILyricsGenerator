lyrics
" now the future's sorted out
 your girlfriend is drifting away
Many years ago
Would you allow? Could you allow?
That's what they're like
Uh  did you look? Did you look?
Heavenly  heavenly sort of sounds adolescent
Well  I told you not  not to look from the start
When the sun is almost gone  it's way too much
Enough said  enough sense  it's unconventional
When the sun is almost gone  it's not enough
Ooh  that's what we're like in broad daylight
Ooh  soon  you'll realize it's after midnight
My memoriеs  souvenirs  some originals
High up in the rows
Idolizеd  canonized
That morning rise
I told you not  I told you not
No veneer behind the mirror  did you call from a distance?
Well  I told you not  not to look from this side
When the sun is almost gone  it's way too much
You might also like
Enough said  enough sense  it's unconventional
When the sun is almost gone  it's not enough
Ooh  that's what we're like in broad daylight
Ooh  soon  you'll realize it's after midnight
Listen  it's illicit
Listen  listen  it's illicit
Listen  listen  it's illicit
Listen  listen  listen
Listen  it's illicit
Listen  listen  it's illicit
Listen  listen  it's illicit
Listen  listen  listen
Ooh  that's what we're like in broad daylight
How about you fellas play something
That nobody knows
Oh if you find for some sad reason
You're alone this christmas season
And the joys of home grow dimmer
Just like a memory's distant glimmer
When your love and you are parted
And all christmas cheer departed
It's sad I say
When you're away
From love on christmas day
Why the sadness? (gotta move on)
When there should be gladness? (keep moving on)
All you can do is keep moving on
Time is mending (you've gotta move on)
Pain soon has its ending (keep moving on)
I know in your heart  it soon will be gone
Whether cruising the lonely highway
Or jetting miles high through some skyway
When you've reached your destination
Awaiting baggage at the station
When you see some happy greeters
It can make your bitter sweeter
But still for real  it's sad to feel
Alone on Christmas Day

Pain soon has its ending (keep moving on)
Know in your heart it soon will be gone
And you guys can cook too
 some other day
 singin' hallelujah
 cover your lies
 singin' hallelujah
 cover your eyes
 the only reason I'm allowed
 ouais
 singin' hallelujah
 cover your lies
 singin' hallelujah
 cover your eyes
 décapitée
 I wouldn't try another second
 a hologram waiting for the tiebreak
 singin' hallelujah
 cover your lies
 singin' hallelujah
 cover your eyes
A promise to get well
That ain't workin'  thinkin' that you're no good
Don't worry  'cause I'm not the kind to kiss and tell
No dahlias and cherry trees
I don't recall them anyway
Some lovers know it ain't gonna wear out
To each his own the same  look what you wasted
When the lights are cutting out
And I come down in your room
Our daily compromise
It is written in your signed armistice
And when the lights are cutting out
And I come down in your room
Well  we'll decide as always
Here is your signed armistice
It's time to follow and not to heat it up
Requesting this plane is a propeller
In the middle of the course when ambitions are low
Head on close  hang on before you lose control
The octagon logo  had to rip it up
The semaphore message on your lips
Some lovers know it ain't gonna wear out
To each his own the same  one of us is wasted

For lovers in a rush  for lovers always
Foreign lovers in a rush  keeping promises
For lovers in a rush  for lovers always
For lovers in a rush  for lovers always
Foreign lovers in a rush  keeping promises
Did you  did you know
Every color turned blue?
How to find the shore in a waterfall?
Oh  that rumor sounds true
Yeah  I hear it too
I'm looking for an artifact
A piece of me that's still intact  yeah
I'm looking for an artifact
What part of me can still attract you?
Before you were born
Before we were one
Before you were loose
And when on your own
I considered it home
Believed it was you
I'd leave it alone
I deleted it all
Bеcause it was true
And when you gеt upset
I can't afford it
I won't deny it
Over Nova Scotia
I'm no Rubirosa
This story comes and
And when you get upset
I kinda like it
Don't leave me skull and bones
And with your boyfriends
I can't escape them
This story comes and goes

 self-entitled portrait
It started years ago
When you're less than kind of done
An adolescent singing out real loud
Some wild English tune
La-la-la-la  la-la-la-la
We'll never talk it out this time
You'll learn from all of us
When your time's up
How it all began
Seriously dumb
When you're less than kind of certain
An adolescent calling out real loud
It's what singers do
La-la-la-la  la-la-la-la
We'll never talk it out this time
You'll learn from all of us
When your time's up
You bet your life on a cruise ship  bartending crucial lies

You lost your mind on a cruise ship  bartending crucial lies

They don't mind it if you're told where I'm from
Anyone I find intrusive
You will bother if you choose me
I don't always think of you
I would rather stand if you stay
Why would I lie to you?
Cruel
Any way you want the truth is
I will marry you on Tuesdays
I don't always tell the truth
I don't like it if you miss me

When my God-given little became a lot older

Don't you want to stop complaining?
No one knows where you're heading to
No consolation prizes
Spit out your lies and chewing gum
I thought about this for a long time

And there is no other option on the schedule

We're sick for the big sun
It doesn't matter what you did
And if you did it like you been told
True and everlasting  that's what you want
True  true and everlasting  that's what you want
Don't say no  your breakfast eaten alone
Resist or let go  you're borderline withdrawn
Down  unlit from the bottom  there is a misfit
Better than it looks  better than it looks
Better than it looks  better than it looks
We're sick for the big sun
I realize that too
Hear the lonesome bell  is this knowledge?
Ask forgiveness you know somewhere
You're fixed to an atom
It doesn't matter what you did

Better than it looks  better than it looks
Better than it looks  better than it looks
We're sick for the big sun
I realize that too
True  true and everlasting  it didn't last that long
We're the lonesome  we're the lonesome yell
True and everlasting  it didn't last that long

We're the lonesome  we're the lonesome yell
True and everlasting  it didn't last that long
 don't let them run in circles
 run away
 you're livid
 you're sad and underweight
 we're so close to serious
 we're too close to serious
 I'm foreign and under stress
 we're too close to serious
Cheap fixtures  religious tales
Light a cigarette for two  you're too close to get to
How come everyone knows you before they meet you?
In the jangle jungle
A better standard than mediocre
I watch you tumble  oh-oh-oh-oh
Jangle jungle
Jingle  jump before you stumble
I'm just too glad to say no
Scandinavian leather  Drakkar Noir
Fake riches  oblivious tales
On a domestic airline
Swear to God that you're mine
In the jangle jungle
A better standard than mediocre
I watch you tumble  oh-oh-oh-oh
Jangle jungle
Jingle  jump before you stumble

I'm just too glad to say no
 why you keep pretending that you wanna let go?
 do you wanna let go?
And not for better
Don't know what it means to me
Got to get you home
Could be with anyone
I think of what I've done
You know it all
Everything is everything
The more I talk about it
The less I do control
Everything means everything
Can't understand a word
Half of the stuff I'm saying

Sometimes they own me too
What are they going to do to me
What I can't explain

Could do so much wrong
But we'll take it don't worry
And I know it already
Sleeping all alone
I been craving too long
Let's rip it all to confetti
A little bit of disrespect could be
Another way to break the ordinary
It's all a blur as far as I can see
No more begging already
Would you allow me to stay?
On
We're meant to get it on
We're meant to get it on

Many have laughed to summon you
So many ways  trying to show them gratitude
Better butcher their lies  till you hear them too
Soon you'll learn where to find me  how to look
Unexposed and no residue
So figure it fast  are you hope or vanity?
Now d'you think you're ready to say no no no?
Terrorizing your neighbor
I'm a Siberian tiger
I'll always be an outsider
Don't neglect me Fleur de Lys
No rest till I get to you  no rest till I get to you
No!
No rest till I get to you  no rest till I get to you
No!
No rest till I get to you  no rest till I get to you

So figure it fast  is it hope or gravity?

Je t'ai laissé un message
Est-ce que tu l'as reçu?
J'ai vraiment besoin qu'on se parle

 not much to lose
 so hard to lose
 yeah
 let's get all antsy
 a whole lot received
Deciders for the lonely  whispering tears
You try out for nothing then you drop dead
Not a miracle in years  leisure for the lonely
Whispering unnecess–ess–essary unless–ess–ess you're in
Die and succeed
I say it out loud  but you just don't care
'Til you know me well
'Til you know me well
Girlfriend
We are far from home  I am with you now
I am longing you  I am longing us two
Who bought a miracle sells these fortune tears
December's death or glory  how you want it?
No  not a miracle in years  deciders for the lonely
Die and succeed
I say it out loud but you just don't care
'Til you know me well
'Til you know me well
Girlfriend
Die and succeed
I say it out loud but she just don't care
To drag you home would do
Or park at the motel
Outside of the Pantheon
Champagne and Châteldon
Our little ritual
It's not the pity that you got
Leave the party for the lot
Or find out your motive
I could do this all day long
But just a minute it's all I want
Dis-moi pourquoi comment je t'aime
Turquoise and navy blue
Polynesian or bayou
Why follow your trail?
Down from the podium
Valentine's and Te Deum
A different bible
It's not the pity that you got
Or go back to cursive
Why cherish the things you don't?
Just a second it's all I want

I go to Hollywood
I buy my ticket
To see the midnight show
And every Sunday
I live my honeymoon
You rule my body
I just feel that it's good
Yet my mind aches
You bust my real thoughts
When you're with me
Till the night's away
I am sitting
I watch the fireworks
It's no matter of time
I feel the midnight crush
Feeling without knowing the other
Let me handle this affair
Every Sunday
I go to Hollywood
It's worth waiting
To see the midnight show
And every Sunday
I live my honeymoon
You rule my body
I just feel that it's good
You might also likeThere's no ending
Light fades in my eyes
I don't want nobody
To burn my Hollywood
Feeling without knowing the other
I’ve grown like that too
If I don't dislike you
I don't just know you
Un-forget
Un-washed away
Can't forgive
What you were
No God forbid
To persuade
All your sins
Are counterfeit
You might also likeI follow my own mistrial
I heard the echo this time
So why not discuss this headline?
Now we're sitting on the same side of this aisle
Reflections on the protocol and reciprocity
Gazing ’round the corner of the university
Tell me you're trying
Trying to regret
Playing all night those video tapes
Scaffoldings
Cover the mess up
Look how high they go
I’m keeping up to code
It's piled-up rims
And polyester
We're losing every vote
One more thrill
Tucked away
Hold on still
To celebrate
Wonder will and chop suey
Hold your arms and wait
Don't talk to say
If only righteous helped me find out the right one
We always wanna do it better than last time
We're going through the zeitgeist till midnight
When we go back from shooting satellites to red lights
In every other corner of the universe we're in
I’ll follow your advices and ignore the marketing
Tell me how to focus on the things that I'm missing
Tell me you're trying
Trying to regret
Playing all night those video tapes
I'm right beside you
Unfold that I know you
I'm told that it's my fault
I'd rather fall and lose control again
I’m losing my friend
I’m losing my grip
Praying all night to radio waves
Feels like I've been buried yet I'm still alive
It's like a bad day that never ends
I feel the chaos around me
A thing I don't try to deny
I'd better learn to accept that
There are things in my life that I can't control
They say love ain't nothing but a sore
I don't even know what love is
Too many tears have had to fall
Don't you know I'm so tired of it all
I have known terror dizzy spells
Finding out the secrets words won't tell
Whatever it is it can't be named
There's a part of my world that's fading away
You know I don't want to be clever
To be brilliant or superior
Now I know that a breeze can blow me away
Now I know there's much more dignity
In defeat than in the brightest victory
I'm losing my balance on the tight rope
You might also like
If I ever feel better
Remind me to spend some good time with you
You can give me your number
When it's all over I'll let you know
Hang on to the good days
I can lean on my friends
They help me going through hard times
But I'm feeding the enemy
I'm in league with the foe
Blame me for what's happening
No one knows the hard times I went through
If happiness came I miss the call
The stormy days ain't over
I've tried and lost now I think that I pay the cost
Now I've watched all my castles fall
Someday all this mess will make me laugh
If I ever feel better
Remind me to spend some good time with you
You can give me your number
When it's all over I'll let you know
If I ever feel better
Remind me to spend some good time with you
You can give me your number
When it's all over I'll let you know
It's like somebody took my place
I ain't even playing my own game
The rules have changed well I didn't know
There are things in my life I can't control
I feel the chaos around me
A thing I don't try to deny
I'd better learn to accept that
There's a part of my life that will go away
In the circular solitude of my heart
As one who strives a hill to climb
I am sure I'll come through I don't know how
They say an end can be a start
Feels like I've been buried yet I'm still alive
I'm losing my balance on the tight rope
If I ever feel better
Remind me to spend some good time with you
You can give me your number
When it's all over I'll let you know
If I ever feel better
Remind me to spend some good time with you
You can give me your number
When it's all over I'll let you know
If I ever feel better
Remind me to spend some good time with you
You can give me your number
There is no thing that makes want to settle down
I thought it was a bad cough
But never knew how much illusions hide a torture
Lonesome and forsaken with no gratitude
It's me against a wardrobe
Focused on the pain to see how we can get along
I'll move on
Together
The more I try the less I care about it
Together
Together
The more I try the less I care about it
I'm giving up my conscience for another
The only one I want is you
Things I wouldn't do
I'll lose you for another
Cause you can't believe how much your pleasure is a factor
Writing down the logic of my solitude
As far as I'm concerned I'd like to leave it random
I'm acting like an orphan
Let me get to know you better to make me less attracted

Parisians all gone
I'm giving up my conscience for another
Something in the middle of the side of the store
Got your attention when I asked for more
I was excited to be part of your world
Something I was stealing for no reason at all
They hang me higher than a disco ball
Something 'bout the jewels you wear
And at the masquerade ball
Suddenly you're out of the woods
Just because of you
These things I have to go through
Is it so bad?
Is it so true?
Is it still you?
Just because of you
These things I have to go through
It's more than I'll change
There's no else to blame for us two
You might also like
Something that don't matter till they matter to you
They stole that money from a homeless girl
We started at the end of the line
When you talked me into letting you go
No more coral on the atoll
Something about how hard you learned
Kamikaze in a hopeless world
Do you remember the last time you laughed and then laughed and you lived to the laugh?
Turn me on the lonely on the side of the world
With a couple of guys and no alphabet
Put two and two together
We'll make it last forever
Just because of you
These things I have to go through
Is it so bad?
Is it so true?
Is it still you?
Just because of you
These things I have to go through
It's more than I'll change
There's no else to blame for us two
Just because of you
These things I have to go through
Is it so bad?
Is it so true?
Is it still you?
Just because of you
These things I have to go through
It's more than I'll change
 I’ve been thinking out loud
 long time
 sorry but your so-called life
 you don't realize
 too
 where would you go
 could you run into
 where would you go
 could you run into
 don't do it
 you should do to me
 you're not so well
 where would you go
 could you run into
 where would you go
 could you run into
 you don't realize
 too
 long time
 long time
 no
 not disgusting yet
 I'm down and lonely
 discouraged
 I gotta be someone else
 it comes and goes
 discourage
 discouraged
 we can barely discuss
 it comes and goes
 but see it grow
€26.10 was the price to pay
A messed up kid with no ideals at all
I remember this young guy died and I took his part
He got far too many stitches on his pretty face
And your capital letters keep me asking for more
And your capital letters keep me asking for more
Where to go? I had no idea about it
Something always told me us two would be serious

And your capital letters keep me asking for more

Loud enough to hold on
I think about the time we wasted
I think about the years to come
It's getting late and I can't call
It's getting late to face it all
I think about the time we wasted
My loneliness has slowly grown
I told you not to cross the line
And leave me with your love for granted
The letters from your broken heart
I think I might have lost them somewhere
Don't tell me 'bout your lies
Don't tell me 'bout your secrets
My love is easy
You are everything I need
Now your love is gone
I want it safe & guaranteed
Life is such a fine line
Looking at the bright line
I think about the time we wasted
For someday I'll be coming too
Tonight is dying on its own
You might also like
And now I got your love for granted
As long as you are hiding somewhere
Don't tell me 'bout your lies
Don't tell me 'bout your secrets
Even though we've said it all
I would never let us fall with you
If it is for better
Even though we've said it all
I would never let us fall with you
If it is for better
A visible horizon
Right where it starts and ends
Acres
A visible illusion
Withdrawn  I never meant to leave you alone
Many relentless promises
And if I realize that I want you to know
I'm turning into partying alone
Kisses
I love you anyway
I never thought you'd get me in line
Forget and forgotten young protégé
So let me control  regret that I broke our thing
Now somebody took my apology
I love you anyway
Would you love her lovelife?
Would you love her lovelife?
Would you love her lovelife?
Oblique city credentials
It's everything that I've ever known
Coca-Cola's Rosetta Stone
Not the logic of the momentum
It's way more than tragic
I never knew what to do
To show you better than lonely
Am I gonna do this alone?
They're fifty-thousand versus one
Am I gonna do it all?
Am I gonna do this alone?
Or will you join me versus wrong?
She's everything that I've ever won
Not the logic of the momentum

Slow down your tan  I'm going to miss you a lot
There goes your tears again  this is no fun
There goes your tears again as you walk away
Then it's hard to tell what kind  they do look alike
Oh  no  that ain't what I said
Oh  no  that ain't what I said
Always trying to fall asleep to make my way out
Looking at the ceiling  I'm counting the days
There goes your man is down to the bottom
There goes your man is willing to cooperate
Then it's hard to tell you kindly that ain't what I'm like
Ooh  guess I'd better find us a way out

It's a long way to look alike

Single in his bed someday
Focus looking forward the Colosseum
Oh no! What did I say? What can I say?

At the end of the street
I knew a time was gone
And it took me like ages
Just to understand
That I was afraid to be a simple guy
I tried my best to smile
But deep inside my heart
I felt it would shout like a crowd dancing
I guess I couldn't live without the things
That made my life what it is
Tonight everything is over
I feel too young
I can't lie on my bed
Without thinking I was wrong
But when this feeling calls
This world becomes another
Nighttime won't hold me in your arms again
I got a very good friend who says
He can't believe the love I give
Is not enough to end your fears

Under the malicious
Winter solstice
Turn the lights on
Find me a narrative
Something positive
This requiem played a few times before
I heard it once
So I'm not sure
Why open your eyes to go to bed?
Drive straight to the ocean
And see what we won't find out
Even the righteous beheaded their loved ones
Now it's hard to connect
But the world's unchained
And soon
It'll be public domain
It's too hard to remain
Astute
But I will stay
If you're detained
With you
I'll wash my hands
Until It rains

So give me a ride home
Find me a narrative
Something positive
This requiem played a few times before
I heard it twice
So I'm not sure
On the phone I told you
Why open your eyes to go to bed?
Drive straight to the ocean
Let's see what you won't find out
Cover your eyes for Winter Solstice

And soon
It'll be public domain
It's too hard to remain
Astute
But I will stay
If you're detained
