lyrics
"'Cause I'm broken-hearted way too soon
I let my guard down
Romeo still lives in my head
Thought I would settle down
Too many times I wish I'd never cared
Too many nights crying that it's not fair
If I get hurt again
I'd need a lifetime to repair
I'd need a lifetime to repair
I'd need a lifetime to repair
They told me stories and they got me good
Who's sayin' fairytales aren't true?
If he saves me from the dragon
I'd overlook the stupid things he does
Straight up forgive him when he's wrong
When he's fallen off the wagon

Too many times I wish I'd never cared
Too many nights crying that it's not fair
If I get hurt again
I'd need a lifetime to repair
I'd need a lifetime to repair
I'd need a lifetime to repair
They say that love is everywhere
But it's a game of truth or dare
Gimme that guarantee and I'll be there
Heaven knows I tried my best
Now I'm swimming in a sea of loneliness
Wanna take that chance
I wanna say yeah
But too many times I wish I'd never cared
Too many nights crying that it's not fair
If I get hurt again
I'd need a lifetime to repair
I'd need a lifetime to repair
I'm standing here with you  why won't you move?
It hurts when you get too close but  baby  it hurts
If love is really good  you just want more
All the lovers that have gone before
They don't compare to you
Don't be frightened  just give me a little bit more
They don't compare  all the lovers
Feel  can't you see there's so much here to feel?
Deep inside your heart  you know I'm real
You'll be next to me  it's all you need
All the lovers that have gone before
They don't compare to you
Don't be frightened  just give me a little bit more
They don't compare  all the lovers

Dance  it's all I wanna do  so won't you dance?
I'm standing here with you  why won't you move?
All the lovers that have gone before
They don't compare to you
Don't be frightened  just give me a little bit more
 I need to taste it all
 thinking about it all
 thinking about it all
 this void
 thinking about it all

I opened up too quick and all my dreams
I had no sensation
I thought no one could ever get me high again
I thought the real thing was a fake
I thought it was a tool to break me down
You proved me wrong again
If love were liquid it would drown me
In a placeless place would find me
In a heart shape come around me
And then melt me slowly down
Hold me and control me
And then melt me slowly down
Like chocolate

Tastes so good

You proved me wrong again
If love were liquid it would drown me
In a placeless place would find me
In a heart shape come around me
And then melt me slowly down
If love were human it would know me
In a lost space come and show me
Hold me and control me
And then melt me slowly down
Like chocolate
If love were liquid it would drown me
In a placeless place would find me
In a heart shape come around me
And then melt me slowly down
If love were human it would know me
In a lost space come and show me (Show me)
Hold me and control me
And then melt me slowly down
There's no doubt it's from you
And I'm addicted to it now
Just one heart here to save me now
Just one heart here to save me now
Just one heart here to save me now
Just one heart here to save me now
If love were liquid it would drown me
In a placeless place would find me
In a heart shape come around me

Hold me and control me

If love were human it would know me
In a lost space come and show me
Hold me and control me

Won't you lift me up  up  high upon your love?
Take these arms that were made for loving
And this heart that will beat for two
Take these eyes that were meant for watching over you
And I've been such a long time waiting
For someone I can call my own
I've been chasing the life I'm dreaming
Now I'm home (I'm home)
I need your love
Like night needs morning
So won't you come  come  come into my world?
Na-na-na  na-na-na  na-na-na
Take these lips that were made for kissing
And this heart that will see you through
And these hands that were made to touch and feel you

I view from afar
Should I offer some assistance?
Should it matter who you are?
We all get hurt by love
And we all have our cross to bear
But in the name of understanding now
Their problems should be shared
Confide in me
Confide in me
I can keep a secret
And throw away the key
But sometimes to release it
Is to set our children free
We all get hurt by love
And we all have our cross to bear
But in the name of understanding now
Their problems should be shared

Hopeful hearts of the human race

We're golden
Burn like the stars
Stay golden

Although you know my name
I don't believe the faults I have
Are only mine to blame
I don't believe that magic
Is only in the mind
I don't believe I'd love somebody
Just to pass the time
But I believe in you
And I believe in you
I don't believe that beauty
Will ever be replaced
I don't believe a masterpiece
Could ever match your face
The joker's always smiling
In every hand that's dealt
I don't believe that when you die
Your presence isn't felt
But I believe in you (I believe in you)
And I believe in you (I believe in you)

I love it  I love it  I love it
I love it  I love it  I love it
I love it  I love it  I love it
Waitin' for your love was enough to go break my heart
Ooh  not bein' close to you  it made my world fall apart
I was like a lonely star at night
Waitin' for someone to share the light
Love like this  no one can take
Away  away  away
Your love is my love
And my love is all you need
So come on  let the music play
We gon' take it all the way
We'll dancе through the darkness
Togethеr eternally

Can't get enough of this  can't get enough of this
There is no complication
I dream about you all the time
The sweetest of sensation
Thinking you could be mine
In my imagination
There is no hesitation
We walk together hand in hand
I'm dreaming
You fell in love with me
Like I'm in love with you
But dreaming's all I do
If only they'd come true
I should be so lucky
I should be so lucky in love

I'm dreaming
That you're in love with me

Then I looked into the sky
And knew the bad news won't prevent the sun to shine
I was gonna cancel
Then took a sec to realize
All the disappointment that would trail behind
I was gonna cancel
Then you reminded me of who I am
Everything is clearer than a mirror is to woman
Just the same as a dog is to man
Go ahead face the day
Who cares what you know
Don't let that in the way no way
Just get up and go
What's on the other side? (Yeah)
You will never know unless you

I was gonna cancel
Then I thought about the strength that
I got from all of the prayers and what it meant
I was gonna cancel
Then I realized that time is just like money and love
Watch how you spend
I was gonna cancel
Until you reminded me of what I do
Now I see it clearer
My best friend is the mirror look behind me
And I see all the things I've been through
Go ahead face the day
Who cares what you know
Don't let that in the way no way
Just get up and go
What's on the other side? (Yeah)
You will never know unless you
What's wrong with saying I love you?
It's nothing to kid about
Some people going through a struggle
Trying to scribble it out
They say attention is a shovel
It's time to dig 'em out
You can't just let them stay in a bubble
They'll pop to get it out
Go ahead face the day
Who cares what you know
Don't let that in the way no way
Just get up and go
What's on the other side? (Yeah)
You will never know unless you
I've only ever dreamt of this
Oh
DJ's spinning up my favorite song
Hurry up and get a groove on
Don't let the moment slip away
'Cause you and I could find a pleasure
No one else has ever known
Feels like it is now or never
Don't wanna be alone
How does it feel in my arms?
How does it feel in my arms?
Do you want it? Do you need it?
Can you feel it? Tell me
How does it feel in my arms?
Got a feeling this is something strong
All I want to do is move on
No more wondering where I belong
So never go away

I paved the road that would one day leave me lonely
No angel's too good to fall from grace
If she lets go of whatever keeps her holy
But I'm still here holding on so tight
To everything that I left behind
I don't care if the world is mine
'Cause this is all I know
When I got my back up against the wall
Don't need no one to rescue me
'Cause I ain't waiting up for no miracle
Into the blue
Into the blue
With nothing to lose
Into the blue
I'm not ashamed of all my mistakes
'Cause through the cold I still kept the fire burning
These memories that I can't erase
Always remind me I'm on an endless journey

I didn't get all dressed up for nothin' (Nothin')
Wanna chance another dance before morning
When the party's over tonight?
Oh-oh-oh
Tell me where you go  oh
Oh-oh-oh
I just gotta know (Know  know)
When the party's over tonight?
When the party's over tonight?
I didn't get all dressed up for nothin' (Nothin')
Wanna chance another dance before morning
Your disco needs you
Your disco  your disco
Your disco needs you
Desperately seeking someone willing to travel
You're lost in conversation and useless at Scrabble
Happiness will never last
Darkness comes to kick your ass (Ass)
So let's dance through all of this
War is over for a bit
The whole world should be moving  do your part
Cure a lonely heart
Your disco  your disco
Your disco needs you
Your disco  your disco
Your disco needs you
We're sold on vanity  but that's so see through (See through)
Take your body to the floor  your disco needs you
From Soho to Singapore
From the mainland to the shore
You might also like
So let's dance through all of this
War is over for a bit
You're a slave to the rhythm  do your part
Cure a lonely heart
Vous êtes jamais seuls
Vous savez ce qu'il faut faire
Ne laissez pas tomber votre nation
La disco a besoin de vous
So let's dance through all of this
War is over for a bit
The whole world should be moving  do your part
Cure a lonely heart
Your disco  your disco
Your disco needs you
Your disco  your disco
Your disco needs you
Your disco  your disco
Your disco needs you
Your disco  your disco"
