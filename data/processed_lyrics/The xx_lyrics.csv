lyrics
"No one stays
I've got so cautious
And now I choke on every move I make
Let one play
To be that careless
With every kiss from a friend
With everything I pretend not to feel
Am I too high? Am I too proud?
Is the music too loud… for me to hear?
Now I go out
But every beat is a violent noise
Try as I might
With every beat comes a violent noise
The melody's sung
And I don't know the voice
Now I go out
But every beat is a violent noise
You've been staying out late
Trying your best to escape
I hope you find what you're looking for
Let a moment take place
Without running away
I hope you silence the noise
You might also like
How could eyes this wide
Lose sight of a world outside?
With every kiss from a friend
With everything I pretend not to feel
Am I too high? Am I too proud?
Is the music too loud… for me to hear?
Now I go out
But every beat is a violent noise
Try as I might
With every beat comes a violent noise
The melody's sung
And I don't know the voice
Now I go out
It is more than I thought could exist
You move through the room
Like breathing was easy
If someone believed me
They would be
As in love with you as I am
They would be
As in love with you as I am
They would be
As in love with you as I am
They would be
And everyday
I am learning about you
The things that no one else sees
And the end comes too soon
Like dreaming of angels
And leaving without them
And leaving without them

Being
As in love with you as I am

A silent devotion

But I think I'm ready
As long as you're with me
Being
As in love with you as I am

As in love with you as I am

It is more than I thought could exist
You move through the room

If someone believed me
They would be as in love with you as I am
They would be as in love with you as I am
They would be as in love with you as I am
And every day
I am learning about you
The things that no one else sees
And the end comes too soon
Like dreaming of angels
And leaving without them
And leaving without them

Being as in love with you as I am
Easy to take  you could take me in fours
Make me a deal  a day a piece
Take it all  just stay a week
I'll take you in pieces  we can take it all apart
I've suffered shipwrecks right from the start
I've been underwater  breathing out and in
I think I'm losing where you end and I begin
Basic space  open air
Don't look away  when there's nothing there
I'm setting us in stone
Piece by piece  before I'm alone
Air tight  before we break
Keep it in  keep us safe
It's a pool of boiling wax  I'm getting in
Let it set  got to seal this in
Can't adjust  can't relearn
Got to keep what I have  preserve

Hot wax has left me with a shine
Wouldn't know if I'd been left behind
Second skin  second skin
I can't let it out  I still let you in
I'll make your eyes turn yellow
Make your skin turn blue
Picture me under blood red moon
I'll make your eyes turn yellow
Make your skin turn blue
That it's hard to see
That you're all I see
Picture me under blood red moon
I'll make your eyes turn yellow

Telling me to be brave

Brave for you
Do the things that I'm afraid to do

Only for long enough

Say
Separate or combine?
I ask you one last time
Did I hold you too tight?
Did I not let enough light in?

I won't let you slip away

Winged or chained?
Did I hold you too tight?

Ooh
Ooh
Ooh
To have me crystalised
And you've got the faith
That I could bring paradise
I'll forgive and forget
Before I'm paralysed
Do I have to keep up the pace
To keep you satisfied?
Things have gotten closer to the sun
And I've done things in small doses
So don't think that I'm pushing you away
When you're the one that I've kept closest
You don't move slow
Taking steps in my direction
Does it lessen your affection? No

You say I'm foolish
For pushing this aside
But burn down our home
I won't leave alive
Glaciers have melted to the sea
I wish the tide would take me over
I've been down on my knees
And you just keep on getting closer
Glaciers have melted to the sea
(Things have gotten closer to the sun)
I wish the tide would take me over
(And I've done things in small doses)
I've been down onto my knees
(So don't think that I'm pushing you away)
And you just keep on getting closer
(When you're the one that I've kept closest)
Go slow
Go slow
Go slow
Go slow
Go slow
But I disagree
But you've had faith in me
So I won't shy away
Should it all fall down
You'll have been my favourite mistake
They say
I'm going to pretend that I'm not scared
If this only ends in tears
Then I won't say goodbye
'Cause I couldn't care less
If they call us reckless
Until they are breathless
They must be blind
There are voices ringing over
I can't make them take you under
Makes no difference
No one can take this away

Let them say there are warning signs
They must be blind

They say
If this only ends in tears
I need to know
Where do you wanna go
Cause if you're down
I'll take it slow
Make you lose control
To spend the night
The whole night?
And Maybe
If you play it right
You can be all mine
Do you mind
If I take you home tonight?
Stay another day
If that's okay
Tell me baby
Would you mind
If I take you home with me
Where no one can see
So don't be shy
The whole night (2x)
Baby
I like your style
So let's get it on
When we touch
I can't get enough
Falling for you
Honey
Would you like to make love tonight
The whole night?
And maybe if you play it right
You can be all mine
Do you mind if I take you home tonight?
Stay another day
If that's okay
Tell me baby
Would you mind if I take you home with me
Where no one can see
So don't be shy
 June?
 see you June
 something of my own creation
 with only daylight between us
 something of my own creation
 why do I refuse you?
 I risk to lose you
 something of my own creation
 how am I to tell?
 still I wake up alone
'Cause I could give so much more
Make you feel like never before
It's been a while and you've found someone better
But I've been waiting too long to give this up
And I was struggling to get in
Left waiting outside your door
I was sure
You'd give me more

I know you've been waitin' you've been waitin' a long time for me
But if you wait a little while longer this is how it'll be
Oh it's gonna be  hot like fire
I'm gonna take you higher
You can't resist
You shouldn't have said take our time
I'll let you know when I'm ready if that's alright
But if you wait on me  I promise you it won't be long
Oh it's gonna be  hot like fire
I'm gonna take you higher
You can't resist
Intoxicated
I'm in rapture
From the inside I can feel that you want to
Wake up high on it
Feel it suspending
I'm enamoured
Way up in the sky I can see that you want to
I've been a romantic for so long
All I've ever heard are love songs
Singing oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh
I dare you
I get chills
Heart's rate multiplies
I'm on a different kind of high
A rush of blood is not enough
I need my feelings set on fire
Strong attraction

After you
Had you seen me with someone new
Hanging so high for your return
But the stillness is a burn
Had I seen it in your eyes
There'd have been no try after try
Your leaving had no goodbye
Had I just seen one in your eyes
I can't give it up
To someone else's touch
Because I care too much
I can't give it up
To someone else's touch
Because I care too much
Care too much
Care too much
Could you tell
I was left lost and lonely
Could you tell
Things ain't worked out my way
Wish the best for you
Wish the best for me
Wished for infinity
If that ain't me
Then give it up

Those eyes were sharp like sharpest knife

Lost in your web
Caught in your trap
What I have is right here
Spend my nights and days before
Searching the world for what's right here
Underneath and unexplored
Islands and cities I have looked
Here I saw
Something I couldn't overlook
I am yours now
So now I don't ever have to leave
I've been found now
So now I'll never explore
See what I've done
That bridge is on fire
Back to where I've been
I'm froze by desire
No need to leave
Where would I be
If this were to go under?
That's a risk I'd take
I'm froze by desire
As if a choice I'd make

That's the wrong thing to
That's the wrong thing to do
That's the wrong thing
That's the wrong thing to
That's the wrong thing to do
I turned a blind eye
Let the borders get wavy
Nothing touches me lately
Shouldn't I be having fun?
That's the wrong thing to
That's the wrong thing to do
It's hard to define
When my memory's hazy
Everyone's trying to save me

Can I confess these things
To you
Well I don't know
And it
Hurts to hold
I couldn't spill my heart
My eyes gleam looking in from the dark
I walk out in stormy weather
Steady walking but bound to trip
Should release but just tighten my grip
Night time
Sympathize
I've been working on
White lies
So I'll tell the truth
I'll give it up to you
And when the day comes
It will have all been fun
We'll talk about it soon

When I lost faith  I found love
Tonight  I could lose the fight
But you by my side  everything will be alright
Close my mouth  words fall out
You can tell  there's something wrong
I've been here  you have been gone
And the skies  don't seem so bright
In dark times when no one wants to
I will give you me
And we'll be
Us
All I have  I will give to you
In dark times when no one wants to
I will give you me
And we'll be

The walls I

Well I know all the words

You know I know your heart
I want to mend your heart
You're broke down
Why don't you tell me from the start?

Did you think I had a place to go?
Since you stopped believing

Time's gone by and I'm still so far from
Over
You reappeared like you had never been gone
I lose composure
You're touching me like you have no desire
For closure
Reconsider
Did you lie awake like I did?
I stayed up 'til the stars didn't recognize me
So long
I waited so long
Now you don't see the skies that I do
My sun becomes your moon
For a familiar love
Time's gone by and I'm still so far from over
You reappeared like you had never been gone
I lose composure
You're touching me like you have no desire for closure
Reconsider
Did you lie awake like I did?
I stayed up til the stars didn't recognise me
So long
I waited so long
Now you don't see the skies that I do
My sun becomes your moon
For a familiar love
Only difference is that I'm the one
Second time around
Feels like the song's already been sung
Mirroring situations  accurate imitation
Do I watch and repeat?
And as if I tried to  I turned out just like you
Do we watch and repeat?
They all say I will become a replica
Your mistakes were only chemical
25 and you're just like me
Is it in our nature to be stuck on repeat?
Another encore to an aftershow
Do I chase the night or does the night chase me?
Mirroring situations  accurate imitation
Do I watch and repeat?
And as if I tried to  I turned out just like you
Do we watch and repeat?

Move to the ever moving
All blazing
We go over and over
And over and over again
If I wait too long
I'll lose you from my sight
Maybe tonight
I could stop dreaming
And start believing in forever and ever
And ever and ever again
Never not ever
Never not ever again
When there's burning inside
Do you give it up?
How long should I wait?
There's no need to hide
When there's only you in here
There's an end to us
With someone else in sight
You shine a light
And there goes that feeling
It won't let me see them

Say something loving
I just don't remember the thrill of affection
I just don't remember
Say something loving
I went looking for it
Could have been anyone's kiss
Throwing my arms at no one

And it's growing all the time
I do myself a disservice
You say something loving
Feels so unfamiliar

Is only getting stronger

I feel it taking over
Before it slips away
Don't let it slip away
Before it slips away
It always has an effect on me
Don't know how the seasons run
I always feel like I'm in between
Do I stay inside till I see the sun?
Or do I step outside?
I'm somewhere in between
Lightning and the distant crash of thunder
Knowing that it's still coming
Doesn't make me any braver
They're slowly creeping out
And they're intensified
The first drop hits my windowpane
And the emotions start flooding in
I recognize it in the air
The fading light is my precursor
But how do I prepare?
I slowly fade as the sky worsens

Here comes the rain again
It always has an effect on me
Don't know how the seasons run
I always feel like I'm in between
Do I stay inside till I see the sun?
Or do I step outside?
Under cover hideaway
Can you hear when I say
I have never felt this way?
Maybe I had said something that was wrong
Can I make it better with the lights turned on?
Maybe I had said something that was wrong
Can I make it better with the lights turned on?
It felt so crystal in the air
I still want to drown whenever you leave
Please teach me gently how to breathe
And I'll cross oceans like never before
So you can feel the way I feel it too
And I'll mirror images back at you
So you can see the way I feel it too
Maybe I had said something that was wrong
Can I make it better with the lights turned on?

And dear know that I can change
By the very first time
'Cos we can give it time
So much time
With me
And I can draw the line on the first date
I'll let you cross it
Let you take every line I've got
When the time gets late
By the very first time

So much time

It's like the sun set in your eyes I never want it to rise
And what have you done with the one I love?
When I look into your eyes  I see no surprise
I always thought it was sad
The way we act like strangers
After all that we had
We act like we had never met
We make believe
I've never seen your face  you neither me
Don't catch my eye
Don't register a smile
It never came to an ending  I can't bear you seeing
I always thought it was a shame
That we have to play these games
It felt like you really knew me
Now it feels like you see through me

When I see you again

Stay one step away
We won't have to wait
When I see you again
And I'm greeted as a friend
It is understood
That we did all we could
I always thought it was sad
The way we act like strangers
After all that we had
We act like we had never met
I always thought it was a shame
That we have to play these games
It felt like you really knew me
When I think of you
Take me to that place
Where it's control I lose
I'll never deceive
Right here I’ll always be
I let the world just slip away
I'm left with you
You light up the sky
Un-shadow the moon
The moments we've shared
Always ended too soon
Part of you stays a while
Even when you're far away
Fever for lost romance reminds me baby of you
And I took a crazy chance
Next time I'll be true
I'll be true  I'll be true  I'll be true
Footsteps on the dance floor reminds me baby of you
Teardrops in my eyes  next time I'll be true  yeah
Whispers in the powder room
She cries on every tune  every tune  every tune
And the music don't feel like it did
And the music don't feel like it did
And the music don't feel like it did with you
When I'm dancin' 'round  reminds me baby of you
And I really let you down  next time I'll be true
I'll be true  I'll be true  I'll be true
Footsteps on the dance floor
Reminds me baby of you
Teardrops in my eyes  next time I'll be true  yeah
Whispers in the powder room
She cries on every tune  every tune  every tune

 should I see someone?
 see if I break
 see if I stay
And I can't stop you leaving
I can see it in your eyes
Some things have lost their meaning
Devote to me
Alone with me
Say with me
Why would you ever want to leave?
You leave with the tide
And I can't stop you leaving
I can see it in your eyes
Some things have lost their meaning
Fade out of view
I wouldn't do that to you
I wouldn't just leave us alone
Hold me close
When you could leave us alone
Why would you just leave us alone

When and where

You know
Whats to be said
It's said out loud
But never said
A premonition of the words
Come
To me
A sign
In your eyes
A familiar light
Says it alright
You said you don't have to speak
I can hear you
I can feel all the things you've ever felt before
I said it's been a long time
Since someone looked at me that way
It's like you knew me
And all the things I couldn't say

Though the time is fine
Say you'll be there
Said to myself I'd try
Why do we waste time
Hiding it inside?
I want you to be mine
Now it's been and gone
You say what you would have done
I needed you there
And if we try once more
Would you give me it all?
Can you feel it?
You move your hand away from mine
And I don't take it as a sign
That you're any less than mine
It doesn't lessen my hold
You know our time meant all
I won't leave it untold
The feeling goes on and on and on
In my head
You tell me things you've never said
And I choose to forget
I take the good and leave the rest
And you don't answer when I call
I would have given you it all
It doesn't mean you're not mine
And you  you still have them too
And we  we live half in the day time
And we  we live half at night
Watch things on VCRs  with me and talk about big love
I think we're superstars  you say you think we are the best thing
Wanna find myself by the sea  in another's company by the sea
I wanna go out to the pier  I'm gonna dive and have no fear
Watch things on VCRs  with me and talk about big love
I think we're superstars  you say you think we are the best thing
Sometimes I feel like saying Lord I just don't care
But you've got the love I need to see me through
Sometimes it seems that the going is just too rough
And things go wrong no matter what I do
Now and then it seems that life is just too much
But you've got the love I need to see me through
When food is gone you are my daily meal
When friends are gone I know my Saviour's love is real
Your love is real
