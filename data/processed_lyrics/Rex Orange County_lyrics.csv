lyrics
" I no longer hang with them
 I can't pretend
 I'm gonna need a moment
 I did it again
 yeah
 I did it again
 fightin' solo
 to things
 I guess it all depends upon
 I turned superhero
 yeah
 I'm livin' again
 I'm safe and sound where I belong
 I guess it all depends upon
The people who don't care for me
When I don't care about them either?
And who am I to judge
The friends that I once thought I knew?
They're all off doing what they wanna do
I'm falling to pieces
When I'm on my own
Even though I'm a walking emotion
And I can't go a day without you
I saw myself as less and you so high above me
But I hope that you can learn to love me
Before I calm myself and start sleeping
And I'ma sleep in 'cause each weekend's like a Monday to me
She stay behind the bar at work
So I'm getting Red Bull for free
And I'm so bored of being awkward
I hit my head against a door
I'm not so awkward anymore
And I'm flying back to L.A.​
And I can't wait for her to see
And I'm not fucking with first class
I'll find a spot that's just for me and see if I can cope
You might also like
And we don't even need to mention all the things that matter
Or anything you're stressing 'bout
Just tell me why your day was good and love me after hours
With the wet shirt in the front row
And I hate myself for what I'm 'bout to say
But I feel as if it's time to get away
I'll find a spot that's just for me and see if I can cope
Said the likelihood just frightens me and it's easier to hide
But if only he'd remember my name one final time
I said the likelihood just frightens me and it's easier to hide
But if only he'd remember my name one final time
I said the likelihood just frightens me and it's easier to hide
But if only he'd remember my name one final time
All the things that matter or anything you're stressing 'bout
Just tell me why your day was good and love me after hours
Said the likelihood just frightens me and it's easier to hide
 oh-oh-oh
 I'm wakin' up
 I'm out of luck
 wrong this time again
 I'm fuckin' up
 but I'm not dumb
 should I pack up or stay?
 I'm fuckin' up
 but I'm not dumb
 yeah
 woah
Though only in the hope that one day I would undress her
Don't be offended
You think I'm 'bout to tell you that I love you
See the months of obsession
And crying for hours
I even started sittin' down in the shower  girl
I'll take my time on my own
And I'll be fine  now I'm alone
Constantly told stories with a stretch of the truth
Trying hard to make memories to remember from youth
Desperately wanting you to be interested too
It's not clear what I need yet
But it's clear it's not you
Here's what I'd say to any young man that's still interested in you
Do you prioritize the things in your life?
The things that you hope to do?
'Cause if not  then
Mate  you'd better trust me when I tell you that
It's not worth forgettin' about yourself
Because of one fucking girl
You'll think she likes you
I mean I thought she loved me  no
But no
Neither of us will get down from the shelf
 ooh (Yeah)
 I woulda told you this was gonna happen
 oh
 ooh (Yeah)
 it's such a shame
 the more I'm seeing a difference
 I'm on my way
 there will always be a part of me that's holding on
 yeah
 I
And where you may find it
Is unknown
So you see her (See her)
She's over (Over)
In the corner (Corner)
And you can't (You can't)
Ignore her (Ignore her)
There must be a reason
Search the definition of shame
I'm sure you'll see my face
Who's gonna save me now?
I can't believe you've come and saved me
I can't believe you've come and saved me
I don't mind

And I can't ignore her

Search the definition of afraid
And I'm sure you'll see my face
Who's gonna save me now?
I can't believe you've come and saved me
I wouldn't mind
I can't believe you've come and saved me
It's me that makes the evening long
And I hope you believe me when I say
That I don't see any other
And it shows she loves the way you love me so
But I wanna show them
And I need to know that she's down to go
But I need to know that I'm not a—
I'm not alone
I'm not alone
And I need to know that she's down to go
And I wanna know that she's not alone
They used to be new jeans
But now they’re all fucked
The only one left I know is me
But I still feel fucked
Remember when your wedding ring began to rust?
And the Mona Lisa wasn’t real?
And where on Earth did my baby go?
Well was she ever even mine?
Was she ever even mine?
So I’m sorry that you’re tired
And you don’t wanna leave
It’s a shame that you can’t see
I heard she hates her dad
Even though he bought her that Mercedes-Benz
Pass out in the afternoon and wake up next to them
She needs to know herself before she falls in love again

We didn’t learn a single thing in school
But daddy already paid
Wish you could know just how happiness feels
'Cause right now I see all these people that love me
But I still feel alone
Can't help but check my phone
I could've made you mine
And you weren't made for me
Though it seemed so easy
And that's because I wanna be your favorite boy
I wanna be the one that makes your day
The one you think about as you lie awake
I can't wait to be your number one
I'll be your biggest fan and you'll be mine
But I still wanna break your heart and make you cry
But won't you wait?
You know it's too late
I'm on my own shit now
Let me tell you how it feels to be fucking great
I feel great
You need to be yourself
Love someone for loving you instead of someone really cool
That makes your heart melt
Who knows what you truly felt
You're still my favorite girl
You better trust me when I tell you there ain't no one else
More beautiful in this damn world
In this damn world

You're gonna wanna be my best friend baby

You're gonna wanna be my best friend
Best friend
You're gonna wanna be my best friend baby
You're gonna wanna be my best friend
I say that I'm happy
I say that I'm happy
I still wanna be your favorite boy
I wanna be the one that makes your day
The one you think about as you lie awake
I'll be your biggest fan and you'll be mine
But I still wanna break your heart and make you cry
I still wanna be your favorite boy
I wanna be the one
Leaving at 11
And the bus gets later
Brutal honesty makes a great man greater
Laying off the skunk
I smell cheese
Who's got a grater?
Can't get out of bed
Real talks I gotta wake up
Forced to stalk
'Cause of lies that I made up
That's why I'm stuck smoking lies when my day's rough
That's why you gotta deconstruct before you make stuff
Or lose yourself before you find it
24 hours so tired can't lift a eyelid
Caught in the talons of talent
That's why they like this
Caught in the talons of talent
Sipping a Heineken
Looking at mice again
Looking at how to fly George and Lennie of Mice and Men
Trust me I adore you
We’re swimming through our dreams
Kiss me in the shower
For a couple hours
Though we’re only sixteen
And sit down beside me
Don’t call me daddy
Cause that’s just fucking weird ‎
Promise that you'll stay here
You and I can lay here
Until the end of time
But if you’re ever unhappy
Let you go
Let’s dream of Corduroy
Work for what you love to do and I will watch right over you
And you’re the other half of me
Drink and sleep and laugh with me
Save me from myself
See I’m a fucking basket-case
Until I'm able to see your face
You saved me from myself
You might also like
But I'm really not ready to die
I don't mind
You can tell me 'bout your day
If you wanna sit together
In silence for a number of hours
That is OK
That is fine by me
I was surprised you see
When you asked if I wanted to chill
Because you used to say
You're really not a fan of awkward tension
And I can be quiet and self loathing
And have a constant need for attention
Not to mention
Confusing humor
I might be rude about your music taste
But the industry moves quickly
And I feel the need to keep up with names and faces
So I find new sounds on a daily basis
Still question my existence on a daily basis
Tie my shoes up on a daily basis
Write my thoughts down on a daily basis
Worry about life
And wonder how many days I have left on this daily basis
Sixteen years in so see all you're able to see
Sixteen years in because you'll never be free
I understand you had a bad day and shit
So I say something dumb as fuck
And luckily it gives you a facelift
But really I couldn't take it
Especially when the volume is raising
(Like) she came in the room
Chicane in the road
Now my mind is racing
You care too
Where to?
Three days in a row my plans fell through
Crying in a hotel room
You listen
If I could I'd be staying at the Edition
(For real?)
For real
I would meet you at a certain time
And take my time to make my decision
For real
I'm only ever trying to help you (love)
It's only ev​er love (in a hotel room)
I'm only ever trying to help you (love)
It's only ever love
You know I'm troubled  but I know you can understand
I'm sorry for the strain
No one prepares you for the way in which things change
But you've been amazing  saw me through my darkest stage
And you always forgave me
And now you love me just the same
It means the most  I hope you know
And I hope you know
That I think about you in every single way
You're more familiar to me  more and more each day
Everything matters now (Everything)
We grew up while you let yourself down
I want out
She calmed me down that night I freaked out
We stayed up  I threw up in that house
She woke up face-to-face from the bed
Two in the en-suite  one in the early
She was like eight hours ahead
Two different countries  slept in a one-piece
Baby boy in full effect
And you couldn't see me  call back  repeat
That's all thanks to poor connection
Fun for me  no
Most time  it's a pain in the neck
I said it's not that fun  see
Everything makes me wanna quit while I'm ahead
Honestly
She wakes  we face-to-face from the bed
I wish I could be with her instead
When we speak face-to-face from the head
Things go wayward and I end up upset  but
You might also like
Never had done
No  I never had
Ooh
Maybe we grew outward (Yeah)
It's true  I kept the truth to myself
Now I'm nothing but a coward (Cow-)
And you were too busy making friends
You were occupied  I was in the shower
You were unaware  I was fully clothed
And you didn't know about this
But you wouldn't even really need to know
So continue picking flowers (Mm)
Remember why you're here  my friend
You can sit back and relax
And they'll always love you now and then
They'll always love you now and then
Always love you now and then
They'll always love you
It's true
She wakes  we face-to-face from the bed
I wish I could be with her instead
When we speak face-to-face from the head
Things go wayward and I end up upset
Let me be over there again
I wish I could be with her instead
Let me return for the night shift
I miss her like she's my only friend
My only friend  100 percent
I unplugged  then I dipped on my friends
My world got so much smaller this year
Tell me 'bout it
She wakes  we face-to-face from her bed
Instead  instead  yeah
When we speak face-to-face from the head
From the head  yeah  yeah
She wakes  we face-to-face from the bed
I wish I could be with her instead
When we speak face-to-face from the head
Things go wayward and I end up upset
Let me be over there again
I wish I could be with her instead
Let me return for the night shift
I miss her like she's my only friend
I grew up  you grew down  we found out
Everything matters now
We grew up while you let yourself down
His brown eyes
He was looking deeper into me than I would've liked
Could've made a contribution
And I can still see the eyes
Her green eyes
She was busy with her friends
Could've told her the truth
And I can still see the eyes
The red eyes of those around me
They like doing it
And wish to grow into the shoes of their idols
Thanks anyway
Could've had a fun night
And I can still see the eyes
His brown eyes
He was looking deeper into me than I would've liked
You might also like
But I should've given him the coins in my pockets
Could've stopped and opened my wallet
Could've done what's right 'cause he wants it
But who doesn't want it
See money is the only motive
But money is a sin and I loath it
The reason we're waiting for something
People are hungry now
The reason why a prick is running the country
No matter when you hear this know that
There's always gonna be a prick running the country
But you better get your votes in
(Best get your votes in)
Best get your votes in
Because-
They know best
And I'll be the one that needs you again
And I'll be the one that proposes in a garden of roses
And truly loves you long after our curtain closes
But will you still love me when nobody wants me around?
'Cause I am the one that's waited this long
And I am the one that might get it wrong
And me and my lack of new news
Wish you nothing but a happy new version of you
Because I
I want you to tell me you find it hard to be yourself
And I want you to love me the way you love your family
The way you love to show me what it's like
I'll be rushing back big time for a good time  I'll be running through
There's too much that I seem to worry 'bout  it's too much for you
You're leaving too soon  come back and just give me a call
I can't wait at all  let me open up
Girl  if you want it
There's no good reason not to love if you want it
I said  girl  if you want it
Let's just believe that we belong if you want it
Girl  if you want it
There's no good reason not to love if you want it
Girl  if you want it
Let's just believe that we belong if you want it
Baby  I'm so sorry  I got something I need to prove
I'll be fucking up good times every single time we discuss it through
There's too much that I seem to worry 'bout  it's too much for you
I'm acting a fool  come back and just give me a call
I can't wait at all  let me be your boy
If you want it
There's no good reason not to love if you want it
I said  girl  if you want it
Let's just believe that we belong if you want it
Girl  if you want it
There's no good reason not to love if you want it  ah
Girl  if you want it
Let's just believe that we belong if you want it
Girl  if you want it
There's no good reason not to love if you want it
I said  girl  if you want it
Let's just believe that we belong if you want it  'long if you want it

I thought I knew everything but I was naive
Didn't understand until the age of 18
Yeah  even then I was blind
2012  I remember being in need
You sent through a love letter for me to read
And it's engraved in my mind
She changed the world I know
And it's better for it
Four years later  and look where we really are
Look how far we've come
Look at us now
Thank you for waiting on me
I'm dying to see her  she's my favourite ever season
Thank you for everything
Spending summer and then we'll be good in July
Why can't it be like this for the rest of my life?

That means it all gets better soon
I hope my world feels better soon
(I hope my life feels better soon)
You let me do what I needed to
So this one's for you
'Cause even when my worst traits get in the way
You're here to help me feel safe
I don't need to be with anyone else
I don't need to explain
No  I don't need to explain
She changed the world I know
And it's better for it
Four years later  and look where we really are

 I look so weird here
 struggling to leave my mouth
 of course
 but it's not a shame 'cause
 it's been a long day
 but I do
 of course (Of course)
 my stomach's full as hell
 yeah
 no one else
 yeah
Thoughts surrounding
As I lay me down in my own bed
With the sheets like weights
And brain tied down to a stone cold pillow
But the pillow just feels like grey cement
Open your ears for this is my final lament
Love songs ain't for me no more
But this won't be the last you hear for sure
'Cause men will send you everything you need
And I can bet they'll all be taller than me
But this isn't about Alex
It's about the girl who changed him
But it wasn't meant to be
Never about me
It's about the one that was not the one
But I was love-blind to see
But what is love?
Or was this love?
Or just a minor obsession with what I thought I needed?
Was this love? I will never know
But I feel my time is up
I respect your decision
But if you ever have a change of heart
I have regrets in my mind every time
And no one seems to figure me out
I guess it's stress
It's making me feel so depressed
Most my life I've felt so tired
Keep it up and go on
You're only holding out for what you want
You no longer owe the strangers
Keep it up and go on
I know that it's so frustrating
Now I'm here and I wish that I wasn't
I'm in a place in front of a dozen people I'vе never met
And I don't know if this is corrеct
I guess I'm blessed
I never give myself respect
Most my life I'm asking why
Keep it up and go on
You're only holding out for what you want
You no longer owe the strangers
Keep it up and go on
I know that it's so frustrating
I've really had enough
Keep it up and go on
You're only holding out for what you want
You no longer owe the strangers
Keep it up and go on
I know that it's so frustrating
You might also like
You won't find it here
And try to keep my mind clear
Overthinking again
Are my problems deeper than me?
I guess they're deeper than meaning
The more you think about it
So it's always worse than it seems
Overthinking again
Well she was only 16
All the things you think about
We'll join the lonely souls and sing this out
I just wanna know love
Mother won't you tell me
When will I know love?
Baby please forgive me
Not able to show love
There ain't no love for me
I just wanna know love
Mother won't you tell me
When will I know love?
Baby please forgive me
Not able to show love
There ain't no love for me

And I didn't know what you wanted
And you didn't know that I was trouble

More than ready for action
And I feel like I forgotten how it feels to feel satisfaction

And stay on my damn feet
Well all the things you think about
Join the lonely souls and sing this out
I just wanna know love
Mother won't you tell me
When will I know love?
Baby please forgive me
Not able to show love

Laser lights all around me when I get the chance
To get my groove on
And ignore it 'til I feel alright
And I might get restless if I stay for too long
I would up and leave this fuckin' bullshit
If it meant that I could see her
Dancing to the shit I like
But now I'm losing my speed
Because I'm not the type of person who can handle defeat
And I'll be caught up and confused about what matters to me
Still in the same position same time next week
I think I'll get that myself
Thank you anyway (Ah)
You had me fucked up
It used to be so hard to see
When everything's perfect
Please don't change a single little thing for me
When you can't even hide it
And it didn't take forever to find it
I was all on my own
Almost glad to be alone
So loving is easy
You had me fucked up
It used to be so hard to see
When everything's perfect
Please don't change a single little thing for me

 woah
 I'm okay
 woah
 I'm okay
 I'm okay
And your face stays the same
You're ashamed to say you feel relieved
Stay away from your own family
But years from now
If you could make them proud
You could leave the world and feel like you've
But that's never enough
'Cause when you lose the ones you love
You might find it hard to cry
Until it's only you and everybody else has left the room
You might feel what it's like to not know how to feel
And there's nothing I can say except this long awaited rest
It's right in front of me so there's no reason to pretend

 yeah  I'm in the background
 I blame myself to tell the truth
 I probably wouldn't do it
 I never had the balls to tell you
 but still  I was helpless (So helpless)
 yeah
 don't be afraid  she reassures me
 you know  so quitters never win
 I'm finally in the zone
 but if I had to live a life
 I'd be giving in
 I never had the balls to tell you now
 it never feels the way it did at the start
 picture it)
 they can't touch me anyway
 yeah)
 oh
 I would’ve stayed here for weeks
 the only place I feel peace
 I'm bleeding
 but I rarely am a regular guy
 picture this)
 no one's even tryna reach me
 I feel the way I did at the start
 I'll never depart
When we first spent the night
Nothing else would ever feel that way
In my room it all changed
And I could see something in your eyes
I knew that nothing else would be the same
'Cause then you'd never see me cry
And I'd feel like a better guy
When we first spent the night
A scarlet love and dew-light touches were so sacred
I could never leave your face

And I still see that in your eyes
I hope that nothing will ever change
'Cause lately I've been missing you
I know I could ease the pain (Ease the pain)

Couldn't you tell I'm scared as well?
Ease my pain
 I'm aware
 one in a million

 I'm dazed and confused

 I've been up all night
 I'm trying to do
 I'm dazed and confused
 I'm aware
 I'm aware
Can somebody open the door?
There's so many reasons
I can barely take it anymore
I'm tryna find a way to get out
So can I open a window?
Can somebody open the door?
There's so many reasons
I can barely take it anymore
Could I open a window?
Can somebody open the door?
There's so many reasons

Don’t miss me when I’m dead
Live life and don’t think twice
Don’t miss me when I’m gone
I’ll see you soon in paradise
When I leave you
Take my last few pennies
And buy yourself something nice
Because  before you know it
We’ll be together again
Forever in paradise
Forever in paradise
Forever in paradise
Forever in paradise

Worried 'bout your life
Now another thought of death
How you’re gonna figure out
How you’re gonna do your best
See the reason why they did not understand you in school
Same reason why you tell yourself you’re not cool
Trust your ideas
And only drink beers  if you really want to
And not just cause they’re free
And not just cause your friends have had three
On to the fourth
But you still can’t see why they would want to drink this
Fizzing piss
But take it from the voice inside your head
You don’t have to drink at all
Fuck what they said about a good night
Fuck a good night
Who needs an academic career when you’re the one with all the ideas?
Can’t feel my arms or my legs
Maybe I’m already dead
Can’t hear my voice  thank God
Cause I hate the sound of my own voice
Wrong
Who can tell?
I’ll probably see you all in hell
Might be wrong
Who can tell?
I’ll probably see you all in hell  yeah
Might be wrong

I’ll probably see you all in hell
I’ll probably see you all in hell
I’ll probably see you all in hell
Is that what I'm supposed to be?
What if all this counts for nothing
Everything I thought I'd be?
What if by the time I realize
It's too far behind to see?
Seventy-mil projector
And we're on our way to glory
Where the show won't ever end
And the encore lasts forever
And it's time we're due to spend
Spending the years together
Growing older every day (Every day)
I feel at home when I'm around you
And I'll gladly say again
I hope the encore lasts forever
Now there's time for us to spend
This right here still feels like a honeymoon
I'm still a boy inside my thoughts
Am I meant to understand my faults?
You might also like
I don't think so
I don't think I'm meant to understand myself
Maybe you do
And that's good for you
Maybe in time
Maybe one day
I'll do the same
(I'll do the same
I'll do the same
I'll do the same)
I'll do the same as you
I'll try and hold it up
Soon I hope
Or as soon as I'm old enough
(Old enough to understand
Old enough to understand)
And it's you that knows my darkness
And you know my bedroom needs
You could blast me and my secrets
Streets are home
I walk them time and time again
And each time I am alone
Where is she?
Visions of her asleep
Visions of her and him together
Living by the sea
But please don't drown
Or let him hold you down
With the waves above your head
And please don't sleep yourself into a dream
I stay beneath your bed
But don't go please
A cold breeze
Pulling teeth
Pissed off and nosebleeds
Stay here just for the weekend
See friends later
I wish that I could hate her
Maybe girl we could grow old
But the shower is cold
And I'm sour-souled
And darker than the black knight
I heard you’ve been away to discover yourself or somethin'
But was it worth it when you stole his heart?
Are you workin' or just wastin' your time?
Did I mention that you’re still on my mind?
Still that lonely guy
Low yet high
Don't know why I still get at your phone
Slips and you become more significant in the mixture
Can’t seem to see myself
Always strive to be myself
Don't shoot me down
I'll stick around
We'll do it somehow
Don't lose me now
Don't shoot me down
I'll stick around
We'll do it somehow
Slowly lost my mind
What if this heart breaks into something that I'm unable to heal?
And what about the time?
No one can stop me now
I feel the rain upon my face again
Don't lose me now
Don't shoot me down
I'll stick around
We'll do it somehow
Don't lose me now
Don't shoot me down
I'll stick around
Wе'll do it somehow

Lonely herе tonight
No one I can speak to right now
Might remain here underneath the sheets
A lot of wasted time
Just thinkin' things that don't excel me
No one can stop me now
I feel the rain upon my face again
So don't lose me now
Don't shoot me down
I'm gon' stick around
We'll do it somehow
Don't shoot me down
Don't shoot me down
I'll stick around
They wanna take what's yours
They wanna go for dinner on your name
I let them take control and take me for a fool
It's such a shame
I never said a word and all the time that I waited was a waste
They wanna lie and still be friends
And you discovered that they don't care
Doesn't it feel unfair?
Doesn't it?
Doesn't it?
Doesn't it?
(Hey)
They wanna lie and still be friends
And you discovered that they don't care

Only wanna check on me now
I want to know where I can go
So won't you stay for a moment so I can say
I
I don't wanna see you cry
You don't have to feel this emptiness
'Cause I don't wanna feel like I'm not me
I let myself get down in the first place
Tryna keep my mind at bay
Sunflower still grows at night
Waiting for a minute till the sun's seen through my eyes
Waiting for a minute till the sun's seen through my eyes

You know you need to get yourself to sleep and dream
A dream of you and I
There's no need to keep an open eye
I promise I'm the one for you
Just let me hold you in these arms tonight
I'm lucky to be me and you can see it in my face
Back when I fucked my shit up too many times
Why would I let myself get down in the first place?
Tryna keep my mind at bay
Sunflower still grows at night
Waiting for a minute till the sun's seen through my eyes
Waiting for a minute till the sun's seen through my eyes
And so she sat me down and told me that I didn't have to cry
Said I didn't need to get down or feel empty inside
And told me that she'll love me for as long as she's alive
'Cause I hate it when I feel like I'm not me
I-I honestly don't even know why
Tryna keep my mind at bay
Sunflower still grows at night
Waiting for a minute till the sun's seen through my eyes
And I'm not sure if we should slow it down (Slow down)
And I'm ashamed of the way that I've appeared
But I promise I'm not gonna let you down (Don't let me down)
By the way  I don't know how to be in love
And there's not a day that I won't be yours
And I'm glad I'm not alone anymore
Is this too good to be true?
Can't you see I'm just a fool?
But if you have a couple hours  call me tonight
I guess I'm falling in the same way
'Cause I know after dark  I will want you here (I'll be there)
I'm just like you  boy
We have so much to lose or the best to come
And by the way  it's a way that I haven't felt before
I have to say that I feel like I've never been so sure
And there's not a day that I won't be yours
And I'm glad I'm not alone anymore
Is this too good to be true?
Can't you see I'm just a fool?
Because I need to know  I need to know
You might also like
You're all I need (Won't you stay? Won't you stay?)
You're all I see (Won't you stay? Won't you stay?)
Hope you can be yourself as well  'cause I can make you feel alright
And there was so much happiness that we were still yet to find
I said that you can call me Alex  baby  welcome to my life
(But don't you worry  don't you  don't worry girl)
No  I'm not sure if I'm into you
The last time that you checked  I was probably so sad and confused
(I don't know  no  I don't know what you like)
But if you're looking for something new
I know somebody that you could choose
What about me?
What about me?
What about me and you together?
Something that could really last forever
What about me?

If all my friends wanna be in her bed
And I begin to wonder why
I guess that I'd be lying to myself
'Cause who the fuck would be dumb enough
To reject an offer? Oh  what an offer
Now two-two-ten-one-five
Couple hours can change your life
Frankie saying Oh  what a night!
What a night?
What the fuck is a girlfriend? I'ma need advice
Maybe I should go outside so I could get a fucking life
I made a friend and she spent the night  and now
(I'm in love and she remains in my life)
Back when we spoke in Europe
I need insurance on my emotions
I can't get hurt again
(Fuck the past  fuck them  they all made me sad)
And I had no time to prepare to face my fears
I guess that it's time that I dried these tears
But if I could just be happy by the end of this song
But if by the time you hear it  you are already gone
And it didn't go to plan
Then why should I continue in this life
When there's no one around to be the one who makes me smile?
I want the crowd in tears when they hear this
I was closing all the blinds
Just so you could sleep the night through
I was staying by your side
Just so I knew you were okay
And I was opening the door
Just to see if you would walk through
I started painting all the walls
Just to see if you liked the shade
I would love just to be stuck to your side
Not with anybody else  anybody else
It's enough just to keep us occupied
Please don't go
I would love just to be stuck to your side
Not with anybody else  anybody else (Don't go)
It's enough just to keep us occupied (Please don't go)
You were holding out your hands
Hoping I'd be there to hold to
I went out to Amsterdam
Just so I could givе you some space
But I kept opеning my door
Just to see if you would walk through
But now I'm painting all my walls
Just to see if you like the shade

But I'm still gonna feel it
I don't believe it
I can't achieve it
I hope he's not a threat to me
But I'm still gonna feel it
I don't believe it
I can't achieve it
I hope he's not a threat to me
We could wait for weeks
I'm gonna be right here overthinking through
I could be the only one
But I might not be him and it drives me too wild
I'm thinking of a man much more than I
Waking up fast in the morning
I can pick up when you're calling
Keep it real with you always
We can take it real slow now
There's different people here now
(There's different people here now)

How do you admit that you're falling apart?
I mean  how will I admit that I'm falling apart?
My mother's gonna worry but I'm fine in my heart
I've lived the words that I've said
And I live with a voice that tends to tell me that I'm shit in my head
Well maybe I should fuck it and be happy instead
I should just say fuck it and be happy instead  right? Right
'Cause there's a lot of people tryin' to tell me how to deal with myself
But I'm not gonna listen if you mention my health
I don't care  don't tell me and don't text me
'Cause that kind of shit upsets me  just kind of affects me
And it's bringing me down  and I'm not gonna lie
These days I prefer to just not be outside
And these days I just end up spending all of my time
'Cause time keeps rollin' and I'm just makin' songs
(I'm doing my best  still find myself stressed)
And I'm no longer sure where I belong
(I'm starting to rust  don't know who to trust)
(Don't trust anyone. Not even me.)

Some people concentrate on style too much
But I think I just force myself to smile too much
And that should soon end for the best
I wanna live my life with no stress
Love life and feel blessed  like
It's kind of funny on the inside
(Is there anything else?)
Oh yeah
My jaw hurts a lot because I grind it with stress (Uh-huh?)
I was an idiot recently and lost a lot of my friends (Aw)
Nothing brings me joy and nothing makes me smile
Being at school makes me aware of how I haven't been myself in awhile (Oh)
And I wonder what it was like to be 11
Wonder if there's such a thing as life after death  such a thing as heaven (Why?)
So if for any reason there's some miscommunication or I'm lying to her face
My immaturity and habits getting in the way
'Cause I can barely breathe and I don't know how I'll explain myself this time
Wish it wasn't a case of this time
But why can't I be any other boy
That doesn't need a hand in love?
Someone that I would trust
But how did I fail
To give you all the love that you deserve?
When you're the only thing that's worth what life is worth
And I don't mind if you hate me
I said that I don't mind if you hate me
I'd rather be anywhere but here
It's like a pain you shouldn't ignore
This family reunion
I felt so uncomfortable I left
They all decided to stay
So it's just me and my mistakes
And I'd like to know that you smile when you're alone
And when you need time to yourself
I'm just the boy you love
I'm just the boy
When I heard that you don't know why you're here
I fell face down
And became one with the ground
And my lover's best friend
He does everything for love
But when his everything just isn't enough
I'm just the boy you love
And if it looks like you don't love me
Then that's alright and I will let you be content
I'm still your friend
No revenge and no regrets
And if it looks like God might judge me
Then I don't even wanna stay another day
Then what's the point in living life
All for him
All for him (Oh)
Mm-mm  mm-mm
First time I tried this  I was free of doubt
I had no fear
Why can't I just do that again
All the things I used to dream about
Got too far from reach
Now I don't know what's happened to me
So you wanna be happy  too?
What are you supposed to do?
Now you care about who cares
Who cares?
Who cares?
Who cares?
Who cares?
People make me wanna scream and shout
Right now  we're here
So why can't I just see you my friend?
This is what I cannot live without
Okay  it's clear
There's really no point living in fear

And I'm not sure why things change
What's worth it anymore?
Am I not the same?
Let it go  give it a try
Didn't you know nobody's perfect?
And it's not like you don't mess up and deserve it
And you don't wanna cry  but you do
You can choose to be upset or just get over it
It's up to you
What you wanna do? Oh
It's not worth it anymore  I feel insane
And I'm not sure why things change
What's worth it anymore?
Am I not the same?
You've got a friend in me
And you're miles and miles
From your nice warm bed
Just remember what your old pal said
You've got a friend in me
You've got a friend in me
You've got a friend in me
There isn't anything I wouldn't do for you
We stick together and we see it through
You've got a friend in me
You've got a friend in me
And some other folks might be
A little bit smarter than I am
Bigger and stronger too
Maybe
But none of them will ever love you the way I do
And as the years go by
Our friendship will never die
You're gonna see
It's our destiny
You've got a friend in me
You've got a friend in me
You've got a friend in me"
