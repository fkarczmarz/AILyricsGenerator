"Hey  you said you were my friend
Hey  turn me upside down  oh
Hey  feelin' so down
Hey  hey
You made a fool of me again
Hey  I know I made the same mistake  yeah
I  I won't do it again  no
Why  why do you slap me in the face? Ow
I  I didn't say it was okay  no
No  no
You violate a part of me again
And again  and again  and again

Burning on the angry chair

Loneliness is not a phase
Field of pain is where I graze
Serenity is far away
Pink cloud has now turned to gray
All that I want is to play
It's easier to keep fallin'
Imitations are pale
Emptiness... all tomorrows
Haunted by your ghost...
Fading out by design
Consciously avoiding changes
Silencing all tomorrows
Forcing a goodbye...
Like blood from a stone
These stand for me
Name your god and bleed the freak
I'd like to see
How you all would bleed for me
When the pig runs slower (Slower)
Let the arrow fly (Fly)
When the sin lies bolder (Bolder)
I'll pluck out thine eye (I'll pluck out thine eye)
These stand for me
Name your god and bleed the freak
I'd like to see
How you all would bleed for me
If you scorn my lover (Lover)
Satan got your thigh (Thigh)
If you steal in hunger (Hunger)
I will kick you when you try (When you try)

I drowned you in the lake
Only thing I'd not embrace
And maybe I don't give a damn anyway
So you couldn't dam that river
And it washed me so far away
I pushed and then you stumbled
I kicked you in the face
You stared at me so hollow
Got to keep that killing pace
And maybe I don't give a damn anyway

Ask around to find out
Where the junkies applied
You just upped and left me
On this rock all alone
It's my fault for knowing not
What I should have known
It's been deflating since you died

I have never felt such frustration
Or lack of self-control
I want you to kill me and dig me under
I wanna live no more
One who doesn't care is one who shouldn't be
I've tried to hide myself from what is wrong for me
For me
I want to taste dirty  a stinging pistol
In my mouth  on my tongue
I want you to scrape me from the walls
And go crazy like you've made me
One who doesn't care is one who shouldn't be

Hey  I'll just wander my own road
Say goodbye  don't follow
Misery so hollow
I get so lost and don't know how  yeah
And it hurts to care  I'm going down
Things I'd done and where I've been
Sleep in sweat  the mirror's cold
See my face  it's growin' old
Scared to death  no reason why
Do whatever to get me by
Think about the things I said
Read the page  it's cold and dead
And take me home
Take me home
Take me home  yeah

Bury me softly in this womb
I give this part of me for you
Sand rains down and here I sit
Holding rare flowers in a tomb  in bloom
Down in a hole and I don't know if I can be saved
See my heart  I decorate it like a grave
Oh  you don't understand who they thought I was supposed to be
Look at me now  a man who won't let himself be
Down in a hole  feelin' so small
Down in a hole  losin' my soul
I'd like to fly
But my wings have been so denied
Down in a hole and they've put all the stones in their place
I've eaten the sun so my tongue has been burned of the taste
I have been guilty of kicking myself in the teeth
I will speak no more of my feelings beneath

Down in a hole  feelin' so small
Down in a hole  losin' my soul
Down in a hole  feelin' so small
Down in a hole  out of control
I'd like to fly
A word so wrongfully abused
All included but you
Alone...
The sounds of silence often soothe
Shapes and colors shift with mood
Pupils widen and change their hue
Why's it have to be this way?
Be this way
Flowers watched through wide eyes bloom
A child sings an unclaimed tune
Innocence spins cold cocoon
Grow to see the pain too soon
Why's it have to be this way?
Be this way

Hope you wish away the lies...
Can you protect
Me when I'm wrecked?
I pretend you're still alive
Yeah...
Who will deny all in time all the lies?

Thick fog that hide our smiles

Threadbare tapestry unwinding slow
Feel a tortured brain
Show your belly like you want me to
As of now  I bet you got me wrong

Ain't the real why
There's no pressures besides brilliance
Let's say by day nine
Endless corporate ignorance
Lets me control time
Once again  you see an in
Discolored skin gives you away
So afraid  you kindly gurgle
Out a date for me

Now the body of one soul I adore
Wants to die
You have always told me you'd
Not live past twenty-five
I say  stay long enough to repay
All who caused strife
Once again  you see an in
Discolored skin gives you away
So afraid  you kindly gurgle
Out a date for me
Once again  you see an in
Discolored skin gives you away
So afraid  you kindly gurgle
Out a date for me
I bear true and an existing witness
To this barrel of monkeys
A self-proclaimed immoral success
Perfected by each whereof
Individually deadly  and equally so
And spread about the surrendered troops
For even thousands of miles
Will not tear apart their communication
Or the lack thereof
In no suggestion or rhyme
Your weapon is contained
In the record keeping the desired effect
The breaking of the spirit thwarts the whole being
Your weapon is guilt
Your weapon is guilt
Your weapon is guilt
Am I too contagious?
Full of sick desire
Am I that I promise?
Burning corpsed pyre
Then some dude came down
To touch the mother
Mother touched
And dude ain't here no more
Suck your woman down
Am I your reflection?
Melting mirror smile
Am I worth the value?
Do my love defile?
Then some dude came down
To touch the mother
Mother touched
And dude ain't here no more
Ain't no day the sun don't crack
Try to brand some name across my back
So you care? Find someone to tell you

Father said  Come home
Sisters said  Come home
So my friends said  Come home
And I said:
Let me be  I'm all right
Can't you see I'm just fine?
Little skinny  okay
I'm asleep anyway
Then I heard a voice
I then slapped my face
Let me be  I'm okay
I'm awake anyway
It's too bright over here
I can shift  cannot steer
So I drive them away
For a while  then I stay
Little skinny  okay
I'm awake anyway

Toby's still laughing
That sounds fucking pretty good
're laughing  it's like
Why would I be lying?
End fan  all planned out
Offering a wonderful
Peace of mind worth buying
Bow down  last round up
I am wise  and you don't know
A cloud is my home
Only some get in
Got a 'maginary friend
The devil put dinosaurs here
Jesus don't like a queer
The devil put dinosaurs here
No problem with faith  just fear
Promise those who've gone before
Waitin' on you flyin'
Leading  receiving us
I'm as flawed as any man
Look at me  I'm smiling
Drink me  eat me up

Things had changed
Inner compass aligned
All this feels rearranged
Shifting to the after
An impostor
I'm not the one you know
I look the same outside
I carry something I hide
Underneath the one you know
Shifting to the after
An impostor soldiers on
Are you surprised
Black water flows
From wells run dry?
I'm not the one you know

Lay me out with flowered guilt
Watch the explosions falling
Cannot live within this tilt

Them bones are me

Gonna end up a big ol' pile of them bones

Empty

Scary's on the wall
Scary's on his way
Watch where you spit
I'd advise you wait until it's over
Then you got hit
And you should've known better
And we die young
Faster we run
Watch the blood float in the muddy sewer
Take another hit
And bury your brother
And we die young
Faster we run

 it's sole desertion
 quite the notion
 yeah
Watched your fears become your god
It's your decision
It's your decision
Apathetic to the stunned
It's your decision
It's your decision
You feed the fire that burned us all
When you lied
To feel the pain that spurs you on
Black inside
No one plans to take the path
That brings you lower
And here you stand before us all
It might seem an afterthought
It's your decision
It's your decision
