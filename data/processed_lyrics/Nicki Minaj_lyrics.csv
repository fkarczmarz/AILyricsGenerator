lyrics
"I put the heat in vents  man  I been competin' since
I look beyond what people sayin' and I see intent
Then I just sit back and decipher what they really meant
Cherish these nights  cherish these people
Life is a movie  but there'll never be a sequel
And I'm good with that  as long as I'm peaceful
As long as seven years from now  I'm takin' my daughter to preschool
Cherish these days  man  do they go quick
Just yesterday  I swear it was '06
Ten years ago  that's when you proposed
I looked down  Yes  I suppose
All things go  all things go
All things go  all things go
While we keep waitin' for a moment to live for
So can't nobody ever tell me that I'm wrong
'Cause I'ma ride out wit' you  still  the night is young
And we keep goin'  we go (We go  we go)
We wake back up and do it all again (And we know  we know)
Said  Fuck the world  we ridin' 'til the end
When all is said and done  look what we've become (Oh  we go)
I just want you to know that I did it for you

I lost my little cousin to a senseless act of violence
His sister said he wanted to stay with me  but I didn't invite him
Why didn't he ask? Or am I just buggin'?
'Cause since I got fame  they don't act the same
Even though they know that I love 'em
Family ties broken before me
Niggas tryna kill him  he ain't even call me
And that's the reflection of me
Yes  I get it  I get it was all me
I'll pop a pill and remember
The look in his eyes the last day he saw me
All things go  all things go
All things go  all things go
While we keep waitin' for a moment to live for
So can't nobody ever tell me that I'm wrong
'Cause I'ma ride out wit' you  still  the night is young
And we keep goin'  we go (We go  we go)
We wake back up and do it all again (And we know  we know)
Said  Fuck the world  we ridin' 'til the end
When all is said and done  look what we've become (Oh  we go)
I just want you to know that I did it for you
Lemme make this clear: I'm not difficult  I'm just 'bout my business
I'm not into fake industry parties and fake agendas
Rock with people for how they make me feel  not what they give me
Even the ones that hurt me the most  I still show forgiveness
I love my mother more than life itself and that's a fact
I'd give it all if somehow I could just rekindle that
She never understands why I'm so overprotective
The more I work  the more I feel like somehow they're neglected
I want 'Caiah to go to college just to say  We did it
My child with Aaron woulda been sixteen any minute
So in some ways  I feel like 'Caiah is the both of them
It's like he's 'Caiah's little angel lookin' over him
And I know Jelani will always love me and I'll always love him
And I'm just his little sister  not Nicki Minaj when I'm around him
Gee  we did it  let's leave this imprint
Just finished writin'  this is The Pinkprint
All things go  all things go
My anaconda don't
Boy toy named Troy used to live in Detroit
Wa-wa-was in shootouts with the law but he live in a palace
I'm on some dumb shit
He can tell I ain't missing no meals (Hey)
Come through and fuck him in my automobile (Hey)

Classic shit
I'm lookin' for a nigga to give some babies
A handful of Weezy  sprinkle of Dave East
Man  I ain't got no type like Jxmmi and Swae Lees
But if he can't fuck three times a night  peace!
I tried to fuck 50 for a powerful hour
But all that nigga wanna do is talk Power for hours
B-beat the pussy up  make sure it's a K-O
Step your banks up like you're movin' that yayo
Somebody go and make sure Karrueche okay  though
I heard she think I'm tryna give the coochie to Quavo
They always wanna beat it up  goon up the pussy
Man  maybe I should let him autotune up the pussy
All these Bow Wow Challenge niggas lyin' and shit
Man  these Fetty Wap niggas stay eyein' my shit
Drake worth a hundred mill  he always buyin' me shit
But I don't know if the pussy wet or if he cryin' and shit
Meek still be in my DMs  I be havin' to duck him
I used to pray for times like this face-ass when I fuck him
Man  Uzi is my baby  he ain't takin' a L
But he took it literally when I said Go to hell
Used to fuck with Young Thug  I ain't addressin' this shit
C-caught him in my dressing room  stealin' dresses and shit
I used to give this nigga with a lisp tests and shit
How you want the pu-thy? Can't say your S's and shit  uh

Lie down in your bed  your bed of lies

Everything you got was based off of my contacts
You a fraud but I'ma remain icon-stat
Balenciagas on my boots with a python strap
You was caught up in the rush and you was caught up in the thrill of it
You was with me way before I hit a quarter mil' in it
Put you in the crib and you ain't never pay a bill in it
I was killin' it  now you got me poppin' pills in it
'Cause I was doin' it for us  I told 'em fuck the public

They say you don't know what you got 'til it's gone
They say that your darkest hour come before your dawn

Do you ever think of me when you lie? (When you lie)
Lie down in your bed  your bed of lies
And I knew better than to look in your eyes (In your eyes)

You had me caught in every web that you weaved

Lie down in your bed  your bed of lies

You'd remember our connection and be freed from the lies
I just figured I was something that you couldn't replace
But there was just a blank stare and I couldn't relate
I just couldn't understand and I couldn't defend
When the tears rolled down  it's like you ain't even notice 'em
If you had a heart  I was hopin' that you would show it some
What the fuck you really tellin' me? What you tellin' me?
I ain't mean to cut you  I ain't wanna catch a felony
This ain't How To Be A Player  you ain't Bill Bellamy
They say you don't know what you got 'til it's gone
They say that your darkest hour come before your dawn

I'ma ask on the song
So does she know I've been in that bed before? (Bed before)
A thousand count and not a single thread of truth
If I was just another girl (Just another girl)
Then I'm ashamed to say that I'm not over you
There's one thing I need to know
So call me when you're not so busy
Just thinkin' of yourself (Thinkin' of yourself)
Do you ever think of me when you lie? (When you lie)
Lie down in your bed  your bed of lies (Bed)
And I knew better than to look in your eyes (In your eyes)
They only pretend you would be mine
You had me caught in every web that you weaved
But do you ever think of me when you lie? (When you lie)

To conquer  to thrive
I came to win (J.R.)  to survive
To prosper  to rise
To fly
To fly
I wish today it would rain all day
Maybe that'd kinda make the pain go away
Tryna forgive you for abandoning me
Prayin'  but I think I'm still an angel away
Maybe that is why I chase strangers away
They got they guns out aimin' at me
But I become Neo when they aimin' at me
Me against enemies  me against friends
Somehow  they both seem to become one
A sea full of sharks and they all smell blood
They start comin' and I start risin'
Must be surprisin'  I'm just surmisin'

Suffocatin' every time it locks me in
Paintin' they own pictures  then they crop me in
But I will remain where the top begins
'Cause I am not a word  I am not a line
I am not a girl that could ever be defined
I am not fly  I am levitation
I represent an entire generation
I hear the criticism loud and clear
That is how I know that the time is near
See we become alive in the time of fear
And I ain't got no motherfuckin' time to spare
Cry my eyes out for days upon days
Such a heavy burden placed upon me

 just ask Master P (Let's go)
 I just took a knee (Let's go)
 gyal a freak
 I can ride it while you slippin' and slidin'
 he always tell me he miss it
Sheets all over the floor and they laced with drugs
You ain't play your cards right  you had the Ace of Clubs
Hit you with the Ace of Spade in your face and shrugged
Blood drippin' out your arm on my Asian rugs
We was just plannin' a wedding  Caucasian doves
You was just tellin' your mans that you hate the clubs
Now we in the crying game  heart laced with slugs
Are you alone? Do you need someone?
Is it too late to talk? Did I wait too long?
Thousand words don't change a thing
Is it only three  three words that you're missing?
Where'd you go? Couldn't see  I was too busy
Could've just said no  where would you go? I think I know
Oh-oh  oh-oh
We're back to playing  we're back to playing
Oh-oh  oh-oh
We're back to playing the crying game
I could've given everything
Don't wanna let the tears begin
We're back to playing the crying game
I could've given everything
Don't wanna let the tears begin
We're back to playing the crying game

Welcome to the crying game  where you lose your soul
Where it ain't no E-Z Pass  you gotta use the toll
Ain't no cruise control  you 'bout to lose control
Ain't no smilin' faces here  we slammin' doors and dishes
Sayin' we don't miss each other  but it's all fictitious
Sayin' that we had enough  but enough of what?
Another slap to the face  another uppercut
I'm just abusive by nature  not 'cause I hate ya
Not 'cause I wanna get someone to imitate ya
I know it's hard  I know I intimidate ya
But is you stayin' or goin'?
I couldn't breathe and you ain't even know it
How come you never show it? All this love you speak of
All I want is to love and be loved (To love and be loved)
I'm losin' a thing I thought I'd win
And I'm comin' undone
'Cause the tears don't end
Where'd you go? Couldn't see  I was too busy
Could've just said no  where would you go? I think I know
Oh-oh  oh-oh
We're back to playing  we're back to playing
Oh-oh  oh-oh
We're back to playing the crying game
I could've given everything (Everything)
Don't wanna let the tears begin (Everything)
We're back to playing the crying game
I could've given everything
Don't wanna let the tears begin
We're back to playing the crying game
Oh-oh  oh-oh

Uh  thinkin' out loud
I must have a quarter million on me right now
Hard to make a song 'bout somethin' other than the money
Two things I'm about it are talkin' blunt and stayin' blunted
We should all disappear right now
Look  you're gettin' all your friends and you're gettin' in the car
You see the fleet of all the new things
Cop cars with the loose change
All white like I move things
Niggas see me rollin' and they mood change
Like a motherfucker
New flow  I got a dozen of 'em
I don't trust you  you a undercover
I could probably make some stepsisters fuck each other
Woo  talkin' filets with the truffle butter
Yeah  they all get what they desire from it
What? Tell them niggas we ain't hidin' from it

And I ain't talkin' about that Lil Wayne record
I'm still the highest sellin' female rapper for the record
Man  this the sixty-five millionth single sold
I ain't gotta compete with a single soul
I'm good with the ballpoint game  finger roll
Ask me how to do it  I don't tell a single soul
Pretty women  what's up? Is you here right now?
You a stand-up or is you in your chair right now? Uh
Do you hear me? I can't let a wack nigga get near me
I might kiss the baddest bitch if you dare me
I ain't never need a man to take care of me
I floss every day  but I ain't a dentist
Your whole style and approach I invented
And I ain't takin' that back 'cause I meant it (Yeah)

Bank teller flirtin' after checkin' my account
Pretty ladies  are you here? Truffle butter on your pussy
Cuddle buddies on the low
You ain't gotta tell your friend that I eat it in the mornin'
'Cause she gon' say I know
Can I hit it in the bathroom? Put your hands on the toilet
I'll put one leg on the tub  girl
This my new dance move  I just don't know what to call it
I ain't nothin' like your last dude
What's his name? Not important
I brought some cocaine if you snortin'
She became a vacuum  put it on my dick like carpet
Suck the white off  white chocolate
And born in New Orleans  get killed for Jordans
