"Covering my head
And I'd stood up to that bully when he pushed and called me names
But I was too afraid
And I'd've gone on and saw Elvis that night he came to town
But mama said I couldn't
And I'd've went skinny dipping with Jenny Carson that time she dared me to
But I didn't
I wish I'd've spent more time with my dad when he was alive
Now I don't have the chance
And I wish I'd've told my brother how much I loved him before he went off to war
But I just shook his hand
I wish I'd've gone to church on Sunday morning when my grandma begged me to
But I was afraid of God
But I wouldn't

People say they wouldn't change a thing
Even if they could
There was this red dress she wanted one time so bad she could taste it
She wanted to paint our bedroom yellow and trim it blues and greens
She loved to be held and kissed and touched
And if I'd've known that dance was gonna be our last dance I'd've asked that band to play
People say they wouldn't change a thing
Even if they could
All the pretty girls said I'm going to L.A
All the pretty girls said I hate my hair
Talking to the mirror in their underwear
All the lost boys said I just got paid
All the lost boys said I wanna get laid
When the town goes blue and the lights blink red
All the lost boys do what all the pretty girls said
All of the whiskey went to my head
All the preachers said it's the devil's playground
I wonder if they knew they were wasting their breath
All I ever heard was all the pretty girls said

Jack in her Cherry Coke town
Momma and Daddy put their roots right here
‘Cause this is where the car broke down
Yellow dawn school bus kickin’ up red dust
Pickin’ us up by a barbed wire fence
Born in the USA
New York to LA
Put me on the cover of the Rolling Stone
Uptown down home American kids
Growin’ up in little pink houses
Makin’ out on living room couches
Blowin’ that smoke on a Saturday night
Take her home and give her your jacket

Me and Mary making our way into the night
You can hear the cries from the carnival rides
Watching the summer sun fall out of sight
There's a warm wind coming in from off of the ocean
Making it's way past the hotel walls to fill the streets
Mary is holding both of her shoes in her hands
Said she likes to feel the sand beneath her feet
So tonight I hope that I will do just fine
And I don't see how you could ever be anything but mine
There's a local band playing at the sea side pavilion
And I got just enough cash to get us in
And as we are dancing Mary's wrapping her arms around me
And I can feel the sting of summer on my skin
In the midst of the music I tell her I love her
We both laugh cause we know it isn't true
But Mary there's a summer drawing to an end tonight
And there's so much that I long to do to you

So many thoughts to sit and ponder
'Bout life and love and lack of
And this emptiness in my heart
Too old to be wild and free still
Too young to be over the hill
Should try to grow up
But who knows where to start
So I just sit right here and have another beer in Mexico
Do my best to waste another day
Sit right here and have another beer in Mexico
Let the warm air melt these blues away
Sun comes up and sun sinks down
And I seen them both in this tourist town
Up for days in a rage
Just trying to search my soul
From the answers and the reasons why
I'm at these crossroads in my life
And I really don't know
Which way to go

Do my best to waste another day
Sit right here and have another beer in Mexico
Let the warm air melt these blues away
Letting go like a levee breaks
Walk away as if I don't care
Learn to shoulder my mistakes
I'm built to fade like your favorite song
Getting reckless when there's no need
Laugh as your stories ramble on
My only friends are pirates
That's just who I am
I'm better as a memory than as your man
Never sure when the truth won't do
I'm pretty good on a lonely night
I move on the way a storm blows through
I struggle sometimes to find the words
Always sure until I doubt
Walk a line until it blurs
Build walls too high to climb out
But I'm honest to a fault
That's just who I am

I don't want to be that mistake

You should know it before it gets too late
Cause goodbyes are like a roulette wheel

Left holding a losing hand
But one day you're gonna find someone
And right away you'll know it's true
That all of your seeking's done
It was just a part of the passing through
Right there in that moment you'll finally understand
That I was better as a memory than as your man
More than I'd like to  but I’m okay with stayin' home
My how the last few months have changed
I’m smilin' more despite the pain
I breathe in  I breathe out
Got friends to call who let me talk about
What ain't workin'  what’s still hurtin'
All the things I feel like cussin' out
Now and then I let it go  I ride the waves I can't control
I'm learnin' how to build a better boat
I hate waitin'  ain't no patience in these hands
I'm not complainin'  sometimes it's hard to change a man
I think I'm stronger than I was

Down in the harbor  where the ferries come to shore
She never really knew how good it would feel
To finally find herself in a place  so warm and real
She wears a Red Sox cap to hide her baby dreads
The girl she was in New England  is different now and dead
In all the local bars  she flirts and tells the boys
While they're talking  she's from Boston
Through e-mails and post-cards  she tries to explain to them
That education and occupation will have to wait for now
She loves the Rosta Reggae rhythms  her dreams have changed somehow
She wears a Red Sox cap to hide her baby dreads
The girl she was in New England  is different now and dead
In all the local bars  she flirts and tells the boys

Her toes dig deep and deeper in the sand
She's seduced by the sunsets and her new life at hand

His stocks were always tankin' and his girlfriends were expensive
But he looked like a poster for a permanent vacation
I asked him what he did to change his orientation
He bought a shot and dropped this little information
I made a bucket list changed the B to an F
I gave my give a damn the finger so it got up and left
I quit worrying about people's expectations
Ordered up a six-pack of chillaxification
If you're a little depressed feel a little bit lost
Baby write it all down and then blow it all off
We're all a letter away from p-perpetual bliss
Put an F on the B of your b-b-b-b-bucket list
You know he got me thinking 'bout the way that I've been livin'
Seems like I'm always going but I don't know where I'm gettin'
I was overexistentializing my redneck

Saw a old man being interviewed
Turning a hundred and two today
Asked him what's the secret to life
He looked up from his old pipe
Laughed and said All I can say is.
Don't blink
Just like that you're six years old and you take a nap and you
Wake up and you're twenty-five and your high school sweetheart becomes your wife
Don't blink
You just might miss your babies growing like mine did
Turning into moms and dads next thing you know your better half
Of fifty years is there in bed
And you're praying God takes you instead
Trust me friend a hundred years goes faster than you think
So don't blink
I was glued to my TV when it looked like he looked at me and said
Best start putting first things first.
'Cause when your hourglass runs out of sand
You can't flip it over and start again

Four houses down from me
Was a family with an only child
She was the only girl
In this whole world that could make me smile
Down the road
I made up reasons to go
Down the road
Somewhere inside of me
There was something she took a liking to
She said she really wanted to
Down the road
To see what life's gonna hold
Down the road
Her mama wants to know
Am I washed in the blood or just in the water?
Her daddy wants to know
If I make enough to take his daughter

And all these pretty people up on El Cerrito Place
They all got something in their pockets  all got something on their face

Singing' hallelujah while they dance over the stars

Wanna be the first to arrive
No time for ponderin' why I'm a-wanderin'
Oh  while we're both still alive
To the ends of the earth  would you follow me?
There's a world that was meant for our eyes to see
To the ends of the earth  would you follow me?
If you won't I must say my goodbyes to thee
Oh  there's an island where all things are silent
I'm gonna whistle a tune

Rumors turn the mills back home
Parkin' lot kids with the speakers blown
We didn't turn it on but we can't turn it

Like we swore we wouldn't do
Drank too much beer last night
A lot more than we wanted to
There were girls from Argentina and Arkansas
All mixed together and having a ball
One thing started leading to another
Out last night
Hitting on everybody and their mother
There were two karaoke girls drunk on a dare
Singing I Got You Babe by Sonny and Cher
We went out last night
Well you know I'm a music man
I grew up in east Tennessee
Last night I was everything
When I got a few drinks in me
Brad Pitt's brother and a man on the run
Anything I thought would get the job done

Out last night
Hitting on everybody and their mother
There were people doing body shots up on the bar
Jimmy in a fist fight out by the car
Everybody was some kind of star
When we went out last night
Well the fact that I'm still breathing
Means that I must have survived
And that I lived to go out with my friends again tonight
One thing started leading to another
Out last night
Everybody started loving on each other
They were dancing on the tables
And howling at the moon
Pairing off together and pretty soon
There was not a sole in sight
Smoky Mountains  nice place to hang around
Moonshine  that's where they make it
Put it in a jug  makes you wanna get naked
But I jumped on a Greyhound bus one night
And took it all the way to the end of the line
Stepped out in the sun  when my feet hit the sand
What a long  strange trip
I spent my whole life running around (Running around)
Still let the wind kinda blow me around
Well  I dropped a note in a bottle
To a long-legged model
And I traded it in for a whole 'nother world
A pirate flag and an island girl
Well  my friends back home think I've gone and lost my mind
Take a sip of rum and you really would know why
Jolly Roger flying on the picnic table
Blender in the kitchen  willing and able
Don't know what makes you say  What the hell?
But when the salt air catches a hold of that sail
Something 'bout it makes her just want to dance
And she loves to dance

Where the oceans turn to silver and the beaches turn to gold
I'd make love to some señorita in that town
Then I'd get on my boat and I'd sail the ocean 'round
I wish I was a pirate out there under my own flag
Runnin' for no reason and no reason to turn back
Gonna get off of this highway
Wake up in some bay
With sunshine on my face
St. Christopher on a silver chain

And that I've been waking up alone
Just me and the TV and a sinking feeling
That you ain't ever coming home
Cause the boat's in the bay and it's calling my name
So I'm heading on out the door
Beer's too cold to be thinking bout you
Gonna take this heartbreak and tuck it away
Save it for a rainy day
When I turned the ignition I knew I'd been missing
The feel of the wind on my face
I was stuck in a habit of wondering what happened
Too busy taking all the blame
But a drink or two is a foolproof remedy
It's a beautiful world with a beautiful girl

Takin' pictures of people we thought were stars
It’s easy to give in to your heart
When you’re drunk on La Cienega Boulevard
When the song comin' out of the speakers
Was the band that you had on your t-shirt
We were screamin' cause all the streets were empty
Up all night and we were feelin' so good
We were in a hotel singin' in the hallway lights
We were strikin' the matches right down to the ashes
Wrote I love you in lipstick on the mirror
Said Do you think we’ll live forever? As we killed another beer
And you wrote I love you in lipstick on the mirror
We were laughin' until we were breathless
And comin' alive and we were…

She said it was her first time to see the sea
Helping her climb across those jetty rocks
Was the first time I touched her hand
The rain and the way that felt never let up all week
By Thursday I knew everything about her
Shining like that lighthouse through all the rain
And the way she called my name
I've lived those seven days a thousand times
Those seven days a thousand
That old pier ran clear out into the mist
My mind plays back that Tuesday night again and again and again
I taste that saltwater taffy on her lips
Wednesday morning snuck in through the window
We just laid there and listened to the waves come and go

Standing in the huddle listening to the call
Fans going crazy for the boys of fall
They didn't let just anybody in that club
Took every ounce of heart and sweat and blood
To get to wear those game day jerseys down the hall
Kings of the school man  were the boys of fall
Well it's turn and face the Stars and Stripes
It's fighting back them butterflies
And it's knocking heads and talking trash
It's slinging mud and dirt and grass

So I drove around 'til I saw the neon lights
Of a corner bar  and it just seemed right so I pulled up
Not a soul around but the old bar keep
Down at the end and looking half asleep
I said  The good stuff
He didn't reach around for the whiskey
He didn't pour me a beer
His blue eyes kind of went misty
He said You can't find that here
'Cause it's the first long kiss on a second date
Mama's all worried when you get home late
And dropping the ring in the spaghetti plate
'Cause your hands are shaking so much
And it's the way that she looks with the rice in her hair
Eating burnt suppers the whole first year
And asking for seconds to keep her from tearing up
He grabbed a carton of milk and he poured a glass
And I smiled and said  I'll have some of that
We sat there and talked as an hour passed  like old friends
I saw a black and white picture and it caught my stare
It was a pretty girl with bouffant hair
He said  That's my Bonnie
Taken about a year after we were wed

He said  Spent five years in the bottle
When the cancer took her from me
But I've been sober three years now
'Cause the one thing stronger than the whiskey
Was the sight of her holding my baby girl
The way she adored that string of pearls
I gave her the day that our youngest boy  Earl
Married his high school love
And it's a new T-shirt saying  I'm a Grandpa
Being right there as our time got small
And holding her hand  when the Good Lord called her up
And look into those eyes  so deep in love
And drink it up
'Cause that's the good stuff
I'm too young for this
Got my whole life ahead
How am I gonna raise one?

Going up in smoke
So much for ditching this town
And hangin' out on the coast
