lyrics
"And I wake up on my own
The dream I'll never sow
You're a true night butterfly
Is it true boys never cry?
But it was never set in stone
Is it only in the movie you love me in 5D?
Is it only in the movies?
On my screen? In my dream?
Daydreaming's not enough
I'm waking up
Is there anywhere we could be 5D?
Are we ever gonna levitate?
Are we the kind to rise and fade? Oh
Is this the part I'm gonna play?
Where I stay and you run away?

Daydreaming's not enough
I'm waking up
Is there anywhere we could be 5D?
Is there anywhere?
5D
(It's every night and every eye)
(Somewhere)
Is it only in the movie you love me in 5D?
Is it only in the movies?
On my screen? In my dream?
Daydreaming's not enough
I'm waking up
Med hjärtat i handen igen
Det är nu eller aldrig
Jag dog
Med hjärtat i handen igen
Låt mig gå
Men släpp mig aldrig
Låt mig gå
Du glömmer väl aldrig vad du sa
Jag tar en kula för dig
Det var jag
För jag är krossad
Men jag kommer inte gråta flera tårar
För jag kan inte förlåta
Du går efter
Men jag kommer inte stanna
Låt mig gå
Låt mig gå
Men släpp mig aldrig
Låt mig gå
Jag kan inte andas
Måste gå
Mitt hjärta har stannat igen

Villе allting
Men du våga aldrig fråga
Låt mig gå
Jag var så lätt att få
Nu är jag bara blå
Så varför sa du så
Om jag ändå måste gå?
Låt mig gå
Jag är hög
Låt mig gå
För jag är krossad
Men jag kommеr inte gråta flera tårar
För jag kan inte förlåta
Du går efter
Men jag kommer inte stanna
Låt mig gå

Ville allting
Men du våga aldrig fråga
Låt mig gå

Like a cancer for its prey
Shot an arrow in your harbor
Where you waited in the rain
I am longing for your honey
I am longing for your love
And the shot goes
Through my head and back
Gunshot
I can't take it back
Lay me down in your ocean
Carry me and my burden
I was hoping you'd save me
And the shot goes
Through my head and back
Gunshot
I can't take it back
My heart cracked
Really loved you bad

Drop down in my seat

Look for you on every street
Drop down in my seat
Flaming memories
You put me in the middle
Now we're back on the road we started
You played me like a fiddle
You pass me by
Silver Chevy
Happy hurts
Never ready
Summer burns
Silver Chevy
Drive away
Back to her
Nothing's ever evergreen
Unwrite the last scene
Erase my memory
Still got your other woman
That's not what you said you wanted
I loved you like she couldn't
She's passing by

That sings so we can heal the harm inside
Don't leave me stranded  don't leave me alone
Don't me leave me dying  without a lover to hold

I know places we can go  babe
I know places we can go  babe
Where the highs won't bring you down  babe
Don't ask me when  but ask me why
Don't ask me how  but ask me where
There is a road  there is a way

I know places we can go  babe
And the high won’t fade here  babe

I lie here like a starless lover

Peeking over shoulders
Waiting for my time to come
Working in the corner
One day to the other
Butter on my piece of bun
Working in the corner
Peeking over shoulders
Waiting for my time to come
Working in the corner

Butter on my piece of bun
Stepping a stone and I'm all gone
Give me the tone and I'm all gone

Angel line  you fell right down
You're the diamond in the gutter

So only one life can't be enough
Can you give me just another
For that one who got away?

GET IT?
They say I switch hoes how I switch clothes
Little nigga now doing big shows
But I'm heavy in the streets like I'm Big Pun
(I don't give a fuck little nigga)
I can't describe with just 1 verse
There'll be no rest for the wicked
There's no song for the choir
There's no home for the weary

If you save your heart for mine

We'll meet again
Is to save every day till eternity passes away
Just to spend them with you
If I could make days last forever
If words could make wishes come true
I'd save every day like a treasure and then
But there never seems to be enough time
I've looked around enough to know
That you're the one I want to go through time with
If I had a box just for wishes
And dreams that had never come true
They were answered by you
But there never seems to be enough time
I've looked around enough to know
You're right behind me as before
Yesterday the night before tomorrow
Dry my eyes so you won't know
Dry my eyes so I won't show
I know you're right behind me
You walk the surface of this town
The high heels above the ground
And high horses that we know
Keep us safe until the night
Stay put and play along
Cause I'm looking for my friend

I'm just a bad woman  I know
I understand if you leave  I understand if you leave me
I'll understand if you leave me  just go
Just don't go before I show you what's behind all of my sorrow
What's inside all of the bullets I throw (oh  oh)

You used to love  you used to love
Even the bad  the crazy
Don't walk away  don't give me up
Don't you know?
I'm a bad woman (I know I hurt you)
But I'm still your woman (I'll try to change)
But I'm a bad woman (I know I hurt you)
But I'm still your woman (I'll try to change)
But I'm a bad woman  but I'm still your woman
I'm just a bad woman  I know
Nobody wants to be the one to walk away
Nobody wants to see
Nobody wants to know
Nobody wants to know the ways they don't love you right
They don't love you right
So when you hold me tightly all night
When you hold me tightly like that
I'm better alone than lonely here with you
So lonely here
I'm better alone than lonely here with you
So lonely here
I'm better alone than lonely
Nobody wants to bleed
Nobody wants to bleed but everybody hurts
Nobody wants to blame
Nobody wants the shame of knowing they're the ones that made it worse
What are we gonna do?
What are we gonna do when makin' love don't make it right?
It don't make it right

Before you tear it all apart
Just let me keep the last piece of my heart
Before you tear it all apart
You packed the bag
I guess that your mind is made up
You take a drag off of the cigarette
You said you're quitting now
Drive away fast
Lost myself to you
So let me keep the last piece of my heart
Before you tear it all apart

I'm down to get bruised
Who's gonna let go hardest?
We fight and we lose
Who's gonna love you hardest?
I'll do 'til I'm blue
We kiss better in darkness
We drown out the light
I don't know where we started
Where you became I
Don't want to end this party
I want to stay 'til it's blue

When I get there  have it nice and wet
Can't stay long  got a flight to catch
Great sex always ends with check
No feelings here  I don't care who's next
My tongue go from your ear to neck
If I don't call  don't get upset
Down play like a sinner jet
When I lie  feels right
Late night  call you in the late night
Trade love for one night
Two pills and a red wine
The words we don't say
No love when you hold me
And now the sun is up  I'm comin' down

We just blow it up  blow it out

Somebody else
I think you're out there with someone else

Go deep like Dylan
There's only one way out
It's burning bright like a fire from a comet
If there's a bomb in your heart I'll disarm it

I don't wanna wait another lifetime
Just to get a dose of the high life
It's burning bright like a fire from a comet
If you want it then I want it
