lyrics
"A thousand times a million doors to eternity
I may have lived a thousand lives  a thousand times
An endless turning stairway climbs
To a tower of souls
If it takes another thousand years  a thousand wars
The towers rise to numberless floors in space
I could shed another million tears  a million breaths
A million names but only one truth to face
A million roads  a million fears
A million suns  ten million years of uncertainty
I could speak a million lies  a million songs
A million rights  a million wrongs in this balance of time
But if there was a single truth  a single light
A single thought  a singular touch of grace
Then following this single point  this single flame
The single haunted memory of your face
I still love you
I still want you
A thousand times the mysteries unfold themselves
Like galaxies in my head
I may be numberless  I may be innocent
I may know many things  I may be ignorant
Or I could ride with kings and conquer many lands
Or win this world at cards and let it slip my hands
I could be cannon food  destroyed a thousand times
Reborn as fortune's child to judge another's crimes
Or wear this pilgrim's cloak  or be a common thief
I've kept this single faith  I have but one belief

I still love you
I still want you
A thousand times the mysteries unfold themselves
Like galaxies in my head
On and on the mysteries unwind themselves
Eternities still unsaid
Saw a city in the fog and an old church town where the seagulls play
Saw the sad shire horses walking home in the sodium light
Two priests on the ferry
October geese on a cold winter's night
All this time the river flowed
Endlessly to the sea
Two priests came 'round our house tonight
And fussing and flapping in priestly black like a murder of crows
All this time the river flowed
Endlessly to the sea
If I had my way
I'd take a boat from the river
And I'd bury the old man
I'd bury him at sea
Better to be poor than be a fat man in the eye of the needle
As these words were spoken I swear I hear the old man laughing
What good is a used up world and how could it be worth having?

Endlessly like a silent tear
All this time the river flowed
Teachers told the Romans built this place
They built a wall and a temple and an edge of the empire garrison town
They lived and they died
And their empire crumbles 'till all that was left
Were the stones the workmen found
All this time the river flowed
In the falling light of a Northern sun
And she was flattered by his charm
It wouldn't do her any harm they all had their chances
He sent her flowers and limousines
She was treated like a queen
Anything she ever wanted
It was no problem for a man like him
And everyone expected soon
That she could ask him for the moon
If she would wear his ring
Knowing glances from his friends
In the homes at the weekends of high society
But he didn't give a damn
He never felt more like a man
And all the time the clock was ticking
And all would envy the older man and his beautiful young wife
In a house upon a hill
She was there with time to kill
She lived a life she'd only dreamed
The life was never what it seemed
To all her friends that she'd ignored
She denied she was bored

That was ticking in the hall
Always reminded her
That life was going on as well
But she was happy and she would swear she wouldn't change a thing
And all would envy the older man and his beautiful young wife
Now it's 5 o'clock AM
She must have spent the night again with that old friend of hers
She loves to dance
She's missing more and more these days
But he's still stuck in his old ways
Perhaps she needs a little more romance
But the clock upon the wall is still ticking in the hall
Where a younger man would weep
He takes a pill and goes to sleep
Now who would envy the older man and his beautiful young wife
Who would envy?
It would be better to be cool
It's not time to be open just yet
A lesson once learned is so hard to forget
Be still my beating heart
Or I'll be taken for a fool
It's not healthy to run at this pace
The blood runs so red to my face
I've been to every single book I know
To soothe the thoughts that plague me so
I sink like a stone that's been thrown in the ocean
My logic has drowned in a sea of emotion
Stop before you start
Be still my beating heart
Still my beating heart
Still my beating heart
Still my beating heart
Restore my broken dreams
Shattered like a falling glass
I'm not ready to be broken just yet

Never to make promises that break

I sink like a stone that's been thrown in the ocean
My logic has drowned in a sea of emotion
Stop before you start
Be still my beating heart
Still my beating heart
Still my beating heart
Been hurt in some kind of love affair
And how many times do you swear that you'll never love again?
And why would you want to put yourself through all that again?
Love has a cruel and bitter way
Of paying you back for all the faith you ever had in your brain
How could it be that what you need the most
Can leave you feeling just like a ghost?
You never want to feel so sad and lost again
One day you could be looking
Through an old book in rainy weather
You see a picture of her smiling at you
When you were still together
You could be walking down the street
And who should you chance to meet
But that same old smile that you've been thinking of all day
We're starting up a brand new day
Turn the clock all the way back
I wonder if she'll take me back
I'm thinking in a brand new way
You'll never know how much I missed her

It could happen to you - just like it happened to me

Don’t wanna be no fuddy-duddy

Stand up all you lovers in the world
Stand up and be counted every boy and every girl
Stand up all you lovers in the world
Starting up a brand new day
You’re the crop to my rotation
You’re the sum of my equation
I’m the answer to your question
If you follow my suggestion
We can turn this ship around
We’ll go up instead of down
You’re the stair and I’m the handle
You’re the flame and I’m the candle
Stand up all you lovers in the world
Stand up and be counted every boy and every girl
Stand up all you lovers in the world
We're starting up a brand new day
It's a brand new day
It's a brand new day
Marching through countries they'd never seen
Virgins with rifles  a game of charades
All for a Children's Crusade
Pawns in the game are not victims of chance
Strewn on the fields of Belgium and France
Poppies for young men  death's bitter trade
All of those young lives betrayed
The children of England
Would never be slaves
They're trapped on the wire
And dying in waves
The flower of England
Face down in the mud
And stained in the blood
Of a whole generation
Corpulent generals safe behind lines
History's lessons drowned in red wine
Poppies for young men  death's bitter trade
All of those young lives betrayed
All for a Children's Crusade

How my poor heart aches with every step you take
Since you've gone I been lost without a trace
I dream at night I can only see your face
I look around but it's you I can't replace
I feel so cold and I long for your embrace

When we walked in fields of gold

Crumbling towers and beams of yellow light
The siege guns had been pounding all through the night
It took a day to build the city
We walked through its streets in the afternoon
As I returned across the fields I'd known
I recognized the walls that I'd once made
I had to stop in my tracks for fear
Of walking on the mines I'd laid
And if I built this fortress around your heart
Encircled you in trenches and barbed wire
Then let me build a bridge
For I cannot fill the chasm
And let me set the battlements on fire
Then I went off to fight some battle
That I'd invented inside my head
Away so long for years and years
You probably thought or even wished that I was dead
While the armies are all sleeping
Beneath the tattered flag we'd made

Drying in the color of the evening sun
Tomorrow's rain will wash the stains away
But something in our minds will always stay
Perhaps this final act was meant
To clinch a lifetime's argument
That nothing comes from violence and nothing ever could
For all those born beneath an angry star
Lest we forget how fragile we are
On and on the rain will fall
Like tears from a star like tears from a star
On and on the rain will say
How fragile we are how fragile we are

The geese are flying south  it sets me thinking
I did not miss you much  I did not suffer
What did not kill me just made me tougher
I feel the winter come  his icy sinews
Now in the firelight  the case continues
Another night in court  the same old trial
The same old questions asked  the same denial
The shadows close me round  like jury members
I look for answers in the fire's embers
Why was I missing then  that whole December?
I give my usual line: I don't remember
Another winter comes  his icy fingers creep
Into these bones of mine  these memories never sleep
And all these differences  a cloak I borrow
We kept our distances  why should it follow
That I must have loved you?
What is the force that binds the stars?
I wore this mask to hide my scars
What is the power that pulls the tide?
I never could find a place to hide
What moves the Earth around the sun?
What could I do but run and run and run?
Afraid to love  afraid to fail
A mast without a sail

The moon's a fingernail and slowly sinking
Another day begins and now I'm thinking
That this indifference was my invention
When everything I did sought your attention
You were my compass star  you were my measure
You were a pirate's map of buried treasure
If this was all correct  the last thing I'd expect
The prosecution rests  it's time that I confess:
I must have loved you
My room is 25 below
This cold man chasing ghosts
A road lies underneath the buried posts
Dogs search the under forest
We scour the empty streets
The fact remains until we find you
Our lives are incomplete
Do I hear laughter through a veil of snow and ice?
Where could you be on such a lonely winter's night?
I can't stop thinking about you
I can't stop wanting you this way
I can't face living without you
That's why I'm searching night and day
This heart's a lonely hunter
These hands are frozen fists
I can't stop thinking about you
I don't care if you exist

I borrowed Jeb's rifle and sat on the hill
I saw a lone rider crossing the plain
I drew a bead on him to practice my aim
My brother's rifle went off in my hand
A shot rang out across the land
I set off running to wake from the dream
And my brother's rifle went into the stream
I kept on running into the salt lands
The sheriff he asked me Why had I run
Then it came to me just what I had done

Explain to the courtroom what went through your mind

Early one morning with time to kill
I see the gallows up on the hill
And out in the distance a trick of the brain
I see a lone rider crossing the plain
He's come to fetch me to see what they done
We'll ride together til Kingdom come
I pray for God's mercy for soon I'll be dead
Who is it that stares back and greets him?
The ghost of his father long dead all these years?
Or the terrible sum of all of his fears
In the eyes of this stranger who meets him?
So his glance rarely strays from his chin or his jawline
To face up to the truth of his soul
It's the eyes he avoids so afraid to acknowledge
There are times when a man needs to brave his reflection
And face what he sees without fear
It takes a man to accept his mortality
Or be surprised by the presence of a tear
I forgot the first commandment of the realist's handbook

At the still point of destruction
At the center of the fury
There is a deeper wave than this
Rising in the land
There is a deeper wave than this
Nothing will withstand

Every leaf on every tree
Every sand dune in the desert

There is a deeper wave than this
Every ripple on the ocean
Every leaf on every tree
Every sand dune in the desert
Every breath you take with me
And though a million stars were shining
My heart was lost on a distant planet
That whirls around the April moon
Whirling in an arc of sadness
I'm lost without you
I'm lost without you
Though all my kingdoms turn to sand
And fall into the sea
I'm mad about you
I'm mad about you
And from the dark secluded valleys
I heard the ancient songs of sadness
But every step I thought of you
Every footstep only you
And every star a grain of sand
The leavings of a dried up ocean
How much longer?
They say a city in the desert lies
The vanity of an ancient king
But the city lies in broken pieces
Where the wind howls and the vultures sing
These are the works of man
This is the sum of our ambition
It would make a prison of my life
If you became another's wife
With every prison blown to dust
My enemies walk free
I'm mad about you
I'm mad about you

Felt more alone than I do now
Although I claim dominions over all I see
It means nothing to me
There are no victories
A stone's throw from Jerusalem
I walked a lonely mile in the moonlight

My heart was lost on a distant planet
That whirls around the April moon
Whirling in an arc of sadness
I'm lost without you
I'm lost without you

I'm mad about you
I see faces as they pass
Beneath the pale lamplight
I've no choice but to follow that call
And the moon and all
I pray everyday to be strong
For I know what I do must be wrong
Oh you'll never see my shade
Or hear the sound of my feet
While there's a moon over Bourbon Street
It was many years ago
That I became what I am
I was trapped in this life
Like an innocent lamb
Now I can never show my face at noon
And you'll only see me walking
By the light of the moon
The brim of my hat
Hides the eye of a beast
I've the face of a sinner
But the hands of a priest

She walks everyday through
The streets of New Orleans
She's innocent and young
From a family of means

Outside her window at night
To struggle with my instinct
In the pale moon light
How could I be this way
When I pray to god above
I must love what I destroy
And destroy the thing I love
Oh you'll never see my shade
Or hear the sound of my feet
When the stars assume their patterns
And the day has made his journey
And we wondered just what happened
To the life we knew before the world changed
When not a thing I held was true
But you were kind to me and you reminded me
That the world is not my playground
There are other things that matter
And when a simple needs protecting
My illusions all would shatter
But you stayed in my corner
The only world I know was upside down
You see the patterns in the big sky
Those constellations look like you and I
Just like the patterns in the big sky
We could be lost we could refuse to try
But we made it through in the dark night
Would those lucky guys turn out to be
But that unusual blend of my funny friend and me
I'm not as clever as I thought I was
I'm not the boy I used to be because
I always seemed so certain but I was really never sure
But you stayed and you called my name
When others would have walked out on a lousy game

Counting sheep in a Book of Numbers?

With you walking towards me from the river?

And it may be a trick of the firelight
But the flickering pages that trouble my sight
Is a book I'm afraid to write
And it's cut like a fruit on the blade of a knife
And it's all there to see as the section reveals
There's some sorrow in every life
Then I won't understand 'til the end of my days
I'm still forced to remember
Remember the words of my life
There are promises broken and promises kept
If I lose everything that I possess
There's a chapter on loss and a ghost who won't die
There's a chapter on love where the ink's never dry
There are sentences served in a prison I built out of lies
Though the pages are numbered
I can't see where they lead
For the end is a mystery no-one can read

So many thousand miles over land and sea

And though the walls of this prison are as cold as clay
But there's a shaft of light where I count my days
So don't despair of the empty chair
And somehow I'll be there
And days I'm so broken I can barely speak
There’s a place in my head where my thoughts still roam
Where somehow I've come home
And when the Winter comes and the trees lie bare
And you just stare out the window in the darkness there
Well I was always late for every meal you'll swear
But keep my place and the empty chair
And somehow I'll be there
I rise from my bed
Collect my thoughts together
I have to hold my head
It seems that she's gone
And somehow I am pinned by
The Hounds of Winter
Howling in the wind
I walk through the day
My coat around my ears
I look for my companion
I have to dry my tears
It seems that she's gone
Leaving me too soon
I'm as dark as December
I'm as cold as the Man in the Moon
I still see her face

Awoo
Comes to pay her respects  but her mind is awhirl
When she finds the tomb empty  the stone had been rolled
Not a sign of a corpse in the dark and the cold
When she reaches the door  sees an unholy sight
There's this solitary figure in a halo of light
He just carries on floating past Calvary Hill
In an almighty hurry  aye but she might catch him still
Tell me where are you going Lord  and why in such haste?
Now don't hinder me woman  I've no time to waste!
For they're launching a boat on the morrow at noon
And I have to be there before daybreak
Why else would the good Lord himself resurrect me?
For nothing will stop me  I have to prevail
Through the teeth of this tempest  in the mouth of a gale
May the angels protect me if all else should fail

From the wound a lovely flower grew
From somewhere deep inside

He won't care for you this way
He'll mistreat you if you stay
Come and live with me
We'll have children of our own
I would love you more than life
If you'll come and be my wife
Over the reefs of moonshine
Under the skies of fall
Under the Arctic fire
Over the seas of silence
Hauling on frozen ropes
For all my days remaining
But would north be true?
All colours bleed to red
Asleep on the ocean's bed
Drifting on empty seas
For all my days remaining
But would north be true?
Why should I?
Why should I cry for you?
Dark angels follow me
Over a godless sea
Mountains of endless falling
For all my days remaining
What would be true?

The stars seem to lose their place
Why must I think of you?
Why must I?
Why should I?
Why should I cry for you?
Why would you want me to?
And what would it mean to say
I loved you in my fashion?
What would be true?
Why should I?
Never ending or beginning on an ever-spinning reel
Like a snowball down a mountain or a carnival balloon
Like a carousel that's turning  running rings around the moon
Like a clock whose hands are sweeping past the minutes of its face
And the world is like an apple whirling silently in space
Like the circles that you find
In the windmills of your mind
Like a tunnel that you follow to a tunnel of it's own
Down a hollow to a cavern where the sun has never shone
Like a door that keeps revolving in a half-forgotten dream
Or the ripples from a pebble someone tosses in a stream
Like a clock whose hands are sweeping past the minutes on it's face
And the world is like an apple whirling silently in space
Like the circles that you find
In the windmills of your mind
Keys that jingle in your pocket  words that jangle in your head
Why does summer go so quickly? Was it something that you said?
Lovers walk along the shore and leave their footprints in the sand
Is the sound of distant drumming just the fingers of your hand?
Pictures hanging in a hallway and a fragment of this song
Half remembered names and faces but to whom do they belong?
When you knew that it was over were you suddenly aware
That the autumn leaves were turning to the color of her hair?

Like a circle in a spiral  like a wheel within a wheel
Never ending or beginning on an ever-spinning reel
As the images unwind

Half remembered names and faces but to whom do they belong?
