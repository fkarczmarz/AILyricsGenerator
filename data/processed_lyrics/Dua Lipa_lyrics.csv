lyrics
" make you cry again
 I'm sitting in the middle of all of you
 this is so intense
 that's nice
 we don't even think to cut it off
 it won't evеr feel like it's too much
 we don't even think to cut it off
 right?
Me and you together  like a loved up bruise
I'll make you an offer that you can't refuse
Baby  you're okay
Baby  you're okay
You've seen that we got the same pain  same scar
Felt that when we got closer in the dark
Baby  I'm okay
Baby  I'm okay
Baby  when
When you're far away  I promise you I'll be good
I guess we're misunderstood
'Cause I've heard things 'bout you too
Makes me know that I'm for you
I don't give a damn  just as long as you care
You don't need to ask 'cause I'm already there
Let's be bad together  if only for a while
Let's be bad together  make the devil smile

Nothing could stop us  we got it all
We mess up  but run from the scene
But I throw my hands up  if you know what I mean
Ah  'cause I'm not afraid to tell you when you're wrong
And I know that you miss me when I'm gone
We make a great team
With you  I'm badder than I've ever been
Baby  when
When you're far away  I promise you I'll be good
I guess we're misunderstood
'Cause I've heard things 'bout you too
Makes me know that I'm for you
I don't give a damn  just as long as you care
You don't need to ask 'cause I'm already there
Let's be bad together  if only for a while
Let's be bad together  make the devil smile
Let's be bad  babe
Let's be bad
Let's be bad  babe
Let's be bad
Let's be bad  babe
Let's be bad
Let's be bad  babe
I don't give a damn  just as long as you care
You don't need to ask 'cause I'm already there
Let's be bad together  if only for a while
Let's be bad together  make the devil smile
We rode on horses made of sticks
He wore black and I wore white
He would always win the fight
Bang bang
He shot me down
Bang bang
I hit the ground
Bang bang
That awful sound
Bang bang
My baby shot me down
Seasons came and changed the time
When I grew up  I called him mine
He would always laugh and say
Remember when we used to play
Bang bang
I shot you down
Bang bang
You hit the ground
Bang bang
That awful sound
Bang bang
I used to shoot you down

Music played and people sang
Just for me the church bells rang
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Now he's gone  I don't know why
And 'til this day  I sometimes cry
He didn't even say goodbye
He didn't take the time to lie
Bang bang
He shot me down
Bang bang
I hit the ground
Bang bang
That awful sound
Bang bang
My baby shot me down
Oh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

Oohh-oh-oh

Shot me down
Oh  when you're looking at the sun
I'm not a fool  I'm not a fool  not a fool
No  you're not fooling anyone
Oh  but when you're gone
When you're gone  when you're gone
Oh baby  all the lights go out
I was wrong  I was wrong
Come back to me  baby  we can work this out
Oh baby  come on  let me get to know you
Just another chance so that I can show
That I won't let you down and run
No  I won't let you down and run
'Cause I could be the one
I could be the one
I could be the one
I could be the one
I see in blue  I see in blue  I see in blue
Oh  when you see everything in red
There is nothing that I wouldn't do for you
Do for you  do for you

And put your keys between your knuckles when there's boys around
Isn't it funny how we laugh it off to hide our fear
When there's nothing funny here? (Ah)
We smile away to ease the tension so it don't go south
But there's nothing funny now (Ah)
When will we stop saying things
'Cause they're all listening?

Had to love and lose a hundred million times
Had to get it wrong to know just what I like
Now I'm falling
You say my name like I have never heard before
I hope I'm not the only one that feels it all
Are you falling?
Centre of attention
You know you can get whatever you want from me
It's you in my reflection
I'm afraid of all the things it could do to me
I would've stayed at home
'Cause I was doing better alone
I knew that was the end of it all
I should've stayed at home
'Cause now there ain't no letting you go

Makes me an optimist  I guess

Hopelessly romantic
Then you said  Hey  and I said  Hey
What's your name?
Come with me
'Cause when I see your face (Ah)
The sweetest pleasure
I feel like we're gonna be together
This could be the end of an era

I just can't relate to the words of this love song
What's it gonna take to right all the wrongs?
Everybody's still dancin'
Everybody's holdin' hands and romancin'
Someone's gotta be the last one standin'
And I hate that I'm leaving you stranded
But I gotta hit the road
But I gotta hit the road
It's not a broken heart if I don't break it
Goodbye doesn't hurt if I don't say it
And I really hope you'll understand it
Only way to go is a French exit
French exit

Now we know what's deep inside
Remember when we ran in the open?
Now we know what's in the wild
Used to think that this love was Heaven sent
How did we get lost? Can't get back again
So are we leaving this Garden of Eden?
Are we leaving this Garden of Eden?
Used to walk around your apartment
Nothing but a smile on me
But tonight I'm so self conscious
Isn't it so clear to see?
Nothing's ever perfect in Paradise
Don't know what it's worth 'til you pay the price
When you bite your tongue does it draw blood?
So are we leaving this Garden of Eden?

I've been done
I've been movin' on since we said goodbye
I cut you off
I don't need your love
So you can try all you want
'Cause if you think I care about you now
I remember that weekend
When my best friend caught you creepin'
You blamed it all on the alcohol
Play the victim and switch your position

This won't be a burden if we both don't hold a grudge
I think it's pretty plain and simple  we gave it all we could
It's time I wave goodbye from the window
Let's end this like we should and say we're good
We're not meant to be  like sleeping and cocaine
So let's at least agree to go our separate ways
Not gonna judge you when you're with somebody else
As long as you swear you won't be pissed when I do it myself
Let's end it like we should and say we're good

Now you're holding this against me like I knew you would
I'm trying my best to make this easy
So don't give me that look  just say we're good
We're not meant to be  like sleeping and cocaine
(Like sleeping and cocaine)
So let's at least agree to go our separate ways
(To go our separate ways  oh)
Not gonna judge you when you're with somebody else
As long as you swear you won't be pissed when I do it myself
Ooh  na-na-na-na
After midnight
Me and my thoughts alone
There's a part of me that wants to steal your heart
And a part that tells me  Don't
'Cause I'm no good at givin' up control
Are you worried that I might find somethin' wrong?
'Cause I'm worried that I won't
But if control is my religion
Then I'm headin' for collision
Lost my 20/20 vision
Please
Whatcha doin' to me  baby?
I'm scared to death that you might be the one to change me
You're in my head and now you're cloudin' my decisions
Got me headin' for collision
Whatcha doin' to me  baby?
Oh  whatcha doin'?

In the future
I see you next to me
But I can't shake the feelin' that there's more to learn
In the time between
But if control is my religion
Then I'm headin' for collision
Lost my 20/20 vision
Please
Whatcha doin' to me  baby?
I'm scared to death that you might be the one to change me
You're in my head and now you're cloudin' my decisions
Got me headin' for collision
Whatcha doin' to me  baby?
Oh  whatcha doin' to me?
Ooh  na-na-na
Tell me what you're doin' to me
Ooh  na-na-na-na
Tell me what you're doin' to me
Ooh  na-na-na
Tell me what you're doin' to me
Ooh  na-na-na-na
If control is my religion
Then I'm headin' for collision
Lost my 20/20 vision
Please (Tell me what you're doin' to me)
If control is my religion
Then I'm headin' for collision
Lost my 20/20 vision
Please
Whatcha doin' to me  baby?
I'm scared to death that you might be the one to change me
You're in my head and now you're cloudin' my decisions
Got me headin' for collision
Whatcha doin' to me  baby?
Oh  whatcha doin' to me?
Ooh  na-na-na
Tell me what you're doin' to me
Ooh  na-na-na-na
Tell me what you're doin' to me
Ooh  na-na-na
Tell me what you're doin' to me
Ooh  na-na-na-na"
