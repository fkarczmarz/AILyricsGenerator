"All that I'm dying for
All that I can't ignore alone at night
I can feel the night beginning
Separate me from the living
Understanding me after all I've seen
Piecing every thought together
Find the words to make me better
If I only knew how to pull myself apart
All that I'm living for
All that I'm dying for
All that I can't ignore alone at night
All that I'm wanted for
Although I wanted more
I believe that dreams are sacred
Take my darkest fears and play them
Like a play of my obsessions
Make me understand the lesson
So I'll find myself
So I won't be lost again

All that I'm living for
All that I'm dying for
All that I can't ignore alone at night
All that I'm wanted for
Although I wanted more
Guess I thought I'd have to change the world to make you see me
To be the one
I could have run forever
But how far would I have come
Without mourning your love?
All that I'm living for
All that I'm dying for
All that I can't ignore alone at night
All that I'm wanted for
Although I wanted more
Should it hurt to love you?
Should I feel like I do?
Should I lock the last open door?
You will always be there
You will always be there
Part 2: The Turn
Where do we go now
That I have seen the turn?
Where do we go now?
Find a way to go back
To go back home
Don't get caught up in pretend 'cause you're not in control
Just hating and waiting and saving up
I'll do you a favor and save you if you sign on the line
Don't worry your pretty little head about the future  it's all fine
Keeping my head down
'Cause they don't know what I know now
As empires fall to pieces
Our ashes twisting in the air
It makes me smile to know that
I'm better without you
Now look around and remember your friends if you can
Feeding the flames 'til there's no one to blame  it's on your hands
And there's no way out
'Cause we all know you're hollow

As empires fall to pieces
Our ashes twisting in the air
It makes me smile to know that
I'm better without you
Not enough  not enough
Not enough to throw it all away
We'd still be falling
We're fallen
Turn it up  turn it up
Never gonna shut me up again
Your time is over
It's over now
As empires fall to pieces
Our ashes twisting in the air
It makes me smile to know that
I can't remember why I believe in us
Love begins with trust
But we can't be trusted
That our fathers were wrong?
We hold the key to redemption
Let icons fall
Dare to break away
Tear down this broken machine
Escape your cage
We're falling to pieces
That our fathers were wrong?
We hold the key to redemption
Let icons fall

Push through the pain
Unbreak this system
Arms of self-sacrifice
Lay them down
That our fathers were wrong?
We hold the key to redemption
Love over all
We hold the key to redemption
That I've come to believe my soul's on the other side
Too sharp to put back together
Too small to matter
But big enough to cut me into so many little pieces
If I try to touch her
And I bleed
I bleed
And I breathe
I breathe no more
Take a breath and I try to draw from my spirit's well
Yet again you refuse to drink like a stubborn child
And all of this will make sense when I get better
But I know the difference
Between myself and my reflection
I just can't help but to wonder
Which of us do you love?
So I bleed
I bleed
And I breathe
And I breathe
 into my core
 without a soul
 without your touch
 darling
Like open doors?
Leading you down into my core
Where I've become so numb
Without a soul (Soul)
My spirit's sleeping somewhere cold
Until you find it there and lead it back home
Wake me up
Wake me up inside
I can't wake up
Wake me up inside
Save me
Call my name and save me from the dark
Wake me up
Bid my blood to run
I can't wake up
Before I come undone
Save me
Save me from the nothing I've become
Now that I know what I'm without
Breathe into me and make me real (Make me real)
Bring (Bring) me (Me) to life

Don't lie to me
Just get your things
If you want to go  let go

If I fall
And all is lost
No light to lead the way
(Never thought that it would end up this way)

Is where I belong

Save my life  change my mind
If I fall
And all is lost
No light to lead the way

Remember that all alone
Brushed off the face
Felt your light

I found a bird
Closing her eyes
One last time
And I wonder if she dreamed like me
As much as it hurts
Ain’t it wonderful to feel?
So go on and break your wings
Follow your heart 'til it bleeds
As we run towards the end of the dream
I’m not afraid
I pushed through the pain
And I’m on fire

High or Low
You never fell beneath me
And I gave up on you
But I never forgot you

You're just like me
Don't scream anymore  my love
'Cause all I want is you
Wake up in a dream
Frozen fear
All your hands on me
I can't scream  I can't scream

I can't escape the twisted way you think of me
I feel you in my dreams  and I don't sleep (ever and ever)
(Ever and ever) I don't sleep
Say you belong to me
My snow white queen
There's nowhere to run
So let's just get it over
Soon  I know you'll see
You're just like me
Don't scream anymore  my love
'Cause all I want is you
I can't save your life
Though nothing I bleed for is more tormenting
I'm losing my mind
And you just stand there and stare as my world divides
You belong to me
My snow white queen
There's nowhere to run
So let's just get it over
Soon  I know you'll see
You're just like me
Don't scream anymore  my love
'Cause all I want is you
All I want is you
All I want is you
All I want is you (Ever and ever)
But it's so clear
Now that I'm unchained
Fear is only in our minds
Taking over all the time
Fear is only in our minds
But it's taking over all the time  oh
You poor sweet innocent thing
Dry your eyes and testify
You know you live to break me
Don't deny
Sweet sacrifice
One day  I'm gonna forget your name
And one sweet day  you're gonna drown in my lost pain
Fear is only in our minds
Taking over all the time
Fear is only in our minds
But it's taking over all the time

You poor sweet innocent thing
Dry your eyes and testify
And oh  you love to hate me
Don't you  honey?
I'm your sacrifice
I dream in darkness
I sleep to die
Erase the silence
Erase my life
Do you wonder why you hate?
Our burning ashes
Blacken the day
Are you still too weak to survive your mistakes?
A world of nothingness
Blow me away
You poor sweet innocent thing
Dry your eyes and testify
You know you live to break me
Don't deny
I can see the lie you're dreaming I'll believe
'Cause that's not your name
Oh you better take cover
('Cause I'm on my way now)
I'm coming back to take your world down
'Cause I never lost my crown
Slave to your insecurity
That's what drove you down in the first place
But you haven't learned a thing
Caught in your thick web of lies
Gonna be the bitch you make me out to be
Oh you better take cover
(Nothing you can say now)
You underestimated my wrath
I'm gonna give the love back

You dug your grave so come on inside and rest in peace
Take cover
(Cause I'm on my way now)
I'm gonna have to take you all down
I lie awake and try so hard not to think of you
But who can decide what they dream?
And dream I do
I believe in you
I'll give up everything just to find you
You're taking over me
Have you forgotten all I know and all we had?
You saw me mourning my love for you
And touched my hand
I knew you loved me then

I'm not alright  but I'm not gonna lie
I don't know that I ever was
Held it in as I played by your rules
I've been biting my lip  but I'm losing my grip
When all the hate burns off
I'm left here with the pain
Behind our vain devices
Are we all the same?
Change me into something I believe in
Change me so I don't have to pretend
Take a breath and try to play along
But I'm a terrible liar
I feel the world like a brick on my chest
And the party's just begun
Throw the rope  I'm wading through the mud
From your mouth flow a thousand truths
But you know
There's only one

Just get through this day
Give up your way
You could be anything
Give up my way
And lose myself?
Not today
That's too much guilt to pay
Sickened in the sun

Without your senseless hate
And hate me if it feels good
I can't hear your screams anymore
You lied to me
But I'm older now
And I'm not buyin' baby
Demanding my response
Don't bother breaking the door down
I've found my way out
In a tuna afternoon
You know you're not the only one
When they all come crashing down
Midflight
You know you're not the only one
A back door out of life
