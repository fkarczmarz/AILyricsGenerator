lyrics
"Unexpected but I'm worth it
I could see you watching let me take it there
Girl let me put you on with something real
So come join me in this room girl it's time
I start off slow so you feel secure
Just let me know where you feel it more
We could smoke one first if you tryna get lit
My weed on ten come take a hit
Girl let me put you on with something real
So come join me in this room girl it's time

Your silence is a curse
My swollen heart you curve
Your comfort makes it worse
'Cause how is the man of my dreams
Not a man of his words?
And how is the man for me
Just a man that makes me hurt?
It's time to take my own
Need me to take my own
I almost crashed and fell right from the sky
And now I’m left with pain to get me high

It's time to take my own

They grew legs and walked themselves down the road
Boundaries is my middle name
I give respect where it's asked or it's shown
Something 'bout our exchange
These are your skies
But then there was the blood from your heart on my hands again
Though I swore I washed it off in the waves
Oh I'd follow you into yesterday
Then miles away
And I pray for the love that we had underneath
When we both promised not to waste love arguing
I love you more than I ever could say

And something about our exchange
And I never want to complain
Love you with your wings babe
And there was the blood from your heart on my hands again
Though I swore I washed it out in the rain
That I don't know how to stay away
And don't say you don't want no problems
Can't hear through what I say
Say you want it your way
Always has been your way when it comes to me
We can't seem to hold space
No way
The blood from your heart on my hands again
Though I swore I washed it off in the waves
Crazy how I feel the most warm when it's cold
Drops hit the window and I drop down to the floor
I assume this is when I would miss you the most
I'm lying down
I've got this notepad where you laid your head
We use to go round and round
Making love in my bed
We were in so deep
We could barely tread
But now I found a way to heal myself instead
And damn I feel alive
It's like something has to die
To help you realize—damn I feel alive
We were in a weird place
Crazy how a person you love could just change
Now I am learning to realize we needed our space
Now just look at the way
I'm moving on and you stuck in the past
I deserve a love that is gonna last
But until then I will just raise this glass

When I might need a quick break from being the leader
We're all just here to learn and everyday we are put up to bat
Someone told me
Hold your breath and take it slow
But I’ll resurface all on my own
Just go with the tide
I'll be doing fine
Just go with the tide
I always have those days when I feel unworthy
When I sit back and ask God why he chose me
And if you feeling all confused
No you are not on your own

And I don't want what's on my head
But baby girl don't be misled (Yeah  yeah)
Young woman reading magazines
Thinking to herself  nobody looks like me
Oh I've got all these curves  all this nerve
Why can't I keep a man?
But baby girl if you love yourself you can
Can't nobody love somebody
That do not love themselves
You are what you choose to be
It's not up to no one else
So be great  be kind
Don't let them dim your light
A woman like the sun should always stay bright
Little boy sitting in the bleachers
Staring at  at his dirty sneakers
Thinking my shoes don't shine
Money is tight  I would never get a date
But baby boy that's not what it takes
Young man  always at the center
Finding ways to make his arms look bigger
Saying  You see those guys?
They get all the girls  I just want to be like them

Whether that's down to even what we put in our bodies

Put the pussy away for you
Thinkin' I would wait for you

You know they don't wanna see us together
Anytime you're under the weather
Babe  we can always go
If I gotta pull up on you  on the east side
In the late night  in a disguise
You know I could pull up on you  keep you all night
We could stay right  on the safe side
One way or another  I'ma love you
Slidin' under covers  undercover
They don't wanna see it happen—but we say  Fuck it

'Cause they ain't happy  no—they don't got you
Somethin' 'bout the way we be acting
Babe  we are magical
Might just have to hit me up  on the late night
When it's game time  I don't play nice
I need you to hit me up  on my fake line

And not lettin' them see me sweat
But it's certain shit I can't forget
I am making amends with myself
Forgiving me for loving you
And the immature me wishes that I could make it known
That you should be left alone
Don't deserve words or thoughts from me
I can go heal on my own
A facade only gets you so far
I'd say your name but you don't deserve recognition
You played the hero but you really are the villain
There ain't a bone in me that wants to spare your feelin's
It's fuckin' crazy what they do for recognition
I'd say your name but you don't deserve recognition

I got to give myself credit for loving as hard as I did
I helped you fight your addiction and change your whole life
Just to find myself played in the end
Ain't no regrets cause I'm proud that my heart was so pure
And I'm never ashamed of my love
Now I'm finding strength in the fact that you're nothing to me
And I know the things I am above
To somewhere I still feel sane
'Cause truth is I've been fuckin' lost since that very day
I'd say your name but you don't deserve recognition (Nah)
You played the hero but you really are the villain
There ain't a bone in me that wants to spare your feelings (Ah)
Used me for status and the fame and recognition (Ah)
It's fucking crazy what they do for recognition (Ooh)
I'd say your name but you don't deserve recognition
That's just you (Deserve recognition)
I always land on my feet
Wish I didn't check your text when you was drunk 'sleep
I've seen everything that I ain't wanna see
Hope you fuck around and have the son you wanted with the bitch
I ain’t find out sooner that you was unfaithful
So fucking shameful
You make a choice to stay down or go and
Find something to bring you back
Found my lows and made them high
Saw my storm and cleared my skies
I don't think I can deny
He makes me feel wanted
Like no one has before
He don't want nothing from me
But to know my love's for sure
Hate to be you watching him love me
I'd hate to be you watching him touch me
Now I am blessed to have what I need
When I loved you I didn't love me
You were this dark cloud hanging above me
I'm doing better
Oh I could not ask for more

 Good morning
 we ain't spoken
 always go through this
 over your liquor?
 I deserve bigger
 but is it all worth the wait?
 I got trauma
 I hate drama
 I'm in shock
 and that don't stop

 still wanna be your co-captain
 I got trauma
 I'm in shock
 and that don't stop (Oh no)
 all this drama
 that shit don't stop

 no
 no
I'm seeing right past you  but you seem well aware
Your body is here but your mind is somewhere else
So far gone and you think I can't tell
Can't tell that you are disconnected
You pulled away and I miss your presence
I always said to you
Baby you should be here  right here
Baby you should be here  right here
Don't know where you went but you're lost now
Don't know where you went but you're gone now
Don't know where you went but you're lost now
Don't know where you went but you're gone now
Head on your chest babe  but your heart is so quiet
We use to talk all night long  now we laying in silence
Your arms around me but your soul is somewhere else
Gone so long and I know you so well
I know that you are everything that I ever dreamed of
And hoped that love had a happy ending
Baby you should be here  right here
Baby you should be here  right here
Don't know where you went but you're lost now
Don't know where you went but you're gone now
Don't know where you went but you're lost now
Don't know where you went but you're gone now"
