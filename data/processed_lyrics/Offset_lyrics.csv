lyrics
"Woo  woo  let's go
Panoramic  bitch  I can see right through it (See it)
Smokin' on cookie  it's gas  manure (Woah)
Damn  threw fifty racks in a lure (Damn)
Know we gon' run with the pack like a wolf (Go)
Thug Life on me like I'm Tupac Shakur (Thug)
Thirty-five K for the seats on the floor (Racks)
Yes  I'm the wave  but don't got a shore (Ha)
Starin' at me  but I don't want the whore (No)
Skrrt  almost had crashed the 'Rari (Skrrt)
Jump off the top of the rope like Jeff Hardy (Go)
Niggas be broke and be ready to party
Nike Mags on  man  I'm feelin' like Marty (Woo)
'Scuse me  bitch  don't you be walkin'? ('Scuse me)
Don't got no money  so you shouldn't be talkin'
DM'ing me  bitch  you know I ain't talkin' (Hah)
My bitch find out  she gon' kill 'em  white chalk 'em (Uh)
Shh  it's a dead man (Dead man)
Rocks on my neck like the Flintstone  I'm Bam Bam
Ran up them M's and I bought me the Lamb' Lamb'
She on my dick  want a pic  she a fan-fan
Postin' these racks but I know it's a scam (Scam)
Don't cuff a bitch  I'm not selfish  I share 'em (Share 'em)
Elliot pink diamonds lookin' like Cam (Pink)
He actin' tough but he sweeter than yams (Sweet)
Two bitches in a Rolls Ghost and it scare 'em (Two)
I collect shoes and I don't even wear 'em (Nah)
Twenty-five million  I get overwhelmed
Hello (Hello?)
I want that kitty  I like bitches thick with them lil' bitty titties
I like bitches rich and they know how to get it (Go)
Come from the dark  my wrist and neck is litted (Ice)
Never quit it
You niggas was hatin'  wait in line  I'm shittin' (Wait)
You niggas was hatin'  wait in line  I'm shittin'
You niggas was hatin'  wait in line  I'm shittin' (Let's go)
Ew  that's nasty  bitch can't catch me (Catch me)
I'm in the Lambo'  this bitch nasty
This a wide body and the rims look ashy (Woo)
How did this happen? Rich nigga habit (Rich)
Niggas ain't eatin' and they blame it on fastin' (Hey)
Fresh to death like I jumped out a casket (Casket)
Before the COVID-19  we was maskin' (Get 'em)
When I say spin it  that mean I'ma shoot (Bah)
Hop out the Maybach and Prada my boot (Prada)
Thirty mill' plus and I don't wear a suit (Plus)
Bust like a gusher  you play with my group (Bust)
Singin' like Usher  this chopper a fool
Hustler customers  do it for you
This nigga broke  you snooze  you lose (Lose)
Louis V coat pocket filled with blues (Blues)
Takeoff  touch my brother  pull a gun  baow

It's noisy off the set path
How can I make choices I've yet to discover we have?
Must need rehab
If you think you know me from the facets they show these folks to get money  I gotta laugh
How funny it is you don't realize the skill lies in knowing within the truth there's still lies
It's called being civilized
But not to trivialize your belief in the semi-fictionalized
I am who you see
What you hear is part of me
But there's so much more to me
So much more to be than just alive
But still can go even farther
Wish and will  can go harder
In that time  I went the hardest
More than this generic term artist
A reality smith  you love my craftsmanship
Because I craft some shit to make my people proud
And so I speak aloud  but not loud enough yet
Or as loud as I can get
They think I ain't a threat
But all preconceived notions  I've arrived

And I'll always be there  I will always be there

Putting in work had to snatch up a purse
Distracted by bitches you stare when they flirt
You pussy boy put on a skirt you a nurse
Pussy niggas shouldn't of been on this earth
Eve bit the apple that was a curse
Ski mask in the bushes I lurk
Look at the diamonds in my watch

Yeah
You already know
Worrying about how you look to other folks  never end up good
Born with the gift to lift you up to new heights  can't settle for just hood
Gotta have the best kicks  best cars and jewelry  the best chicks
Half of the things we do is 'cause of what other folks think about this shit
My rims spin  they don't spin
My fade blend  it don't blend
Wear Nikes with Adidas  I smoke the best reefers
Disrespect get you chin checked  hoes love committing sins for me
With me  you bout' to witness a living legend make history
Intentionally  been letting shit down since before the turn of the century
Bells will be ringin' loud as a motherfucka if ever you mention me
I give you what you need  cause' what you want I give no fucks about
Still the best  still command respect  so really fuck some clout"
