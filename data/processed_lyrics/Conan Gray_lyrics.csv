"Let's hang out every weekend
We're driving every night
Stare at people that we like
Could you be my best friend?
I'll tell you all my secrets
I'll tell you all the times
That I wished that I could die
And if anybody fucks with you
They fuck with me
I'll knock their teeth out (Yeah)
Could you be my best friend?
Can we be friends?
Could you be my best friend?
Every once in a million seconds on a broken clock
Yet we talk like we're living
All alone in a coffee shop
I can't help but imagine what maybe could've happened
If you weren't just an online love
And daddy's got a new mansion to keep
He never really calls back
'Cause he's got too many finances to reap
When you get what you need
All these kids have got affluenza
But a diamond cheers you right up
Give me none of your affluenza
Every day's your birthday
You threw a party but you kinda hate all your friends
So you're cryin' in a driveway

Mhmm
Mhmm
 and your lips were torn
 dear
 how the hell do you think I feel?
 maybe you'd love me
 don't leave me hangin' alone again
 don't leave me hangin' alone again
We joked as we looked that they were too good for us
'Cause socially speaking  we were the same
With runaway fathers and mothers who drank
A tale old as time  young love don't last for life
And now I know  now I know
It's time to go  it's time to go
We've traveled the seas  we've ridden the stars
We've seen everything from Saturn to Mars
As much as it seems like you own my heart
It's astronomy  we're two worlds apart
(It's astronomy) We're two worlds apart
(It's astronomy) We're two worlds apart
From far away  I wish I'd stayed with you
I thought if I wandered  I'd fall back in love
You said distance brings fondness  but guess not with us
The only mistake that we didn't make was run
(Now look what we've done)

Stop tryna keep us alive
You're pointing at stars in the sky
That already died
Stop tryna keep us alive
You can't force the stars to align
When they've already died
We've seen everything from Saturn to Mars
As much as it seems like you own my heart
 I'm glad you've finally gotten over them
 I swear that bitch was such a narcissist
 I always tell
 that's my fucking right hand
 but still love them
 best friend

 you're my

 just as sick inside the head

She talks and talks of how the rich are wrong
They cheat on wives  never pay the price

Callin' me drunk when it's too late at night
Telling me truths that you know all are lies
You think you're super sly
Flirtin' with them but telling me you're mine
Now I'm gonna ruin your life
'Cause I've gotten tired of the games that you play
When you tell me you love me then you throw me away
So cry me a river 'til you drown in the lake
'Cause you may think you're winning but checkmate
Yeah  you may think you're winning but checkmate
Now this is getting fun
I saw you kissing someone else's tongue
You said that I'm the only one you love
Baby  this is getting fun
I'll let you think you won
Date in the park  I'll play it super dumb
Holding your hand  but in the other one
I'm holding a loaded gun

But I'ma keep a smile on my shoulders 'til I'm sweaty
Beggin' on my knees
But by the time they're there
I've already hid the body
My breath's gettin' short and I'm unsteady
Wellin' up in tears as I lay upon your belly
But you say through a sigh
That I said that lie already
I just needed company now

Just company now

I'd just left the party at Blake's and it's Halloween
I left a text you won't read all night long
This could be a disaster
And then we're losin' it all at the critical chapter
This could be a disaster

This could be a disaster

I'm walking to your corner I see you in the street
You’re here  you're haunting me
The Eye of the Night
I always feel like I am not alone
While I am walking down these empty roads
I always feel like I am not alone
I hear a voice that tells me where to go
'Cause you're here  you're watching me
I'm walking to your corner I see you in the street
You're here  you're haunting mе

I grab thе keys  I scramble to the door
And I  I hear your heartbeat bleeding through the floor
The memories that I cannot ignore
Fight for my life inside a silent war

You're here  you’re watching me

You're here  you're haunting me
Through another ghost town on a Saturday night
Don't you get yourself down  not the end of your life
Don't mean that you're marrying me tonight  tonight
And you said  You got it? We're nothing
I'm the worst if you want it
When your heart aches and it's dead in the night
Don't you worry for me  it's cool
It's enough to survive
Don't you worry  I want your fainted love
That's enough  fainted love
Darkroom  not a whispering word
Guess you take all the pain that you think you deserve
Won't sleep 'cause it's easy to hurt tonight  tonight

He just took a walk around the block
'Til all his anger took a hold of him
And then he'd hit
My mother never cried a lot
So she did
But I truly am my parents' child
Scattered 'cross my family line
I'm so good at telling lies
That came from my mother's side
Told a million to survive
Scattered 'cross my family line
But my sister's when I cry
From my family line
It's hard to put it into words
How the holidays will always hurt
I watch the fathers with their little girls
And wonder what I did to deserve this
How could you hurt a little kid?

You don't really look at me the way you used to
And I'm hoping it ain't true
Every single rumor that I've heard of you
Say you were off with someone that I don't know
Callin' other people on your telephone
Kinda wish I didn't know
Than have to cry in front of you
Than tell you I'm in love with you
My eyes are welling up
As you admit there's someone new
You tell me it ain't what it seems
There's clothes thrown on the balcony
And you smell like perfume out a magazine
I'm throwing all your shit outta my window
Telling you I wish that we had never spoke

 Sober up
 could that maybe help?
But I guess that you could argue we survived
And after all this time  I wonder why you're still with me
Well  at least in all my memories
I ain't sorry
I wouldn't change a thing
But it'll take a lifetime to get better
I ain't sorry
Though I should probably be
I think I'm gonna love you  you're forever with me
You're forever
You are the reason I learned to love
Also  the reason that I cry
Still  I think of all the bloodshed  somehow bittersweet
I'm even smiling now as I sing

I was off keying cars parked on radium lawns
By suburbian moms
I called a friend  Let's meet at ten
Go wherever we want
'Cause no one cares that we're gone
This town don't got much to do
And you and I haven't got much to lose
So do you wanna rot in your room like we always do?
Talk about how fast we grew
And all the big dreams that we won't pursue
Then get in your car and laugh 'til we both turn blue
'Cause we are the helpless  selfish  one of a kind
Millennium kids  that all wanna die
Walking in the street with no light inside our eyes
We are the worthless  cursed with too much time
We get into trouble and lose our minds

There's nothin' you could do to dampen up my mood
There's nothin' you could say  won't like you anyways

Then why don't you go get your gun?
'Cause you don't really hate me (You're a little baby)

I never thought that everything I had would fade away
When we were younger
We didn't know how it would be

Why did we ever have to leave?

Tears of honeysuckle welling up in your eyes
And they both are left unsatisfied
And lovesick girls will always listen
But what you fail to see is there's plenty of us
So keep your petals pointing towards the sun
You watch as he walks through the fields
Crushing pretty daisies under his heavy heels
You notice that the flower is you

And I know that he has the charm
To sweep you off your feet and wrap you around his arm
But he hurts you like crazy
But you are so much better than you know that you are
Cause lovesick boys will write you love songs
And lovesick girls will always listen
But what you fail to see is there's plenty of us
So keep your petals pointing towards the sun

It's been a couple months
That's just about enough time
For me to stop crying when I look at all the pictures
Now I kinda smile  I haven't felt that in a while
It's late  I hear the doorbell ringin' and it's pourin'
I open up that door  see your brown eyes at the entrance
You just wanna talk  and I can't turn away a wet dog
Please  don't make it harder than it already is
I'm trying to get over this
I wish that you would stay in my memories
But you show up today  just to ruin things
I wanna put you in the past 'cause I'm traumatized
But you're not lettin' me do that  'cause tonight
You're all drunk in my kitchen  curled in the fetal position
Too busy playing the victim to be listening to me when I say
I wish that you would stay in my memories

Now I can't say Goodbye if you stay here the whole night
You see  it's hard to find an end to somethin'
That you keep beginning over and over again
I promise that the ending always stays the same
So  there's no good reason in make believin'
That we could ever exist again
I can't be your friend  can't be your lover
Can't be the reason we hold back each other from falling in love
With somebody other than me
I wish that you would stay in my memories
But you show up today  just to ruin things
I wanna put you in the past 'cause I'm traumatized
But you're not lettin' me do that  'cause tonight
You're all drunk in my kitchen  curled in the fetal position
Too busy playing the victim to be listening to me when I say
I wish that you would stay in my memories
In my memories  stay in my memories
Since you came
I guess I'll let you stay
For as long as it takes
To grab your books and your coat
And that one good cologne
That you bought when we were fighting
'Cause it's still on my clothes  everything that I own
And it makes me feel like dying
I was barely just surviving
I wish that you would stay in my memories
But you show up today  just to ruin things
I wanna put you in the past 'cause I'm traumatized
But you're not lettin' me do that  'cause tonight

Too busy playing the victim to be listening to me when I say

Is it wrong to now decide?
Ah
Now you know I'm a wicked man
I bit the hand that was feedin' me
It's snappin' back like a rubber band
The fear of love is my tendency
I never meant to break your heart
But I lost it (I lost it) like a promise (A promise)
And left you dancin' in the dark
I don't know why
I'll be gone because you love me

I want a love like the movies
I look at you like you're perfect for me
If you are the diamond  then I am the ring
All of our friends think of us jealously
We’re so sweet  so sweet
Built us a world and I gave you the key
Still can't believe that this isn't a dream
Falling in love with a damn fantasy
That’s so me  so me
But I've been livin'
Life in fiction
In my head  we're dancing in the dark
In my head  we kiss under the stars
But we know that's not what we're doing

'Cause Monday through Friday  we both barely spoke
They don’t know  they can't know
That just on the drive here  I was looking through your texts
I was screaming my damn head off  how you still love your ex?
And you say that it's over  but why does she call you
At 3AM and 4AM?
That's a funny way of staying friends
In my head  we’re dancing in the dark

But I saw your face in a magazine today
Wasn’t you  too late  all my tears already fallin'
Tried to turn the page  but our story wasn't stoppin’
And it goes on  and on  and on
Like a never ending song
On and on
Like a never ending song
You and I sacrificed my adolescence
Just to waste my time on the edges of your life
But we've grown too close  now it can't amount to nothin'
I can hear your voice in the music on the radio
And it goes on  and on  and on
Like a never ending song

Are we done? Can you make it play?

They're havin' talks about their futures until 4 AM

But I wanna feel all that love and еmotion
Be that attached to the person I'm holdin'
Someday I'll be fallin' without caution
But for now  I'm only people-watchin'
I'm only lookin' just to live through you vicariously
I've never really been in love  not seriously
I had a dream about a house behind a picket fence
Next one I choose to trust  I hope I use some common sense
But I cut people out like tags on my clothing
I end up all alone  but I still keep hoping

You're scared of the dark when you sleep
You cover up your arms with your sleeves
Even in hundred degree heat
Your father was awfully mean
Your favorite color is green
It reminds you of the summer you turned three
Runnin' through sprinklers on your street
And you laugh and you dance in the wind
And you sway and you hug and you kiss
But there's darkness behind those eyes
Even when you smile
You don't have to act like all you feel is mild
Arеn't you way too busy takin' care of everybody
To takе care of yourself?

Five words that I've heard before

Can't live a little longer sitting on your lap

The world that we were busy buildin'
Mid-November  and I'm sippin' on a half-cold coffee
Starin' at a girl who's not me
On your arm  a carbon copy
Feels like we had matching wounds
But mine's still black and bruised
And yours is perfectly fine now
Feels like we buried alive
Something that never died
You love her  it's over
Do you even doubt it on your lips? (When you say it  say it)

While I'm still standin' at the exit (Oh-oh  oh-oh-oh)
