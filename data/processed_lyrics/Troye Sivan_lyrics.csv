lyrics
"Couldn't tell you what we're even fight 'bout  yeah
That's probably something we should figure out  yeah
Ooh
'Cause I wanna be a ten out of ten for you
Hit it out of the park
And I wanna be an amen to ya
When you're falling apart
And we're not what we used to be
But let's be what we are (Let's be what we are)
With infatuation fading in and out  yeah
Gotta find a piece that keeps us sticking 'round  yeah
I should say I don't have a shred of doubt  yeah
We're alright  'cause
I wanna be a ten out of ten for you
Hit it out of the park
And I wanna be an amen to ya
When you're falling apart
And we're not what we used to be
But let's be what we are (Let's be what we are)

There will be dark days  ooh
Swear that they'll be short
There will be good days  ooh
There'll be so many more
You can always be sure that
I wanna be a ten out of ten for you
Hit it out of the park
And I wanna be an amen to ya
When you're falling apart
And we're not what we used to be
Pull me from hell bring me back again
Give him my all when I don't even have it
I always dreamed of a solemn face
Someone who feels like a holiday
Startin' to think that I've lost all feelin'
I'll tell you how I almost died
While you're bringin' me back to life
I just wanna live in this moment forever
'Cause I'm afraid that livin' couldn't gеt any better
Started givin' up on thе word forever
Until you gave up heaven so we could be together

'Cause I'm afraid that livin' couldn't get any better
Started givin' up on the word forever
Until you gave up heaven so we could be together
All the sick and twisted nights that I've been waitin' for ya
I just wanna live in this moment forever
'Cause I'm afraid that livin' couldn't get any better
Until you gave up heaven so we could be together
Something I've never said before
While you're lying awake
Covered all in the night before
I want you all to myself
Don't leave none for nobody else
I am an animal with you
No angels could beckon me back
And it's hotter than hell where I'm at
I am an animal with you
An ode to the boy I love
And as the days fly by
I want you all to myself
Don't leave none for nobody else
I am an animal with you
No angels could beckon me back

Sing me like a choir
I can be the subject of your dreams
Your sickening desire
Don't you wanna see a man up close?
A phoenix in the fire
So kiss me on the mouth and set me free
You can coax the cold right out of me
Drape me in your warmth
The rapture in the dark puts me at ease
The blind eye of the storm
Let's go for a walk down Easy Street
Where you can be reborn

Can't go back  baby
I wish I could but I can't go (Can't go back  baby)
To the days when I thought I knew you
This is me you're talkin' 'bout
Your only friend
Put your love into the ground
On my big weekend
While I was singin' songs about you
On the TV screen
Don't know how he left the hotel
I wasn't there to see
In the morning
Your hands around my waist  just us two
In the evening
On my mouth  could you still taste him?

In the morning
Yeah  I wake up with the sun across my face

Drinks in bars and
Boys in cars and
Rooftop sinning
Skinny dipping
Shooting stars with you
Fat cigars and
That weekend up in the islands
They stop and stare
Flashes filling the silence
Of a Hollywood love affair
Waking up in the islands
'Cause I saw you there
Lost and tryna be
I was just tryna be cool
I was just tryna be like you
I'm a spark and you're a boom
What am I supposed to do?

Pays his daughter
And her mama withdrew
From the life they once knew

Residuals become imminent

I went astray to make it okay
I know how it seems between you and me
I can't even look at you
Would you look at the space just next to your feet?
The wood is warping
The lines distorting
Burning the tears right off my face
What the hell did we do?
Tell me we'll make it through

I feel sick to my stomach as I begin to stand
I see your outline in my bed
In the same spot I watched him rest his head
Feel this emptiness in my chest
I feel surreal but I'm feeling stressed
I need to do something
Fucked up for nothing
Tell someone what I've done
Just set my heart on fire
Like gasoline

And I can't look you in the eye

You deserve forever

Linin' down the block to be around you
Look at you

Sweet like Marabou
Look-look at you
Give me a call if you ever get lonely
I'll be like one of your girls or your homies
Say what you want and I'll keep it a secret
You got the key to my heart and I need it
Give me a call if you ever get desperate
I'll be like one of your girls
Everybody wants you  baby (Evеrybody)
You should insure that waist (With the highest policy you can gеt)
But nobody wants you bad as I do

I could cry just thinking about you

We make a really good team
And though not everyone sees
We got this crazy chemistry

Jump-starting your car 'cause this city's a bore
Buying e-cigarettes at the convenience store
Making new clichés on our own little tour
Let's ride
You don't have to say I love you to say I love you
Forget all the shooting stars and all the silver moons
We've been making shades of purple out of red and blue
All I need is you
We try staying up late
But we both are lightweights
And we take jokes way too far
And sometimes living's too hard
We're like two halves of one heart
