"Why don't you lay here? Make the full moon cry
Why don't you love me the way I want you to?
You cut up the best dress I ever bought for you
But you don't have to doubt or figure me out
Let me show you the way it's gonna be
You don't have to doubt what it's all about
I want you to be here all the time
I want you to be here when I die
I want you
You don't have to doubt or figure it out

I want you to be here all the time
I want you to be here when I die
I want you
We don't need the seas to separate
No regret
See the storm in you against your own
Cigarette
And you don't have to doubt what it's all about
I want you to be here all the time
I want you to be here when I die
I want you to be here all the time
I want you to be here when I die
 I can take her anywhere
 now you know I just don't care
 I'm a man on the scene
If that's the way you wanna live your life
You can get yourself connected
But all I need is somewhere to lay
Somewhere to lay my hat up
I need someone to love in the middle of the day
I need someone to love when the chips are down
Love me when the chips are down
Will you love me when the chips are down?
Love me when the chips are down
And could you love me when the world is crashing all around?
You can try and be someone you're not
If that's the river that you want to cross
You can choose the life of a bohemian
Or you can choose the material world
But all I need is somewhere to lay
Somewhere to lay my hat up
I need someone to love in the middle of the day

Baby got her head down to the ground
Looking for a stranger
Looking for a stranger to love
You gotta dot your I's and cross your T's
You gotta let go and come with me
Looking for a stranger
Looking for a stranger to love
You got yourself a bad habit for it

You are just a kid with a sentimental heart
Afraid of what would happen before you ever start

But the stars are rolling out for me
Stars are rolling out

Is it just a light reflecting off the street?

I'm trying to live inside
I got a lover
And she's kind of kind
She got a feeling
Like I'm somebody else
I'm gonna run with that
Until I let her know
I'm not a body
I'm just a soul
High on the buzz
Trying to separate
You are the pulse
You the falling rain
When the day is almost over
And the clouds are in the sea
When my life has all been lived
Even though I didn't love you
You made me believe

I was walking by on my way to Monday
Cracked lips and a sad vogue
Something tune life that you just can’t hear
Dry fuel but it hurts too much
You always washing your hands in myth
Don’t you know you can’t get clean?
What I was running to
What I was running to

Didn’t know what I was running to
Oh girl don’t stop now
Walking through the city like a holy cow

 I get under
 that's why
 that's why
 a very nice time
 my farthings for my mortgage that I'm under
 that's why
To tear my soul away from me
'Cause when I see you
You rip my heart out
But all the same you're not to blame
Baby baby I love you still
But I need your heart beating next to my heart
In love I am
I need your heart beating next to my heart
In love I am
I was down and I fell for you completely
When I wanted your heart and
You didn't want me but now you do
But now you do
But I need your heart beating next to my heart
In love I am
I need your heart dancing next to my heart
In love I am

As the kettle whistle blows
Paperback novelette still open
And the door is closed
You got a real sick mind
You write a column for The Times
For all the lovers gone blind
Who are looking for a sign
And when the night is over
And the drugs are gone
All you've got is your four leaf clover
You keep inside your coat
And when the night is over
And the drugs are gone
You feel the world is getting colder
You got no one to hold
Six pages down and she's lighting up
Her trainwreck soul
She was abandoned by her lover
Left by the road
It's thirsty work
She'll stumble down to the boozer
Just to have a flirt

Remember love
When we weren't so Fractured and Dazed
In a world
Where we try to hurt each other
I know you feel bad
For what you did and how you recovered
Im a blessed man
Just to have touched your face
But then again
Who are you to make me replace that
And if I was you
I would have done the same
When lies meant truth to you
It was you who loved the fame
I'll never give your love
I'll never give your love away

That day you seemed to change
We all need someone to guide us
Someone to introduce the show
I needed someone just like you
Someone to let me know I could lose it all

There was nothing that you could’ve done
There was nothing that you should’ve said
We’re both still chasing shadows in our heads
It was all too soon
But is it me? Is it you?
Is it the times that we’re going through?
Was it hard? Did your heart break down?
Is your mind still in control?

A beautiful wife and a baby on the way
And his bills are already paid
No need to scrimp  no need to save
But all around him the world grows hard
He thinks to himself he must have played a lucky card
If he was alone he'd give it all away
To people and things that he wanted to save
Oh yeah  oh yeah
Doesn't stop to think that it's because of he
Always doing right  he stays healthy
The girls in the alleys won't get hold of him
He's got no time for that kind of sin
And he  he's not a member of the Catholic Church
The pastor of his town got sent down for dirt
He sees the boys from Sunday school
It's hard to believe what he read in the morning news
Oh yeah  oh yeah

We were lovers in every way
Now I can hardly remember her face
Before I met her I was sad
Ooooooooh
Ooooooooh
And can I hold you one last time?
 you've got to stay
 then you twitch
 pretty petticoat
 he got wild
 the world just chewed her up and spat her out
 she was such a good girl to me
 the world just chewed her up and spat her out
 don't feel out of place
 go to Hollywood
 it's such a drag
 don't begin to lag
 so live it well
 girl
 she was such a good girl to me

 the world just chewed her up and spat her out

You touched the ground and I fell in love with you
Oh  Pamela  what did they say?
I reached for your hand but you turned and walked away
Can you lend your ears about my mate Pamela?
So naughty but she loves her fella
One wink and a glint in the other one
At night she only wears Yves Saint Laurent
Watches black and white movies to get thin
Curls her hair just like Marilyn
Oh  what an enigmatic woman
My gosh do some mothers have 'em
Oh  Pamela  what did you do?
You touched the ground and I fell in love with you
Oh  Pamela  what did they say?
I reached for your hand but you turned and walked away
Can you lend your ears for a man in trouble?
She tripped me up and now I see double
I asked her what her life was missing
And if she'd like to go trout mask kissing
Said  Go get high with the other ones
I looked around  lights on but no one home
Oh  what an enigmatic woman
My gosh do some mothers have 'em

Take it away
Earl grey and lemons in the morning
By noon her nurse comes calling
Limousine with a stretcher in the back
They strap her down when she has a panic attack
I followed her down to the hospital
No visitors allowed on a bicycle
So I threw rocks up to the window
I broke the glass so she could feel the wind blow

About the picture in your picture frame
It was drawn of a fountain in your Paris
Bought for a fiver most probably
You tell me that you'd never sell this
That the artist himself was beneath this
That life itself was within this
And I looked at the sky to worship the ground
And you never asked for nothing at all
Even as the wolves glowered at your door
And you do your best to fold me and unfold me again
Time will make fools of us all
It's time to find meaning or control
Every time we go out now you pretend
You tell me the meaning of life is
To be happy and to give up loss
But you've never lost something you loved
But I turn around
How could I be angry at you?

And to warm your bed as you fold me and unfold me again
Wash my hands and shake my feet
As I wonder what we'd be like
Lust will do funny things
I don't want you to go out looking so good
And you look so good
Rosie
To be
Still take your time but get to me
Rosie
She looked away as I mentioned my name
The street lights light up my shame
The world can take you and swallow you whole
But you're a big girl and I think that you already know
You've been bought and sold
Be careful with me
I see all that you see
And Troy died in a day for little Rosie

Oh  would you be proud?
I've been in sticky situations
I fell in love with a girl who likes girls
I know Mum's thinking of you

Not about to lie down for your cause

Tempered furs and spangled boots
