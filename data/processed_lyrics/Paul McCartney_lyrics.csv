lyrics
"Wraps a towel around her as she's heading for the bedroom chair
It's just another day
Slipping into stockings  stepping into shoes
Dipping in the pocket of her raincoat
It's just another day
At the office where the papers grow  she takes a break
Drinks another coffee  and she finds it hard to stay awake (another)
It's just another day
Du du du du du du  it's just another day
Du du du du du du  it's just another day
So sad  so sad
Sometimes she feels so sad
Alone in apartment  she'd dwell
Till the man of her dreams comes to break the spell
Ah  stay  don't stand her up
And he comes  and he stays  but he leaves the next day
So sad
Sometimes she feels so sad

As she posts another letter to The Sound of Five
People gather around her  and she finds it hard to stay alive (another)
It's just another day
Du du du du du du  it's just another day
Du du du du du du  it's just another day
So sad  so sad
Sometimes she feels so sad
Alone in apartment  she'd dwell
Till the man of her dreams comes to break the spell
Ah  stay  don't stand her up
And he comes  and he stays  but he leaves the next day
So sad
Sometimes she feels so sad
Every day  she takes a morning bath  she wets her hair
Wraps a towel around her as she's heading for the bedroom chair (another)
It's just another day
Slipping into stockings  stepping into shoes
Dipping in the pocket of her raincoat
It's just another day
Du du du du du du  it's just another day
There lives a girl
Dreams of the future
Back in Brazil
She meets a man
He's tall and handsome
And he fits in with her plan
Bright lights ahead
Music and fun
Nights are for dancing
And the days are for the sun
All kinds of weather
Will surely come and go
But they're together
And together they will steal the show
Ichiban! Ichiban! Ichiban!
Ichiban! Ichiban! Ichiban!
Ichiba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ban!
Back in Brazil
She makes a date
He has to cancel
'Cause they got him working late
Back in Brazil
She feels afraid
Hope starts to crumble
And her dreams begin to fade

Her lights are out
She's gone to bed
Nights are for sleeping
If a girl's to get ahead
Even the weather
Has started changing too
But they'll be together
Ichiban! Ichiban! Ichiban!
Ichiban! Ichiban! Ichiban!
Ichiban!
So we raise a family
As the clouds roll by
Making pictures of us in the sky
The kids are happy
And they don't ask why
Someone's on a mission to the lonely Lorelei
Some folk's got a vision of a castle in the sky
And I'm left stranded  wondering why
You and me together  nothing feels so good
Even if I get a medal from my local neighbourhood
I won't need a castle  they've got castles in Versailles
And I'm still stranded  wondering why
Make it a beautiful night for me
It's a beautiful night for love
A wonderful sight for lovers of love to behold
Make it a beautiful night for me
It's a beautiful night for love
A wonderful sight for lovers of love to behold
Some boat's on the ocean  we're here in this room
Seems to me the perfect way to spend an afternoon
We can look for castles  pretty castles in the sky
No more wondering  wondering why

Ah
From the moment I opened my eyes
And the morning when I first saw you
Gave me life under calico skies
I will hold you for as long as you like
I'll hold you for the rest of my life
Always looking for ways to love you
Never failing to fight at your side
While the angels of love protect us
From the inner most secrets we hide
I'll hold you for as long as you like
I'll hold you for the rest of my life
Long live all of us crazy soldiers
Who were born under calico skies
May we never be called to handle
All the weapons of war we despise

My underneath-the-staircase friend
But I fell out of love with you
And brought our romance to an end
I played with you throughout the day
And told you every secret thought
Unlike my other so-called friends
You stood beside me as I fought
Could dream of shining far-off lands
Where serpents turn to bits of string
And played like kittens in my hand
In our imaginary world
Where butterflies wear army boots
And stomp around the forest chanting
Long lost anthems
Long lost anthems
You used to be my confidante

Of dangers up ahead
The captain won't be listening
To what's being said
He feels that there's a good chance
That we have been misled
And so the captain's planning
To steam ahead
What can we do? What can we do?
What can we do to stop this foolish plan going through?
This man is bound to lose his ship and his crew
Despite repeated warnings
From those who ought to know
And so he'll go
(What can we do?)
Those who shout the loudest (What can we do?)
May not always be the smartest (What can we do?)
But they have their proudest moments
Right before they fall
(What can we do?)
Red sky in the morning (What can we do?)
Doesn't ever seem to faze him (What can we do?)
But a sailor's warning signal
See Paul McCartney LiveGet tickets as low as $84You might also likePart II
How can we stop him?
Grab the keys and lock him up
If we can do it
We can save the day
But he misses them so
Although he's working with the best crew on the planet
(We're the best crew on the planet!)
They never want him to go
He had a premonition
He senses something's wrong
And by his own admission
He knew it all along
The captain's crazy
But he doesn't let them know it
He'll take us with him
If we don't do something soon to slow it
How can we stop him?
Grab the keys and lock him up
If we can do it
We can save the day
The captain's gonna leave us when the temperatures rise
And we are gonna be left down below
Down below
Part III
Oh yeah
If life would work out the way you plan it
That'd be so fine for the wife and Janet
Sometimes you might have to battle through it
And that's the way you learn how you've got to do it
Part I reprise
Despite repeated warnings
Of dangers up ahead
To what was said
(What can we do?)
(For those who shout the loudest)
So we went to the captain
(What can we do?)
(May not always be the smartest)
And we told him to turn around
(What can we do?)
(But they have their proudest moments)
But he laughs in our faces
(Right before they fall)
Says that we are mistaken
(What can we do?)
(Red sky in the morning)
So we gather around him
(What can we do?)
(Doesn't ever seem to faze him)
Now the ropes that have bound him
(What can we do?)
(But a sailor's warning signal)
Prove that he should have listened
(Should concern us all)
To the will of the people
It's the will of the people
I have answered your invitation
I'll be leaving in the morning
Watch me go
I don't know where the wind is blowing
Got directions to where I'm going
Nothing's certain
That's the only thing I know
Do it now  do it now while the vision is clear
Do it now while the feeling is here
If you leave it too late  it could all disappear
Do it now while your vision is clear
Do-do-doo  do-do-doo
Do-do-doo  do-do-do
Do-do-doo-ooh  doo-ooh

Is the right one

Hey-hey  yay-yay
In time  we'll know it's all a show
I lived through those early days
So many times I had to change the pain to laughter
Just to keep from getting crazed
Dressed in black from head to toe
Two guitars across our backs  we would walk the city roads
Seeking someone who would listen to the music
That we were writing down at home
But they can't take it from me  if they try
I lived through those early days
So many times I had to change the pain to laughter
Just to keep from getting crazy
Hair slicked back with Vaseline
Like the pictures on the wall of the local record shop
Hearing noises we were destined to remember
We willed the thrill to never stop
May sweet memories of friends from the past
Always come to you when you look for them
And your inspiration  long may it last
May it come to you  time and time again

See the mighty ocean break

I don't think I can take anymore
What am I doing wrong?
I don't know
My brother told me  life's not a pain
But that was right when it started to rain
Where am I going wrong?
I don't know
But it's alright  sleep tight
I will take the strain
You're fine  love of mine
You will feel no pain
Well  I see trouble at every turn
I've got so many lessons to learn
What am I doing wrong?
I don't know
Now what's the matter with me?
Am I right? Am I wrong?
Now I started to see
I must try to be strong
I try to love you best as I can
But you know that I'm only a man
Why am I going wrong?
I don't know
But it's alright  sleep tight
I will take the strain
You will feel no pain
I got crows at my window and dogs at my door
But I don't think I can take anymore
What am I doing wrong?

Jenny Wren could sing
But a broken heart
Took her song away
Like the other girls
Jenny Wren took wing
She could see the world
And its foolish ways
How we spend our days
Casting love aside
Losing sight of life
Day by day
She saw poverty
Breaking up a home
Wounded warriors
Took her song away

When this broken world

Parachutes  army boots  sleeping bags for two
Sentimental jamboree

Memories for you and me

Nothing's gonna shake your love
