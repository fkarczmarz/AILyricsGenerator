"I think I might be able fulfill your fantasy
Oooh the way she looked at me
I love it when you're teasing me
I love it when you're pleasing me
You wanna get it shawty (All night long)
Then keep acting on it (All night long)
Then keep acting on it (All night long)

You wanna get it shawty (All night long)
Then keep acting on it (All night long)
Then keep acting on it (All night long)
I read your text saying what you wanna do to me (All night long)
I think I might be able fulfill your fantasy
She never been in a limousine
And now she's living the life
Popping bottles in Italy
She's dancing up on the table
Got everybody's attention in here
She put my hands on her body
And then she whispers in my ear
This is the best night of my life
And I wish this between you and I
Can last forever
Let's make it last forever
Let's make it last forever
Let's make it last forever
Let's make it last for...
I hope this ain't a dream
This better not be no dream
Please don't let this be a simulation
It better be real
Cause you're a pretty thing
You a motherfucking sexy thing
I hope it's not my imagination
It better be real
You might also likeI'm dancing on the floor (yeah on the floor)
We spinning round and round
You spin me round and round
I'm falling for you girl
I'm falling in love
I know you want it
You know I want you too
I know you like it
I know you like my moves
Now that I got you
Call you on my phone
Baby let's party the night away
I'm dancing with you
This is the best night of my life
And I wish this between you and I
Can last forever
Let's make it last forever
Let's make it last forever
Let's make it last forever
Let's make it last for...
You never know how it's gonna go
When you bring a chick up in the limousine
Seeing things she's never seen
Cause she's struck by the stars
And the stars find her striking
You try to play it off cause you see a sign of frightening
Will.I.Am is spitting at her
T-pain's winking at her
Ludacris is with his chick but his homeboys getting at her
What's the matter? Oh nothing
I've seen it in a dream before
I love it when you hold me tight
And then we kiss 'til the morning light
This is the best night of my life
And I wish this between you and I
Can last forever
Let's make it last forever
Let's make it last forever
Let's make it last forever
To my freakers
To my freakers
To my freakers
To my freakays
To my freakays
I'mma just be rip- you're dancing on my soul
I wanna see you grip that sofa then pop it slow
Pop that booty bitch
Make it swang
Now pop it up on your tippy toes
Let me see that booty
For all them hippy hoes
We got that game on Lizzy
I got my sippy-sippy
I'm feeling tippy-tippy
I got my goons with me
Until we getting dizzy
We don't stop
Until they turn on the lights or call the cops

Dancing on the floor with a packet of dough
If you're C-walking
If you're two-stepping
If your cranking that
Then it don't matter pimpin'
Even on Myspace they call my shit the bomb
If I keep it up I'll have more friends than Tom
How you describe your style?
Call it the new 80s
The women all up on us 'cause we entertain
My momma named me sky
So high
I ain't your pusher man
But I got what you need
A double dose of Foo
A double dose of me
So if you C-walking
And you two stepping
And if you cranking that
Then it don't matter pimpin
We're gonna make you sweat
A night you won't forget
Are you ready for it?
Champagne showers (Oh)

Shake it  spray it on a body or two
And walk out the party with a hottie or two  oh

Get crazy get wild

If you wanna have fun and do something

Walk in the club with no ID
Girls on my jock cause I'm VIP
Your man can't do what I can do
What's your name - I'm SkyBlu
Well I'm RedFoo with the big ass fro
Never wear lenses in my glasses yo
My first keyboard was a Casio
Oooh look at that girl on the dancin floor
Was she lookin at us like she wanna do
Somethin freaky in the back with a camera crew
I guess I got time for a fan or two
I roll with 3 hoes like Santa do
Ho Ho Ho and a bottle of goose
Mix it with the bull if you wanna get loose
It's that time to lose control
If you're feelin real good then let it show

When I was a baby  I was suckin' on titties

Different titties - but titties nonetheless
The first thing I do when a girl undress
Crazy girl spark my interest
If titties were a stock  I'd invest in breast
Love the way you move  I'm impressed

In Europe they show t-titties all the time
But here in LA every titty a prize
So girl let me see what you tryin to hide
Has either of your titties ever touched the sky
Now if your shy (if your shy)
Just close your eyes (just close your eyes)
And pull your titties out like you part of tha African tribe

I know a club around the way that be poppin’ fo sho
So gather up your girlfriends cause we all fitin ta roll
There’s more booties than seats so just sit on my lap
In the club my nigga red foo’s are the ones and twos
Feelin like the man of the hour to the flow we cruise
It’s hard to dance baby

A girl just walked passed with a nice round ass
So excuse me I gotta go fuck up the rotation I know
But when I see a booty like that my other heads in control
Booty so big it look like two obese salsa twins
Baby baby please come back home with me
“I know you ain’t thinking that I’m getting on my knees”
What! Girl you know you better
Fuck isis no landmines
Dripped down in jesus sandals
Jared Fogle that's a scandal
I am german but not Hansel and Grettle
Keep a Burna on me no heavy metal
Got more straps than the Taliban
Free my parents no travel ban
Go through that boy like a gamma ray
Thick booty slim waist no Sommer Ray
When I'm pissed get out of my way
Get the fuck out of my way
Get the fuck out of my way
 I work out every day
 that's what they say
 they say I did it
 came to drink
 some vendors be real and some be faking
 you ain't got no bacon?
 I don't care what you say
 got no peppers
I am not a whore
I am not a whore
I am not a whore
I am not a whore
I am not a whore
But I like to do it
Most girls I meet are quite savage
Always tryin' to grab up on my package
They say I look yummy and they want a taste
Sometimes I feel like LL Cool J
I need love not random booty
But every girl I try to get to know
Ends up tryin' to do me
I said
I am not a whore
I am not a whore
But I like to do it
Girl I know you like my style
But get your hand out my pants

When I walk in the club

I get looks from the ladies
Daps from the dudes
I'm dressed like it's the 80's
I got a drink in my hand
You know my favorite one
It's Red Bull and vodka
And then I get those call
From my favorite hizzo
She screaming Where the fuck you at?

And got delirious
She went back with her ex
Kept me a secret
Then gets mad at me
When I go to the club and freak it
What you talkin' 'bout
I'm dancing with her bud
You got his dick in your mouth
I ain't no side dish

Better decide bitch

From the stage to the door

LMFAO is on the checks
One  two in the place to be
It pays to be  what's happening next
Baby you look so fine  I can tell with that look in your eye
That me and you in the bathroom
Has crossed your mind
I rock a chain on my chest
Cause I'm fresh to the death
And everyday I'm shuffling  I'm like a soldier with these steps
It's on and popping  there ain't no stopping
That bass is knocking  the shots are dropping
Some of us came to celebrate  but most of us came to get away
It doesn't matter what I say  no matter what I do
Every little thing reminds me of you
It gets harder every day  I don't know what to do
Every little thing reminds me of you

This is what it means to be friends
Only when I'm hanging with you
All my dreams come true because
And as my coffee steamed I thought about my life and my lofty dreams
It's so sick and I'm startin' to mix thanks to AM  rest in piece banana split
Was the place we all went Sundays  to make people feel this way we would one day
And I remember when you gave me the secret  popped in the DVD and peeped it
And if you dreamin' you achivin'  after that it was a wrap
And now I walk in the club like a million times
Spit on the mic like a million rhymes
We party rock to a billion drops and this shot makes one zillion shots
Yes I'm feelin' good  and we the best I'm feelin' good
And in your breast are feelin' good  ha-ha LMFAO
I'm a pro with this party thang
I love Cherry Tree Cola and Bacardi mayne
Hey  I've been the same before the start of fame
The only that has changed is we changed the game
You and I and the crew that I roll with
It's gonna be the the same crew I grow old with
Memories fade like old leather
But the music that we make gonna last forever... legacy

Nowadays I'm stylin' and when she naked it I feel like cryin'
It's better than I hoped it'd be
I walk down the street and people notice me
No body was as broke as me
They say you never get nowhere smokin' weed
So I roll one up I stepped on a landmine blowin' up
And I ain't never growin' up
And if the party rocks then you know it's us
Me and foo in the club straight posted-up
Back when I wasn't old enough
Now bottles on ice when we rollin' up
Cheers  a toast to us
Oh  we winnin' now
My whole life's changed since then and now
Fans show love and women shout
Make me feel like I'm the man
All of my friends n' my fans say don't let em change you

And he's still the same Foo

Stuck with our team and our dream and look how it came true
