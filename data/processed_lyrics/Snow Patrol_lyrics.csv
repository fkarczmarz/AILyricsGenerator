lyrics
" that I didn't know existed
 I'm not afraid
 who knew that I would like it
 I'm not afraid
 I'm not afraid
 I'm not afraid
We felt like the rampart lion's roar
We were elastic and then we were healed
Healed in the blinking of an eye
And then when the dawn cracked over us
The day wouldn't hit us hard at all
We could ride the morning into night again
We knew the days were there to waste
But these days
That light hit so heavy
And those days
Feel like another life
This isn't like the first time anymore
And I've been chasing that too long
Digging for the lost memories
Of a youth written in fire
You've always said it's not too late for me
Well I sure am listening to you now
Believe in me so I can trust myself
'Cause there's a first time for that too

Remember the first time that we kissed - It felt like a planet forming
Though we were just novices at this - It felt like an ancient wisdom
There was lightning then and those songs were all proved true
No wonder I still think so much about you
But these days
My heart feels too heavy
And those days
Are someone else's life
This isn't like the first time anymore
And I've been chasing that too long
Digging for the lost memories
Of a youth written in fire
You've always said it's not too late for me
Well I sure am listening to you now
Believe in me so I can trust myself
I might go after school
She was an angel
I saw her swimming there
I am in such a mess
I can't cope without this
She just teases me
Pretends she can't see me here
So let me go out there
I can breathe fresh air
Lay with you all night
Just let me love you
Just for a while want to
Be with you all night
Be with you all night
Until I fall asleep
Until I fall asleep
Until I fall asleep
Until I fall asleep
Just let me be here
I won't tell anyone

The blind lead the blind
So why can't I find my way
This could be heaven
But I don't know where I am
I am too scared to come out
From behind here
My body is aching
It feels like it's wearing me
So let me go out there
I can breathe fresh air
Lay with you all night
Just let me love you
Just for a while want to
Be with you all night
Be with you all night
Until I fall asleep
Until I fall asleep
Until I fall asleep
Until I fall asleep
Just let me be here
I won't tell anyone
Don't want to wake up
Cause we don't know how to back down
We were called out to the streets
We were called out to the towns
How the heavens they opened up
Like arms of dazzling gold
With our rain-washed histories
We are listening and we're not blind
We are listening and were not blind
I was called out in the dark
By a choir of beautiful cheats
And as the kids took back the parks
You and I were left with the streets

We don't need
Anything

If I lay here
If I just lay here
Would you lie with me and just forget the world?
I don't quite know
How to say
How I feel
Those three words
Are said too much
They're not enough

Would you lie with me and just forget the world?
Forget what we're told
Before we get too old
Show me a garden that's burstin' into life
All that I am
All that I ever was
I don't know where
Just know that these things will never change for us at all
If I lay here
If I just lay here
I'm aware I'm alive
All these places feel like home
With a name I'd never chosen
I can make my first steps
As a child of twenty-five
Roof of my mouth as I lie to you
Just because I'm sorry doesn't mean
I didn't enjoy it at the time
You're the only thing that I love
Scares me more every day
On my knees I think clearer
Goodness knows I saw it coming
Or at least I'll claim I did
What have I done? It's too late for that
What have I become? Truth is nothing yet
A simple mistake starts the hardest time
I promise I'll do anything you ask
On the broken radiator
When you lay them freezing on me
I mumble can you wake me later
But I don't really want you to stop
And you know it so it doesn't stop you
You run your hands from my neck
To my chest
Crack the shutters open wide
I want to bathe you in the light of day
And just watch you as the rays
Tangle up around your face and body
I could sit for hours
Finding new ways to be awed each minute
'Cause the daylight seems to want you
Just as much as I want you
It's been minutes it's been days
It's been all I will remember
Happy lost in your hair
And the cold side of the pillow
Your hills and valleys
Are mapped by my intrepid fingers
And in a naked slumber
I dream all this again

I know it's late but I can't help but think here
That the day hasn't shown all its cards
Now it's out to the stars or the ocean
Let's not retrace our steps to the car
Picking out all the stars that we like
Between finger and thumb
You laugh as you pass me the night
As if it's too fragile to hold
And I hold it so close to my chest
With your hands in my hands
You say this is just how we'll rest
Until blood turns to sand
Now your eyelids they faint and they shiver
Like the wings of the last bird to leave
For the south for the heat for no reason
At all just to fly for sheer joy
The wind shakes the branches above us
And the cars shake the ground at our backs
But the dark roman wine in our bloodstreams

It seems too much went wrong and all at once
Resistance seems impossible from down this low
And surely no one else can feel like this
But on the streets
You can see them gathering
And in your heart
You know they feel like you do
Sound and pulse and volume
Hands just reaching out for hands
This is almost overload
I said almost overload
Friends and foes and princes
Are all just human in the end
It's so damn simple
So standing in the steady throne of restless hope
You don't feel like an outcast anymore
And something deep inside of you has waken up
And you know that nothing's gonna be the same again

These last ten years or more
My friends we've seen it all
Triumphs to drunken falls and our bones are broken still
But our hearts are joined until
Time slips its tired hand into our tired hands
We've years 'til that day and so much more to say
You give the strength to me
A strength I never had
I was a mess you see
I'd lost the plot so bad
You dragged me up and out
Out of the darkest place
There's not a single doubt when
I can see your faces
My friends we've seen it all
When it made no sense at all
You dare to light my path
And found the beauty in the aftermath

Not always just the traffic jam
Hit me hard enough to wake me
And lead me wild to your dark roads
Headlights before me

And this is hurt like kindness breaking you with gentle hands

And it whispers and roars like an orchestra
You call out my name like no one before  it sounds like I...

I think of us just silly kids
I bet we thought we'd never age
And if we did we'd never dare say
And I remember trips to 'Derry

And none of us have been the same

Come back and carry us now
Come back and carry us now
I wound it round and round my finger so tight
It turned to purple and a pulse formed inside
And I knew the beat 'cause it matched your own beat
I still remember it from our chest to chest and feet to feet
The easy silence then was a sweet relief to this hush
I said I knew the beat 'cause it matched your own beat
It's become my engine my own source of heat
The sea between us only amplifies the sound waves
Every hum and echo and crash paints my cave
For the lies I've told
That the truth
It no longer thrills me
And why can't we laugh
When it's all we have?
Have we put these childish things away?
Have we lost the magic that we once had?
It's time for us to lose our weary minds
Will you dance with me
Like we used to dance
And remember
How to move together?

My words just break and melt
Please just save me from this darkness
Instead of in New York
If the curve of you was curved on me
I'd tell you that I loved you
Before I even knew you
'Cause I loved the simple thought of you
If our hearts are never broken
And there's no joy in the mending
There's so much this hurt can teach us both
And there's distance and there's silence
Your words have never left me
They're the prayer that I say every day
The lone neon lights and the ache of the ocean
And the fire that was starting to spark
And the lack of it snaps me in two

If you were here beside me
Instead of in New York
In the arms you said you'd never leave
I'd tell you that it's simple
And it was only ever thus
There is nowhere else that I belong
The lone neon lights and the ache of the ocean
And the fire that was starting to spark
And the lack of it snaps me in two
To the quiet chaos driving me back
The lone neon lights and the warmth of the ocean
And I won't waste a minute without you
And I'm getting so tired and so old
The anger swells in my guts
And I won't feel these slices and cuts
I want so much to open your eyes
'Cause I need you to look into mine
Tell me that you'll open your eyes
Tell me that you'll open your eyes
Tell me that you'll open your eyes
Tell me that you'll open your eyes
'Cause they don't get your soul or your fire
And we'll walk from this dark room for the last time
Every minute from this minute now
We can do what we like anywhere
I want so much to open your eyes
'Cause I need you to look into mine

All this feels strange and untrue
Then we really have to go
You've been the only thing that's right
In all I've done
And I can barely look at you
But every single time I do
I know we'll make it anywhere
Away from here
As if you have a choice
Even if you cannot hear my voice
And we'll run for our lives
Why you can't raise your voice to say
To think I might not see those eyes
Makes it so hard not to cry
And as we say our long goodbye
I nearly do

To get out of our little heads
We're bound to be afraid
Even if it's just for a few days
Making up for all this mess
As if you have a choice
Even if you cannot hear my voice
Let's craft the only thing we know into surprise
Set down your glass
I painted this
To look like you and me forever as we're now
And I'm shaken then I'm still
When your eyes meet mine I lose simple skills
Like to tell you all I want is now
You sing and I'm killed
I'm just not the same
As I was a year ago and each minute since then
My jumper tears
As we take it off
And you say you'll sew me good as new and I know you will
And I'm shaken then I'm still
When your eyes meet mine I lose simple skills
 and state lines
Somewhere cold and caked in snow
Learn to wear each other well
And when the worrying starts to hurt
And the world feels like graves of dirt
Just close your eyes until
And falling gently on the cushion
You can come and sing to me
And when the worrying starts to hurt
And the world feels like graves of dirt
Just close your eyes until

'Cause there was nothing in there but you
I felt every ounce of me screaming out
But the sound was trapped deep in me
All I wanted just sped right past me
While I was rooted fast to the earth
I could be stuck here for a thousand years
Without your arms to drag me out
All this fear falls away to leave me naked
In the confusion and the aftermath
You are my signal fire
The only resolution and the only joy
Is the faint spark of forgiveness in your eyes

But then someday neither will I
Tomorrow though is nothing to fear
Because father it's always today
Life won't flash before your eyes
Instead will fall away then melt like snow
The secret storms of your wild youth
Soon you'll not remember anything
But then some day neither will I
Tomorrow though is nothing to fear
Because father it's always today
I can ride on your coat tails again
Like I always did as a little boy
We are standing on the home shores now
My whole hand hanging onto your thumb
There's a place in the palace of you
We can always be standing like that
Just my father and I am just your son

And left a note at your bedside
I'm far too shy to speak to you at school
I find it easier to sit and stare
Than push my limbs out towards you right there
My heart is bursting in your perfect eyes
As blue as oceans and as pure as skies
I struggle for the words and then give up
My head's up with the birds in the t-hut
A little peace of mind that I know better
Than the plain disgrace of all my letters
And I fell in love with everyone I saw
And it's in everything I ever write
It's not as if I need the extra weight
Lonely written words for company
Just raise the roof this once and follow me

Insect noise is all that I hear
A magic trick makes the world disappear
A distant motorcade and suddenly there's joy
The snowin' ticker-tape blurs all my senses numb
It's like the finish line where everything just ends
The crack of radio seems close enough to touch
I feel like I am watchin' everything from space
And in a minute I'll hear my name and I'll wake
I think the finish line's a good place we could start
 ever again?
 the silver forked sky
 just overwhelm me
 I want unsettled
 all peeling thunder
 ever again?

 the caravans are kids' toys
 everything is sound
 the trend bucks
 everything is sound
 you looked alone
 you're safe and dry
 the day breaks
 sometime today
 so suddenly and rained
 the two of us were the only thing
 I felt my worth
 sometime today

It's floored was frozen glass
You slip into my arms
And you quickly correct yourself
Your freezing speech bubbles
Seem to hold your words aloft
I want the smoky clouds of laughter
To swim about me forever more
I will race you to the waterside
And from the edge of Ireland shout out loud
So they could hear it in America
It's all for you
The shells crack under our shoes
Like punctuation points
The planets bend between us
A hundred million suns and stars
The sea filled in the silence
Before you sank those words
And now even in the darkness
I can see how happy you are
