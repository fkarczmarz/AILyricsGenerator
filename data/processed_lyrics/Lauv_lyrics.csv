" maybe we could run
 2021
 maybe we could run
 you're invaluable to mе
 mmm
 maybe we could run
 2021
 maybe we could run
 but I'm always there when you call
 baby
 maybe we could run
 2021
 maybe we could run
About a boy who broke his own heart?
And he always blamed everybody else
But the truth is that he did it to himself
Made a couple songs and they got big
And thought that he could do whatever he wanted
But it all left him with a hole in his heart
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Money buys you happiness
Doesn't buy you time
The more that I get older
The less I wanna be sober
And maybe I'm just broken
And I'll never admit it
But I wish that I was younger
How the hell did it come to this?
And I wish I could tell you
But I'm pretty sure that I forgot
What it's like to be a person that doesn't think
That everything he does just sucks

Ooh-ooh-ooh
Money buys you happiness
Doesn't buy you time
The more that I get older
The less I wanna be sober
And maybe I'm just broken
And I'll never admit it
But I wish that I was younger
How the hell did it come to this?
The more that I get older
The less I wanna be sober
Now I'm laying alone in bed
Trying to wrap up this feeling
Falling apart instead
'Cause baby we hit the top
Sweeter than sugar rocks
Holding onto a moment
I just need a little of it
Oh
Keep calling me home
Can we go back to adrenaline?
Can we go back to adrenaline?
Adrenaline
Remembering all those nights
With your body straight to the sky
You work me until the morning
Fall asleep half past nine (A.M.)
So crazy in love
Enough was never enough
Tell me our touch ain’t dull now
(Tell me our touch ain’t dull now)

I just need a little of it
Oh
Keep calling me home
Can we go back to adrenaline?
Can we go back to adrenaline?
Adrenaline
And I don’t know where the ceiling is anymore
Can we go back to adrenaline?
(Can we go back from here?)
Can we go back to adrenaline?
(Can we go back from here?)
Adrenaline
(Can we go back from here?)
(Can we go back from here?)
(Can we go back from here?)
(Can we go back from here?)
I don't ever wanna stop this ride that we're on
I don't ever wanna say goodbye
'Cause then all of those nights
They would just be all for nothing
Third of October  we were never sober
First few times that we hung out
But we fell in love somehow
First time that I met you
I didn't have a damn clue
That I love everything about you
Now I can't think of life without you
(Ehh) Did you know that you're my whole heart?
(Ehh) Did you know that I never stop  no
Giving you everything I got ‘cause I'm so
I'm so in love  I'm so in love
I don't ever wanna stop this ride that we're on
I don't ever wanna say goodbye
'Cause then all of those nights
They would just be all for nothing

Giving you everything I got 'cause I'm so

I don't ever wanna stop this ride that we're on

'Cause then all of those nights
They would just be all for nothing
Yeah I'm so in love  I'm so in love
I don't ever wanna stop this ride that we're on

I don't ever wanna stop this ride that we're on
I don't ever wanna say goodbye
'Cause then all of those nights
Instead  I took a plane out of this town
And missed out on us  mmm
If I had a time-machine I would take it
And make it back to us
Now I'm reminiscing 'round the clock
Wish that I could make it stop
Should've believed in us
While we existed
'Cause now the whole thing's fucked
And just a figment of my imagination
If I could bring you back  I would
But it's just way too late for that
Should've believed in us
And I wish I would've been patient
Instead of lettin' all the emotions
Turn to motions with you  mmm

Nobody told 'em the world was mean
Billy grew up in a trailer and nobody thought
He could amount to anything
But I knew he would because he has a heart of gold
'Cause Billy bought a brand new house
To all the people that were mean
He just channeled your energy
To all the people that believed
He just channeled your energy
Billy woke up in a Tesla at twenty-three
He didn't think he earned the ride
Then Billy got down under pressure at twenty-four
He couldn't go to bed at night
'Cause he saw the world come crashin' down the way it does

Still don't know what I'm wantin'
I'll be honest  I'm not ready to let you go
I walk down memory lane late at night
I end up losing my way every time
I wake up missing you more
Oh  why did I say goodbye?
I used to have you  now I have this bracelet
I used to have you  now I have this bracelet
I let you go but baby  I'm gonna wear it
Until I don't need to
Until I don't need you
All I know is I can't face it
I used to have you  now I have this bracelet
I let you go but baby  I'm gonna wear it

Anyway I could toss it  I'll admit that
That don't mean that I need to
Keep you wrapped around my wrist

I wake up missing you more  missing you more
Oh  is it goodbye?
Is it goodbye?
River in the not good times
I've seen your soul grow just like a rose
Made it through all of those thorns
Girl into the woman I know
You're my all and more
You're my all and more
I found New York laying in your arms
We'll melt into the bedroom floor
Never knew I'd stay for so long
But it's deeper if I hold on

It's almost like I've been here forever
I'm obsessed with your brain
And I'd unfold it if you let me
What if we move to Canada
And buy some things we don't need?
Bring your mother's dog
Your paintbrush and some candy
And when they talk about those
People who up and leave
That could be us
That could be you and me
How you talk with your hands
And how you sigh like a movie
And we got luck so bad we have to laugh
What if we move to Canada
And buy some things we don't need?
Bring your mother's dog
Your paintbrush and some candy

People who up and leave

I think I'm gonna cut my hair
I think I'm gonna take a break from alcohol
Probably won't last that long
But it's killing you to stay the same
You've been thinking ’bout these changes
I think I’m gonna take some pills to fix my brain
'Cause I tried every other way
But some things you can't fix yourself
But it's sad that he’s doing the same thing over and over
But it's killing you to stay the same (Changes)

You've been thinking 'bout these changes (Changes)
And it's weighing on my chest
We keep our bodies tied together
To ignore what's coming next
I was driving you home in the middle of the night
But I couldn't bring myself to say goodbye
I was driving you home in the middle of the night
It's like dancing when the song's already over
I'm chasing fire when I'm running after you
Not just hold you close at night
We keep our bodies tied together
I was driving you home in the middle of the night

Keep chasing fire

It kills everything that you love  oh
Now  now  now
I’m losing myself on the run
And I flew to California
Thought I could leave
Every piece of you right here
Yeah I flew to California
Still wide awake
Oh the sun burned it on clear
How I still love you
I still love you
But sometimes you have to go
Trade your heart for bones
To know you need to come back home
Come back home
Paint-chipped skies
Nothing is ever as it seems

Blind to the world in between

'Cause I’ve been holding on too long just to let it end
Oh I must be walking on eggshells
Trying not to sell myself out
I bet that’s what she’s thinking
That’s when she said

Do you want it bad?

Do you want it bad?
Or are you just comfortable? (Oh-oh)
Do you want it bad?

I'm done getting stressed for you
I wash my hair out in the shower
But something still remains
A feeling that's so strange
And now I can't stop
Dishes in the kitchen
And dancing in the rain
You're singing in the shower
Your hair stuck in the drain
A party on the weekend
And everyone is here
But it feels so weird without you
And dancing in the rain (Oh)
Your hair stuck in the drain (Oh)
A party on the weekend (Woo)
And everyone is here (Oh)
But it feels so weird without you
Yeah
I wonder if the stars aligned
If there would still be you and me
I want to say that I'm alright
The truth is that I'm so much sad
I crashed the car the other night
Inside the strangest dream I had
(And I wonder what it means)

Men steady comin' after you  women steady comin' after me
Seems like everybody wanna go for self
And don't wanna respect boundaries

But I must admit there was a couple secrets I held inside
Just know that I try to always apologize

You don't even have to call  even check for me at all
'Cause the way I've been actin' lately has been off the wall
Especially towards you  puttin' girls before you
They've been watchin' everything I been doin' just to hurt you
Most of it just ain't true and they won't show you
How much of a queen you are to me and why I love you  baby

She walked out  said I was boring
About 3 AM  that's when I called my friends
We hit the bar  sent myself flying
Shit I said I'm never trying
'Til the bitter end  but every now and then
I wonder what it feels like to be more than I am
I traded all my friends for drugs and the internet
Ah shit  am I a winner yet?
Look quick  is he a winner yet?
Mom's back home with a drink and a cigarette
I traded all my friends for drugs and the internet
Ah shit  am I a winner yet?
Look quick  hasn't hit him yet
Mom's back home with a drink and a cigarette
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Still hasn't hit him yet
And I don't wanna base my actions
On reactions or the things they say
And I don't wanna hit delete
On all the parts of me that they might hate
So now I'm laying in my bed
And I can't get out my head
It's all because  all because

I wonder what it feels like
Like I can't trust my own brain
Unless it's screaming your name
I'd have it no other way
I'd have it no other way
And maybe that's why I stay
How many times can we pick up the same fight?
Can we keep screaming all night
And make up until it's light?
That's when I say that you're right
And feel your body on mine
Oh maybe that's why I stay

I met a girl at El Tejano  we danced
To Spanish covers of Nirvana  we danced
And got another margarita  she's from Reseda
Drinkin' after dark  that's when she stole my heart (Mmm)
She knew my friends  that's where the story begins
Standin' at the salsa bar  asked if it was mild
Took me by the hand and asked me if I had plans
I said  Gettin' drunk and pretendin' that I can dance
She laughed  I fell in love and now it's no goin' back
I met a girl at El Tejano  we danced
To Spanish covers of Nirvana  we danced
And got another margarita  she's from Reseda

We're going to my place tonight
I met a girl at El Tejano  we danced (I'm from wherever you're goin')
To Spanish covers of Nirvana  we danced (I'm from wherever you're goin')
And got another margarita  she's from Reseda (I'm from wherever you're goin')
Was I misunderstood?
You lookin' at me so cold
After all that we've been through
How could you pretend?
I'm someone that you don't know
But can you tell me
You see me walkin' towards
You're headed for the door
Why is your shoulder so cold?
I know it's hard to speak
With all our history
But that don't mean you should go

I'll send you pictures all the time
Of our friends when they're too drunk and telling stories
I'll keep you right here in my brain
Even when we're waking up in different cities
I know it's hard to feel so
Close to someone
That's so far away
But for now  I'll love you through the phone
And for now  our friends will fill this home
I'm really gonna miss you  but I'll kiss you through the screen
For now  'til you come home to me
In the shadow of the moon
Found a memory of that night we were in Portland  mmm
Of the moment I told you
That no matter where we are  you're still my best friend

And if I had a candle  I would wish you back to me
And next time that I see you  I'll make sure you never leave
Think I hit a wall
Running from the moment
So I don't recall
Waking up in a cold sweat
Someone else in this cold bed
I'd do anything to not be alone
All alone with the ceiling
All alone with this feeling
And I wonder if I'll ever let go
I tried spending my nights under someone new
But the truth is
I could spend my whole life getting over you
Getting over you
Getting over you
Getting over you
Getting over you
Getting over you
Getting over you

But the truth is

To not know who I am but still know that I'm good long as you're here with me
To be drunk and in love in New York City
Damn
I like me better when I'm with you

The way that we felt when we were kids?
We lived for the moment
And fear was a stranger to our lips
Wonder if that place still exists
Felt fire without matches
Made promises without fear of gettin' burned
Now we're always second-guessing
We think happy is expensive
Do you remember
The last time we felt something like this?
The way that it felt when we were kids

And we built castles out of couches
Felt fire without matches
Made promises without fear of gettin' burned
Now we're always second-guessing
We think happy is expensive
Way I feel and the way we kiss
Swear that nothing else in the world exists (Shhh)
Way I feel from the way we kiss
Cross my heart if we both forget
When we met
That seems really good
My hesitation and holdin' my breath
I led you into the garden of my loneliness
Wished that you left before it all burned down
I'm sorry what I do to ya
