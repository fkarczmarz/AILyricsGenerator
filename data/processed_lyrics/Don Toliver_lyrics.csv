"RamyOnTheBeat
Two lil' shorty on Bacardi
Ride that Harley  feel exotic
Smoke that gas  puff then pass (Oh)
Is that your ho? I beg your pardon
If it's not  I'm shootin' my shot (Go)
I'm going for the win like James Harden
Did my diamonds stay solid? (Yeah  yeah)
Shawty sloppy  lipstick poppin'
I get head all in the lobby (Let's go)
Fuck these niggas  they can't stop me
She hop in and pop a molly (Oh)
Did the dash  bound to crash
Catch a vibe  grab a dime
Now my life is so exciting (So exciting)
