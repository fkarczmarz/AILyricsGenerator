"She's real fine  my 409
My 409
Well I saved my pennies and I saved my dimes (giddy up  giddy up 409)
For I knew there would be a time (giddy up  giddy up 409)
When I would buy a brand new 409 (409  409)
Giddy up 409 (409  409)
Giddy up 409 (giddy up  giddy up 409)
Giddy up 40...
Nothing can catch her
Nothing can touch my 409 (409 ooooo)
(giddy up  giddy up oooo)
(giddy up  giddy up oooo)
(giddy up  giddy up oooo)
(giddy up  giddy up)
When I take her to the track she really shines (giddy up  giddy up 409)
She always turns in the fastest times (giddy up  giddy up 409)

And the warmth I missed

I've got my love to give
And a place to live
Guess I'm going to stay
It'd be a peaceful life
With a forever wife
And a kid someday
And pillow fights
Fantasy world and Disney girls
The conversation turns to girls we knew
When their hair was soft and long
And the beach was the place to go
With suntanned bodies and waves of sunshine

Recall senses sadly
Mirage like soft blue  like lanterns below

Whether whistling heaven's clouds disappear
Whether wind withers memory
Whether whiteness whisks soft shadows away

Eases the burning
Whether willing witness waits at my mind
Whether hope dampens memory
Whether wondrous will stands tall at my side

Whether whiteness whisks soft shadows away
Could make you laugh
I ask the sky just what we had

So hard to laugh a child-like giggle
When the tears start to torture my mind
So hard to shed the life of before
To let my soul automatically soar

Throw off all the shackles that are binding me down

And the now starts to get in my way

If the mind speaks of only today?

Through restful waters and deep commotion
Often frightened  unenlightened
I wrest the waters  fight Neptune's waters
Sail through the sorrows of life's marauders
Unrepenting  often empty
Seldom stumble  never crumble
Try to tumble  life's a rumble
Feel the stinging I've been given
Never ending  unrelenting
Heartbreak searing  always fearing
Never clearing  persevering
I work the seaways  the gale-swept seaways
Past shipwrecked daughters of wicked waters
Uninspired  drenched and tired

Never feeding all my feelings
Damn the thunder  must I blunder
There's no wonder all I'm under
Stop the crying and the lying
And the sighing and my dying
Buddy going to shut you down
It happened on the strip where the road is wide
(Oooo rev it up now)
Two cool shorts standing side by side
(Oooo rev it up now)
Yeah  my fuel injected Stingray and a four-thirteen
(Oooo rev it up now)
Revving up our engines and it sounds real mean
(Oooo rev it up now)
Tach it up  tach it up
Buddy going to shut you down
Declining numbers at an even rate
(Oooo moving out now)
At the count of one we both accelerate
(Oooo moving out now)
My Stingray is light the slicks are starting to spin
(Oooo moving out now)
But the four-thirteen's really digging in
(Oooo moving out now)
Got to be cool now  power shift - here we go

Superstock Dodge is winding out in low
But my fuel injected Stingray's really starting to go
To get the traction I'm riding the clutch
My pressure plate's burning that machine's too much
Pedal's to the floor hear the dual quads drink
(Oooo pump it up now)
And now the four-thirteen's lead is starting to shrink
(Oooo pump it up now)
He's hot with ram induction but it's understood
(Oooo pump it up now)
I got a fuel injected engine sitting under my hood
(Oooo pump it up now)
Shut it off  shut it off buddy now I shut you down

Around Nassau town we did roam
Drinking all night
Got into a fight
I want to go home
So hoist up the John B's sail
See how the mainsail sets
Call for the captain ashore
Let me go home
Let me go home
I wanna go home
The first mate he got drunk
And broke in the captain's trunk
The constable had to come and take him away
Sheriff John Stone
I wanna go home

And threw away all my grits
And then he took and he ate up all of my corn
Let me go home

This is the worst trip
I've ever been on

The winds of change fanned into flames
Student demonstrations spark
Down to Isla Vista where police felt so harassed
They called the special riot squad of the L. A. County Sheriff
Well there's a riot going on
There's a riot going on
There's a riot going on
Student demonstration time
The violence spread down South to where Jackson State brothers
Learned not to say nasty things about Southern policemen's mothers
Nothing much was said about it and really next to nothing done
Well there's a riot going on
There's a riot going on
Well there's a riot going on
Cause it's student demonstration time
When rally turned to riot up at Kent State University
They said the students scared the Guard
Though the troops were battle dressed
Four martyrs earned a new degree
The Bachelor of Bullets
I know we're all fed up with useless wars and racial strife

I have watched you on the shore
Standing by the ocean's roar

We could ride the surf together
While our love would grow
In my Woody I would take you everywhere I go
So I say from me to you
I will make your dreams come true

 Brother John?
 the fired rose
 the dim last toasting
 I
 a broken man too tough to cry
But that's not me
I wanted to show how independent I'd grown now
But that's not me
I could try to be big in the eyes of the world
What matters to me is what I could be to just one girl
I'm a little bit scared 'cause I haven't been home in a long time
You needed my love and I know that I left at the wrong time
My folks when I wrote them told 'em what I was up to
Said that's not me
And said that's not me
I miss my pad and the places I've known
And every night as I lay there alone
I would dream
I soon found out that my lonely life wasn't so pretty
I'm glad I went now I'm that much more sure that we're ready

If you brought a big brown bag of them home
I'd jump up and down and hope you'd toss me a carrot
I'm gonna keep well my vegetables
Cart off and sell my vegetables
I love you most of all
My favorite vege-table
I tried to kick the ball but my tennie flew right off
I'm red as a beet cause I'm so embarassed
I know that you'll feel better
When you send us in
Your letter an'
Tell us the name of your

I know that you'll feel better

Tell us the name of your
Then we wouldn't have to wait so long
And wouldn't it be nice to live together
In the kind of world where we belong?
You know it's gonna make it that much better
When we can say goodnight and stay together
Wouldn't it be nice if we could wake up
In the morning when the day is new?
After having spent the day together
Hold each other close the whole night through
But happy times together we've been spending
I wish that every kiss was never-ending
And then we'd be happy (And then we'd be happy)

I try hard to be more what you want me to be
But I can't help how I act when you're not here with me
And after all I've promised you so faithfully
You still believe in me
I wanna cry
Cry
Ah
Ah
Floating over the raging sea
How deep is the ocean?
How deep is the ocean?
I'm a rock in a landslide
Rolling over the mountainside
How deep is the valley?

I'm a leaf on a windy day
How long will the wind blow?
