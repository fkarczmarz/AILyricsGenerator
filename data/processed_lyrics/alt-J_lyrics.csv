lyrics
"À cinq heures du matin sur le plafond  ok
Qu'importe ce que j'ai bu  je serais jamais assez vieux pour apprendre à mener une vie sage
Si tu voyais dans quel état j'écris  tu me trouverais sûrement pathétique  mais bon
T'es plus jalouse  on est deux  mais je t'entends parler de lui et je ressens des montées de violence
J'croyais qu'j'avais des bonnes ondes
Mais j'viens de défoncer ma porte : sombre
Trop tard même si je m'en rappelle  j'ai jamais su te dire à quel point je tiens à toi
J'suis le plus froid de tous les hommes
Mais tu peux tout lire dans mes yeux
Dire je t'aime  c'est pour les autres
Oh  these three worn words
Oh  that we whisper like the rubbing hands
Of tourists in Verona
I just want to love you in my own language
Oh  oh
J'me suis encore allongé sur le goudron  c'est super sale
Mais j'suis tellement défoncé  j'me sens presque sur le sable
C'est pas un endroit pour dormir et mes chaussures le savent
Mais si j'avais ta tête sur mon cœur enflé  j'pourrais presque ronfler
Autour de gobelins Place d'It'
Inarrêtable  tant que mes muscles tiennent
Là  je cours avec une seule bière
Mais j'tombe avec  et j'entends ton rire qui résonne sur les murs de pierre
Sauf que t'es pas là et qu'mon moral a plus d'piles
Besoin d'une heure avec tes pupilles
Comme avant qu'on vive tous les drames
On rentrait chez moi pour désaouler  cachés sous les draps
Je te regardais comme si j'allais t'épouser dans la foulée
C'est mieux qu'de dire je t'aime à toutes les phrases

Stepped out one morning
The ground to be his bed
The sky his awning
A blue neon lamp in a midnight country field
So much your hugs become hold ons
Like the rubbing hands
Of tourists in Verona
I just want to love you in my own language
Good like burning wood
The wayward lad lay claim
To two thirsty girls from Hornsea
Who left a note when morning came:

The road erodes at five feet per year
Along England's east coastline
Was this your first time?
Love is just a button we pressed
Last night by the camp fire
Like the rubbing hands
Of tourists in Verona
Down in Tasmania
Where the devil's jaws are far too weak
To tear you away
Ooh  I wish you well
I wish you well

Ooh  my Adeline
I watch your morning swim again
Ooh  Kodachrome blue sky
Strokes from patch to warm patch
My sweet Adeline
Ooh  I wish you well (My Adeline)

And the old triangle went jingle-jangle
All along the Royal Canal

Before the dawn breaks on her sorry grasp
She never finds her bearings  sucking splash into her lungs
Though I cannot see  I can hear
Her smile as she sings
And though I cannot see  I can hear
Her smile as she sings
I sold my soul

For a sip at school

A swimming pool

Ice cold black fuel

I'll dive in
Swimming and drinking
And when my parents tell me to come in
I'll just ignore them and keep on drinking
Fizzy cola

Dumbfounded by the sizzle of the bubbles on the tongue
Sixty-six times underwater somersault

And you took me with a glance
Should've been on that last bus home
But I asked you for a dance
Now we go steady to the pictures
I always get chocolate stains on my pants
My father's going crazy
Says you're living in a trance
Dancing in the moonlight
Dancing in the moonlight
On this long hot summer night
And I'm on the streets again
Disobeyed another warning
Should've been home by ten
Now I won't get out until Sunday
I'll have to say I stayed with friends

Two tabs on your tongue
A herd of shepherds to herd the sheep
Who sleep apart
Both still pine for the other's side spine
Spoon as sleep starts

Your state worsens on my skin

A recording of you sleeping next to me
A cappella  I'm listening to you cover
Elliot Smith's Angeles
It's these times I'll need if you go
It's these times I'll need if you go  so
Get better  my darling
I know you will
Get better  my darling
I know you will get better
I'm drawn to the motorway
The cold whoosh of trucks passing
This nighttime under sodium light
The orange spread is soul-quietening
A younger you and a younger me meeting at The Serpentine
I am yours  you are mine
Happy birthday  staff smuggled in a card I made
It rests under your pillow
When out of ICU  you'll cringe at all the I love yous
The card retired the life of one biro
At this time  I wanted you to know

A younger you and a younger me meeting at The Serpentine
I am yours  you are mine
You were the baker  I'll christen this new era
With the smell of freshly baked bread
Your Nutella  I'll keep it in the cellar
You were always a fan of that spread
Six months on  there's a car crash outside
The fire brigade using the jaws of life
No flush at night to sound your return
I still pretend you're only out of sight
Front garden bouquet  I threw it at the fire brigade
I was admonished and told to go back inside
From the living room window  I stand and watch the white sheet go
Over the family car and I close my eyes
I still pretend you're only out of sight in another room
Smiling at your phone
I still pretend you're only out of sight in another room
Smiling at your phone
I still pretend you're only out of sight in another room
Smiling at your phone
I still pretend you're only out of sight in another room
Smiling at your phone  I still pretend
A younger me  a younger you
Meeting at The Serpentine
The beginning of spring  you wore those yellow ripped jeans
Your look defined my 2009
Your shyness stoked my boldness
Shall we go in? I smiled
Your hand warmed walking through the gallery
Get better
I know I will
Get better
 now I'm bleeding
 now I'm bleeding
Only fuck-ups need clean starts
I scream as you come my way
(I'm happier when you're gone)
Joe  Joe  Joe
The chime of loves texting your phone
Familiar as the clothes I own
California  Pensacola  go
I'm happier when you're gone
It's not easy  it's not easy
Homelessness at home
My life is bracing for your hug
You pass me to unplug your phone

She smiled and replied  You don't know what you're missing
If all the young men
Were hares on the mountain
How many young girls would take guns and go hunting?
If all the young men
Were fish in the water
How many young girls would undress and dive after?
If the young men could sing
Like blackbirds and thrushes
How many young girls would go beating the bushes?
But the young men are given
To frisking and fooling
I'm fucking loose  you're gorgeous  I don't care
Come closer  baby  slap me like that snare
Moon Shaped Pool plays in the velvet cell
Green neon sign reading Welcome to Hell
Leather slings fall like oxygen masks
We're going down  fuck my life in half
School of magic  with brooms and wands
Pairs of people tugging like hungry dogs
For bone  baby  in the house of slithering
Floor full of happy wizards scissoring
I don't subscribe to your cultural norms
My church's doctrine has lost its charm
Rise above the gloom of the jungle floor
I don't subscribe to your cultural norms
My church's doctrine has lost its charm
Family matters  I couldn't agree more
This is my family fisting me on the floor
Regret my safe word  one to ten in Japanese
At the party  carpet burning my knees
Na na na na na na na na na na na na
(Nē  sakki no sunea mitai ni aterushi  hoshī? Ji yaa sou suruwa.)

She sews those new blue jeans
To keep my gambling father drunk
Deep down in New Orleans
It's a happy happy happy happy fun day day
Like a bird flying over forest fire
My father feels the heat beneath his wings
And in debt he leaves for another town
My mother hides from pleasure
And thinks of Father on her knees
Lifted in the arms of God
Away from New Orleans
Happy happy happy happy fun day day
Butterflies and needles line my seamed-up join
Encased in case I need it
Hunger of the pine

Sleeplessly embracing
And so you finally use it

Cut from the same cloth

You and I

When I wake up in the morning light
Sunlight hurts my eyes
Bears heavy on my mind
Then I look at you
Then I look at you
Then I look at you
Then I look at you
Then I look at you
And the world's alright with me
Just one look at you
Just one look at you
And I know it's gonna be
A lovely day
For the night line

Blue and white gun made from Lego
All the vowels vow to hold your name
Keep your estate clean of me
I've pillowed you so many times this week
The dark seeks dark
The dark seeks dark
The nights of all my youth pressed into one glass of water
We have our weight: ten-thousand ladybirds
All the vowels vow to guard your name
Some things lie too deep for tears to well

Where will I be in two years?
Out to sea to my mother's arms

Awake and not awake
To be told of such hills
To be held in such spots
To behold such warmth
Call to arms these harmonies!
And in happy agony we sing
How green  how green was my valley?
How green  how green was my valley?
Oh  your deeps and your shades
Where the wild roses pray
Such heat from pride
Glorious  the voice of man!
Like the nightingales  we sing
How green  how green was my valley?
How green  how green was my valley?
Clear softness in our hymn
Soft  like coming rain
Soft  like Bronwen
Victoria! Victoria!
Voices our queen might envy
How green  how green was my valley?
Please wait by the line
And you know dispersive prisms rainbow
But my native optimism isn't broken by the light
The idea of life without company fell suddenly
It crashed through the ceiling on me and pinned me to the pine
And layer upon layer of hope and doubt
Will crush bones to oil in time
Are you a pusher or are you a puller?
I pull the weight towards me
Unless I have a woman pushing me
A canopy of red-billed quelea
Passed over the blue
To tell you the truth
And whispers on his last wings
But a waited phone never rings

Big toe feeling it through the hole in his sock
Car keys dangling absently from the lock
Of the Buick Regal parked to the side of the roadblock
Celly on the center console continued buzzing
Dissolve Me on the speakers is playing into the nothing
Faded blue polo shirt missing a top button
Khakis with a coffee stain ripping near where he cuff 'em
Tongue on the roof of his cotton mouth is feeling rough
And got a pocket full of stones and a cup full of Robitussin
Too many stars to count and the moon is high up and blushing
(The purple round her eye was deepening as he pleaded and backed away from the door)
(Sleeplessly embracing)
(Sleeplessly embracing)
Never seen the ocean so this lake will have to do
(Sleeplessly embracing)
Pumping his brakes to the sound of the beat

Leave the tarnished ring with a note inside of the shoe

Same thing ringing right until the voice messaging
Heater on her face to compensate for the chill
Plastic on the passenger window thunders at will
Is what Snake had said to her while she re-ing up on her pills
Pop a couple now as she driving around the woods
Knew from the beginning that marriage would be no good
Told him not to fall for the first available hottie
If you count the time he slipped into her room when she was seven
And he told her that he loved her and everything was okay
That was just a week before they took her mother away
(She knows that he's poison but he was the only one who stayed when she needed it most)
(Sleeplessly embracing)
Dress up like a princess and come out to the party
(Sleeplessly embracing)
Tired of the burning so this numb will have to do
(Sleeplessly embracing)
A little bit of dirt never hurt nobody
(Sleeplessly embracing)
Always protect the thing that you know is true
It's all fucked up now
Shoes taken off and placed upon the bank
Crickets in the distance are dissonant and he brakes
Of joy before he slipped back into his sinister ways
How well could he justify every choice that he'd make?
How little control a little girl could ever take
How little he cared in the moment if she would wake
It's dimming all the stars and it's muffling all the screams
It's now up to his waist and he's wading into a dream
She could be rid of him now at last
(Sleeplessly embracing)
The ripples disappear and there's nothing left to show
(Sleeplessly embracing)
Never been concluded so the end will have to do
(Sleeplessly embracing)
(Sleeplessly embracing)
Tomorrow it'll all be a perfect shade of blue
(Sleeplessly embracing) It's all fucked up now
(Sleeplessly embracing) It's all fucked up now

Two feet creep up the road
They advance as does his chance
(Ooh) Very yellow-white flash
A violent wrench grips mass
Mine is a watery pit
Painless with immense distance
Him five yards from his leg
Do not spray into eyes
I have sprayed you into my eyes
3:10 pm: Capa pends death
All colours and cares glaze to grey
Shriveled and stricken to dots
The left hand grasps what the body grasps not
Le photographe est mort
Painless with a great closeness
Reunited with his leg

My heart still thumps as I bleed
And all your friends come sniffing
Triangles are my favourite shape
Three points where two lines meet
'Til morning comes
Let's tessellate
And keep my whole lovely you
And keep us on my heart
Three guns and one goes off
Search the graves while the camera spins
Chunks of you will sink down to seals
Blubber rich in mourning

Happiness is between two buns
Feeling funky on a rolling boil
Smiles bend all over  can't control how I feel
It's just you and me now
Round of kimonos for my girls in the sun
Sending videos to friends in London
Strut like Stellan Skarsgård to and from the bar
Playing my candied tangerine Telecaster
It's just you and me now

Dragged by my sockets to a better place

Dry dunes cater for jumping boys
From the nape of her neck he made his descent
They watched men hurl from rock to sea
Your foothills
Your warm
Iris swims quietly beside me
And stretch themselves beneath
Blue dragonflies dart to and fro
I tie my life to your balloon and let it go
Your foothills
Walks to-to count-count her steps
Eighteen-teen strides and she stops to abide
By the law that she herself has set
That eighteen steps is one complete set
And before the next nine right and nine left
She looks up-up at the blue
And whispers to all of the above:
Of the great-great-great grey world of hearts
As all dogs everywhere bark-bark-bark-bark
It's worth knowing"
