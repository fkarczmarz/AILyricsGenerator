"Drop! 2 Furious
Drop! 2 Fast
Drop! 2 Furious
You just came home from doin a bid
Tell me whatcha gon' do? Act a fool!
Somebody broke in and cleaned out your crib
Just bought a new pair and they scuffed your shoes
Tell me whatcha gon' do? Act a fool!
Now them cops tryna throw you in them county blues
Evacuate the building and trick the pigs
See some fools slipped up and over-stepped they boundaries
Ya peeps talkin 'bout What kinda shits he on?
You think twelve gon' catch me? Gimme a break!
I'm super-charged with the hide-away license plate
It seems they wanna finger print me and gimme some years
They'll only get one finger while I'm shifting gears
Hydraulics all around so I shake the ride

Some punk just tripped up and made you spill your drink
Tell me whatcha gon' do? Act a fool!
Now your car just stopped on a empty tank
If you got late bills and you lost your job
Tell me whatcha gon' do? Act a fool!
If you about to get drunk and you ready to mob
Let's take it to the streets 'cause I'm ready to cruise
Just bought me and my cars all some brand new shoes
And the people just stare so I love to park it
And I just put a computer in the glove compartment
TV in the middle of my steering wheel
More speakers in the trunk than my ride can handle
'Cause the women love the paint and they can see their reflection
Because my side mirrors flap like a fuckin' bird
'Cause my folk ridin shotgun with a shotgun
You just got hustled for a wad of cash
Man whatcha gon' do? Act a fool!
Now your friends just smoked up your brand new stash
Say whatcha gon' do? Act a fool!
Now them girls up the block still runnin they mouth
If anyone talk bad about the Dirty South
Tell me what I'm gon' do? Act a fool!
I got my eyes wide shut and my trunk wide open
Did donuts last week and the streets still smoking
Slide a five to the junkie to clean my windshield
Got the whole crew ridin' and we startin' shit
I even got a trailer hitch with a barbeque pit
Now all you wanna do is get drunk and pout
Plus your new name is Fire 'cause we stomped you out
I kicked to fifth gear and tear the road apart
You'll be like lil John Q and get a Change of Heart
I'm about to blow this whole shit up to smithereens!
The pot holes in the street just bentcha rims
Tell me whatcha gon' do? Act a fool!
Catch ya man with another bitch up in ya bed
If the bottle's all gone and your eyes are red

 nothing’s been new since Big Daddy Kane

 buried in my ashtray

 I’m ya future and ya present
 6 number 1 peaks
 softer than the Pillsbury dough boy

 nigga  yeah
 if rappers want it  they can get it
 Hannibal Lecter shit
 bitch
The First Time it's been a problem
 your pop's should'a wore a condom
 I think you better come harder (Go hard)
 like will.i.am's barber
 fuckin' with Luda's not a great look
 unfriend you on Facebook
 my styles are goin' into labor
 I'm their daddy like Darth Vader
 it's kind of hard to overlook me
 it's kind of hard to overbook me
 is like a nigga playin' Tetris
 cause I got your bitch stayin' out way past her curfew
 that got away with these words
 like I been playin' Angry Birds
 Dark Knight like Batman
 the Ghost follows like Pac-Man
 like Forest Whitaker
 you boys ain't ready for combat
 I laugh and be gone
 Bath & Beyond
 y'all niggas just bitches with dicks like Sheneneh
 your lines are just dead
 like a nigga just played
 you intermediate
 if your bitch Wikipedia'd it
 yes  some of my friends is still sellin' them drugs
 but ain't nobody ever stepped to me
 if you ever slept on me
 my mind is sharper than a guillotine
 from the knuckles of Wolverine
 but I still get a check
 the more we all win
 man  your plan is MetroPCS
 but my points go on the board
 fuck out of here  rewind that shit
Think I'mma try somethin that I ain't
I ain't never did before on this one
Let's go
Got that blueberry yum yum and it's that fire (it's that fire)
Got that blueberry yum yum and it's that fire (it's that fire)
Got a little bit of blueberry yum yum
And I never woulda thought that it could taste this gooooooooood
Thank God for the man who put it in my hooooooood
It's got me singin melodies I never thought I woooooould
I'm feelin sorry for the homies who be smokin woooooood
Chop chop  break it down for a player like ye ye ye ye..
I'm 'bout to find me a woman and skeet skeet skeet skeet..
I'mma keep smokin 'til I reach my peak peak peak peak..
Or 'til I'm stuck and my body feels weak weak weak weak..
But it just ain't cool cause right on after  I'mma have-ta go
And continue on my mission fishin for the yum yum but I'm movin slowwww

And burning bridges can't be crossed
Lord won't you let me know
Or give me one more reason to go
I done took all I could take from you
Need a little bit more than a break from you
You done did so much wrong I hope you get it right
When I did everything in my power to help and please you
Too many emotions I try to bury
But I'm only responsible for my daughters Cai and Karma

Cos I move in speed not to get caught up in this fake shit
Smiling in my face when I'm around y'all
Is it cause you'll never sell as many records?
And misery loves company now that you're going through it?
Somebody tell these rappers I walk hard in these Louis
I see them drugs got y'all trippin' too soon
So while you contemplate making your first million
I'll be somewhere contemplating on making my first billion
When all your love is lost
And burning bridges can't be crossed
Lord won't you let me know
Or give me one more reason to go
The biggest mistake we make as individuals
Is thinking everyone lives by the same principles
But when I talk by the same teachers and principals
So I can't expect you to know what I'm talkin' 'bout
As if you know what I'm talkin' 'bout
When all your love is lost
And burning bridges can't be crossed

What I'm 'sposed to do? It's such a sweet thang
Work that track  whip 'em like Kunta
That's why they stay down  they loyal citizens of Zamunda
By way of A-T-L  if you disagree
Don't even look at me ho don't pass go just go straight to jail
With no probation or bail  but this ain't Monopoly
It's Jolly Green Giants cause we smoke so much broccoli
Uh-oh  Spaghetti-O's! Luda's oodles of noodles
And testing me  is like pitbulls put up to poodles
My rap career goes back further than your father hairline
It's ludicrous - I pack more nuts than Delta Airlines
I'm fly  even when I get high I work cash
And even got my coach bumped up to first class
I'm boss to all employees - and I'm here to teach the principle
Cause I've been saved by mo' bells than Lark Voorhies

Fuck you too! What you wanna do?!
Scrawny nigga  but I got a arsenal of automatics down to .22s
Know how to use 'em  fight dirty as SHIT
I throw a grenade and all-in-one bury a CLIQUE
You see  y'all got it all wrong like women in tuxedos
And comin' up shorter than five Danny DeVitos
I'm on a cool ranch  get laid more than Fritos
With five strippers  four wives and three amigos
I go scuba divin in Bays at Montego
I find gold links and snatch 'em  like I'm Deebo
But I'm the light-skinte-ted version of Mandingo
I've seen more Beatles and Jagged Edges than Ringo
I used to run numbers in line they caled me BINGO
Old asses like sharpeis  y'all all wrinkled
And I stay with more BULLETS  than yo' Billboard singles
C.P. set a bigger trap look at that Godby Road and Old Nat
Where they kick it at? And a lot of people just don't know
Shady Park you heard just don't go
Quick to flip the bird up po'-po'
Makin the way for that rodeo  that rodeo show!
Gotta hit 'em with a reload  I gotta put 'em with the people
Tons of fun with guns
Fuck all the lil' chit-chat get back get that get that
Who knows  who goes there? Motherfuckers it's Poppa Bear
Stop and stare  pourin out a lil' gasoline and then drop a flare
I'm on  FIRE! And you know I can't stop 'til I re-TIRE!
Right down the avenue  passin you rapidly stackin
In the back of the Cadillac and packin emergency action
Packin a lunch and then BITE BITE!  A-T-L stay TIGHT TIGHT!
Light showers and you're probably hookin up with that girl
It's okay to check in that Motel 6
I just don't pay 'em
I'm kinda hopin that maybe you wanna kick it in the L.A.C
So later on we'll be rollin'
My niggas never listen but I told 'em
When I catch you at the game runnin game at the A.U.C
Then later on we'd be bonin'
No wonder why you wakin' up swollen

Comin at the fatty in a platinum Caddy so back it up fast
On the back and leave it drippin down the crack of her ass
When I'm feelin scummy I love to cut
Smell the aroma of a dingaling king Ludacris when I'm in yo' house
Check the ratio of men to women and women to men when down south
So we love that c-c-c-c
Now I got the feelin' we can cut the hell out each other
And I hope we be the same thang (freaks)
Handlin' business while I bang bang (skeet)
Wash the dick off and kick off another session again
The pieces from the East is the shit
And the flesh in the West is the best
But Twista love them Chicago and South hoes
Ludacris in the back of your Cheverolet
So magical I come and touch the game
You motherfuckers really lust to gain
Nothin' but hatin and a look of disgust
Wonderin why they don't be bustin' the same
She give me the booty I'm breakin' it off
I can tell her style by the way that she walks
Fatty flickin' like it was dubs on it
Pullin' rubbers and swishers up out your Prada bag
Makin' you stutter from the b-body butters and backrubs
It's killin me thinkin about the bottles that pop
If it tickles in the middle from Mr. Pickles you try to escape
So give me the rope you gettin' wrapped up
Ya duty's to figure the booty's gettin slapped up
I love them chicks that be thick as a loaf of bread
How I dip up in it we can make a video
But I got the radio bumpin Jagged Edge by the bed
When you wanna get up witcha cutty buddy
Come on and dip off through the hideout with Twist'
But after we do what we gon' do get ya purse and get together
In your condition I'm wishin you'll take a lickin'
And keep on tickin' from thicker thighs
We love to cut up cause we like them freaky thangs
Cause girl I ain't got nothin but time
Let a nigga get a little cut up girl
We love to cut up cause we like them freaky thangs
Cause girl I ain't got nothin but time
Let a nigga get a little cut up girl
I come from the eighth planet in the 19th galaxy
I'm the Prince dick of insanity

Now you might come for vacation  leave on probation
Home of the strip club  known for the thick girls
Where the tricks put tips in the tip cup

Know what I need  yeah
I need some real good lovin'
'Cause I'm troubled by the things that I see
I need some real good lovin'
'Cause ain't nobody been around here lovin' on me
It's better to love and then lost than to never have loved at all
If that was true I wouldn't be drinking this alcohol
Every relationship failed to take a toll on you
Especially when you had hoes and area codes on you
Is it easier to erase my memories
At a point when most of my past women became my enemies?
Some on the fence  some befriended me
But when we see each other it's gon' be some weird energy
I'm sorry that we couldn't make it work
Believe in your heart  I never intended to make you hurt
Now they see me on the blogs with my new girl
Friends talking 'bout that's supposed to be you  girl
I need some real good lovin'
'Cause I'm troubled by the things that I see
I need some real good lovin'
'Cause ain't nobody been around here lovin' on me

I got a empty hole in my chest
How do I fill it? Somebody give a prescription
I guess I gotta learn to live with regrets
Pay for mistakes and your exes take a commission
But what's a percent off the top when you hit the bottom
After you break up wondering how to live without 'em?
Need solutions  less problems
Cause if love will drive you crazy I belong in the insane asylum
Hear the rain  feel the pain inside 'em
Kinda lost  need someone to guide 'em
It's nothin' worse than feelin' alone
But I'll admit to feelin' better when I'm hearing this song  it goes
I need some real good lovin'
'Cause I'm troubled by the things that I see
I need some real good lovin'
'Cause ain't nobody been around here lovin' on me
Playing empty songs when I'm blowing my high
Feeding my heart to a lion called guilt on an empty bed
On an empty bed
Dwelling on the past  all the moments on repeat
Playing empty songs when I'm blowing my high
Feeding my heart to a lion called guilt on an empty bed
While I lose my mind
So you know what I need
I need some real good lovin'
'Cause I'm troubled by the things that I see
I need some real good lovin'

Stop drinking for a year and I was all sober
Next year I got drunk and did it all over
Yesterday I quit smoking and swore I had enough
Till I smelt it in the club and had to take a puff
I got rich and learned life was a bitch
Now everybody's after all of my ends
(Get yo hand out my pocket!)
When I was broke all love from my folks
But nowadays I'm losing all of my friends let the story begin
The grass is always greener on the other side
Always searching for another high
The grass is always greener on the other side
Caterpillar to a butterfly
The grass is always greener on the other side
Always searching for another high
The grass is always greener on the other side

Start exercising and winning got me a six pack
Was eating healthy and did away with the junk
Then I got lazy and started to wanna kick back
My six pack reverted back to a gut
When I'm at the crib I'm mad I'm not at the club lit
When I'm at the club I'm mad I'm not at the crib
I used to be out partying every damn night
Now sometimes I'd rather be with my kids
I got checks gained a lot of respect now everywhere I go they holla my name (Luda!)
But sometimes wish that I was disguised for peace of mind over fortune and fame
Guess what I'm really saying is
The grass is always greener on the other side
Always searching for another high
The grass is always greener on the other side
Caterpillar to a butterfly
The grass is always greener on the other side
Always searching for another high
The grass is always greener on the other side

Last year got the Ferrari that I always wanted
Drove it crazy got sick of it had to trade (Give me my Ac'!)
All my fans convinced me to grow my hair back
Grew it back then started missing my fade
I got hits start trippin' I wasn't underground
Got underground start trippin' I need hits (We outta here!)
When you down and people give you the runaround
But feels great to know who really gives a shit
You cut the grass and the snakes will show
And know your neighbor's fertilizer is fake (Don't let it fool ya!)
We always searching for what we never had
Always ignoring what's in front of our face
We've been conditioned to think
The grass is always greener on the other side
Always searching for another high
The grass is always greener on the other side
Caterpillar to a butterfly
The grass is always greener on the other side
Always searching for another high
The grass is always greener on the other side
Caterpillar to a butterfly
Bye bye butterfly
Fly away
Bye bye butterfly
 to the game then fucking blew up
 I ain't took a breath yet
 waiting to shape up and ship out
 Wake up and kick out!
 spit the government chip out
 A-Town down and then I dipped out
 the Osh Kosh was picked out
 even my baby stroller was tricked out
 the little nigga's out of control
 to grow from an infant to toddler was effervescent
 and it was a blessing to rhyme and start rapping
 shit I made it a bird
 all I need is the word
 ice is cool but them pots is hot
 five bricks and my Gucci duffle bag
 I run with a Playaz Circle
 all we do is smoke
 look
 Hyundais to Bentleys
 no more Popeye's and Blimpie's
 from one room to mansions
 no MARTA
 but harder
 kiss on the cheek to doing the nasty
 low lefts  even stevens and fades
 one gold with yo' initial
 group shots  can you remember?
 had North Clayton crazed
 man crews from all around
 bumpin Kilo
 Cross Colour and Paco
 tux and Kangol was so cool
 Hamwood and Diplomats
 G.I. Joe's and Thundercats
 before the Starter jacket jacks
 Crown Victorias police unmarked cars
 Wayne Williams was out there  but we ain't care
 that's a bet
 smack your hands and say sweat
 box Chevy Caprice
 cut da whole Disturbin' Tha Peace
 broke niggas call 'em non cents
 it's Lil' Fate payin homage to College Park
 no gold or plat
 clothes got torn
 brush naps and calm streets
 wood wheels and plush seats
 man
And I'm close to the edge  so your parents can come push me
I curse so much just to get on they nerves
I got kids actin' a fool from the traps to the 'burbs
My filthy mouth  it won't fight cavities or beat plaque
So I shot the tooth fairy and put my old teeth back
I take a shit on the equator  the size of a crater
And make government officials breathe harder than Darth Vader
It's the chicken and the beer that makes Luda keep rappin'
But no pork on my fork  I don't even speak pig Latin
I go fishin' on my lake  with yo bitch as the bait
Plus I eat many MCs  but I don't gain no weight
The numba one chief rocka  clean out yo' rap lockers
I'm as stiff as a board  y'all more shook than maracas
But my trix ain't for kids  if you dig'um you'll get smacked
I'll clock ya I'll spring forward  you fall back
Every album that I drop has got more than ten bangers
That's cause I'm a shot caller  y'all fools is Crank Yankers
Ain't a damn thing changed but the ice on my chain
To get chicks from Portland  Oregon to Portland  Maine
Now I roll up torpedoes  get blunted with rastas
For a hefty fee  I'm on your record like Bob Costas
I own so many jerseys  I'm a throwback mess
I hit the cleaners and tell 'em I want a full-court press (Ow)
So momma toast your glass while I'm countin' my cash
'Cause every single is a smash  I'm hot as a camel's ass
The competition never just wanna admit that they lost
And that they last about as long as my part in The Wash
From yo' car to a crap game  no one rolls wit'chu
One of Mini-Me's shoes got more sole than you
So by the time you figure out why your record ain't spinnin'
I'm in the strip club smokin' with President Clinton
So stand clear of the long sideburns and goatee
They made the mold of the penis enlarger off me (Me)
I'll be in another room when I hit from the back
Not to mention my refrigerator's taller than Shaq (Yeah)
So yippie kay yay  yippie yie yie yo (Yo)
If you can't swim  don't smoke my hydro ('Dro)
I've been lookin for a woman just to put my stamp on
But a lot of y'all are mo' stuck up than tampons (Woo)
So wash all your sins away and stop playin' (Yeah)
If God's line is busy you might have to two-way him (Mhm)
Then catch me in your backyard  playin' croquet
Or watch me swing my chain at the Roscoe's off Pico
Got seven cars  get all my rims at Chrome Depot
And people think I'm bad  they say Ooh  he's so evil!
'Cause I go on blind dates with actual blind people (Ow)
But my album's out the store  yours be on the shelf
I heard you masturbate a lot  so y'all keep to yourself
'Cause these women want a man that stay up and stay strong
Like the NBA  you gotta play hard or go home
All that shit that y'all talkin'  y'all can pop it to them
'Cause Ludacris'll beat you down with a prosthetic limb
I put my foot so deep in your ass that you can smell it
And your breath will turn to Foot Locker water repellant
I'm the man  I got money far as the eyes can see
So much money in my jewelry that I'm damn near sorry
So I'ma trade my earrings in and get a Ferrari (Woo)
I buy cars with straight cash  have meetings with Donald Trump
Y'all meet with Honda  no payments for twelve months (Uh-huh)
Take a look at yo' life  and no wonder you so sad
You's a ho  I said that you's a ho (Ho!)

With ho energy to do what you do
Blew what you blew  screw what you screw
Y'all professional like DJ Clue  pullin' on my coat tail
And why do you think you take a ho to a hotel?
Ho tell everybody  even the mayor
Reach up in the sky for the ho-zone layer
Come on playa once a ho always
And hoes never close they open like hallways
And here's a ho cake for you whole ho crew
And everybody wants some 'cause hoes gotta eat too

(Whoo!) I fill 'er up  balloons
Test her and guns get drawn like cartoons
D'oh  but I ain't talkin 'bout Homer
Chick's so bad the whole crew wanna bone her  yeah
My chick bad  my chick hood
My chick do stuff that your chick wish she could
My-my chick bad (and I'm lovin' it!)  my chick hood

My-my-my chick bad  badder-badder than yours

Now all these bitches wanna try and be my bestie
But I take a left and leave them hangin' like a testie
Trash talk to 'em then I put 'em in a Hefty
Runnin' down the court I'm dunkin' on 'em  Lisa Leslie
It-it-it-it-it's goin' down  basement
Friday the 13th  guess who's playing Jason
Tuck yourself in  you better hold onto your teddy
It's Nightmare on Elm Street and guess who's playin' Freddy
My chick bad  chef cookin' for me
They say my shoe game crazy  the mental asylum lookin' for me
(Ha ha ha ha)  you a rookie to me
I'm in that wham-bam purple Lam  damn bitch you been a fan
My chick do stuff that your chick wish she could

I got a college girl who go to church e'ry Sunday
Had her sneak out of choir rehearsal to put it on me
Gave it to her yesterday while she was doin laundry
Text me from work and told me she was horny
You my nasty girl forever I promise
She plays like my house is her emergency room
Tells me to undress and to lay on the sofa
Checks all my vitals like a doc's supposed ta
And nothin underneath so it's an all night deal
I'm her number one patient and delighted to be
And when she needs her medicine I give her vitamin D
But wait! I got a lawyer girl that's so wild
And every single night she wanna take me to trial
So I put her on the stand and I give her the truth!
Cause I'm hung like a jury (jury)
Judge Luda preside over your body and I'm never in a hurry
And if I call a mistrial we gotta do it again
(Woo!) Back again! (That's right)
Luda!
Hahahaha (Feel this)
It gets meaner and meaner each time  baby
Feeling real good  too (Holla at 'em  man)
What up  Uncle 'Face? (Yeah!)
Haha  haha
I'm a bull in this industry  man (Tell 'em)
Some would rather run down and get one cow (Nah)
I think I'd rather walk down and get 'em all—you know what I'm talking 'bout  right? (You know what's up  right?)
Look—
I'm never going nowhere  so don't try me
My music sticks in fans' veins like an IV
Flows poison like Ivy—oh  they grimy!
Already offers on my sixth album from labels tryna sign me
Respected highly  Hi  Mr. O'Reilly!
Hope all is well—kiss the plaintiff and the wifey
Drove through the window  the industry super sized me
Now  the girls see me and a river's what they cry me
I'm on the rise  so many people despise me
Got party ammunition for those tryna surprise me (Surprise!)
It's a celebration  and everyone should invite me
Roll with the crew or meet the bottom of our Nikes (Bow!)
Explorer like Dora—these Swipers can't swipe me
My whole aura's so mean in my white tee
Nobody light-skinned'ed repping harder since Ice-T
You disagree  take the Tyson approach and bite me!

Ready to break the steering column on your Impala
If I get caught  bail-out  po'-po'—I tell 'em  Holla
In court  I never show up  like Austin Powers' fa-zha
But can buy anything I want from the records I've sold
Jacuzzi's hot  Cristal is so cold
Neighbors catch contacts from the blunts that I've rolled
A pig in a blanket  a shmoke and a pancake
Drop albums nonstop  once a year for my fans' sake
I crush mics until my hand breaks
Then shag now and shag later 'til these women can't stand straight
The Luda-meister got 'em feeling so randy
I'm double-X-L  so I call 'em my eye candy
Brush my shoulder and I pop my collar

Make music for Mini-Mes  models and Fat Bastards
These women trying to get me out my Pelle Pelles
They strip off my clothes and tell me  Get in my belly!
Stay on the track  hit the ground running like Flo-Jo

So when you go to certain places you'll be thinkin of me
But be careful where you walkin' when you swingin' them hips

I used to think that it was way too cold
'Til I went to Canada and saw some beautiful hoes

Please put both of your pinky fingers high in the air?
Let's see if we can weed some of these niggas out
Cause it ain't no way that all these niggas could be pimpin'
Now if you happen to see a nigga
With two sweat patches up under his arms
Look like he been swimmin' in shoulder height water
If you smell like you been at work all day and Drakkar
Please put your hands down
Now look up at the pinky fingers that are still in the air
If you see him ashy around the knuckles
Like the nigga wash half of his hands
And lotion three quarters of his body
If you are dancin' on the dancefloor
And you look to your left and your right
And there is not a woman in sight
Guess what? You guessed it - you are not pimpin'
If your vodka and cranberry is really really dark like blood
That's because you didn't order Vodka buddy

In the back door (NIGGA WHAT?!)
Act like I don't make clouds
How you gonna act like I don't get loud?
How you gonna act like I don't rock crowds?
And leave a lot of people with a gap-tooth smile
If I recollect right then you sound like dirt
But I guess what you don't really know don't hurt
Don't it smell so good?
In Southwest where they rep that hood

Act like I just do rap
How you gonna act like I just ain't strapped?
How you gon' act like I don't push 'Lacs?
Don't it smell so sweet?
I'll see you later when we in them streets

I wanna get you in the Georgia Dome on the 50-yard line
While the Dirty Birds kick for t'ree
And if you like in the club  we can do it
In the DJ booth or in the back of the V.I.P
Whipped cream with cherries and strawberries on top  lick it don't stop
Keep the door locked  don't knock while the boat rock
We go-bots and robots  so they got to wait til the show stop
Or how about on the beach with black sand?
Lick up your thigh then call me the Pac Man
Table top or just give me a lap dance
The Rock to the Park to the Point to the Flatlands
That man named Ludacris (woo!) in the public bathroom
Or in back of the classroom
How ever you want it  Lova Lova gonna tap that ass soon
See I cast 'em and I passed 'em
Get a tight grip and I grasp 'em
I flash 'em and outlast 'em
And if it ain't good then I trash 'em
While you stash 'em  I'll let 'em free
And they tell me what they fantasy
Like up on the roof  roof
Tell your boyfriend not to be mad at me!

I wanna get you in the bath tub
With the candles lit  you give it up 'til they go out
Or we can do it on stage at the Ludacris concert
'Cause you know it got sold out!
A red carpet dick it just roll out
Go ahead and scream  you can't hold out
We can do it in the pouring rain
Running the train  when it's hot or when it's cold out
How about in the library on top of books?
But you can't be too loud!
You wanna make a brother beg for it
Give me TLC 'cause you know I be too proud
We can do it in the White House
Try to make them turn the lights out
Champagne with my campaign
Let me do the damn thing
What's my name  what's my name  what's my name?
The sauna  jacuzzi  in the back row at the movie
You can scratch my back and rule me
You can push me and just pull me
On hay in middle of the barn
Rose petals on the silk sheets
Eating fresh fruit  sweep your woman right off her feet
I wanna  li-li-li-lick you from your head to your toes
And I wanna  move from the bed down to the  down to the  to the flo'

I wanna get you in the back seat  windows up
That's the way you like to fuck
Clogged up  fog alert
Rip the pants and rip the shirt
Rough sex: make it hurt
In the garden all in the dirt
Roll around Georgia Brown: that's the way that I like it twerked
Legs jerk  overworked
Underpaid  but don't be afraid
In the sun or up in the shade
On the top of my Escalade
Maybe your girl and my friend can trade
Tag team  off the ropes!
On the ocean or in the boat!
Factories or one hundred spokes!
What about up in the candy store?
That chocolate  chocolate make it melt
Whips and chains  handcuffs
Smack a little booty up with my belt
Scream help! Play my game!
Dracula  man  I'll get my fangs
Horseback and I'll get my reins
School teacher  let me get my brains
I wanna  li-li-li-lick you from your head to your toes
And I wanna  move from the bed down to the  down to the  to the flo'
Then I wanna  Ahh ahh  you make it so good I don't wanna leave
But I gotta kn-kn-kn-know  what-what's your fan-ta-ta-sy?
I wanna  li-li-li-lick you from your head to your toes
