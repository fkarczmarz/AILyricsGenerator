" search your soul
 it's not worth tryin' for
 it's not worth dyin' for
 I do it for you
 you will find
 take my life
 I would sacrifice
 there's nothin' I want more
 like your love
 unless you're there
 all the way yeah
 you can't tell me it's not worth tryin' for
 there's nothin' I want more
 yeah
 just look into your heart
 I'll be there
You will see
What you mean to me
Search your heart
Search your soul
And when you find me there
You'll search no more
Don't tell me
It's not worth tryin' for
You can't tell me
It's not worth dyin' for
You know it's true
Everything I do
I do it for you
Look into your heart
You will find
There's nothin' there to hide
Take me as I am
Take my life
I would give it all
I would sacrifice

Like your love
And no other
Could give more love
There's nowhere
Unless you're there
All the time

You can't tell me it ain't worth dying for
I will die for you
All the time
Take me by the hand
I wanna be the shower when you sweat
I got to be the tattoo on your skin
I wanna be the sheets when you sleep
Let me be the secrets that you keep
I gotta be the spoon to stir your cream
I wanna be the one that really makes you scream
I wanna be your high heels when ya kick it
From your feet up to your hair
I wanna be your underweear
I wanna be the itch that you scratch
Wanna be your chair when you relax
I got to be the razor when you shave
Wanna be the habit that really makes you crave
Oh yeah! I wanna be your hot tub when you're dippin'

 gonna be 18 'til I die
 forget about the past
 we're gonna have a blast
 gonna be 18 'til I die
I'll be a man of good faith
Then in love you'll live
I'll be the rock you can build on
Be there when you're old
To have and to hold
When there's love inside
I swear I'll always be strong
Then there's a reason why
I'll prove to you we belong
I'll be the wall that protects you
From the wind and the rain
From the hurt and pain
Let's make it all for one and all for love
The one you need
When there's someone that should know
Then just let your feelings show

Then I found you and you helped me through
And you showed me what to do
And that's why I'm comin' back to you
Like a star that guides a ship across the ocean
That's how your love can take me home  back to you
And if I wish upon that star  that someday I'll be where you are
Yeah  I know that day is coming soon
Yeah  I'm comin' back to you
You've been alone  but you did not show it
You've been in pain  but I did not know it

I had a dream that we flew on golden wings
Follow the voice that's callin' you home
We are like birds of a feather
We are two hearts joined together
We will be forever as one
My brother under the sun
Wherever you hear the wind in the canyon
Wherever you see the buffalo run
We are like birds of a feather
We are two hearts joined together
We will be forever as one
Under the sun
You might stop a hurricane
Might even stop the drivin' rain
You might have a dozen other guys
I'm going one way
Your way
Now it's such a strong way
Let's make it our way
Now baby
Can't stop this thing we started

Makes no difference if you're black or white
'Cause we can sing together in harmony
I know it's not too late

Do tours of the East
Contract diseases
Bury bones
Break up homes
Send flowers by phone
Take to drink
Go to shrinks
Give up meat
Rarely sleep
Keep people as pets
Train dogs

Bury treasure
Store up leisure

Can you take what you need
But take less than you give?
Could you close every day
Without the glory and fame?
Could you hold your head high
When no one knows your name?
That's how legends are made
At least that's what they say
We say goodbye
But never let go
'Cause you can't save every soul
Gotta take every chance to
Show that you're the kinda man who
And never let go
Can you lose everything
You ever had planned?
Can you sit down again
And play another hand?
Could you risk everything
For the chance of being alone?
Under pressure find the grace
Or would you come undone?

Right now I feel
Just like a leaf on a breeze
Who knows where it's blowin'?
And who knows

 learn to be a day like today
But I never thought that I'd be touchin' you
How was I to know
I'd let my feelin's go
And that I'd be yours before the night was through
One night love affair
Tryin' to make like we don't care
We were both reachin' out for somethin'
One night love affair
Pretendin' it ain't there
Oh - and now we're left with nothin'
When the mornin' breaks
We go our separate ways
If the night was made for love it ain't for keeps
But I lose control
As I watch you go
All my senses say I'm in this much too deep
Now you're outta reach
One night love affair
Tryin' to make like we don't care
We were both reachin' out for somethin'

Sometimes life ain't fair
Feels like the first kiss and it's gettin' better baby
No one can better this
First time our eyes met the same feeling I get
You still turn the fire on
You're the only one I ever want
I only wanna make it good
So if I love you a little more than I should
Don't deny me this pain I'm going through
Still feels like our best times are together
Feels like the first touch
We're still gettin' closer baby
Can't get close enough
I remember the smell of your skin

I know you wanted more but
Right now this is the best that I can do
If I give it too little too late
How was I to know?
I don't wanna give you up
So please stay
I just need a little time
And a little help to find
All the words to say
Please stay
Before you're walking out the door
I know you want more
So give me one more day
Please stay

As the seasons change  remember how I used to be
Now I can't go on  I can't even start
I got nothing left  just an empty heart
I'm a soldier  wounded so I must give up the fight
There's nothing more for me  lead me away
Or leave me lying here
Sound the bugle now  tell them I don't care
There's not a road I know that leads to anywhere
Without a light  I fear that I will stumble in the dark
Lay right down  decide not to go on
Then from on high  somewhere in the distance
There's a voice that calls  Remember who you are
If you lose yourself  your courage soon will follow
So be strong tonight  remember who you are
To be free once more
As long as you're gone we may as well pretend
I've been dreamin'
Straight from the heart
You say it's easy but who's to say
That we'd be able to keep it this way
But it's easier
Comin' straight from the heart
Tell me we can make another start
You know I'll never go - as long as I know
It's comin' straight from the heart
I see you on the street some other time
And all my words would just fall out of line
While we're dreamin'
Straight from the heart
Tell me we can make one more start
You know I'll never go - as long as I know
It's comin' straight from the heart

Bought it at the five and dime
Played it 'til my fingers bled
Was the summer of '69
Me and some guys from school
Had a band and we tried real hard
Jimmy quit and Jody got married
I should've known we'd never get far
That summer seemed to last forever
And if I had the choice
Those were the best days of my life
Ain't no use in complainin'
When you got a job to do
I spent my evenings down at the drive-in
Standin' on your mama's porch
You told me that you'd wait forever
I knew that it was now or never
Those were the best days of my life

We had the last laugh
And we felt some pain
We been through the toughest times
And we'd do it all again
