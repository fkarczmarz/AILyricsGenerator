"Just put on my best
I just want to know
Just a square
Just put on my best
What's wrong with me?
You  you came
Just put on my best
I just want to know
Just a square
Just put on my best
What's wrong with me?
You  you came
Just put on my best
I just want to know
Just a square
Just put on my best
What's wrong with me?
You  you came
Just put on my best
I just want to know
Just a square
Just put on my best

We sure can change the way we live
We can't only take
Also got to learn to give
People corrupt because they don't understand
There's a book of truths
And a book of lies
Think with your heart
Read between the lines
Things aren't always how they seem
We've got to make the best of it
Eye for an eye
Tooth for tooth
Sometimes we're blind
We can still see the truth
Well  we can't change the world
We sure can change the way we live
We can't only take
Also got to learn to give

 this haze
 be careful with
 I don't go home
 tell me love
 you're my favourite
 but we're phasing
 you're my favourite
 but we're phasing
 you're my favourite
 but we're phasing
 you're my favourite
 it's just broke apart
 it's just a break apart from us
You don't want it this way
But dark is the middle
And the walls are still wet clay
You slay an old nightmare
A mirrored display
Beneath all the wreckage
Is a form that wants to stay
I know you can hear me
You don't want it this way
But dark is the middle
And the walls are still wet clay
We'll make this a better place
We'll make this a better place
Cross the Moon and verse the days
The lows and news of all things be
Sunlight garden  low red blossoms
Moon tides of the sea
When struggling for the magic grain
We throw life to the winds like rain
For goodness sake  spare your failings and take
The ability to strengthen your spirit can stimulate all minds
Blossoms of days to come
Blossoms of days to come
Move away from your western guns
Travel towards eastern suns
Far above all earthly goals
A pledge for creation's soul
Spirit finds fresh morning in the dew of precious things
Hope is a phoenix spreading wings to fly
And what we wish shall be like a breath of fresh air
Stay from secret powers and no look can snare
Move away from your western guns
Travel towards eastern suns
Far above all earthly goals
A pledge for creation's soul

 I can't believe it's burning again

 I can't believe it's burning again
 I can't believe it's burning again
 I can't believe it's burning again

Now it grows on trees
There's no saint  and there's no sinner
Done more dirt than me
Another who can do more right than me
I need to find a paradise for me
When we want it  we just ask it
God is ready  but you don’t want it
So they tell me  Heaven's waiting for the sinner
God is ready  when you’re ready
World keeps turning
Shine your light
Shine  shine
So they tell me  Heaven's waiting for the sinner
God is ready  when you’re ready
Shine
When we want it  we just ask it
God is ready  when you’re ready
But you don’t want it  God is ready

 it's gone for good  let me tell you
 you know we would  if we could
 if I could
 breathe out the past
 as long as it lasts  let me tell you
 I'd make you so sweet
 baby  from your head to your feet
 then we'll never know how it ends
To keep the hope
Peaceful shall proceed
In every single way
Weather is in a style
To keep the hope
Peaceful shall proceed
In every single way
There comes a time when some will know
A time when trueborns really show
Can you depend on friends to help when you're in need?
Have they got problems of their own?
Your positivity's been shown
I told you so  you know
We'd face survival  we're leaving lights on
We'll move or go on somehow
Looking like soldiers waiting to drown
And I'm not around no more
And looking at people that don't make a sound
When music's around  stay warm
And we've got no rhyme or no reason now
We've got the time of our lives now
It's seasonal  nobody knows
We'll make it known somehow
Just you and me  and we can see
Small machines and sunrise
Looking like soldiers waiting to drown
And I'm not around no more

Lookin at people that don't make a sound

And we've got no rhyme and no reason now
Used to keep a lighthouse lit for you
Hoping there’s a chance you would stay sober and
Find your way back home without the booze
In this deep hole of shame
I’ve got secrets buried
In this deep hole of shame
There is no one to call
Love is in the eyes of the beholder  I’ve
Kept the clouds at distance from the blue
Hoping there’s a chance we’d change it over
(We were fighting but its over now)
(Picking pieces off the ground)
Picking up the pieces and make do
(Once so reckless but I’m older now)
(Picking pieces off the ground)
Love is in the eyes of the beholder  I
(We were fighting but its over now)
(Picking pieces off the ground)
Used to keep a lighthouse lit for you
(Once so reckless but I’m older now)

Hoping there’s a chance you would stay sober but

It’s not up to me to guide you through

I won't leave you
I won't leave you
I won't leave you
I won't
Your mind has set me free
Your mind has set me free
I won't
Your mind has set me free
But falling leaves hang on for life as time is ticking on
I wait and see the fire burn  it's burning to the ground
Save me  save me from the unknown
While I daydream  I leave this world to follow
My footsteps are sinking to the hollows
I can retrace the memories in my shadows
Consider that my time away was working for the soul
I studied all I had to face  the fear inside me grows
Save mе  save me from the unknown
Whilе I daydream  I leave this world to follow
My footsteps are sinking to the hollows
I can retrace the memories in my shadows
Save me  save me from the unknown
While I daydream  I leave this world to follow
My footsteps are sinking to the hollows
Possessions  some lessened to carry with me
Heavy and soothing  like a gentle symphony
I rest my head right back upon my seat
It's hard and cold  though the best thing for me
This train is moving  but my heart is stationary
Seasons change  surely it won't be the same
I'm hoping I won't stay the same
Reasons strange  why we all must play these games
I left it with you: a note that was discreet
I made sure I put it upon the cellar door
It's hanging  hoping  will you read it while I weep?
Last time  the last time it flickers through me
So vivid  it rushes from my head down to my feet
We're laughing  joking  through a dance to my defeat
Seasons change  it'll never be the same
I'm hoping I won't stay the same
Reasons strange  why we all must play these games

Cause every time I call
She's sitting sweeter
And I know she said
To get near her
But I'm feeling cold
And I must leave her
Sat down here with my head hung down
And I just seem to find
A bit of peace
A bit of love
A bit of something left behind
A bit of peace
A bit of love
A bit of something left inside
We shall go on 
Cause we can't go on living this way

And I just seem to find
A bit of peace
A bit love
A bit of something left behind
A bit of peace

We can't go on 
We shall go on in this embrace
Cause we can't go on living this way

What we don't need  release in rain

So near and so high
They're stopping for none
And when they has done
They agree that the sea
Is the best place to be
Wondrously free
They live happily
They know from the past
Life simply doesn't last
So they live for today
For tomorrow they may
Not be able to walk in the skies
Sun slips into horizon
Moon reaches for the stars
Music is the healer
No matter who you are
No matter who you are

So near and so high
They're stopping for none
