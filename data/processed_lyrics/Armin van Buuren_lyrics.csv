" freeze my burning soul
 I ran into the sun (You)
 it all comes down to you
 it all comes down to you (Oh)
 it all comes down (Oh)
 I ran into the sun (You)
 it all comes down to you
 it all comes down to you (Oh)
 it all comes down
 it all comes down to you
 barely alive
 have you seen it?
 are we alone?
 have you seen it?
 are we alone?
Just looking for another you
It's not getting any better
But what can I do
When there's something wrong
When we keep holding on
To the best days
I'm not saying I'm not sorry
Just looking for another you
Looking for another you
Just looking for another you
Just looking for another
Looking for another
Looking for another you
Looking for another you
Just looking for another
Looking for another you
I don't know any other way to show
It's not getting any better
I think we both know that
There's something wrong
When we keep holding on
To the best days
I'm not saying I'm not sorry
Just looking for another you

Some people long without knowing
We finally know how to be free
It’s how I feel everything for the first time
When every day is made of you and I
And we could dance tonight forever

With the sunrise in her eyes
All that she see is darkness
She won't tell you why
It's always raining
You lift me when I'm down
You're breaking through the clouds
And all she needs is shelter
Shelter for the night
And this one could be heaven
But she's looking down the line
You lift me when I'm down
You're breaking through the clouds

She keeps on praying

 where we used to go
 we’re still holding on
 darling don’t let me go

 what we had we never left behind
 darling don’t let me go
The world is at my feet
And it’s no wonder
Your eyes speak to me
They tell me be calm
They tell me be strong
Swimming out so deep
Now I can’t breathe
And it’s exactly where I belong
Cause it feels like the ride of a lifetime
And nothing’s gonna save us now
Let the waves come crashing down
Cause it feels like I’m right for the first time
And every time I take you in
I feel my heart skip a beat again
I'm drowning in your love
Love
It’s taking over
There's no in between to offer me some cover
Ohh oh
With every breath I feel my inhibition breaking
Cause it feels like the ride of a lifetime
And nothing’s gonna save us now

Wasted love
Wasted time
Wasted yours and I wasted mine
Wanna feel again
Unsaid words
Unlived nights
Unfelt feelings and uncrossed lines
Wanna feel again
Send me out like a shooting star
And I'm on my way
Wherever you are
Wanna feel again
Take my hands  raise 'em to the sky
Like there's no tomorrow
There's just tonight

Now we’ve been down this road a million times before
Cause it’s a sweet sensation
Thinking of all that hot temptation
You know it’s going right where you want
I keep breaking my own rules playing your love fool
Trying to forget about the consequence
We keep saying we should and yeah we know we could stop
But really what it all comes down to is
It feels so good
It feels so good

You say it’s dangerous you don’t wanna be exposed

Making mistakes they can never teach
But these silver clouds won't dissolve to black
Let's lose our feet to a leap of faith
And bigger skies that lie in wait
It's a long way down but I got your back
We're out on the edge of it all
We're out on the edge of it all
So feel the pull of an open thread
Unravel life 'til there's nothing left
It's a long way down but I got you now
We're out on the edge of it all
We're out on the edge of it all
And almost being struck by lightning
Staring at the light of the stars
It's like looking in the mirror
So if this what you are then you're honest
Everything is in on the outside
Clap as the sun goes down
Clap as the sun goes down
When the world stops spinnin' round
When the weight's too much to bear
Throw your hands to heaven
Look at what we've started
Everything comes from something
Throw your hands to heaven
Know that all there is to gain lies within arm's  reach
For the flaw lies in your head not in your heart
See  how the darkest night will soon bring light again
Now we're heading up high
Where no harm will get in our way
Will we ever touch ground again
Now it's a long way down
Now we're heading up high
Where no harm will get in our way
Will we ever touch ground again
Now it's a long way down
Now it's a long way down
See  when you're holding on to all but you can't  breathe
Know the dawn lies in your hands just let your heart  speak
And the darkest light will soon burn bright again
Now we're heading up high
Where no harm will get in our way
Will we ever touch ground again

You write my name across the sky whenever I'm with you

Though I don't care how high  how high that you take me
Oh that feeling keeps coming around
Like we're floating ten feet off the ground
Oh that feeling keeps coming around
Like we’re floating ten feet off the ground
All the nights without you that I don't want to remember
Like it was always written in the stars that we were together
I love that rush so much I just wanna taste it

I saw a world full of people
Everybody was dancin' and screamin' loud 
They were just there to listen to the music
Some even had their eyes closed
Everybody was just smilin'
It was deep
It was underground
Tranceparent
It was magical
It was a happy place
Celebrating music!
Celebrating life!
Men and women - free - without a worry
I wanna BE in that moment
The very essence of my existence is looking for that emotion
And when the weekend comes
See the truth behind the lies
Your lies are haunting me
See the reason in your eyes
Giving answer to the why
Your eyes are haunting me

I found you in the stars  with a heart made of glass
But the fire in your eyes  to me electrifies
As you and I collide
We could be safe  we could be alive
We could be free for the first time
Stand next to me  stand next to me
If you stand next to me  we could be indestructible
Stand next to me  stand next to me
You're everything I need
We could be indestructible
A fragile heart that keeps me warm
A little piece of heaven shining in the storm
If the fires gonna burn it's you that's gonna put me out
And if the rain falls down we'll rise above
Carry you home  carry you through the flood
Carry you through the flood

Only lonely for you at night
The sun doesn't shine
And I try to forget why
Why you're not here by my side
Made it through another day
I've been cleaning out my brain
I start to panic when the sun goes down
I stay this jacked 'til the lights go out
I don't wanna go back home
Don't wanna be alone right now
I already got a brand new life
Don't you know I'm moving on
And everyday I'm stronger
I don't even know you're gone

Can I get a scent of the mood you’re in
I’ve been floating on this sea for so long
I wouldn’t recognize a place called home
Oh and what a moment that was
How I got a taste of you in my blood
And remember how I wrote your name
On the rocks down by the river Seine
And I laughed because it was just too late
Even though I don’t know if it’s safe I’ll jump in it
I would do anything to find
And underneath the sky that’s full of stars
I’m looking for your name tonight
Maybe if I chase this dream
I’ll feel how you intoxicated me
Upon the bridge I hear a radio play
And it sounds like something you would say
And the feeling’s oh so holy as I dive tonight alone

If not constantly hollow and empty
What could this mean?

Who am I now that the silence surrounds?

 I can’t take anymore
 how I miss such a beautiful sound
 I don’t even know if I’m alive
 they remind me of the battle I face
 I’m going down
 I don’t even know if I’m alive
 I don’t even know if I’m alive
Keeps me breathing through the storm
My head above the crowd?
Can you see this light between us?
So come a little bit closer now
It's in our eyes
Believing what we hold
But sometimes we fall to pieces
In the dust
So we should dance like this forever
We're safer on the ground
When a million lights surround you
And you're moving to the sound
Don't waste another moment
It's waiting for you now
So dive in this new beginning
Let the glowing show you how

We'll take a ride outside together
The streets are lined with gold
And where the good become the wanted
Not the sold
Don't waste another moment

With your unrelenting spark
It always put a fire in me
You used to say I'm the one
The only ray of sun you could touch
Without a fear of burning
Well you used to try to please me
Yeah you used to try to please me
Never said this would be easy
Never said this would be easy
What are you telling her now
While you hold her in your arms
Are you pretending she’s me?
And just how long will you go on
Before you realize you know she's
The one but you're gonna lose her anyway?

Emotions running high with double meaning
Just another day to keep it calm within
But I can't find a way to fight this shadow dreaming
We're always waiting for the night
Never lost
We can go where the light shines brightest
We're always waiting for the night
So come with me
And we can go where the light shines brightest
Push and shove against the thoughts you left me with
Every picture of regret my expectation
Your emotions can't hide behind those eyes
Conversations comes quick to steal me back again

I'll be up before ya know it
Why am I awake?
Every time I see your number
I can't help but answer
Do you do the same?
When you see my name?
So come on give me all of your secrets
Come on over and I promise I'll keep them
We can lay here and listen to The Weeknd
Every minute 'til the weekend
If I'm gonna be tired all day
Cause you got me staying up so late
Reading into every word you say
Then why am I not waking up with you?
In this bed
Don't you tell me that we're not there yet
Cause I've been waiting since the day we met
Why am I not waking up with you?

We can't wait to hold you and rock you to sleep in your rocking chair
Before you know it  you'll be standing
Crashing 'round the house like bandits all day
You can't get into too much trouble
Nothing's gonna stop me from loving you always
Ooh  you'll know it when you're where you're supposed to be
Oooh  you'll know it when you're living out your dream
Someday when you leave the house
And the open road calls
Just know your heart won't lie to you
If you learn to listen close
When you meet your queen  go get her
Make sure that she knows you'll love her always
'Fore you know it  your own child's standing
You can crash around with them like bandits all day

From the moonlight
Through the cherry trees
Open the roof and take in the view
Cause you're my sweetest dream
Come true
Color the dusk a deep navy blue
And try to be brave
Cause I'll be right beside you
There's a world so high
Hold out your hands
And you can go anywhere
So reach for the stars
Cause I'll be waiting up there
And you can finally fly
Cause you'll be lighter than air
And try to be brave
Cause I'll be right beside you
There's a world so high
Hold out your hands
And you can go anywhere
So reach for the stars
Cause I'll be waiting up there
And you can finally fly"
