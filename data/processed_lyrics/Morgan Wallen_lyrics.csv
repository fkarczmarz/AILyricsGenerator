"Getting even further South
Somewhere where the summer lasted all year 'round
Probably got a big ol' diamond on your hand right now
Maybe a baby or a couple by now
Long driveway to a big white house
But I wonder when you're drinking if you
Find yourself thinking about
That boy from East Tennessee
And I know we both knew better
But we still said forever
And that was seven summers
Of Coke and Southern Comfort
Were we dumb or just younger  who knows?
Back then  you used to love the river
And sippin' on a sixer with me
Does it ever make you sad to know
That was seven summers ago?
Yeah  I bet your daddy's so proud
Of how his little girl turned out
Think she dodged a bullet
Of a good old boy like me
'Cause I still
Go drinkin'  same friends on Friday
Bought a few acres  couple roads off the highway
Guess you never saw things my way anyway

Ooh
Seven summers ago (Ooh-ooh  ooh-ooh)
One glass on the living room table
Phone face down  Church up loud
Was tryna drown you out tonight
But first sip  I could feel you on my shoulder
The Tennessee heat had me feelin' colder
Thought a drink would get you off my mind
But this bottle tastes like 865-409-1021
Girl  just pick it up and come over
Give the bedroom door a little closure
I know I told you I wouldn't call and I tried
But this bottle tastes like 865 (409-1021)
This bottle tastes like 865 (409-1021)
You might think I don't really want you with me
You might tell me to empty out my whiskey
Or try changin' what I'm holdin' in my hand
Try another liquor  try another brand
But it don't matter if I got my lips on a different drink on a different night
Yeah  the second that I take a sip all I'm gonna think

Been tryin' to forget we
Ever became what we were
And I poured some whiskey
On places you kissed me
Tried to wash off all the hurt
But ain't nothin' workin'
I've lived out the words in
A thousand old sad country songs
But whenever I try to move on
It's like tryna put a bandaid on a bullet hole
Tryna tell a cowboy to slow down
It's like watchin' the way that the river rolls
And then tellin' it to turn back around
And I've held some strangers  told people I hatе you
But I just keep hittin' a wall
It's like tryna put a bandaid on a bullet hole
It just don't do mе no good at all
If I was only
Heart broke and lonely
I'd head on back down to the bar
Find me a companion

Can't nobody fill in this heart

Couple of kids in a Chevrolet
Catch a little air when we cross the tracks
Sipping on something from a paper sack
You hang your shirt on that maple limb
Slipping through the moon to the river bend
I guess I'm still doing now what I was doing then
Chasin' you like a shot of whiskey
Chasin' you like those goodbye tail lights
Headed west to anywhere out of this nowhere town
You always used to talk about LA
I heard you got as far as Santa Fe
Well you know I tried to track you down
I only got as far as Guitar Town
Well you should know that I haven't given up
I'm just on your radio

I don’t wanna see my ex-girl
I don't wanna worry 'bout findin’ me my next girlfriend
At the bar where they charge your right arm
For a cold can of PBR
I don't wanna pick the phone up
Don't wanna sit in traffic with an empty can of long cut
I've been doin' what I should be doin'
And I'm losin’ my Dodge Ram mind
’Cause I just wanna do country-ass shit
With my country-ass friends
But my country-ass been
Between workin' it off and gettin' it chewed
There ain’t much country ass left in these old blue jeans

Can't trust anyone
I was so sure what I needed was more
Tried to shoot out the sun
Such damage was done
I was meant for someone
'Til someone needs medical help or the magnolias bloom

In Richmond on high
Forever this time

That you don't get in the country
And I hope you find you a guy with some dollar-sign eyes

Take two steps back and say
What's one little taste gonna hurt?

And I want your buzz in my veins
I'll pour us back down the sink

After all the shit you did
Can't wash our hands of this
I had some help
It ain't like I can make this kinda mess all by myself
Don't act like you ain't help me pull that bottle off the shelf
Been deep in every weekend if you couldn't tell

Backin' down the ramp in my old truck
To find a bunch of logs
To catch a bunch of hogs
If you wanna learn to throw a curve right
To catch a clean up lookin' on a third strike
Talk a little smack while he's walkin' back
But there's one that lays by the lamp on the nightstand
One that says don't cuss and don't fight
Or let the bottle turn you into a different man
But damn if I don't do it every Friday night
Those get you into Heaven letters in red
Ain't gettin' read enough to keep me on a straight line

Livin' out a suitcase  trashin' hotel bars

He said it was good  I bet it was great
Then God made a man  and man got lonely
Have an angel to hold in my arms
So God made a girl  His best work of art
Oh  but He didn't make no place to go when she breaks your heart
So man made a bar
Yeah  man made a bar
Sometimes an angel falls too hard
Loses more than just a piece of her heart
And she needs a place to go and make a brand new start

Devil on my shoulder  strangers in my bed
Pills in my pocket  ashes on the floor
These bad decisions keep on knockin' on my door
I know you think you left me all alone
I hate to say  you couldn’t be more wrong
Got Copenhagen  whiskey straight
Empty bottle  promise breakin'
All the ways I let you down  down
What went around  came back 'round
The Sunday mornin' still asleep
Traded angels for my demons
I ain't lonely since your leavin'
I've got me and all your reasons
Like all the lies I ever told  that change I never did
All the times that I was cold  all that broke you couldn't fix
I know you did just what you had to do
You looked around and saw there wasn't no room for you
Just Copenhagen  whiskey straight

Makes some people wonder if I'm smart like that
And that guitar layin' on the chair is worn out like my boots
Makes it look like I can play it better than I do
But nobody buys it when we walk in
They say there ain't no way that she's with him
In a world where nothing is what it seems
Ain't no one more surprised than me
It's funny how some strangers like to size me up
This attitude it makes me street and this accent makes me dumb
I can tell 'em I've got pirate blood or ancient royalty
Thеre's no end to the liеs that I could get 'em to believe

Your bright lights called  I don't blame you for pickin' up
Your big dream bags are all packed up and ready to go
But I just need you to know
That I love you more than a California sunset
More than a beer when you ain't twenty-one yet
More than a Sunday morning Lord
Turnin' some poor lost souls 'round  and Hallelujah bound
Yeah  I love you more than the feeling when the bass hits the hook
When the guy gets the girl at the end of the book
'Cause I can't love you more than my hometown

Drinkin' off a dive bar highway
Thick smoke soaked up in tequila
Told you I'd leave you with neon eyes
Dancin' with a ghost on thе dance floor
Never rеally gettin' what you came for
Lonely lips sippin' on a margarita
Like the lights on a liquor store

Product of some kneelin' down
In a town where the doors don't lock
And there's a million other people like me
From a scene a little more podunk than pop
I didn't choose being born in the sticks
And I'll be damned if I sound like something I ain't
For some folks  a backroad gets old
But for me  it just can't
'Cause I'm from a small town  southern drawl crowd
We're sippin' clear  drinkin' beer on a Friday night
Every country girl got on her cutoffs
Still circle up big trucks around a fire
Still kickin' up some dust behind the tires
It's still goin' down out in the country
Somewhere now  someone's out there
Sippin' on some hundred proof
Every day  a baby's born with some baby blues
A good ol' boy's got on his faded boots
Workin' a nine to five

Ain't breakin' ground

Wasted on you
All of this time and all of this money
All these sorries I don't owe you  honey
All of these miles on this Chevy and prayers in a pew
All them days I spent wasted on you
Wasted on you
'Cause I don't wanna feel a thing
No more  hell nah
I just wanna sip 'til the pain wears off
Poor me  pour me another round
Line 'em up and knock 'em down
Two more let's go
'Cause I ain't never hurt like this before
Don't wanna think about her
Or wear a ring without her
Don't wanna hit the karaoke bar
Can't sing without her
So make them drinks strong
'Cause brother she's gone
And if I'm ever gonna move on
I'ma need some whiskey glasses
'Cause I don't wanna see the truth
She's probably making out on the couch right now
With someone new
Yeah  I'ma need some whiskey glasses
If I'm gonna make it through
If I'ma be single
I'ma need a double shot of that heartbreak proof
And see the world through whiskey glasses
(Ain't nothing else to do  but sip around the truth)
And see the world through whiskey glasses
(I need a better view  where I don't drink to you)

Last call
I swear this will be my last call
Now I ain't drunk dialing no more at 3 am
Mr. Bartender hittin' me again
Don't wanna think about her
Or wear a ring without her
Don't wanna hit the karaoke bar
Can't sing without her
So make them drinks strong
'Cause brother she's gone
And if I'm ever gonna move on
I'ma need some whiskey glasses
'Cause I don't wanna see the truth

Oh  see the world through whiskey glasses
(I need a better view  where I don't drink to you)
'Cause if she ain't ever coming back
'Cause if she ain't ever coming back
I'ma need some whiskey glasses

Thinkin' no way them boys wouldn't win
Between them big three pitchers  Andruw and Chipper
It was gonna be hard to keep up with the Jones's
But as fate would have it  that Atlanta magic
Got put out by them damn Padres
I guess destiny ain't always meant to be
Kinda like you and me that day
We got close  but close doesn't cut it
Had a good run  to end up with nothin'
But a 3x5 that you hide in a drawer
We swung for the fences and came up short
And that's just the way life plays
If we were a team  and love was a game
We'd have been the '98 Braves
Had that whole town believin'
But just like that season
Girl  you and me didn't end with a ring on a hand
