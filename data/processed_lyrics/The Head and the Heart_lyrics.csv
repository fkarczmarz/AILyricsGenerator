"And the nighttime was the worst
It shows you all the things you've lost
There's no light in here now
There's no light in here now
If you take the kids and go
I can't blame you for the things you know
And when I'm out there on the road
I think you and those kids at home
There's no light in here now
There's no light in here now
Well 10 000 weight in gold
Never feels like treasure until you lose it all
Well I packed my bag for the road
I grabbed my hat cause it's time  yes time is marching on
And if you see me out on the road
My bags are packed cause it's time  yes time is marching on
There's no light in here now
There's no light in here now
I was burned out and lost
There's no light in here now
I was burned out and lost
There's no light in here now
And the nighttime was the worst
There's no light in here now
I see nothing
For miles and miles and miles
She's only in dreams
We've been here before
Don't drag me through this again
We tried everything under the sun
Now I'm trying to wake up from this
I'm trying to make up for it
All we ever do is all we ever knew
La la la la la la
La la la la la la
La la la la la
La la la la la la
La la la la la la

Burning in your fireplace
I hear your voice and it seems
As if it was all a dream
I wish it was all a dream
I see a world
A world turning in on itself
Are we just like
Hungry wolves howling in the night?
I don't want no music tonight
Can we go on like it once was?
Every time I hear another story
Oh the poor boy lost his head
Everybody feels a little crazy
But we go on living with it
These are just flames
Burning in your fireplace
I hear your voice and it seems
As if it was all a dream
I wish it was all a dream

There's nothing more for me to say tonight
I know you're leaving  but I can't believe it
There's nothing more you need to say tonight
All I hear is you through the chatter of the room  babe
Something in your voice made me stay
Can I convince you to stay?
Don't know how to say goodbye
Don't know how to say goodbye
Go on believing  you don't need a reason
There's nothing more you need to say tonight
Moving through the room like a shadow on the wall  babe
Careful every step that you take
I'm confused by the daffodils in bloom  babe
And how you blow them away

Underneath the cupboard lives a mouse and he discovered
There was nothing there  nothing there
To discover
Falling from the sky  there are raindrops in my eyes
And my thoughts are diggin' in the backyard
My roots have grown but I don't know where they are
Don't know where they are  don't know where they are
My roots have grown but I don't know where they are
Cats and dogs and rooster calls
Telephones and pay phone stalls
They take away the lonely days
For now
They take away the lonely days
 I don't know what to do
 to go out and chase you
 that's just what I'll do
 chasing a ghost
 a fool

I saw the colors fade away
I saw the colors fade away

I see you kicking the can down the road
And you staring at the dust
I hear you in the moonlight
I saw the colors fade away
I saw the colors fade away
So the scene all looks the same
As it did in the morning
And it feels like a storm
But it's all in your head
And I know that you feel like

But give it a night

No hope in sight

Try to catch a deluge in a paper cup
There's a battle ahead  many battles are lost
But you'll never see the end of the road while you're traveling
They come  they come to build a wall between us
We know that they won't win
Now I'm towing my car  there's a hole in the roof
My possessions are causing my suspicion but there's no proof
In the paper today  tales of war and of waste
But you turn right over to the TV page
They come  they come to build a wall between us
We know that they won't win
Now I'm walking again to the beat of a drum
And I'm counting the steps to the door of your heart
Only shadows ahead  barely clearing the roof
Get to know the feeling of liberation and relief

Lord have mercy on my rough and rowdy ways

Call it one drink too many

Cause they both end in trouble and start with a grin

Every shade of blue
Dark Heroine of the books I have read
And I'm tired of wasting life
What became such a false alarm
'Cause I'm looking for the truth
Fireworks blew out the top of your head
Powder and spark drew me to bed
Drift with you there down a dark and frozen stream
I thought I'd found Jewel of the Nile

Just a false alarm
Just a false  alarm
You never had much to lose
So I'm blaming you for these hopeless blues
What's to say when the kids are gone?
I've made up the beds and been left alone
There's no way to write what's been done wrong
You left me a fool
So what to do?
Hold me down if I'm running off
So I'll shut my mouth and I'll steal my heart
 they're leaving
 about leaving
 about leaving
 I knew you when you were six years old
 if only you could see me now
 about leaving
 about leaving
 we're just hanging around
Is there anything I stand for?
Is there anything I stand for anymore?
One voice in time can set everything in motion
So stay on this line and help me lift everyone's voices
Am I a living man? Am I a dying man?
Is there anything I believe in?
I believe in the glory of music
But I don't believe in the power you're using
Made this choice to use my voice
So many things I shouldn't have
I don't have to tell you what's right

Wiped the counters off
And put away my clothes

Could you imagine where our lives would lead?

I can't imagine how my life would be
If all your gravity did not hit me
But here we are
After all the messes and confessions
To the stars
That we never really owned as ours
And if our world comes tumbling down
I never could forgive myself for leaving out
Such a fool
I took your love and I bent all the rules
You took the blow and didn't let it show
Stuck around to let me know
Built a family of our own
Look around
We made a garden of the love we found

Across the bridges not yet burned
Where the ice won't let us further

In the barn with broken floors
With your boots of Spanish leather
And my hat knit out of yarn (x2)
You are in the seat beside me

You are in grandmother's wisdom
You are in grandfather's charm

With the music on their branches

Who intend for them no good

Whispering through the dusty aisles
Watching all the thinkers read
Trying to keep a grown man quiet's like
Pulling teeth on a winters eve
Cracks and poles and unfamiliar roads
I'm on this one to find out
Can't stay healthy in the cloud of eyes
Listening to my every move
Just trying to survive
Self-imposed adventure that selfishness drives
I can barely keep my head above the blue
Trying to keep it off me and you
And I can see the sunshine's rays

Being alone isn't lonely
Sought after like a holiday
Being home is my vacation
Postcard dreams of a full-sized bed
Quit the band one too many times
Serious enough to get a rise
Get up in the next morning
The best advice we ever received
Is for you and me to stay here together
It's easier to begin and hard to end
I'm just glad to go through it all with you as a friend

Gleaming through the clear water

There will always be better days

So then I open my lungs
And everything I say is in tune
Then I open my mind
Every little mistake comes through
It's like a living mirage
Everybody's the same out here
And I can open my light and stay
Whatever it takes for you
Those secretive eyes
And all they say
I can open my mind for you
Every word is true
And then you're saying write a melody for you
If I open my mind for you
Everybody's the same out here
So I open my lungs
They're waiting here
It's the same out here
But I can open my lungs for you
Like it's a living mirage
I can marry the skies for you
Now will you scream out like children lost or maybe
Everything's waiting here
I'm singing my baby's blues
When I give in to you
Every word that you say rings true
When I give in to you
Every word that you say rings true
Is it a living mirage?
I won't see you for some time
I am lost in my mind
I get lost in my mind
Momma once told me
I am lost in my mind

I slipped into a cave one day
I never thought I'd leave that place
I never meant to do (Ooh-ooh)
You know I've done a few
And tell me friends
When I'm down
My friends
(My friends)
(My friends)
I slipped into a cave one day
I never thought I'd leave that place (My friends)
When I woke up the sky had fallen down
Our thoughts are written on our face
We try to run and change our fate (My friends)
But time will always catch us in disguise
(My friends)
Oh I hear you lost your head again (My friends)
Have you forgotten all the good years?
Once or twice
That's all we get in this life
You can put it on the shelf
You can watch the dust collect
But oh dear  oh dear
Don't let 'em die
Don't let 'em die
Don't let 'em die
If that's what it takes to be one and the same
If that's what it takes to be one and the same
If that's what it takes to be one and the same
Oh  my dear
Pick yourself up  kid
Pick yourself up  kid
I can't bear the weight
Pick your mood up  friend
We don't have the time
When you find someone
We don't run away
Pick yourself up  kid
All those books in your head
Is that all this really was?
Just a role you play
That you could hide behind
Is it what you want?
To bury yourself away
Before your time goes
I don't want a love that holds us back
I don't want a life that I can't have

Let the light back in
'Cause you've been walking blind

It's been a little while since we've been together
It's been a long time since we were young and wild  remember?
When we were friends  remember?
When we were lovers
It's not too late  it was never too late
People need a melody to open their eyes
To a memory frozen in time

Won't you let me drive you home?
'Cause I've had the rhythm and blues
Since the day you met me
Stepped on my blue suede shoes
Watch Elvis go crazy
Won't you let me turn you on?
Cause no one likes to be so lonely
No one likes to feel alone
Won't you let me drive you home?
I drive you home

All our friends will move away
And they're goin' to better places

Looks like I got myself in trouble with the boys again
The prairie's on fire  house is in order
And nowhere to be seen again
Looks like I got myself in trouble with the boys again
Well  the head of the letter says I can't do this no more
I can't play like this  I gave you two
I can't keep going back  but
The winds were blowing in
Now I'm looking for heaven  running through hell again
Looks like I got myself in trouble with the boys again
Prairie's on fire  house is up for sale
And the dog are the days
And your car won't start again

A wind is blowing  it's all around

How can she ever feel the way I feel?
Caught inside a wheel

Oh  oh
A heart-shaped tree standing in between
Human nature  and the nature we see
Wouldn't you know it now?
Life's got a funny way of showing us how
I see you standing there  listening in the leaves
Looking down  shining on me
Trying to show me how  just takes a while
You should know this by now
Until you learn to love yourself
The door is locked to someone else
I'm just as damaged as you are
Scattered to pieces with you gone
Without the dark  there is no light
But don't give the ghost an inch tonight
I saw the signs you were leaving
But I didn't wanna believe it
This could be so easy
If you could see you through my eyes
I tell myself not to let it go
Hold on to something so beautiful

You were waiting on me to
Change into something  baby
Change is a beautiful thing

Like the trees in the wild

And time in time

You put in the time
You put all those memories so deep inside my mind

 it's you that keeps hanging on

To close his eyes and call it a night
So we can put all our differences aside
I'm just waitin' on the moon
With all the stars and all its gloom
We can watch it fall right back in to place
So I won't keep myself around
Just to keep you warm

Throwing up just like the fourth of July  baby
And the longer we go  the better

History keeps repeating

When asked if we should stay or go
Your back is up against the wall
The clock's the only sound you hear
We've all been down this road before
Feeling like you're so alone
Feeling like you're so alone
Right when you think you have it
You fall into the static
Slipping into slow-mo
It's almost automatic
You fall into the static
Slipping into slow-mo
Isn't living all about embracing the real?
