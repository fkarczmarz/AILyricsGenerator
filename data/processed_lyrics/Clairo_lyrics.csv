lyrics
"To hold you?
I told you
If I'm in love then why is my heart hurting?
Hurting?
Everywhere that I go
I wrote it down
I told my mom
My friends all know
We get along
I want you
To want me too
I want to kiss you
I want to love you
I want to touch you
I think too much
You called me wondering why I changed
Or why I don't look the same
Why I think so differently now
Is it ever gonna change? Am I gonna feel this way forever?
Are you gonna be around for me to count on?
Is it ever gonna change? Am I gonna feel this way forever?
Are you gonna be around for me to count on? Count on
Some things just never seem to fade
I'm thinking about how we were on our first date
You understood the words I was saying
I knew I'd never let you get away
Put me in your bedroom and I'll sing a little song

Only 30 minutes from Alewife
I lay in my room
Wonderin' why I've got this life
I met you by surprise
You were hangin' out all the time
But you know you saved me from doin'
Something to myself that night
You called me seven times
I didn't mean to scare you
Just had the thoughts in my mind
They showed up to my door
My parents didn't know what for
Swear I could've done it
If you weren't there when I hit the floor
It's been so long
And you've been my sister all along
But you know I'll be alright
Got close to some epiphany
I'll convince a friend to join deep ends
Have your toes touch the lack of cement
Gather to one corner of the woods
Echo chambers inside a neighborhood
And centerfold  humility shown
You're not as good as what your mama's sewn
Aren't you glad that you reside in a Hell and in disguise?
Nobody yet everything  a pool to shed your memory
Could you say you even tried?
You haven't called your family twice
I can hope tonight goes diffеrently
But I show up to the party just to leavе
Between the gaps  keep it under wraps
How I got to some epiphany
I'll convince myself when it turns to twelve
The photos keep the sentiment

Could you say you even tried?
You haven't called your family twice
I can hope tonight goes differently
But I show up to the party just to leave
Pulling back  I tried to find
The point of wasting precious time
I sip and toast to normalcy
A fool's way into jealousy
I mock and imitate goodbyes
When I know that I can't deny
That I'll be here forever while
Tell me what you're thinking
Baby  I don’t know you so well
I'll put my heart in it (in it)
Hold me for a minute (minute)
Baby  I would never lie to you (lie to you)
Hold me close  tell me why
Put me in your bed at night
I wanna stay here forever
Hold me close  but don't you lie
Put me in your dreams at night
I shouldn't tell you this
You're the boy of my dreams
You're the boy of my dreams
You're the boy of my dreams
You're the boy of my dreams
Of my dreams
Somedays I try to call
You never seem to fall for me at all
Baby  why you so cold?
I'm standing at your door
Don't understand why you ignore my love
It is so warm for you

You're the boy  you're the boy
You're the boy of my dreams
 and
 yeah
 yeah
 let it rush to my head
 I don't wanna cut corners
 then my cheeks are so flushed
They're toying with me and tapping their feet
It's not that I crave any more company
Clearing your throat while I count to three
Keep hold of my hand
We both know I can leave
I don't like to cry before I know why
Blue ribbon ties while emotions are high
I told all my friends
They were glad to see
Sat in a circle in front of my Claud's tapestry
In a dorm less than three minutes to drive
We both can always
Take it or leave it
The moment's here and you should believe it
Know that you should
I pull until I'm left with the burns
Blisters and the dirt left in between my fingers
Rushing so I can beat the line
But what if all I want is conversation and time?
I move so I don't have to think twice
I drift and float through counties with my one-sided climb
With courtesy to little pet peeves
Napkins on laps  strands pulled back
I hang the scarf and my mom's anorak
Why do I tell you how I feel
When you're just looking down the blouse?
It's something I wouldn't say out loud
If touch could make them hear  then touch me now
If touch could make them hear  then touch me now
Talking to some who laugh and others scorned
I guess humor could help me after all
It's funny now  I'm just useless and a whore
But I get a cosign from your favorite one-man show
Why do I tell you how I feel
When you're too busy looking down my blouse?
It's something I wouldn't say out loud
If touch could make them hear  then touch me now
If touch could make them hear  then touch me now
If touch could make them hear  then touch me now

 I told you so  going down a different road
 I pick up every time

 don't wanna hear it now  I'm fed up
 oh  to make me walk away
 and I know it won't change
 I'm not going  I'll wait
 say
 anyway
 don't wanna hear it now  I'm fed up
 oh  to make me walk away
 and I know it won't change
She told me not to lie
Struggling to find out what happened to you
On tour and alone with nothing to lose
Cried myself to sleep that night
I haven't wrapped my head around it
Maybe I should think about
When I turned around and said
I can't believe you like me
When I turned around and said
I can't believe you like me better than the rest
When I turnеd around and said
I can't believe you likе me better than the rest
Turns out kissing someone older
Doesn't mean there's gonna be a lesson attached
Swear I'll take this one to my grave
And nothing's gonna change
There's a child writing stories of when they become king
And learn to take everything

Sometimes I feel like I just wanna go back to my old ways
You're telling me I'm silly
It's no fun in the old days
I'm such a romantic
I never remember how things really happen
I guess you're attractive
Or something
Live in the moment
That's what they tell me
But what ever happened
To when you would hold me
And hold me
And hold me
Girlfriend or girl that's a friend?

I wanna be the one you think about at night
And I wanna be the one that you would put up a fight for
You know that I adore
That even when you're bored
Sometimes I'm just sitting at home
Sometimes I'm just still alone
Sometimes I'm just sitting at home
Get high with me
On the corner of Main Street
Get high with me

For the constant affirmations
While I scrounge for understanding
And fall out
I'll let you win and I'll let you tie
The ribbon to my hair
Just so that we could come back to this
If we really cared
The morning gates stay open
If you had a thought that I'd be there
Ooh
Know we could use a break
Because I can't feel my feet
Carried you all the way upstairs
So you can sleep and I can think

Clinging on to everything you fear
Keeping mе close while you hold me out and say
I don't lovе you that way
Harbor myself away from everyone else
I'm half-awake and intimate
Eyes closed and I'll commit
What I wish I had with you
I'll pretend until it's true
I don't love you that way
Know myself better than I have in years
I don't know why I have to defend what I feel
I try
Stand your guard when I am near
Loathe me until you're reminded of the deal
One of us knows when you hold me out and say
You're just a loner
Give it a try
And you're hard on yourself
And your laugh  it just melts in my hands
Lonesome in the street
You say the mice all seem to laugh at me
I'll get by with you on my mind
I'll get by with you on my side
I'll get by with you on my mind
I'll get by with you on my side
I'm not at home (At home)
And I'll just say that
Being with you makes me feel less old
A kid on the street playing basketball
Horses will run forever  can't be called
I don't know why
I don't know why
I don't know why
Wish that I  wish that I
Wish that I could go back in time

 and yet so far
 taste like Bey
 took his place
 wanna smoke you out like all-day
 no mass
 I'm an asshole
 will you be my real or my fake though?
 cashing out checks when I say so
 make me old
 text my phone
 fake like jokes
How did I try to get you off my mind?
Could this be the end
Of you and I for now?
Hope that I see you soon
Don't know what I would do
My heart is under the weather
I know that I’m the only one who can heal it
I try to be the strong one for you
But that's just too hard for anyone to do
Ooh
How did I try
To get you off my mind
Could this be the end
Of you and I for now
Hope that I see you soon
Don't know what I would do
My heart is under the weather
I know that I’m the only one who can heal it
I try to be the strong one
For you
But that’s just too hard for anyone to do
But I wrote these chords with you in mind
I've met you on the benches
Of places where I know we can still hide
Sometimes it’s hard
'Cause I just wanna call you and cry
If timing is everything
I've missed you by the minute
I’d give myself to have you one last time
I want more time
I want more time
I want more time
I want more time
I want more time
 and I wouldn't ask you to take care of me
 and I wouldn't ask you to take care of me
 don't get close to me
 still in the nosebleeds
 call that intimacy
 together there
 and I wouldn't ask you to take care of me
 and I wouldn't ask you to take care of me
 I keep it real clean
 you don't get a key
 I'll show you what I mean
 I wouldn't ask you to take care of me

 I wouldn't ask you to take care of me

 we'll be alright

 I don't feel strong
 I just wanted to hear your voice so clear
 I'd say
 but now it just hurts me so bad
 don't want to give in
 know that it's right
 don't want to give in
 know that it's right
 but now it just hurts me so bad
Or anywhere at all  I'm distant just enough to never fall behind
Picturing the saddest scene of wearing bedsheets
And two pats on the back  It just takes time
It's getting late
Since when did taking time take all my life? Mm-mm
Mommy  I'm afraid I've been talking to the hotline again
I blocked out the month of February for support  mm-mm
As we speak  I'm hеre to meet devils for tea
Peering 'round the corner of my life
I throw my drink into the faces of my demise  mm-mm
And finally  an answer from your throat comes crawling
There's room for us
There's room for anything
The usual urge I'd see clear
A flower for you and the dogs are near
But white light comes from nothing at all
Good
Good to fall between
The ones I love and the ones that faded
He loved me good enough to calm me down
But tried to trick me into little changes
I see the end before it begins
A cloud just for you and a place to land
But white noise comes from nothing at all

Personally  I'm surprised you called me after the things I said
Skrt skrt on fellas

Skrt down  you acting like me
Acting like we wasn't more than a summer fling
I said farewell and you took it well
I promise I won't cry over spilled milk
Gimme a paper towel  gimme another Valium
Gimme another hour or two  hour with you
Why you bother me when you know you don't want me?
Why you bother me when you know you got a woman?
Why you hitting me when you know you know better?
Know you know better
Know your crew better than you do when
Call me looking for you

Got me looking forward to weekends
With you baby  with you baby

Love on my ladies  love to my ladies
Dated a few
Dated a few
One for the ride and one for the magazines?
She's only twenty-two
A flash to the upbringing of the child  the canine
What will become mine
Once I decide to leave?
Seek to take and give it all away
Once you know  it's only a maze
There could be more days like today
Complain to the management
About my lack of self-respect
Fast forward to when I'll have friends
And men who don't interject
Harping over old regrets
Hating how I let it get to me  me
Only for a short while
I'm bound to lose my head
And just when I start to think it's ended
Another demand commences
I'm doing it for my future self
The one who needs more attention
I'll forget to forgive and hold it all in
I'm old with some resentment

 just in case I might
 it's hard to believe

 I'm shameless
 just in case I might
 where you hid the key?
 obsessed
 ah
 nothing to do
Touching me  hands warm on my thighs
And I know I could turn a blind eye
Afraid of what I'm gonna find
Does it really have to be this way?
Oh  and my body hasn't felt the same
Since you left my apartment
Think my pillows still have your scent
I just want to let you know
I’m seeing the sides that you don't show
And I know that we've got some potential
'Cause that look you gave me was so gentle
Do you think that you could stay?
I need more time  I need to get away from here
Pour my love out
Spill it all on the ground
Is it all in my head? What are you saying?
Usually I'd be fine  but my head is spinning
I never let anybody in
Somehow you got under my skin

Never seen a face like yours
I got it together  but my breath feels short
I don't wanna close the door
Maybe I should just go up north
All I'm tryna say
Is I miss you in every way
Fingertips on my back
Things I know that I can't have
Never seen a face like yours
I got it together  but my breath feels short
I don’t wanna close the door
Maybe I should just go up north
Maybe I should just go up north
But the perfect harmony is lost
As I watch you fall awake and ask
What's wrong? Did I really miss all the work you've done?
All the work I've done
Calling someone else is only harder
I'll explain myself again
Take the chance on someone's daughter
She makes me feel like I'm the best
The only time I see you smile
Is after hours or the finish line
But bring yourself to the еdge
Of the cliff and look upon
The animals who will wakе before us at dawn
All the work they've done
I'm sorry I have to hold you longer than you expected
It's only temporary
I'll let you walk and make your own discovery
 I think it was about noon
 to understand
 in my hands
 now I cry
I pushed you so far down and I let you sink through the drain
There's a claw on my shoulder
And she's saying the obvious
I keep forgetting that I'll have a family
If I listen in with my hands cupped and on my knees
I can hear the single obnoxious sigh of relief
I'll tell you about the Rabbit Moon and when to keep walking
I can't fuck it up if it's not there at all
I'll show you where I did swim team and drive to Dunwoody
I can't fuck it up if it's not there at all
Sometimes sexy to someone is all I really want
Checkin' out of the hotel or moments at a bar
And it's just a little thing I can't live without
Sexy is something I see in everything
Send me eyes with the knowing that I could pull it off
And it's just a little thing I can't live without

Think of things I can't do or haven't done
And does it make me weak?
Sometimes I feel like I can't breathe
Is that all you see in me?
Don't you wait for something more
I'll still be sinking to the floor
Now I'm all alone
Is it my doing? Is it my doing? Mmm
Why does it feel like I'm older than I asked to be?
But when you say my name
It all falls away so tenderly
Don't you wait for something more
I'll still be sinking to the floor
Why do I feel so cold?
Is it my doing? Is it my doing?

Egos are always blown
A ship in a bottle
Collapses under my cell phone
Next to my rough callouses
Tell me more about your sister
Brittle bones
Hold my body together
Tender touches
If only to say you're mine
Shouldn't feel like a crime
I think we could do it if we tried
If only to say you're mine
Shouldn't feel like a crime
You know I'll do anything you ask me to
Standing here alone now
Think that we can drive around
I just wanna say

To feel this way so early?
But am I blind?
All the sweet nothings fallin' in love overnight
Didn't mean to get so close
And I know that I should probably go
But I got this feeling
And all my life
Been wanting this forever (Mm)
And in my mind
Think of ways to ask you Why don't you come over sometime?
Didn't mean to get so close

'Fore the first one's finishin'
I like to bridge the gap between
A break and long-lost lovers
Only to get me by until I decide
I've had enough
The eyes from the stranger's window
At least somebody's home
Decades are wastin' on your name
You'll grasp the concept of life
When you give up the point of tryin'
If you don't do the things that you do
They'll just happen to you
Pulling out all my weight
And do my part and you'll say
You probably thought you would be gone
And until there's another way
I just have to face that there's no real place
To go and I could really be alone
You might also likeI'd promise you now that if I had known
I wouldn't be standing here
There's memories to be made
And water that's to wade
I used it all up drying tears
Of course I don't regret
The moments where I wept
And yearned for what I've got now
 been four years since
 and you were my friend
 hope you find solace in this
 only listened to Loveless
 move on
 you kick me when I'm down
 how can you pretend you didn't say that now?
 I know that you're stressed out
Where I saw my brother speak for the first time since
He graduated in the spring
Got a cold piece of information to bring to you
It comes to me in a dream
In the dead heat and the suffocating wet grip
Sure sounds nice to settle down for a whilе
Let the real еstate show itself to me
I could wake up with a baby in a sling
Just a couple doors down from Abigail
Sure sounds nice to settle down for a while
Let the real estate show itself to me
I could wake up with a baby in a sling
Just a couple doors down from Abigail
But it's obvious I wanted to
Bubble gum down my throat and it's a curse
But my luck couldn't get any worse
'Cause I swallowed the bubble gum
Pink flowers grow from my skin
Pepto Bismol veins and I grin
You look so nice in your shirt
It's sad because it just hurts
I'd do anything for you
'Cause I swallowed the bubble gum
I bet you have questions like  Where did I come from?
I know I come from that planet that hit Tiamat
Years ago
Years ago
Years ago
Years ago
I do my flows and then I get so lost
Light just take my spheres to go
Spheres to go
Spheres to go
Spheres to go
To the top of the pyramid  let's save the world like this
Conversing with light bodies (I know)
But really they all a part of me
Let's get the whip and go
'Cause I'm tired of this solar ring
Whatever (oh)
Whatever I do
Whatever
I don't care  get dressed whatever
I don't feel like talking  whatever
Cause it's really out of my control
How you feel is not my problem
I really don't want you to go  but I do not want to stop you
(stop you)
I do not want to stop you
I do not want to stop you
I do not want to stop you
I do not want you to stop you
A lock of my hair
Polaroid in your fragile hands
Tear the picture of us apart back together
They're all mine
Pictures I took of you
I tend to put them on my windowsill
I want you to care for me
Don't you know I'm feeling blue?
Wondering why I hurt
Spend all my months
Trying to decipher
Your words
But you have to come to terms with it
And I think I'll be alright
If you just give me your word
I hear you laughing at me
The harmony of our souls
Is something that
Is left with me
But you have to come to terms with it
And I think I'll be alright if
 things I could say to get you back
And say bye
You should turn back now
You're only crying just because
There's no return now
And all this lying has to stop
I'll never coincide if the chemistry is right
So baby do you see the light of day
I like to watch you run
But I'll never touch your bum
Oh babe do you see the light of day
You should turn back now
You only crying just because
There's no return now
You make me smile with my heart
Your looks are laughable
Unphotographable
Yet you're my favorite work of art
Is your figure less than Greek?
Is your mouth a little weak?
When you open it to speak
Are you smart?
But don't change your hair for me
No  no no no
Not if you care for me
Stay little Valentine  stay
Oh stay
Oh stay
Oh stay
Each day is Valentine's Day
Is your figure less than Greek?
Is your mouth a little weak?
When you open it to speak

And I'll give you a kiss or two
You don't look at me
You don't even notice me
But you're still my cutie
I know that this will end
But I sure do intend
(How you want it baby? In the front  in the back
How you want it baby? In the front  in the back
How you want it baby? In the front  in the back)
It was only yesterday
(How you want it baby?)
But yesterday's so far away
(In the front  in the back
How you want it baby? In the front  in the back
How you want it baby? In the front  in the back)
What's the ETA?
(How you want it baby? In the front  in the back
How you want it baby? In the front  in the back)
Feeling a lot  feeling alone
Got to remember that I don’t need no-one else
Just me and myself
I drift to you  put me back on the shelf
I’m thinking of you
And it's driving me through
The walls in my head but I’m so upset
Can’t do nothing 'bout it  collapse on the bed
I don't wanna be someone else's
Someone else's someone else
I don't wanna be someone else's
Someone else's someone else

Call up your phone
I just get the tone
I guess that you're not home
Trying not to be a nuisance
But I call up your phone
I just get the tone
I guess that you're not home
You seem to be going out a lot lately
And you don’t have time for me  baby
It's alright
I'll be going out a lot more lately
And I won’t have time for you  baby
I’m sorry  I'm sorry
Doo doo doo-doo doo
Doo doo doo doo-doo doo doo-doo doo doo doo
Doo doo (doo)
Doo doo-doo doo-doo doo
Or will you see my name and I'll fade?
Pitch my camp in your mind
And I'll look through them just once or twice
But I might see something I don't like
Like your hands in his shirt
Losing my way
Yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
Losing my way
Seeing your name
Yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah"
