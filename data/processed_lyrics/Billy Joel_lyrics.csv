" three  four
Leading me to that third rail  shock!
Quick as a wink  she changed her mind
She gave me a night  that's all it was
What will it take until I stop
Kidding myself  wasting my time?
Whoa
There's nothing else I can do
'cause I'm doing it all for Leyna
I don't want anyone new
'cause I'm living it all for Leyna
There's nothing in it for you
'cause I'm giving it all to Leyna
We laid on the beach watching the tide
She didn't tell me there were rocks
Under the waves  right off the shore
Washed up on the sand  barely alive
Wishing the undertow would stop
How can a man take anymore?
Whoa

There's nothing else I can do
'cause I'm doing it all for Leyna
I don't want anyone new
'cause I'm living it all for Leyna
There's nothing in it for you
'cause I'm giving it all to Leyna
I'm failing in school  losing my friends
Making my family lose their minds
I don't want to eat  I don't want to sleep
I only want Leyna one more time
Now  I'm in my room watching the tube
Telling myself she still may drop
Over to say she's changed her mind
Instead of my old man saying
Whoa
There's nothing else I can do
'cause I'm doing it all for Leyna
I don't want anyone new
'cause I'm living it all for Leyna
There's nothing in it for you
'cause I'm giving it all to Leyna
All for Leyna
All for Leyna
All for Leyna
All for Leyna
All for Leyna
And they're closing all the factories down
Out in Bethlehem  they're killing time
Filling out forms  standing in line
Well  our fathers fought the Second World War
Spent their weekends on the Jersey Shore
Met our mothers at the USO
Asked them to dance  danced with them slow
And we're living here in Allentown
But the restlessness was handed down
And it's getting very hard to stay
Well  we're waiting here in Allentown
For the Pennsylvania we never found
For the promises our teachers gave
If we worked hard  if we behaved
So the graduations hang on the wall
But they never really helped us at all
No they never taught us what was real
Iron and coke  chromium steel
And we're waiting here in Allentown
But they've taken all the coal from the ground
And the union people crawled away
Every child had a pretty good shot
To get at least as far as their old man got
But something happened
On the way to that place
They threw an American flag in our face
Well I'm living here in Allentown
And it's hard to keep a good man down
But I won't be getting up today
And it’s getting very hard to stay
If there's a chance of it opening up
They hear a voice in the hall outside
And hope that it just passes by
Some people live with the fear of a touch
And the anger of having been a fool
They will not listen to anyone
So nobody tells them a lie
I know you're only protecting yourself
I know you're thinking of somebody else
Someone who hurt you
But I'm not above making up for the love
You've been denying you could ever feel
I'm not above doing anything
To restore your faith if I can
Some people see through the eyes of the old
Before they ever get a look at the young
I'm only willing to hear you cry
Because I am an innocent man
I am an innocent man

Some people say they will never believe
Another promise they hear in the dark
Because they only remember too well
They heard somebody tell them before
Some people sleep all alone every night
Instead of taking a lover to bed
Some people find that it's easier to hate
Then to wait anymore
I know you don't wanna hear what I say
I know you're gonna keep turning away
But I've been there
And if I can survive I can keep you alive
I'm not above going through it again
I'm not above being cool for a while
Some people run from a possible fight
Some people figure they can never win
And although this is a fight I can lose
The accused is an innocent man
I am an innocent man
An innocent man
You know you only hurt yourself out of spite
I guess you'd rather be a martyr tonight
That's your decision
But I'm not below anybody I know
If there's a chance of resurrecting a love
I'm not above going back to the start
To find out where the heartache began
Some people hope for a miracle cure
Some people just accept the world as it is
But I'm not willing to lay down and die
Because I am an innocent man
I am an innocent man
An innocent man
A sanctuary safe and strong
To heal the wounds from lovers past
Until a new one comes along
I spoke to you in cautious tones
You answered me with no pretense
And still I feel I said too much
My silence is my self defense
And every time I've held a rose
It seems I only felt the thorns
And so will you soon I suppose
But if my silence made you leave
Then that would be my worst mistake
So I will share this room with you
And you can have this heart to break
And this is why my eyes are closed
It's just as well for all I've seen
And you're the only one who knows

So I would choose to be with you
That's if the choice were mine to make
But you can make decisions too
And you can have this heart to break
Ridin' in your limousine
With your fine Park Avenue clothes
You had the Dom Perignon
In your hand
And the spoon up your nose
Ooh  and when you
Wake up in the mornin'
With your head on fire
And your eyes too bloody to see
Go on and cry in your coffee
But don't come bitchin' to me
Because you had to be
A big shot  didn't cha
You had to open up your mouth
You had to be a big shot  didn't cha

You're so much fun to be around
You had to have the front page  bold type

You're tired of living in your one horse town
You'd like to find a little hole in the ground

And you stare at the junkies and the closet queens
It's like some pornographic magazine
And you smile

And take you to your special island
Captain Jack will get you by tonight

We left as inmates from an asylum
And we were so gung ho to lay down our lives
We came in spastic like tameless horses
We left in plastic as numbered corpses
And we learned fast to travel light
Our arms were heavy but our bellies were tight
We dug in deep and shot on sight
And prayed to Jesus Christ with all of our might
We had no cameras to shoot the landscape
We passed the hash pipe and played our Doors tapes
And we held on to each other like brother to brother
We promised our mothers we'd write
And we would all go down together
We said we'd all go down together

And we would all go down together

It isn't hard to find
You can have the love you need to live
But if you look for truthfulness
You might just as well be blind
It always seems to be so hard to give
Honesty is such a lonely word
Everyone is so untrue
Honesty is hardly ever heard
And mostly what I need from you
I can always find someone
To say they sympathize
If I wear my heart out on my sleeve
But I don't want some pretty face
To tell me pretty lies
All I want is someone to believe

We dress our days in silken robes
We know it's all a passing phase
We light our lamps for atmosphere
And hang our hopes on chandeliers
We're sleeping long and far too late
And so it's time to change our ways
But I've loved these days
Now as we indulge in things refined
We hide our hearts from harder times
Oh we can only go so far
On caviar and cabernet
We drown our doubts in dry champagne
And soothe our souls with fine cocaine

We'll get so high and get nowhere
We'll have to change our jaded ways

Passes on her
Fateful information
Then these careless fingers
They get caught in her vise
Till they're bleeding
On my coffee table
Living alone isn't all that it's cracked up to be
Laura has a very hard time
All her life has
Been one long disaster

Failure to break was the only mistake that she made
Here I am feeling like a fucking fool
Do I react the way exactly she intends me to?
Every time I think I'm off the hook
She makes me lose my cool
I'm her machine
And she can punch all the keys
She can push any button I was programmed through
Laura calls me
When she needs a good fix (ah)
All her questions
Will get sympathetic answers
I should be so immunized
To all of her tricks (ah)
She's surviving
On her second chances
Sometimes I feel like this godfather deal is all wrong
How can she hold an umbilical chord for so long?
I've done everything I can
What else am I supposed to do?
I'm her machine
And she can punch all the keys
She can push any button I was programmed through
Laura (Laura) loves me (loves me)
Even if I don't care
That's my problem
That's her sacred absolution
If she had to
Even though I faced electrocution
She always says I'm the best friend that she's ever had
How do you hang up on someone who needs you that bad?
And never saw his father anymore
Another son who never had a father after Leningrad
Went off to school and learned to serve the state
Followed the rules and drank his vodka straight
The only way to live was drown the hate
A Russian life was very sad and such was life in Leningrad
Haven't they heard we won the war? What do they keep on fighting for?
Viktor was sent to some Red Army town
The greatest happiness he'd ever found
Was making Russian children glad and children lived in Leningrad

I saw the Empire State laid low
And life went on beyond the Palisades
They all bought Cadillacs and left there long ago
They held a concert out in Brooklyn
To watch the Island bridges blow
They turned our power down
And drove us underground
I've seen the lights go out on Broadway
I saw the ruins at my feet
You know we almost didn't notice it
We'd seen it all the time on 42nd Street
They burned the churches up in Harlem
Like in that Spanish Civil War
The flames were everywhere
But no one really cared
I've seen the lights go out on Broadway
I watched the mighty skyline fall
The boats were waiting at the Battery
They sent a carrier out from Norfolk
And picked the Yankees up for free
They said that Queens could stay
They blew the Bronx away
And sank Manhattan out at sea

It's a pretty good crowd for a Saturday
And the manager gives me a smile
'Cause he knows that it's me they've been comin' to see
To forget about life for a while
And the microphone smells like a beer
And they sit at the bar and put bread in my jar
Sing us a song tonight
With his working class ties and his radical plans
And he's always at home with his back to the wall
And he's proud of his scars and the battles he's lost
And he struggles and bleeds as he hangs on his cross
And he likes to be known as the angry young man
Give a moment or two to the angry young man
With his foot in his mouth and his heart in his hand
It's a comfort to know his intentions are good
And he sits in a room with a lock on the door
With his maps and his medals laid out on the floor
And he likes to be known as the angry young man
I believe I've passed the age
Of consciousness and righteous rage
I found that just surviving was a noble fight
I once believed in causes too
I had my pointless point of view
And life went on no matter who was wrong or right

With his fist in the air and his head in the sand

And he struggles and bleeds as he hangs on his cross
And he likes to be known as the angry young man

Got a good job  I got a good office
I got a new wife  got a new life
And the family is fine
Oh  lost touch long ago
You lost weight  I did not know
You could ever look so nice after so much time

(Yeah  yeah!)
Brenda and Eddie were the popular steadies
And the king and the queen of the prom
Riding around with the car top down and the radio on
Nobody looked any finer
Or was more of a hit at the Parkway Diner
We never knew we could want more than that out of life
Surely Brenda and Eddie would always know how to survive
Brenda and Eddie were still goin' steady in the summer of '75
When they decided their marriage should be at the end of July
Everyone said they were crazy
“Brenda  you know that you're much too lazy
And Eddie could never afford to live that kind of life”
Oh  but there we were waving Brenda and Eddie goodbye
Well  they got an apartment with deep pile carpets
And a couple of paintings from Sears
A big waterbed that they bought with the bread
They had saved for a couple of years
They started to fight when the money got tight
And they just didn't count on the tears (Oh  oh)
Yeah  rock and roll!
Well  they lived for a while in a very nice style
But it's always the same in the end
They got a divorce as a matter of course
And they parted  the closest of friends
Then the king and the queen went back to the green
But you can never go back there again (No  oh)
Brenda and Eddie had it already by the summer of '75
From the high to the low to the end of the show
For the rest of their lives
They couldn't go back to the Greasers
The best they could do was pick up their pieces
We always knew they would both find a way to get by
Oh  and that's all I heard about Brenda and Eddie
Can't tell you more 'cause I told you already
And here we are waving
Brenda and Eddie goodbye
Bottle of red  ooh bottle of white
Whatever kind of mood you're in tonight
I'll meet you anytime you want
She can wound with her eyes
And she can ruin your faith with her casual lies
And she only reveals
What she wants you to see
She hides like a child
But she's always a woman to me
She can lead you to love
She can take you or leave you
She can ask for the truth
But she'll never believe you
And she'll take what you give her
As long as it's free
But she's always a woman to me
She can wait if she wants
She's ahead of her time
And she never gives in
She just changes her mind

Mmm mmm

She is frequently kind
And she's suddenly cruel
She can do as she pleases
She's nobody's fool
But she can't be convicted
She's earned her degree
And the most she will do
Is throw shadows at you
But she's always a woman to me
I don't know what it is
But I know that I can't live without her
She's got a way of pleasing
I don't know what it is
But there doesn't have to be a reason anyway
She's got a smile that heals me
I don't know why it is
But I have to laugh when she reveals me
And she's got a way of talking
I don't know what it is
But it lifts me up
When we are walking anywhere
She comes to me when I'm feelin' down
Inspires me without a sound
She touches me and I get turned around
She's got a way of showing
How I make her feel
And I find the strength to keep on going
And she's got a light around her
And everywhere she goes
A million dreams of love
Surround her everywhere

You've been locked outside the door

It's such a clever masquerade
She's so good with her stiletto

Now I have seen that sad surrender in my lover's eyes
And I can only stand apart and sympathize
For we are always what our situations hand us
It's either sadness or euphoria
So we'll argue and we'll compromise
And realize that nothing's ever changed
For all our mutual experience
Our separate conclusions are the same
Now we are forced to recognize our inhumanity
Our reason coexists with our insanity
And though we choose between reality and madness
It's either sadness or euphoria
How thoughtlessly we dissipate our energies
Perhaps we don't fulfill each others fantasies
And as we stand upon the ledges of our lives
With our respective similarities
It's either sadness or euphoria

Listen boy it's not automatically a certain guarantee
To ensure yourself you've got to provide communication constantly
And there's only one good way to reassure
Cause now and then she'll get to worrying
Just because you haven't spoken for so long
And though you may not have done anything
Will that be a consolation when she's gone?

And I'm cruising through Block Island Sound
I have charted a course to the Vineyard
But tonight I am Nantucket bound
We took on diesel back in Montauk yesterday
Left this morning from the bell in Gardiner's Bay
Like all the locals here I've had to sell my home
So I could own my downeaster Alexa
And I go where the ocean is deep
There are giants out there in the canyons
And a good captain can't fall asleep
I got bills to pay and children who need clothes
They say these waters aren't what they used to be
But I got people back on land who count on me

And if you work with the rod and the reel
Tell my wife I am trolling Atlantis

Perspiration stains and varicose veins
My eyes look shot
My belly's got a pot
And there's a pimple on my nose

Said from the Bowery to St Marks
Alright
Said whoo-hoo-whoo-hoo-hoo
Said whoo-hoo-whoo-hoo-hoo
Why should I worry?
Why should I care?
I may not have a dime
But I got street savoir-faire
Why should I worry?
Why should I care?
It's just bebop-ulation
And I got street savoir-faire
Mmm-hmm
The rhythm of the city
Said you can own this town
You can wear the crown

It's just doo-wop-ulation
And I got street savoir-faire
Everything goes
Everything fits
They love me at the Chelsea
They adore me at the Ritz
Why should I worry?
Why should I care? Yeah!
Even when I cross that line
I got street savoir-faire
Whoo-hoo-whoo-hoo-hoo

Saturday  I said I'm sorry
Sunday came and trashed me out again
I was only having fun
Wasn't hurting anyone
And we all enjoyed the weekend for a change
I've been stranded in the combat zone
I walked through Bedford-Stuy alone
Even rode my motorcycle in the rain
And you told me not to drive
But I made it home alive
So you said that only proves that I'm insane
You may be right
I may be crazy
Oh  but it just may be a lunatic
You're looking for
Turn out the lights
Don't try to save me
You may be wrong for all I know
But you may be right

Well remember how I found you there
Alone in your electric chair
I told you dirty jokes until you smiled
You were lonely for a man
I said  take me as I am
Cause you might enjoy
Some madness for a while
Now think of all the years you tried to
Find someone to satisfy you
I might be as crazy as you say
If I'm crazy then it's true
That it's all because of you
And you wouldn't want me any other way
You may be right
I may be crazy
Ho  but it just may be a lunatic
You're looking for
It's too late to fight
It's too late to change me
You may be wrong for all I know
But you may be right
You may be right
I may be crazy
Hey  but it just may be a lunatic
You're looking for
Turn out the lights
Aww  don't try to save me
You may be wrong for all I know
But you may be right
You may be wrong
But you may be right
You may be wrong
But you may be right
You may be wrong
But you may be right
You may be wrong
But you may be right
You may be wrong
But you may be right
You may be wrong
But you may be right
You may be wrong
But you may be right
You may be wrong
And you see the crazy gypsy in my soul
It always comes as a surprise
When I feel my withered roots begin to grow
Well I never had a place
That I could call my very own
'Cause you're my home
When you touch my weary head
And you tell me everything will be all right
And my love will keep you warm
Throughout the night
Well I'll never be a stranger
And I'll never be alone
Home can be the Pennsylvania Turnpike
Indiana's early morning dew
High up in the hills of California
Home is just another word for you
Well I never had a place
That I could call my very own
Cause you're my home

If I travel all my life
And I never get to stop and settle down
Long as I have you by my side
There's a roof above
And good walls all around
And my instant pleasure dome
I need you in my house
Cause you're my home
 he hasn't lost his style
 don't you go downtown
 woah
 I'm just another face at Zanzibar
 woah
 that's where I'll be
 he knows he's such a credit to the game
 woah
 I'm trying just to get to second base
 woah
 woah"
