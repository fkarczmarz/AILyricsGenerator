"Every single day what you say makes no sense to me
Somewhere in the night there's a light in front of me
All your fakin'
Shows you're achin'
Every single day what you say makes no sense to me
I never really know what's really going on inside you
I can't get my head around you
All your feedin'
Shows you're bleedin'

Deep inside your soul there's a hole you don't want to see
Coverin' it up like a cut with the likes of me
I guess I'll never know what's really going on inside you
I can't get my head around you
I can't get my head around you
I can't get my head around you
Day after day (Your home life's a wreck)
The powers that be just breathe down your neck
You get no respect (You get no relief)
You gotta speak up and yell out your piece
'Cause I'm sick of not living to stay alive
I don't wanna be controlled
That's all I want
That's all I want
That's all I want
That's all I want
Ya-ya-ya-ya-ya!
How many times (Is it gonna take)
'Til someone around you hears what you say?
You've tried bein' cool (You feel like a lie)

Where strip malls abound and diversion's mere moments away
Where culture's defined by the ones least refined
And you'll be left behind if you don't fit in
It's all distorted in Americana my way
Well  fuck you!
Woah  woah
Woah  well  my dream has come true
Woah  woah
Woah  my vision has come true
I want it right now ’cause my ge-generation don't like to wait
My future's determined by thieves  thugs  and vermin
It's quite an excursion but it's okay
Everything's backwards in Americana my way
Well  fuck you!
Woah  woah
Woah  well  my dream has come true

I'm a product
Of my environment
So don't blame me  I just work here
But I wanna fuck it up

Well  fuck you!
Woah  woah
Woah  my nightmare has come true
Woah  woah
Woah  my nightmare has come true
Yeah  it's all coming true
The gun in my hand will tell you the same
But when I'm in my car  don't give me no crap
’Cause the slightest thing and I just might snap
When I go driving  I stay in my lane
But getting cut off  it makes me insane
I open the glove box  reach inside
I'm gonna wreck this fucker's ride
I guess I got a bad habit (Yeah  yeah)
Of blowin' away (Yeah  yeah)
I got a bad habit (Yeah  yeah)
And it ain't goin' away (Yeah  yeah)

I stood and watched them as they fell off one by one

Whoa-oh! You don't wanna change the world like you say

I think you guys should try heavy metal

The kids are strappin' on their way to the classroom
Gettin' weapons with the greatest of ease
The gangs stake out their own campus locale
If one guy's colors and the other's don't mix
Take him out
You gotta keep 'em separated

Hey! Come out and play

All our yesterdays are pictures lost in time
Never enough
Towers crumble to dust
Looking back on the moments of our lives
Doesn't matter in the end
Those days go by
And we all start again
What you had and what you lost
They're all memories in the wind
Those days go by
And we all start again
Stars still burn bright
Seasons change overnight
Look back in love
A new day rises above
With a wind that comes to carry you back home

I think she wants me only
She said come over right away
But she's just not that way
Her little soul is stolen
See her put on a brand-new face
Pull the shades
Razor blades
You're so tragic
I hate you so
But love you more
I'm so elastic

The games you play
Dirty magic

Falling  I'm falling
Have you ever walked through a room
But it was more like the room passed around you
Like there was a leash around your neck that pulled you through?
Have you ever been at some place
Recognizing everybody's face
Until you realized that there was no one there you knew?
(Well  I know)
Some days my soul's confined
And out of mind  sleep forever
(I know)
Some days I'm so outshined
And out of time  have you ever?
Falling  I'm falling
Falling  I'm falling
Have you ever buried your face in your hands
'Cause no one around you understands
Or has the slightest idea what it is that makes you be?
Have you ever felt like there was more
Like someone else was keeping score
And what could make you whole was simply out of reach?

If the cops don't make you pay
And you make your getaway
Then you know that it's one fine day
I believe it's my God-given right
To destroy everything in my sight
The only thing it gets is more bold
In our world it's a way to stay sane
If you're asking me to have it my way
I'd say that's one fine day
Now excitement seems to grow
When we're hanging with the bro's
When we're chilling and we pound a case of Stroh's
Now the game is cool to see
You can High 5 on TV
Operation is in sight
And the field is open wide
If the cops don't make you pay
And you make your getaway
Then you know that it's one fine day

Watch the way the world goes  the man deals out our plight
Jester in the corner laughs without a sound
Jester in the corner  malady abounds
In our souls
In our souls
In our souls
See the way the sun sets  twilight of this life
The man is making little bets playing with our lives
All that I believe now  anything is possible
A simple explanation for the evil in this world
And in our souls
In our souls
In our souls

Went out to a party just the other night
But three hours later and seven shots of Jäger
She was in the bedroom with another guy
And I don't really wanna know
So don't tell me anymore
And I really don't wanna hear
About her feet all up in the air
And well  I'm not the one who acted like a ho
Why must I be the one who has to know?
I'm not the one who messed up big time
So  spare me the details if you don't mind
Now I can understand friends who wanna tell me
Think they're gonna help me open up my eyes

Running through my head  over and over
Things I never told her now just make me sad
And it drives me insane  sittin' with the vision

While someone else fucked her then a-walked away
