lyrics
"I want to thank my beautiful fiancee  my parents  my manager  and our team that puts together this music  that sacrifices everything for this art. Countless hours in the studio and onstage and everyone that made this album what it is. I love you guys.
You need love
Give me love
And I'll give you my love
They say thirty's the new twenty
And twenty-five-year-olds seem ten
I used to drink away my paycheck
Celebrate the mistakes I hadn't made yet
Our generation isn't the best on safe sex
Synthetic heroin is the new basehead
Walk around looking through a fake lens
I wish I didn't care
If cynical hipsters with long hair and cocaine problems like my music
Said my flight has finally landed down
And the ground has stopped moving all around
We both forfeit this game of crime
You might also like
These interviews are obnoxious
I grew up during Reaganomics
When Ice T was out there on his killing cops shit
Or Rodney King was getting beat on
And they let off every single officer
And Los Angeles went and lost it
Now every month there's a new Rodney on YouTube
It's just something our generation is used to
In neighbourhoods where you never see a news crew
And my subconscious telling me stop it
This is an issue that you shouldn't get involved in
Don't even tweet R.I.P Trayvon Martin
Don't wanna be that white dude million-man marching
Fighting for a freedom that my people stole
Don't wanna make all my white fans uncomfortable
But you don't even have a fuckin' song for radio
Don't get involved if the cause isn't mine
So we just party like it's 1999
Celebrate the ignorance while these kids keep dying
My flight has finally landed down
And the ground has stopped moving all around
We both forfeit this game of crime
I need love
You need love
Give me love
Who-lay-hey-hey
Who-lay-hey-hey
And we danced
And we cried
And we laughed
And remember this moment for the rest of our lives (Our lives)
Our lives (Our lives)
Our lives
Tonight (Tonight)
Tonight (Tonight)
Tonight
Dance
Feels like a night for a party
My nature so naughty
Quit cock-blocking
Don't let me pull my hose out
Free of beat and pussy pop
And if you don't have a pussy
Pop a cock into a booty

And we danced (Oh)
And we cried (Oh)
And we laughed (Oh-oh)
And remember this moment for the rest of our lives
To whatever girl's booty I'm freaking on
I will moonwalk to Pluto in honor of Michael Jackson
Dedicate this to the dance floor
Party up the sorrow 'til tomorrow morning happens
And we danced (Oh)
And we cried (Oh)
And we laughed (Oh-oh)
And remember this moment for the rest of our lives
You see me looking at you from that bar right over there
But your friends are huddled up and they are hating on a player
Oh-ee-oh-ee-oh (Oh-ee-oh-ee-oh)
Uh-ah-ba-bo (Uh-ah-ba-bo)
Zib-oh-da-we-bab-ba-dap-bop-bop (Zib-oh-da-we-bab-ba-dap-bop-bop)
I just wanna dance with you
I just wanna dance with you
And we danced
And we cried (Oh-ee-oh-ee-oh)
And we laughed
 no buzz  no fire
 naw  now saying that I'm pop 
 turn them into believers
 I speak for my hard work
 naw  we show the world you don't need 'em
 I so happen to speak it
 I'm like  Who are you?
 I'm myself  and I know the truth
 oh-oh! (Oh-oh  oh-oh!)
 oh-oh! (Oh-oh  oh-oh!)
 Make the money  don't let the money make you
 don't let the game change you
 I said
 don't let the money make you
 don't let the game change you
I could read people's energy
Listen to what have been said to me
Heard the voices in elementary
That I wouldn't amount to anything
Get the CD out the car trunk and did it myself
These piano keys hold some weight
She ordered shrimp scampi on a porcelain plate
Afternoons need a coffee boost
Attitude needs a confidence boost
But where's the self-esteem when the costumes removed?
I could blame it on a flight to Vegas
And go and waste my time with an acquaintance
These relationships need maintenance
Everybody got expectations
Where were you when I was an in-patient?

You don't know what I'm doing
Focusing on what I'm giving back
Fuck preaching on top of the mountain
People can see through it
Keeping my name in your mouth
Just don't bite your tongue while you chew it
Source Magazine was like our Vanity Fair
But got a bone to pick with the man in the mirror
Questioning the purchase while I'm standing there
Questioning the purpose of my rap career
Feels like yesterday in a van packing gear
What am I gonna go and give back this year?
There's a whole lot of struggling rappers here
Want a co-sign and a whole track this year
If you know motherfuckers start acting weird
Lot of backstabbers and some actors here
Lot of has-beens and over-reactors here
I remember laughing and cracking beers
Now I climbed the ladder and you're mad I'm here
You don't know what I'm doing
Focusing on what I'm giving back
Fuck preaching on top of the mountain
People can see through it
Keeping my name in your mouth
Just don't bite your tongue while you chew it
(400)
Judging me off of my past
You don't see what I'm doing
When I got shot that was headline news
Cause what about all the good?
The non-profit for the kids in the hood
That ain't got no option in them shelter homes plotting
They must want no one to know
They suck us like leeches 'til we broke
The next time my name in the press
Talk about how YG gave them kids Christmas
You don't know what I'm doing
Focused on what I'm giving back
Preaching on top of the mountain
People can see through it
Keeping my name in your mouth
Just don't bite your tongue while you chew it
Hey where'd he go though?

Seven bucks an hour wasn't much money
But I be rapping and kicking it on my lunch break
Like I'ma make it out this motherfucker one day
Type of dudes who square up and knock a tooth loose
That is the window I'm planning to vacate with
Pops put on bars just in case somebody breaks in
That's not gonna stop me from getting to the pavement
Window to window and wall to wall
Can of Krylon and we out to bomb (Buckshot)

Just copped that new Boot Camp tape
The neighbors keep complaining 'bout too much bass
Give me two cans and you gon' know my name
You don't wanna get involved
You know I be dippin' through these alleys tryna diss the law
Sixteen with Adidas on
I was underground where he come from and he pop out a hole
Cracked the top back on the flat black aerosol
I woke up in the morning and I had a vision
These suit and ties got the nerve to call it vandalism
But I'ma paint a better world until the cans are empty
If they catch me doing dirt I'll plead the fifth
Window to window and wall to wall
Can of Krylon and we out to bomb (Buckshot)
Chill-chill-chilin' with the crew
Just writing my name in graffiti on the wall
Who-who-who is he?
Got the world following the...
Turn up the CD or turn up the TV
I got twenty-five cans in my napsack
Crossing out the whick-whack
T-O-Y-S's ain't even get that
149th street bench is where we slept at
Where my real graf writers? Make some noise
Chill-chill-chilin' with the crew
Just writing my name in graffiti on the wall
Who-who-who is he?

Got the world following the...
Blow blow blow blow blow
 we'll fight 'til it's over

Alright  okay

Return of the Mack
Get 'em  what it is? What it does? What it is? What it isn't?
Looking for a better way to get up outta bed
Instead of getting on the Internet
And checking on who hit me  get up
Thrift shop  pimp-strut walkin'
Little bit of humble  little bit of cautious
Somewhere between like Rocky and Cosby
Bad  moonwalking  this here is our party
My posse's been on Broadway  and we did it our way
Grown music  I shed my skin and put my bones
Into everything I record to it and yet I'm on
Let that stage light go and shine on down
Got that Bob Barker suit game and Plinko in my style
Money  stay on my craft and stick around for those pounds
But I do that to pass the torch and put on for my town
Trust me on my I-N-D-E-P-E-N-D-E-N-T shit  hustlin'
Chasing dreams since I was fourteen
With the four-track  bussin'
Halfway 'cross that city with the back (Back) pack (Pack)  fat (Fat) cat (Cat)  crushin'

Go hard like I got a 808 in my heartbeat
And I'm eating at the beat like you gave a little speed
To a great white shark on Shark Week  raw
Time to go off  I'm gone
Deuces  goodbye  I got a world to see
And my girl  she wanna see Rome
Caesar'll make you a believer
Nah  I never ever did it for a throne
That validation comes from giving it back to the people
Now  sing a song  and it goes like

Hammer pants and make believe
Pirate ships sailing off to sea
Will you come party with me in my
This is for the freaks and for my magicians
Booty clap and lap dancing technicians
Dance parties in the name of Great Britain
And American girls who love the Detroit Pistons
Long wong-dong in a soft hand
From England to Stockholm
I'm wearing a cape just like a poncho
I got a cutey and I'm making a beat on her booty
Like I was at Bonnaroo beating up on a bongo
I got a bottle of Martinelli's and I'm dumping
All over anybody that's kicking it in the grotto
Fuck your condo!
Unicorns and wizard sleeves

Your thighs are the closet to Narnia
Is it cool if I go and get lost in that?
Of course cold on the dance floor
Like an Eskimo's toes in the North Pole
With both toes poking out of two holes
Like a cauldron from a warlock
Wearing sweatpants in a sauna
Who's your father? I'm not
I'm motherfuckin' Raven Bowie and here's my cock
Girl's booty was bigger than the stomach of Rick Ross'
Holy mother mountain of tender tendon to get lost in
You don't want to look back on this night
And think I should have been freaking on a booty
Freak-freaking on a booty
Unicorns and wizard sleeves
Hammer pants and make believe
Pirate ships sailing off to sea
Will you come party with me in my
This might be the best night that we have ever had
That-that we have ever had
That-that we have ever had
That-that we have ever had together
Have you ever killed a coyote in the middle of a party
Have you ever killed a coyote in the middle of the night
In the middle of a party
Brought it home and threw it on the carpet
Who wants to eat a coyote?
Who wants to eat a coyote?
Who wants to eat a coyote?
Cause drunk King John is still in the loo
And Raven has ruled ever since
Unicorns and wizard sleeves
Hammer pants and make believe
Pirate ships sailing off to sea
Will you come party with me in my
And some of us even try to get sober
Now here's to the assholes and the last calls
Hold the night for ransom as we kidnap the memories
Not sure there is a way to express what you meant to me
Sit around a table and use those years as the centerpiece
Sounds of the city on Capitol Hill
Where I question if what I'm seeing here is real
Cowboy boots doing lines at the bar
Where the time goes slow when you're drinking PBR
Sounds of the city on Capitol Hill
Where I question if what I'm seeing here is real
Cowboy boots doing lines at the bar
Where the time goes slow when you're drinking PBR
The twenty-something confusion before the suit and tie
Memory's a collage pasted with glue that barely sticks
I fantasize about a second wind

So here's to the nights dancing with the band
Strangers into girlfriends from a one night stand
Pour out a little liquor and turn up the Johnny Cash
I'd be a goddamn liar to say at times I didn't miss it
Dip my feet in every once in a while just to say I visit
And we hold onto these nights
Try to find our way home by the street light
Learn a lot about your friends right around two a.m. 
Hold the night for ransom as we kidnap the memories

Way back  I used to rock the hat with the suede strap at ABC's
Bought my food from the Arabs
Played craps on corners where the OG's slang at
Cross colors  I'm the boss of the playground
Iesha on the nuts  cos I knew how to play house
The 8 oz. baby from '84 to grow up
Cleaner than my Easter suit was with my shoes buffed
Don't step on my new ones
These Reeboks beat blocks  you give 'em a few pumps
She came from a new school  and all I wanna do is my zoom zoom
My uncle stayed faded like crew cuts
But I was just too young to know the what's-what and the who's-who
'Round here  they could give a fuck if you got props
You get clowned for rockin' British Knights to the sock hop
The BK stood for black kids  the hood was crackin'
And Poison was on everybody's tracklist
Spandex was in fashion  back then
And bad chicks had tracks in that lasted
Before CDs and Internet the kings was in effect
You fiends wasn't gettin' respect
Before mp3s and CD-Js  we pop in a tape cassette
Chain on my chest  I'm fresh

I'm bouncing and Sam Goody's not getting shit from my allowance
Day dreaming in class  know I'm zoning out and
Rosie Perez's titties are right where my mouth is
Who says that white men can't jump? They were hella wrong!
Before the days of getting drunk at kegs
We were bumping some Jodeci and dry-humpin' legs
That's right  I was born in the '80s
House party?
Crackin'
Humpty dance?
Crackin'
Why don't you reminisce and bring it back  rap shit
Before CDs and Internet the kings was in effect
You fiends wasn't gettin' respect

Ooh  it's too real
Chromed out mirror  I don't need a windshield
Banana seat  a canopy on two wheels
Eight hundred cash  that's a hell of a deal
I'm headed...
Downtown  cruising through the alley
Tip-toeing in the street like ballet
Pulled up  moped to the valet
White walls on the wheels like mayonnaise
Got gas in the tank  cash in the bank
And a bad little mama with her ass in my face
Snuck her in backstage  you don't need a wristband
Dope
Killing the game  'bout to catch a body
Passed the Harley  Dukie on the Ducati
But I'ma keep it hella 1987
Head into the dealership and drop a stack and cop a Kawasaki
I'm so low that my scrotum's almost dragging up on the concrete
You don't need an Uber  you don't need a cab
She got 1988 Mariah Carey hair
Very rare  mom jeans on her derriere
Throwing up the West Side as we tear in the air
Stop by Pike Place  throwing fish to a player

Whole downtown yelling out Who that is?
Sounding like a French pimp from back in the day
I take her to Pend Oreille and I water skate
I'm perusing down Fourth and they watching me
I do a headstand  the eagle lands on my seat
Now do you or do you not wanna ride with me?
I got one girl  I got two wheels
She a big girl  but ain't a big deal
I like a big girl  I like 'em sassy
Going down the backstreet listening to Blackstreet

Posted on the porch just chillin'  me and my people
Eyelids closed  gold sun shines on
The world's coated in the gold Krylon  yay
Gold tints  shades that block out that golden haze
Take all the gold from the pawn shop that lives behind the case
And g-g-give it away
When gold erupted from volcanoes in the heavens
And every shrine that existed in time melted
Tombs open  Dookie ropes on the pharaohs
When everything is gold  who cares about the carats?
And they say that gold's the skin of the gods
You can't take the Band-Aid when you're gone
As the sunset falls into tomorrow
Today we're feeling like gold  five hundred thousand sold
Slick Rick gold rope on  hella cold
Goldschläger faded  fourteen carat plated
So we're feeling like gold  five hundred thousand sold
Slick Rick gold rope on  hella cold

Crack open the vault  let everyone mob in the bank
Take whatever they want  we party and give thanks
I've been rocking gold chains since P was in a tank
You only live once  you only live once
Watch Rick Ross give his Jesus piece to a bum
Paintin' the globe gold  two-steppin' on the sun like

Under these gold trunks  that's two golden nugget
Flyin' on the gold eagle  flier than the rest of 'em
Past the Space Needle  golden shower on pedestrians
Loungin' on the water  feet in the gold sand
Sippin' on Orangina  arms around them both pants
They're sippin' Olde English right out of a gold can

But your dad has shed a lot of tears
They say I should be a strong man
Sometimes I don't know who I am
Sometimes I question why I'm here
I just wanna be a good dad
Will I be? I have no idea
They say girls shouldn't be tough
And moms should raise their kids at home
Cause your momma's the toughest person I know
I wanna raise you to be like her
And watch you show the world how to do it on your own
I'm still tryna figure out who I am
I don't wanna mess this up or do this wrong
I'm gonna be there for your first breath
I don't know if I'll be there for your first step
I can promise you that I'll try to work less
To be something that I can look back and I can be proud of
Don't wanna be a dad that's living in FaceTime
But I got a world to sing to and you at the same time
I love you and I can't give you enough of that
Give back to community that raised you up
And do it every day
Do that for the rest of your life

Leather weathered Irish skin
Beard orange as the sunset or the flag
In the night sky we fly it in
Pride for the life we fight to live
Spit it with the dialect
And this is a celebration of course
And when they pulled up on that shore
First generation born
Toast to those that made it on a boat to New York
And when the English came the colonizer came
And hurled 'em to protect what's ours
Don't touch these lucky charms
Whole bunch of Irish screaming Fuck the London Guard
But go against the Irish and get a bloody jaw
Preaching nonviolence but reminds of the scars
We put our glass to the sky and lift up
And live tonight cause you can't take it with ya
So raise a pint for the people that aren't with us
And live tonight cause you can't take it with ya

What they don't know is there is a gun in the paint can
If I could get signed my life is destined
My future depends on ink
And secretary at the front of the entrance staring right at me

I put my life on the line
I roll them dice and I'm fine
'Cause all I ever dreamt about was makin' it
Thought it would be shiny and beautiful
Thought it would be alive and like musical
There’s numbers on a chalkboard
CDs boxed in cardboard
Graphic designers are sitting around
Waiting for albums that never come out
Complainin' that they have nobody in house
Wonderin’ what they make art for
This was my chance to grab that contract and turn and jet
And with that right song we all know that you're next to be famous
So it’s really like a loan?
You'll get a third of the merch that you sell out on the road
Along with a third of the money you make when you’re out doing your shows
No one will give you a better offer than us
Thought that this is what I wanted
Rather be a starving artist
Yeah
And we live tonight
Check it  now
I seen pain  I felt the losses
Attended funerals and seen coffins
Twenty-one-years-old  an angel was lost here
Wings clipped by the grip of eighty milligram sniffs
Of OxyContin every day through the nostrils
Never went away  never does it stop there
Death a line or two away and a couple tall cans
'Cause you never know when God is gonna call  man
Precious  what we all share
I said peace at 5:30  the next time that I saw 'im
Was in the hands of the pallbearer
What if I would've never gone and dropped him off there?
With a book of rhymes  he was gonna recite to the globe
Only thing to numb the pain besides that shit in his nose
He was gonna quit tomorrow  we're all gonna quit tomorrow
Just get us through the weekend  and then Monday follows
Might as well go crack a seal and might as well go chug a bottle
Might as well go pop a pill and go and band-aid that problem
And escape this world  vacate this world
'Cause I hate myself  no praying's gonna cure
This pain

Doctor  please
Give me a dose of the American Dream
Put down the pen and look in my eyes
We're in the waiting room
And something ain't right
Doctor  please
Put down the pen and look in my eyes
All this is on you
We're over-prescribed
For me and Kev
You end up in jail  institutions or dead
And with our lives  we play Russian Roulette
And try to find a life where we could be content
'Cause for us  we're just trying to minimize
The fear of being alive
And now my little brother is in the sky
From a pill that a doctor prescribed
That a drug-dealing billion dollar industry supplied
That the cops never go and profile at night
Has us looking for the answers and that instead of you
Because a doctor with a license played God and said it's cool
Played God and said it's cool
But me? I don't blame Kev
Or his mom freebasing while pregnant with him
I blame the pharmacy companies and country that spends
Trillions fighting a war they supplying themselves
Politicians and business and jail
Public defenders and judges who fail
First dealer was his mom's medicine cabinet
Got anxiety  better go and give him a Xanax
'Til he's walking 'round the city looking like a mannequin
Ups and downs shifted by prescriptions you're handin' him
So America  is it really worth it? I'm asking ya
Doctor  please
Give me a dose of the American Dream
Put down the pen and look in my eyes
We're over-prescribed
Doctor  your medicine
And your methods
Can't cure my disease
Without killing me
You're killing me
You're killing me
You're killing me
You're killing me
Doctor  your medicine
And your methods
Can't cure my disease
Without killing me
You're killing me
You're killing me
You're killing me
You're killing me
In the darkest of days
Men become kings and still die of old age
While the children become gods
At last the whole world begins to play
My body is adorned with thorns
King with a crown of thorns
I wash my feet and kiss the ground I'm on
Jump niggas cos they thought I was a pawn
This the sirens for the quiet of the storm
I opened up the door and saw
Like Jimi or Kurt before
King with a crown I shall be adored
I was not the norm I will not be ignored

A nigga couldn't decide should I rap or should I sing
And since God blessed me with my wings
Lately globetrotting through a lotta traps
I steady grab my nuts and you can roll with that
But in the streets they can't look me in the eye
Champagne Champagne
(Can I get 'em?)
The greats learned that humility is a weapon
Sever ties with the part of you too big to learn a lesson
Cos we only get a couple chances to be epic
Directly into Heaven and told me to go and get 'em with this
The purpose of my art is for people to respect me
Only way to escape the cage in a valley of roots
Be Emir to the people when they're searching for truth
Only way to escape the cage in a valley of roots
In the darkest of days
Men become kings and still die of old age
While the children become gods
Then I fed my cat and then I walked to the mini-mart
And I really want a donut  shouldn't get a donut
Bought a donut  fuck it man it's really hard
Supposed to be on a diet  I wanna be like Ryan
He lost thirty pounds on that paleo
But fuck it man  I love fried shit
I was gonna get skinny for the summer
I was gonna start doing my crunches
But looking down at my stomach
I'ma go to the beach  but I'm not taking my shirt off in public
My girl shaped like a bottle of Coke
Me? I'm shaped like a bottle of nope
I'd like to order a hot dog  some bonbons
A large soda  and some tacos to go
I never knew what a carbohydrate was
Turns out that it's all the snacks I love
With a really huge package
I wanna be the 2015 Batman
And send Ben Affleck packing
If you ain't gonna treat Jennifer Garner right
You don't deserve to have that
You better pass that to the homie Matt Damon
He'd eat the booty like Pac Man
(Pac Man)

Happy New Years
Everybody got a resolution
I went to the gym and got a membership
Five minutes on the treadmill and I never lift
That was four years ago I should probably cancel this
But they tell me I gotta do it in person  ain't that a bitch?
But tomorrow though  I'ma get fit
Get me a fuel band and a fit-bit
Get me some workout shoes  and a bench press
Some Lulu Lemons and a french press
I'ma finally focus  do some private yoga
Exercise my shoulders  I'ma hide the donuts
Realign my posture  no time for sofas
I'm finally sober  no lime Coronas
But again  that's tomorrow
Before I lose that weight  I gotta get one last plate and go big
I ate all night  Kool-Aid on ice
I woke up and I felt like shit
I should probably start on Monday instead

But it's like I can't stay quiet
This is my voice
I can't let it die inside me
See I'll be scared if there wasn't a riot
Puking and fucking up the sidewalk
This battle makes it interesting
I abide desires
Like a dog pissing on the hydrant
Just to spite the fire
It's not to be taken lightly
The page is a set of eyelids
The booth is an instrument that God created
To record us trying to find him
But don't let the word throw you off
Religion and spirit are two different plots
Just know that it's bigger than me and my ego
When I'm flyin
Take me higher
I've got something to pray for
Please leave me when I'm guided
Who said that Life is cinema?
I'm right here
Put a soundtrack right in the middle
A neverending quest to try and get fans
They're gonna be so disappointed when they roll the credits and
I realize that my movie sucked and I was the only one that could edit it
I say I found something greater than myself and started accepting it
And I'm the only one with the hammer to break this shell I'm in
It's gonna take me crackin' this mirror to finally be myself again
Met my potential a long time ago and I'm not stopping til I resemble him
Past lives in light tunnels
Light tunnels
Maneuvering through the people out front
Twenty minutes late and my manager blowing me up
Security guard in the garage at the entrance
We roll down the window and show him our credentials
Terrell flash the pass and he lets us continue
I should be grateful this my nine to five
I get on YouTube tryna learn how to tie on my tie
I probably shouldn't have done the drugs I've done
I forgot my belt at the hotel
I eat a banana and I drink a cup of Throat Coat
I wish I had the homies with me here but nope
Most of the artists that I know don't get invited to this show
Because success to them determines our value
The ratings come down to who's popular now in the song in the hour
I look orange but she swears that it's natural with my skin
Like the whole industry is staring at me

I'm here but I'm barely even watching the show
Cause tonight we toast to our accomplishments
Insecurity dressed up as confidence
I said tonight we toast to our accomplishments
Insecurity dressed up as confidence
Watch celebrities take selfies with celebrities
It feels so make-believe
They want Britney Spears to make out with Madonna
So we Botox our skin and we smile for the camera
Might as well get a new nose while we're at it
And we wear it and we renamed it fashion
Picture after picture after sister after sister
Realized there's an ovation and everyone's clapping
Last night the skies turned purple and
Past lives in light tunnels
Light tunnels
So that's who we are
Just like the stars
Shine your light on

It's just weird when the camera's on you
Gotta remember to still clap if I lose
I see myself on the screen
Split into five different artists on TV
(And the award goes to Macklemore and Ryan Lewis)
Me
There's a stranger holding my award
I give her an awkward hug she says It's yours
Think I'm supposed to kiss her on the cheek
Do I talk first? Is it Ryan? Is it me?
Do I look at camera one? Do I look at camera three?
I couldn't have done it without you all in my corner
One big reality show that is scripted
And I can keep trying or get off the competition
I'd rather run out of my fifteen minutes
Than have life past me by and I forget to live it
But that doesn't mean retirement
But I don't like who I am in this environment
I forgot what this art's for
I didn't get through Freshman year to drop out as a Sophomore
But wanna make sure I'm invited next year
Same big-budget production
I know now who I am when the lights go out and it falls down
Wanted to be Wayne with the accent from the 'Nolia
Thought I'd feel better when the award show was over
But I guess I showed up late
Almost got cut off when they closed the gate
Time to explain this unruly mess I've made
I guess I showed up late
Almost got cut off when they closed the gate

Pulled me out the depths when I thought that I was finished
Yeah  I questioned if I could go the distance
That's just the work  regardless of who's listening  listening
Listen  see  I was meant to be a warrior
Fight something amongst me  leave here victorious
Classroom of kids or a venue performing
If I'd done it for the money  I'd have been a fucking lawyer
Concrete  vagabond  van telling stories
Humbled by the road  I'm realizing I'm not important
See  life's a beautiful struggle  I record it
Hope it helps you maneuvering through yours and
That's why we stay in the lab at night
I've been staring into this pad for over half my life
A true artist won't be satisfied
So I guess that's the sacrifice
And I say
Make the money  don't let the money make you
Change the game  don't let the game change you
Uh  I'll forever remain faithful
All my people stay true
I said  make the money  don't let the money make you

Forget about the fame  fortune  and the mansion
Sitting and trippin' watching myself on a plasma

Ego once swollen 'til karma catches that up  that up

I lost myself to remember who that was
We start thinkin' about some kicks  necklace
What I really need is a job off Craigslist
Take away the dot com  name  love
Fans  Twitter followers  and the buzz
See  you keep the issues but you take away the drugs
And I had to find out who I really was
Uh  who I really wasn't
So sick of who I was becoming
Yeah  tired of running
Time to look at the man in the mirror until I can learn to love him
Make the money  don't let the money make you
Change the game  don't let the game change you
Uh  I'll forever remain faithful
All my people stay true
I said  make the money  don't let the money make you

Of course I want dubs and a candy-painted 'Lac
Watch the videos and get the girls in the back
But if that's what I believe in and the reason that I rap

 and the moss
 the Mariners win it! Yes!
 with that sun-stained brim
 after practice we'd listen
 just one more inning!
 no brake pads
 we play to win
Should probably only give my opinion when I'm asked to
I'm really good at telling the half-truth
But usually only when I have to
And the grass is always greener when you play on Astroturf
Wonder why my generation poppin' pills and poppin' percs
And got some weed and got some purp
And got some bars and got some syrup
And got some Jordan's on my feet
I went and matched them with my shirt
And I just Instagrammed them both
To show you that I got them first
I'm tryna find God through a purchase
I'm not tryna go to church
I only think about myself
I only think about my work
I only think about my come-up: capitalism
Look at where we come from
We are what we run from
We are why we smoke some

 two  now
 please give me a confession
 got a long way to swim
 I need some shots for this sin
 come with me  feel like Pac when it hits
 the sweet taste of blood
 familiar places
 a sign that reads vacant
 I'm a fool and I stay here
 I die in wait here
 thief at night
 everything that's burning
 all the Lord Have Mercys
 the sin  oh Holy Father
 that's according to my gospel
 if you're judging it I don't want it
 far more than once every weekend
 I'm getting amnesia
 my faith is having seizures
 Neon Cathedral
 Neon Cathedral
 thief at night
 thief at night
There's no sea left for me
And how the sky gets heavy
When you are underneath it
Oh I want to sail away from here
And God  he came down
And said nothing
He rolled up  asked him what he was sipping on
That's the same stuff Weezy's sipping huh
And tons of other rappers that be spitting hard
Yup  yup he had five a bone
When he passed him that Styrofoam
The Easter pink  heard it in a rhyme before
Finally got to see what all the hype was on
And then he took a sip  sitting in the Lincoln
Thinking he was pimping as he listened to the system
Little did he know that it was just as addictive as base
Not the kind of hit from the kick drum
Hot box  let the bass bump
Take it to the face  gulp
Months later the use went up
Every blunt was accompanied by the pink stuff
But goddam  he loved that feeling
Purple rain coated in the throat  just so healing
Medicine alleviate the sickness
Liquid affix and it comes with a cost
Trying to escape the skin that barely fit him
Gone  get another bottle just to get a couple swallows
Headed towards the bottom couldn't get off it
Didn't even think he had a problem
Though he couldn't sleep without getting nauseous
Room spinning
Thinking he might of sipped just a little bit too much of that cough syrup
His eyelids closed shut
Sat back in the chair clutching that cup
Girlfriend came and a couple hours later
Said his name  shook him but he never got up
He never got up  he never got up
We live on the cusp of death thinking that it won't be us
Nah  it won't be us
Oh girl  this boat is sinking
There's no sea left for me
And how the sky gets heavy
When you are underneath it
Oh I want to sail away from here
And God  he came down
And said nothing
Now he just wanted to act like them
He just wanted to rap like him
Us as rappers underestimate the power and the effects that we have on these kids
Blunt passed  ash in a tin
Pack being pushed  harassed by the Feds
The fact of it is most people that rap like this
Talking about some shit they haven't lived
Surprise  you know the drill
Trapped in a box  declining record sales
So we try to sound like someone else
This is not Californication
There's no way to glorify this pain
Despite how Lil Wayne lives
It's not conducive to being creative
And I know cause he's my favorite
And I know cause I was off that same mix
Rationalize the shit that I'd try after I listen to Dedication
But he's an alien
I'd sip that shit
Pass out or play PlayStation
Months later I'm in the same place
No music made  feeling like a failure
And trust me it's not dope to be twenty-five
And move back to your parent's basement
I've seen my people's dreams die
I've seen what they can be denied
And Weed's not a drug  that's denial
Groundhog Day  life repeat each time
I've seen Oxycontin take three lives
I grew up with them
We used to chief dimes
I've seen cocaine bring out the demons inside
Cheating and lying
Friendship cease  no peace in the mind
Stealing and taking anything to fix the pieces inside
Only motivation for what the dealer's supplying
Thinking I would never do that  not that drug
And growing up nobody ever does
Until you're stuck
Looking in the mirror like I can't believe what I've become
Swore I was going to be someone
And growing up everyone always does
We sell our dreams and our potential
To escape through that buzz
Just keep me up  keep me up
 my uncle was  and I kept my room straight
 tears rushing down my face
 Ben  you've loved girls since before Pre-K
 Yeah  I'm good at little league
 rewiring of a pre-disposition
 aw nah  here we go
 my love  my love
 I would think hip-hop hates me
 that's gay gets dropped on the daily
 yet our genre still ignores it
 the complexion of your pigment
 there is no difference
 those words aren't anointed
 but that's not important
 damn right I support it
 my love  my love
 we turn our back on the cause
 some would rather die than be who they are
 we have to change us
 we come from the same one
 underneath it's all the same love
 sing
 my love  my love
 in my head I'm like  Aw yeah!
 man
 she got a booty mane
 she love my dookie chain
 bathroom door open when she boo boo-ing
 Are you awake?
 said Good night. You my babe.
 you're spooning
 you're spooning me
 let's get lost in these bed sheets
 Shel Silverstein (He's awesome)
 might as well be in a seminar
 completely numb in my left arm
 I need my homies
 but I need my homies. (YUP)
 but inside I'm resentful
 you're busted!
 do you even know what love is?!
 say Fuck it and then busted (sleep tight)
 you're spooning
 you're spooning me
 you know I got you
 no costumes
 but every now and then in bed I know when to say: Alright  it's my turn to be the small spoon.
 I put my hands around your waist
 Good night my love  it's been one hell of a day.
 I'm sleeping... space
 you're spooning me
Sometimes you just have to wait
I never believed in God
But things got so fucked up that I had to pray
Used to steal my daddy's cabernet
Never thought that it would turn into a rattlesnake
Thinkin' everything'll be all right
Rollin' round with nowhere to go
Argue with the homies over who's gonna roll
'Til it's two in the morn' when the rain hits the windshield
And everything is still
Nothin' really is a big deal
One hand on the steerin' wheel
And we gon' be all right
I had a brown paper bag
St. Ides in that motherfucker
Crawl under broken fences
And when I lose perspective
Need to go to a place where I lose reception
Lookin' at the satellites pass by
Reflectin' on my past life
I can barely remember last night
Where would I be?
I know the devil fancy me
But that don't mean the motherfucker get to dance with me

Only reason I would ever leave my hometown
Those three-plus years  I was so proud of
And I threw 'em all away for two Styrofoam cups
The irony  everyone will think that he lied to me
Made my sobriety so public  there's no fuckin' privacy
If I don't talk about it  then I carry a date
A 08/10/08 that now has been changed
And everyone that put me in some box as a saint
That I never was  just a false prophet that never came
And will they think that everything that I've written has all been fake?
Or will I just take my slip to the grave?
Uh  what the fuck are my parents gonna say?
The success story that got his life together and changed
And you know what pain looks like
When you tell your dad you relapsed and look him directly into his face
Deceit on your shoulders  deceivingly heavy weight
Haven't seen tears like this on my girl in a while
The trust that I once built's been betrayed
But I'd rather live tellin' the truth and be judged for my mistakes
Than falsely held up  given props  loved and praised
I guess I gotta get this on the page
Feeling sick and helpless  lost the compass where self is
I know what I gotta do  and I can't help it
One day at a time is what they tell us
Now I gotta find a way to tell them  uh
God help 'em  yeah

Back of that meeting on the east side  shakin'  tweakin'
Hope that they don't see it  hope that no one is lookin'
That no one recognizes that failure under that hoodie
Just posted in the back with my hands crossed  shooken
Out that door  but before I can make it
Somebody stops me and says  Are you Macklemore?
Maybe this isn't the place or time  I just wanted to say that
If it wasn't for 'Otherside ' I wouldn't have made it
I just look down at the ground and say  Thank you
She tells me she has nine months and that she's so grateful
Tears in her eyes  lookin' like she's gonna cry  fuck
I barely got forty-eight hours  treated like I'm some wise monk
I wanna tell her I relapsed  but I can't
I just shake her hand and tell her  Congrats
Get back to my car  and I think I'm trippin'  yeah
'Cause God wrote Otherside  that pen was in my hand
I'm just a flawed man  man  I fucked up
Like so many others  I just never thought I would
I never thought I would  didn't pick up the book
Doin' it by myself didn't turn out that good
If I can be an example of gettin' sober
Then I can be an example of startin' over
If I can be an example of gettin' sober

Everyone's greatest obstacle  I beat 'em
Celebrate that achievement

And got around 980 on my SATs
Generation of kids choosin' love over a desk
You put those hours in  and look at what you get
Nothin' that you can hold  but everything that it is
Ten thousand

Ten thousand hours felt like ten thousand hands
Ten thousand hands  they carry me
Ten thousand hours felt like ten thousand hands
Ten thousand hands  they carry me
Slow motion as time slips through my knuckles
Nothing beautiful about it  no light at the tunnel
For the people that put their passion before them being comfortable
Bangin' on tabletops  no Subs to toot
Scrapin' my knuckles  I'm battlin' with some drug abuse
I lost another friend  got another call from a sister
And I speak for the people that share that struggle too
Like they got somethin' bruised
It's the part of the show where it all fades away
When the lights go to black and the band leaves the stage
And you wanted an encore  but there's no encore today
'Cause the moment is now  can't get it back from the grave
Part of the show  it all fades away
Lights go to black  band leaves the stage
You wanted an encore  but there's no encore today
'Cause the moment is now  can't get it back from the grave

Welcome to The Heist
The process walking right through that door  at the entry
I can’t seem to remember  the lights were so bright
And the disco ball blurred in the turn of that night
But it was perfect  I was told the tux was starched and all
You put your hand out like I was stranded
Tried to pull me on that dance floor  I stepped backwards
See I wasn’t ready yet  but you were my medicine..
Showed me that trust through that love that you held me with
Our backs against the wall as the DJ would spin
The soundtrack had changed as he played that mix
Our lives flashed in front of us  just a glimpse
We were together and experience this
You finally pulled me up  I didn’t want to
But you filled me up  from the bottom of my heart
And as we walked through that gymnasium that I’d been watching
Feeling like my chest would explode from my heartbeat
To the middle of the floor I almost panicked
You put your hand out and I fearfully grabbed it
The most beautiful thing that I’d seen on this planet
She laughed ‘cause you could tell that I didn’t know how to dance yet
We started moving and I didn’t know what I was doing
You whispered  Don’t you love music?
It’s such a gift and I’ll give it to you
But you gotta use it”
I strayed  you brought me back in
Trying to sneak a flask outside of that gym
She said You don’t need that  look within
The end of this dance you don’t want to regret me  live
Cos tonight you'll all be set free
You might also like
Last dance! the DJ yelled
Looked into her eyes and I could see myself
Like there is no morning  like there is no morning
As we circle the floor like the globe through this infinite mass
Makes us seem so small
With you in my hand like the skyline holds the stars
Not letting go  but I can’t hold on
Fading through my fingertips  watching us fall
I try to catch you with my arms
I would never take you for granted when I had you in my palms
To all I ever wanted  please play my song
And put the record to the needle  don’t ever touch that off switch
You are perfect  forget that prom dress
Somebody turned the heat on in this party
Or we’re becoming one because I’m melting into your body
The ground split right between us and that concrete
Separated my love  I could hear her calling
Separated  but I could hear her calling
Goodbye forever  never see you again

I can't seem to remember  the lights were so bright
And the disco-ball blurred in the turn of that night
But it was perfect I was told the tux was starched and all
Grabbed the glass of punch nervousness struck  stood by that wall
Arms folded  myself I didn't know yet
You put your hand out like I was stranded
Tried to pull me on that dance floor.I stepped backwards
See I wasn't ready yet  but you were my medicine

Frozen  toast to this moment
Like there is no morning  like there is no mourning
No emotions  you on my shoulder
Me lead and you follow
As we circle the floor like the globe
Through this infinite mass

I am not the logo
Been here too long and I'm going home
Is this a higher calling or just a career?
And I'm sorry doesn't cover all the pain that I've caused
I just wanna play
I just wanna stay in bed
And watch life through the shades
Through the shade

My uncle's kidneys failed when he got out the hospital
Couldn't get off that bottle
I spun the roulette wheel and I felt it all start to crash
Got kicked off that ladder I was finally getting praise from
A chance to see how we react when God decides to break us
Chipped my teeth on the curb
I just wanna play
I just wanna stay in bed
And watch life through the shades
Through the shade
And I could look the other way but it still won't erase the pain
Just another reflection in the window
Watchin' the trees pass by at a tempo
Got a round trip ticket out to limbo
And I'm getting close to my kinfolk
I'm sorry that you didn't get the memo
Water under burned bridges
Always on the road tryna earn a livin'
I remember when I bought my first ticket
This return day must be a misprint
Made a wrong turn now I'm long distance
And I miss them
I try to write but every sentence is a run on
I try to text you but I don't get reception in this tunnel
I'm gettin' on track but the wheels still spinnin'
I got a polaroid camera so I don't forget where I travel
I got a couple rolls of film I'll get developed when I get back to Seattle
But I didn't
Because I had some things I felt I had to tell him
It's almost impossible to stay connected
When you get on this train after standin' in the rain
You'd be crazy to exit
I'ma ride this shit 'til the wheels fall off

Nice mask on  I wore the same one
The greatest trick that the devil ever pulled
Was convincing women that they looked better in their makeup
I wear war paint  fight to the casket
Too tired to apologize on this mattress
Emotional detachment  what's the matter?
She's learning that she never should have dated a rapper
I don't blame her  my mind is gone
I'm at dinner checking phone calls  texts and blogs
I don't hear a word  I know nothing at all
Just concerned about the world memorizing these songs
It goes on and on
Don't wanna break you  but I'm leading you on
Ah-ah-ah  ah-ah-ah  on
And now it's gone

Didn't believe in love until we fell out
Gave the keys back  now I'm on the homie's couch
Always going out  sleeping 'round with strangers
Danger  but you can't live without her
Now you're paranoid  checking on her cellphone
Making sure she ain't like you alone
Haven't made love with the lights still on
It's like you're hiding something from me
Let's fake another toast to the good life
Predict the future  clean slate  blue sky
Fantasy of me  husband and you  wife
Lyin'  staring into those two eyes
And I can't take it back to where we came from
A pavement past emotional earthquake foundation
Yeah  let's keep swimming in the snake pit  get bit
Get out  then jump back into the suffocation
Make up and fuck to save us like we got this
Come on  this is just us  baby
And this is just a fight  this is just love  maybe
Is it just you or am I fucking crazy?
I swear to God  I wish that I could Photoshop the scars off
Cold world and gettin' my heart thawed
Then I said it all and never get lock jaw
Mouth is a sawed off shotgun at any second could pop off
How does the truth taste?
My job comes with a complimentary toothpaste
Lately  I've been living up out of my suitcase
Building trust in that I'm leaving on Tuesday
Bought a one night stand  just a bootleg
A duplication of something authentic
Heart augmented  and it's so hard to end it
I said peace before  but this time I meant it
Can't get her out of my head
This place is a mess
Holding onto cobwebs
It has us both on the fence
She walks that thin line
In and out of my bed
Each time I love her less
Can't get her out of my head
This place is a mess
Holding onto cobwebs
It has us both on the fence
She walks that thin line
In and out of my bed
Each time I love her less
And on on and on and on we go
And on on and on and on we go
Love what we had but now it's gone
Let's leave before we eat each other alive
Alive
You are the love of my life
You are the love of my life
You were the love of my life
This time we know  we know
I had to finally look
Look at the mess we had made
And all that's lacker the glory
And tarnished failures
Stare at it... and then leave
I was too comfortable
Being comfortable is what kills artists
There is creativity for validation and there is creativity for survival
They're very different places
I didn't know what I wanted to say
Didn't know how the ink would stick to the page
How to let go of the anxiety
And the suffocating fear that latched onto my vocal chords
I had to figure out how to use my voice again
So we went ghost
And just left town
People make music for all different reasons
It's the fabric that connects us
We celebrate our communities
We question our politics
I had forgotten how to do that
Not being afraid of the platform we were standing on
Not creating from a place of Don't fuck it up
But creating from a place of Fuck it up

Not just the one that we created

Music was intended to be that one thing that we could rely on to disrupt the norm
Start conversations and change the way that we think and we feel

Only got twenty dollars in my pocket
This is fucking awesome (Now)
Walk into the club like  What up? I got a big cock
Nah  I'm just pumped  I bought some shit from a thrift shop
Ice on the fringe is so damn frosty
The people like  Damn  that's a cold-ass honkey
Rollin' in hella deep  headed to the mezzanine
Dressed in all pink 'cept my gator shoes  those are green
Draped in a leopard mink  girl standin' next to me
Probably should've washed this  smells like R. Kelly sheets
Piss
But shit  it was ninety-nine cents (Bag it)
Coppin' it  washin' it  'bout to go and get some compliments
Passin' up on those moccasins someone else has been walkin' in
And saving my money and I'm hella happy  that's a bargain  bitch
I'ma take your grandpa's style  I'ma take your grandpa's style
Velour jumpsuit and some house slippers

They had a broken keyboard  I bought a broken keyboard
I bought a skeet blanket  then I bought a knee board

Limited edition  let's do some simple addition
Fifty dollars for a T-shirt  that's just some ignorant bitch shit

Don't die holding on to your words
Cause you know  that you got a whole world to change
But understand who you gotta change first
And I was like Fuck that  humility bust back
I remember the days with nothing but a bus pass
I was just a little shorty  just hopin' that I could find a bum
To buy a 40 for me and have enough for a bud sack
Yeah  and I dance on that instrumental
Unorthodox like Basquiat with the pencil
Give me a microphone and a beat box I could vent to
Music the only medium that I could find myself through
Recluse  sippin' on some lean I would let loose
Lookin' in the mirror  watchin' myself lose
Cleaned up in oh-eight  got a job makin' barely minimum wage
To get into that page
Hit the road with R.L.  performing in front of eight people
And that shit will check your ego
About around that time I'm watching that EP go
From nothing to getting us booked around the country
I know no limits  life can change in an instant
Eight people turn into sold out shows in a minute
Now watching my pops in the back row grinnin'

Last year thinking to myself like
I'ma give it everything  play my position
The next 11 months I gave it all  everything I had in me
Just music that connected and fans that rode with me
Throw me a gold mine  and a co-sign
While you're riding a couple dope rides
Two women  both dimes
Not gonna lie  that shit sounds so nice
But I got creative control  and my soul's mine
I wouldn't trade it  maybe I'm crazy
Rule four-thousand-and-eighty  it's really not changing
Now a days make good music  the people are your label
Oh my God
Feels like a victory lap
Can I have that moment
Can I talk my shit
Now they say  Don't forget where you come from
Don't die holding on to your words
Cause you know  that you got a whole world to change
But understand who you gotta change first
Macklemore  Ryan Lewis

 shit
 you can shed the skin

 Vipassana practice
 God to the mountaintop and I'm traveling
 reflecting on what matters
 lack of attachments
 this booth is my Vatican
 what I've heard
Yesterday?
Forget it
Tomorrow is?
Nada
We sit and discuss God on lawn chairs
About how we got here
I was a couple moves away from being dead
Now we meet again
Expectations are resentments waiting to happen
The measure of a spirit that no human can ever capture
Desire versus truth until I finally find happiness

I was put here to do something before I'm lying in that casket
I'd be lying on the beat if I said I didn't know what that is
It took me twenty-something years and a bunch of shitty soundchecks
Regardless of my sales or the record deals they're handing you
If the next generation takes our legacy and samples you
We'll have a bunch of mp3s and misled kids to pass 'em to
I use my veins to create the color I paint from
Delve into self 'til my heart becomes my paint brush
I told my mama I'm not stoppin' 'til my name's up
Thinking those comments on that blog is gonna save us
Searchin' for everything but God to validate you
Get insecure and then we start blaming the haters
Used to look to women to fill a part of me that was vacant
So I stare into this paper instead of sitting at a cubicle
Take all the ugly shit inside and try to make it beautiful
Use the cement from rock bottom and make it musical
So the people can relate to where I've been
Just a person on a porch putting it all into recording
Many in my past and many that came before me
I just keep walkin' my path and blessed to share my story
Passing through space and time
Passing through space and time
Space and time
Zipped up my parka  joined the procession of marchers
In my head like  Is this awkward?
Should I even be here marching?
Thinking if they can't  how can I breathe?
Thinking that they chant  what do I sing?
I want to take a stance 'cause we are not free
And then I thought about it  we are not we
Am I in the outside looking in  or am I in the inside looking out?
Is it my place to give my two cents?
Or should I stand on the side and shut my mouth?
Is it okay for me to say? I don't know  so I watch and stand
In front of a line of police that look the same as me
A shield  a gun with gloves and hands that gives an alibi
In case somebody dies behind a bullet that flies out of the 9
Takes another child's life on sight  bam!
*Gunshot*
No racist beliefs  no rest 'til we're free

You've exploited and stolen the music  the moment
The culture was never yours to make better
Fake and so plastic  you've heisted the magic
You've taken the drums and the accent you rapped in
Your brand of hip-hop  it's so fascist and backwards
That Grandmaster Flash'd go slap it  you bastard
All the money that you made
Go buy a big-ass lawn  go with your big-ass house
Get a big-ass fence  keep people out
There's no way for you to even that out
But they see through it all  people believe you now?
You speak about equality  but do you really mean it?
Are you marching for freedom  or when it's convenient?
Want people to like you  want to be accepted
That's probably why you are out here protesting
Don't think for a second you don't have incentive

And the last thing you wanna do is take a picture
But seriously  my little girl loves you
She's always singing  'I'm gonna pop some tags'
Their aunt is gay  when that song came out
My son told his whole class he was actually proud
That's so cool  look what you're accomplishing
Even an old mom like me likes it  'cause it's positive
You're the only hip-hop that I let my kids listen to
'Cause you get it  all that negative stuff it isn't cool
Yeah?
The bitches and the hoes and the gangs and the thugs
If a cop pulls you over  it's your fault if you run
Huh?
Some of us scared  some of us defensive
And most of us aren't even paying attention
It seems like we're more concerned with being called racist
Than we actually are with racism
I've heard that silences are action and God knows that I've been passive
What if I actually read a article  actually had a dialogue
Actually looked at myself  actually got involved?
If I'm aware of my privilege and do nothing at all  I don't know
Hip-hop has always been political  yes
It's the reason why this music connects
So what the fuck has happened to my voice if I stay silent when black people are dying
And I'm trying to be politically correct?
I can book a whole tour  sell out the tickets
Rap entrepreneur  built his own business
If I'm only in this for my own self-interest
Not the culture that gave me a voice to begin with
And this isn't authentic  it is just a gimmick
The DIY underdog  so independent
But the one thing the American dream fails to mention
Is I was many steps ahead to begin with
America feels safe with my music in their systems
And if I'm the hero  you know who gets cast as the villain
White supremacy isn't just a white dude in Idaho
White supremacy protects the privilege I hold
White supremacy is our country's lineage  designed for us to be indifferent
My success is the product of the same system that let off Darren Wilson – guilty
We take all we want from black culture  but will we show up for black lives?

Grip the leather steerin' wheel while I grip the thighs
See the lust stuck up in her eyes
Maybe she like the ride or did she like the smoke?
Or does she want it low?
'Cause this shit a Coupe de Ville so you'll never know
 and I was like Momma
 it's gonna make me fly
 and when I jumped
 I swear I got so high
 I touched the net!
 four stripes on their Adidas
 book bag was so dope
 though
 without leaving the ground
 I wanted to touch the rim
 and I wanted to fit in
 can you take me far away?
 I'll go so high
 this is that new shit
 I would never hoop in
 laces I can barely talk
 if it pops
 we wear what we are
 or stay in my box?
 can you take me far away?
 I'll go so high
 this would be my parachute
 this is what I am
 this is the source of my youth"
