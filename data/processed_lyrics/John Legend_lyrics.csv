lyrics
"Guess that's why I was drawn to you
This time you told me you saw me at the same hotel
You asked me how am I ever going to learn to put my trust in you
You know me because you're doing it too
Oh you're doing it again
Yes you're doing it again
Oh you're doing it again
You said it would end but here it goes again
I have to fight you almost daily
We break up so fast
Why can't we just trust each other
You can't hate me and be my lover

Yes we're doing it again
Oh we're doing it again
We said it would end
Each time you call me home in a sweet refrain
Then we flashback to the first time you put your spell on me
One moment leads to another few
Here it goes again oh
Oh leaving you is oh so hard to do
Yes I'm doing it again
Oh I'm doing it again
Oh I'm doing it again
I said it would end but here it goes again
Drawing me in and you kicking me out
I can't pin you down
What's goin' on in that beautiful mind?
I'm on your magical mystery ride
But I'll be alright
You're crazy and I'm out of my mind
'Cause all of me loves all of you
Love your curves and all your edges
All your perfect imperfections
You're my end and my beginning
'Cause I give you all of me

How many times do I have to tell you?
Through every mood
In my head for you
You're crazy and I'm out of my mind
'Cause all of me loves all of you
Love your curves and all your edges
All your perfect imperfections
You're my end and my beginning
'Cause I give you all of me
'Cause all of me loves all of you
Love your curves and all your edges
All your perfect imperfections
You're my end and my beginning
'Cause I give you all of me
And you give me all of you
I give you all of me
 but we simply won't admit it again
 we get mad then we go at it again
 I guess we say bye-bye
 and we want it again
 and we know it
 but I told her to come over
 and we want it again
 wanna kiss you again
 it's another again-
I've got to go away (But  I can call you a ride)
This evening has been (I'm so glad that you dropped in)
So very nice (Time spent with you is paradise)
My momma will start to worry (I'll call the car and tell him to hurry)
My daddy will be pacing the floor (Wait  what are you still livin' home for?)
What will my friends think? (I think they should rejoice)
If I have one more drink? (It's your body and your choice)
Ooh  you really know how (Your eyes are like starlight now)
To cast a spell (One look at you and then I fell)
Oh  I really can't stay
(I understand  baby)
Baby  it's cold outside
I simply should go (Text me when you get home)
This welcome has been (I've been lucky that you dropped in)
So nice and warm (But you better go before it storms)
My sister will be suspicious (Well  gosh your lips look delicious)
My gossipy neighbor is vicious (I'm a genie  tell me what your wish is)
But maybe just a cigarette more (Oh  that's somethin' we should probably explore)
You've really been grand (I feel it when you touch my hands)
But don't you see? (I want you to stay  it's not up to me)
At least there will be plenty implied (Oh  let them mind their business and go-)
Murray just go on

Come on in the morning
I go to bed feeling the same way
I am nothing but tired
Mand I'm just tired and bored of myself
Hey there baby
I could use just a little love
You can't start a fire
Can't start a fire without a spark
This gun's for fire
Even if we are just dancing in the dark
Messages keep getting clearer
Radio's on and I'm moving around the place
I check my look in the mirror
Just living in a dump like this
There's something happening somewhere
You can't start a fire
You can't start a fire without a spark

There's a joke here somewhere and it's on me
I'll shake this world off my shoulders
Stay on the streets of this town
They say you gotta stay hungry
I'm dying for some action
I need a love reaction
You can't start a fire
Sitting around crying over a broken heart
This gun's for hire
Even if we're just dancing in the dark
You can't start a fire
Worrying about your little world falling apart
This gun's for hire
Even if we're just dancing in the dark
Even if we're just dancing in the dark
Even if we're just dancing in the dark
Even if we're just dancing in the dark
It's heaven on Earth  but hell of a night to melt into one
She's never been afraid of sirens  head down but keep drivin'
Damn we might crash moving so fast but baby
Don't stop  I need it
Release me  it's too hard for me to hold
Nothing can stop this love  nothing can stop this love
Both hands on the floor  you go low
Who was I before? I don't know
And who am I now? Your body shows how
The past just has no meaning
Don't stop  I need it

But I can't seem to shake the pain
It's written all over my face
That I can't function the same when you're not here
Calling your name and no one's there
And I hope one day you'll see nobody has it easy
I still can't believe you've found somebody new
We've heard it all before
That everybody knows just how to make it right
I wish we gave it one more try
I don't care what people say
They're probably lonely anyway

Things got so dramatic
Things got out of hand

Make this night the best night
It's time for second chance
Turn the beat up on repeat and we can start to dance
Sometimes when we're talking
Words get drowned out by the sound
Let's get back to touching and we'll get back on solid ground
Let's hold hands
Like the young romance
Let's first kiss like the moment we first did
Can we make love like way back in the day  love?
We can lose control  baby don't say no

 that’s enough
But I've sung what they want
Some folks do what they're told
But baby this time I won't
When I look through that door
I know the truth from lie
Some things I've done before I can't justify
There are kings in my past
Things no one can be proud of
But I stand in the light I've cast
And turn away from any lack of love
I say here I go
You see me and nothing more
I'm singing what I know
I know better
I know better
Legend is just a name
I know better than to be so proud
I won't drink in all this fame
I'll take more love than I'm allowed

Now what good is a dream when the dreamer dies?
Some are better than good
Greater than great
Some are misunderstood

Sometimes it's Heaven sent
Then we head back to Hell again
We kiss  then we make up on the way
I hang up  you call
We rise and we fall
And we feel like just walkin' away
As our love advances
We take second chances
Though it's not a fantasy
I still want you to stay
We're just ordinary people
We don't know which way to go
'Cause we're ordinary people
Maybe we should take it slow
Take it slow  oh-oh  this time we'll take it slow

Maybe we'll live and learn
Maybe we'll crash and burn
Maybe you'll stay  maybe you'll leave  maybe you'll return

Maybe we won't survive
Maybe we'll grow  we'll never know

We can't lose hope just yet
And we're scared to love but it's alright
