lyrics
"Ow!
People  gangsters and pimps and people
Smokin' that lethal reefer
Up in the club with speakers
Hi hats  some base and tweeters
DJ is jockin' needles
Sweat 'til I catch a fever
Call me the illest diva
Yo  I'm on fire
People  go 'head and drink up
Get in the club  get fucked up
See me  you got get lucked up
Someone to touch and rub up
Show me some love  strip off your clothes
And take off your socks
The party's jumpin'  I see something fine
Boy  I wanna kiss you  but I'm just too shy
Let me dance with you  let me wear you out
Here's a glass of orange juice  let's go X it out
The music's bangin' way down in my soul
When you dance behind me  I lose all control
Make me grind my hips  make me move my waist
Yo  when the music come on  you take my breath away

Take me on the dance floor to feel some ecstasy
The vibe is right now and I'm 'bout to score

Can't stand when a nigga fuckin up my plans
All night ducking him while I'm tryna dance
Drunk and his breath stink  freaky with his hands
Cocky with his mouthpiece like he got a fan
Can't stand when a bitch all on my side
I don't even know her and she all up in my light
Givin' me the side eye like she wanna fight
Philly known for boxing  bitch  better get it right
Can't stand when a DJ fuckin' up the song
Know I'm tryin to shake my ass all night long
Cuttin' up the same shit all night long
High 'fore I got there  now my shit is blown
Can't stand when it ain't jumpin' like I want
Bouncer try stop my fun  take away my blunt
I don't give a fuck  he ain't gon' take away my fun

Like Darth Vader takes a Skywalker  I told you I was the street talker
It ain't my fault you gave me your Victoria's Secret's and your Frederick's
You wanted the Waldorf Astoria but instead I took you to Cedric's
You blamin' who? You namin' who? I know you ain't bringin' that lame crew
But I'm backed by the Dungeon Family  so you can go 'head wit' all that stabbin' me

Stick figure with a dick bigger than Mark Wahlberg (Oh!)
Hit a fucking ***** bitch in her ***** with luggage (Ahhh!)
Lookin' for somebody 'of' to beat the crap out

Jumped out of the 93rd floor of a building
And shot every window out on the way down to the ground

I know by the time I finish this line  I'ma hear this on the radio
Once upon a time in College Park
Where they live life fast and they scared of dark
There was a little nigga by the name of Chris
Nobody paid him any mind  no one gave a shit
Knowin' he could rap  no one lifted hands
So he went about his business and devised a plan
Made a CD and then he hit the block
Fifty thousand sold  seven dollars a pop
Hold the phone  three years later
Stepped out the swamp in ten-and-a-half gators
Now all around the world on the microphone
He leave the booth smellin' like Burberry cologne
Still ridin' chrome
Got bitches in the kitchen  never home alone
And he's on the grind
Please let me know if he's on your mind
And respect  you'll give me
Ludacris  I live loud like Timmay (Uh)
Fuck  have to clear these rumors
I got a headache  and it's not a tumor
Get up on my lap and get my head tucked tight
Sprayed  so I never let the bedbugs bite
