lyrics
"You're getting older
Your journey's been
Etched on your skin
Simona
Wish I had known that
What seemed so strong
Has been and gone
I would call you up every Saturday night
And we'd both stay out 'til the morning light
And we sang Here we go again.
And though time goes by
I will always be in a club with you in 1973
Singing Here we go again.
Simona
Wish I was sober
So I could see clearly now
The rain has gone
Simona
I guess it's over
My memory plays our tune
The same old song

And we sang Here we go again.

And though time goes by
I will always be in a club with you in 1973
Singing Here we go again.
And though time goes by
And realised
All I do is apologise
For a song I wrote in 2005
Didn't come with a warning
But fame is unkind
Put me on top of the world
Couple of girls and then
Left me behind
You can show it to your friends and laugh
I'd tell you what I'm doing now
But you don't really wanna know
I wrote you a love song
Now it's something that you hate on
And I'm sad the record's broken
But I don't think I can write a better love song
Without it I'd be no one
And now that you've forgotten me
Tell me how to write one better

I'm not gonna lie
Say it didn't work out
'Cause I live in a big house
Made a few pounds
Nice car on the drive
And I went 'round the world once or twice
Saw the sunset and sunrise
When all you do is criticise
You can show it to your friends and laugh
I'd tell you what I'm doing now
But you don't really wanna know
I wrote you a love song
Now it's something that you hate on
And I'm sad the record's broken

And I'm sad the record's broken
But I don't think I can write a better love song
Without it I'd be no one
And now that you've forgotten me
Just tell me how to write one better
I woke up this morning
And realised
All I do is apologise

 you look the same
With someone else the one that you belonged to
I never thought I'd drown in my shallow heart
I'd like to say the things I never used to
But come today they won't ever be useful
I never learned to use my shallow heart
It's just something I do
I guess it's not a good excuse
And she will always hate me
No matter what I say
Yea she will always hate me
She said you lost me baby
Looking back I guess I'm holding on to
The good we had but I know that it's wrong too
'Cause in the end she's never gonna hold my heart
I'm not supposed to be the one who's lonely
I never thought that she could have a cold cold heart
There's a couple in the corner
And I wonder what he said because she's crying
And I guess they won't remember
When they wake up in the morning
With the headache from the whiskey and the wine
I know that I have said things I regret when I am sober
'Cause we always hurt the ones we love the most
But it's good to see the girl I used to know
We could dance but I can't dance
Maybe we could stick to holding hands
Or should we raise a glass
And forget the past?
If we keep on drinking we gon' fall back in love
We must not be thinking 'cause we can't get enough

Don't know where he's going
Holds his head in disgrace
He can't escape the truth
He knows the price that he's paid
He admits that it's too late to admit that he's afraid
Tomorrow comes
Sorrow becomes his soul mate
The damage is done
The prodigal son is too late
Old doors are closed but he's always open
To relive time in his mind
Oh Billy
Billy's leaving today
Don't know where he's going
He's got lines on his face
They tell the story of his pain
He accepts it's his fate
He admits it took too long to admit that he was wrong
Tomorrow comes
Sorrow becomes his soul mate
The damage is done
The prodigal son is too late
Old doors are closed but he's always open
To relive time in his mind

Makes her body older than it really is
She says it's high time she went away
No one's got much to say in this town
Trouble is the only way is down

I'll carry you home

And another day God will give her some

Never take a chance because I’m too afraid my heart will break

Castaway in a sea and it’s frozen
I don’t mean to be desperate or pretend that I’m not torn

There's still your name on my phone
I can't believe I'm not able ... to call
We met in a beautiful place
I go back there every single day
I'm still there ... but you're not
You lit me up and you led me inside
Then you disappeared with no warning sign

I'm here to let you know
I'm here to let you go
There's still your voice in my memory
There's still a way that you move

Resting on the shoulders of your name
Do you see the truth through all their lies?
Do you see the world through troubled eyes?
And if you want to talk about it anymore
Lie here on the floor and cry on my shoulder
I'm a friend
I have seen birth
I have seen death
Lived to see a lover's final breath
Do you see my guilt?
Should I feel a fright?

But all I found was a For Sale sign
Put my hand on the gate and there's tears in my eyes
And all that's been left since the minute you died
Now they're just covered in leaves
My hands are shaking as I type in the code
But I know inside there's a piece of your soul
That they're painting over and everything else will be sold
And the piano that played on its own is not playing no more
I wish that you had called somebody (Oh)
You made me believe you were strong
I wish you had called me and told me that something was wrong
So goodbye to my best friend ever (Oh)
I can't believe you're gone forever (Oh)
I came up to find you today
'Cause I finally found all the words that I needed to say
But a dark thought got there first
They buried your ashes in a Prozac pill

Every day is closer to the end
Holding back the tears I need to cry

Many clerics wasted wine

Are there silver shores on paradise?
Can I come in from the cold?
I killed a man in a far away land
My enemy I'm told
I really want you to really want me
But I really don't know if you can do that
I know you want to know what's right
But I know it's so hard for you to do that
And time's running out as often it does
And often dictates that you can't do that
But fate can't break this feeling inside
That's burning up through my veins

The message isn't getting through
And you're listening to the sound
Of my breaking heart

You are everything I have never been
I want you to make me better
And I've been wondering why you let me in
I want you to make me better
Although that I've never read your mind
I figured it out on my own
I am so glad that I caught you in time
You are everything I have never been
I want you to make me better
I want you to make me better
And I've been wondering why you ever let me in
I want you to make me better
I want you to make me better
I won't read you your wrongs or your rights
The time has gone
I'll tell you goodnight  close the door
Tell you I love you once more
The time has gone  so here it is
I'm not your son  you're not my father
We're just two grown men saying goodbye
No need to forgive  no need to forget
I know your mistakes and you know mine
And while you're sleeping  I'll try to make you proud
Don't be afraid  it's my turn
To chase the monsters away
Oh  well I'll read a story to you
Only difference is this one is true
The time has gone
I folded your clothes on the chair
I hope you sleep well  don't be scared
The time has gone  so here it is

Arms outstretched into the sky
Tears drying on their face
He has been here
Brothers lie in shallow graves
Fathers lost without a trace
A nation blind to their disgrace
Since he's been here
And I see no bravery
No bravery in your eyes anymore
Only sadness
And I see no bravery
No bravery in your eyes anymore
Only sadness
Only sadness
Houses burnt beyond repair
The smell of death is in the air
A woman weeping in despair says
He has been here
Tracers lighting up the sky
It's another families' turn to die
A child afraid to even cry out says
He has been here

He'll judge me by the fact that my face don't fit
It's touching that the monkey sits on my shoulder
He's waiting for the day when he gets me
But I don't need no alibi - I'm a puppet on a string
I just need this stage to be seen
We all need a pantomime to remind us what is real
Hold my eye and know what it means
(CAUSE)
I'm out of my mind (8x)
Judging by the look on the organ-grinder
He'll judge me by the fact that my face don't fit

Will you be a friend of mine to remind me what is real?

And I played for you
You let me keep you entertained
With stories I exaggerate
That you know aren't true
And as you sit there making daisy chains
And I throw in a hand grenade
And tell you how it is I really feel for you
I'm sending postcards from my heart
Your love for a postmark and then
You know that you make me feel like
We've been caught like kids in the schoolyard again
And I can't keep it to myself
Can't spell it any better
L.O.V.E forever
I hope you know that
I'm sending a postcard
I don't care who sees what I've said
Or if the whole world knows what's in my head
We chased the sun til it got away
On a bicycle that your daddy made
But not made for two
Then we sat out on your rocking chair
You with a flower in your hair
That I found for you
But then Monday always comes around
And it's sad cause I can't see you now
Want you to know you're always in my head

Could you hold my hand?

'Cause I'm breaking down
And I need you here

Naked and standing in the rain

Now I've gotta live with my mistakes

We were chilling out on the sofa
Digging how the guitar goes
In a song that no one knows
Did you lick that line yourself
Or did the voodoo magic help?
Does everyone have a different take?
Do you seem real but I seem fake?
Does everyone get hypnotized by your fire?
Though you only stayed a moment
We all know that you're the one
Sure we're glad for the experience
We miss you now you've gone
We're just swimming in your soul cause
We all wish we wrote this song
Life goes on
I'm just so relieved that it's over
We were hanging out going nowhere
Digging how the guitar goes
In a song that no one knows
Did you burn that bridge yourself
Or did the voodoo magic help?
Does everyone have a different take?
Are you just cool and I'm just baked?
Does everyone get mesmerized by your fire?
Somebody's going to attack
Someone will tell you to take a side
Tell you their version of wrong or right
Somebody's gonna let you in
Judged on the color of your skin
Slam a door in the face of your friend
Simply because you don't look like him
And then you gotta find a way that you're walkin'
Everybody's walkin'
You gotta find the words to say when you're talkin'
Everybody's talkin'
So I built the words into a song
I'm hopin' someone's singing along
And even if some notes are wrong
I'm hopin' someone's singing along
'cause just one voice is not enough
I need to hear from everyone
And even when I'm dead and gone

Zero chance of rain
It’s been a perfect day
We’re all spinning on our heels
So far away from real
In California-ey-ey
We watched the sunset from our car
We all took it in
And by the time that it was dark
You and me had something  yeah!
And if this is what we’ve got  then what we’ve got is gold
We’re shining bright and I want you  I want you to know

How there was something missing in our lives
A little life
So we tried  it was more than just a twinkle in your eye
But some things you just don't get to decide
At least we tried
The first casualty of life is the plan
When I look back  I'm not even sure that
We were thinking
Somewhere
She's probably dancing with her blonde hair
Falling like ribbons on her shoulders
Just likе we always saw
Bright eyes
Spinning in circlеs in the sunlight
Darling  we tried but now it's over
We had it all and then we lost
The girl that never was
If I could say  a million words to take away the pain
What kills me is you trying to take the blame
You're not to blame
I'll never say I told you so
But sad I've thought the words
Tried drowning you in happiness
I only make it worse
We never should have picked a name
'Cause now she has a face
And now no matter what we do
No one will take her place

It’s a battle of time that I have with you

The ones who came before you only to let pride and money weaken them
'Cause the world is standing  waiting
For someone to come and change it
'Cause we need a soul to save us
Need someone to be the greatest
So many words veiling the truth
The earth is turning and it’s time for us to choose
And people will try to take you down  too
