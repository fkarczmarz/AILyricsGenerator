"Something we need to look every on
Hope that it's made of lasting wood
Within a home for our love
Then you do your thing aside
Promises i get in steady
I felt my love for you this time
You didn't feel anything at all
I felt my love for you this time
You didn't feel anything at all
Plenty of time we need to grow
Let's take the truth and slow it down
There's a lot of love we have to show
Maybe it's something faking out
Many times we were in trouble
I can't deny that I have made some
But in the end there's things to know
You might also like
I felt my love for you this time
You didn't feel anything at all
I felt my love for you this time
You didn't feel anything at all
Is what I'm aiming for
Won't you hear me now
Like you've done before
Are we going round in circles
Are we losing something precious
Are we hanging onto something special
I think so
'Cause when you're conquering my day and night
Easing the pain inside
Got me laughing all of the time
Eyes caressing my skin
Undressing my every flaw
We're blinded on an empty shore
Are we going round in circles
Are we losing something precious
Are we hanging onto something special
I think so

'Cause when you're conquering my day and night
Easing the pain inside
Got me loving all of the time
I don't mind wasting time
Let's stop and smell the roses
I don't mind wasting time
Let's stop and smell the roses
Is ever need to hang me out to dry
My hands are tired
Don't have the courage to tell you goodbye
'Cause when you're conquering my day and night
Easing the pain inside
Got me loving all of the time
Easing the pain inside
Got me loving all of the time
Easing the pain inside
Got me loving all of the time
I don't mind wasting time
Let's stop and smell the roses
I don't mind wasting time
It takes me to the right horizon
Takes me where I want to be
Blood is running down the river
I feel like fond of destruction
Is destiny playing a dirty trick on you
When you were not the one you wanted to be
Can't you see the pain inside
Over the years we can hide
How long will you be able to stand yourself
If you think no one is stopping you
Only jealousy is blind
But there's a light that brings me back
It takes me to the right horizon
'Cause everything you hear is empty words
'Cause the truth is
And I'm tired of constant sorrow
'Cause the truth is

Like the sun and the stars
Maybe I’ll be the moon
So we can shine pretty soon
Then we drift through the night
When it's getting too cold
I notice you'll be around
Living stories you've told
It's nothing ever out there but some gathering clouds
I just wanna take care of you my love
It's nothing ever out there but some gathering clouds
I just wanna take care of you my love
Of you my love
Of you my love
Of you my love
Of you my love
And then you're stuck in my head
Like a radiant rose
Make me dreaming away
Feels like getting too close
Always want you to stay
Just don't leave me alone

I know that you must feel like facing
With ruin  facing with ruin
I messed it up as always  I'm afraid of losing  I'm afraid of losing
I made you thinking oh so wrong
I made you feeling the worst
And I don't know how to get along
With myself when I'm weakened
When I'm weakened
So let's go back to our cocoon
On the blackened afternoon
I see your heart is bleeding too
Let me bleed instead of you
So let's go back to our cocoon
On the blackened afternoon

Let me bleed instead of you
Let me bleed  let me bleed

And all we need is escaping  escaping

Maybe we're just passin' through
Two souls venturin' into the moon
The life before  whoever really know?
Speak a different point of view
Common ground  flowers bloom
Make it through the meadow
Make it oh so simple  so simple

I framed it like a photograph
We glorify golden age
And all we do is fade away
Where I wanna go on the run
You can always run away from that feeling
No one ever makes you stay
And up and down is all we go
And  little less is what we know
Emotionally overflowed
Where I wanna go on the run

No one ever makes you stay

Don't you wanna stay?
You are my fairy-tale
I hope that you don't run away
Now we should run away
I can now hear them tapping on the ground
Where do we wanna go?
I know an ambush where we won't be found
Listening to the all-night-singing-sweet-melodies-fairy trees
And there is no better place to be
And so we took off to the moon
And all the shining lights in the night
You are my fairy-tale

Touch on the Earth and make it right?

Have you ever seen the light?
Nothing can stop the rain when it's pouring

Someone's wrong when someone's right
I wanna touch the other side
Will I remember what I've seen?
And have you ever seen the sun before the days begun?

Call is conquering the love for you

Keeps me warm and anchory in the stars

Lingering solitude can rip them off

Never mind when the crocodiles
Don't let you walk along the riverside
Never mind when those birds don't fly

It just feels like something we regret
Don't know what to do and how to act
Lately we've been covered by the past
But don't you think that we are made to last?
Rather than just stumbling in the dark
So far we've been trying to see the light
Anyway we made it so far
How does it feel like
As strong as the force of your fantasy
Forever more it's gonna be a mystery

You're trying to catch the break of dawn  Blame it on your curiosity
Now we have a lot of love to give
But it's not with each to all the misery
I dream of a past that we could have
Feel like we made up so entirely
Now we have a lot of love to give
But it's not with each to all the misery
I dream of a past that we could have
Feel like we made up so entirely
You stick around  You got it bad but no one's out there you can listen to
It seems to be so hard to find the colorful state of mind
But still you're trying to catch it all  Blame it on your own philosophy
Now we have a lot of love to give
But it's not with each to all the misery
I dream of a past that we could have
Feel like we made up so entirely
Now we have a lot of love to give

Just because of you I got so damn high
I don't even know how to get back down
Only if you pull me back to the ground
Let it shine like gold on a cold day
Deep dive down Gold Coast Highway
This is where you don't feel sad
With your trauma when you love her too bad
You make me feel like a reckless child
Just because of you I got so damn high
I don't even know how to get back down
Only if you pull me back to the ground
Euphoria got me way too far
It's a lot when you're lost in love

This is our loving
Just like a hunch or melody
I think we got it

Just like a place to you and me
I was driving with my demons down the road
I was trying to abide the words you wrote
I was drowning with a heavy overload
I was even with the pieces I'd been told

When will I fall into your arms?
I want to try and stand the pain
Of my long-time-hurting-feet
And what about you  you drunken soul
Is that your own will to go?
On and on until I die
Or are you going to give up now?
To give up now?

I've never run so real  so immense real

I just keep on facing up the true side
They make me wanna turn around
Thoughts just keep on drowning in my blue mind
Chances are my sorrow start to fade away
This time it got me night and day

Lately I woke up without a feeling
Without a feeling chasing me
Still there is the wonder of a meaning
I stopped believing what I've seen

We were falling in love  now we're falling apart
My baby blue  this is how I feel for you
I still want you so bad  am I losing you instead?
You  you stole my heart with grace
But I'm just dying to embrace
You  you stole my heart with grace
And I don't want you to give it back to me
Oh  I gotta see you dancing on the edge
Every time you turn around  I lose my breath
I don't wanna see you drown and fall
Scarlet paintings on the bathroom floor
Lost in a storm  but we learned to carry on
But when the love spins inside  it's the cold that makes you hard
My baby blue  this is what we're going through
'Cause you  you stole my heart with grace
But I'm just dying to embrace
You  you stole my heart with grace
And I don't want you to give it back to me

Remembering that feeling

Wants you to stay-eh-eh-yeah-eh-eh

After overcoming hour after hour
Ignoring all your demons
You'll collapse under cover of your darkness
Strangling your feelings
Be the one that you always wanted to be
Can you really see then?

So that I never feel alone again
They've always been so kind
But now they've brought you away from me
I hope they didn't get your mind
Your heart is too strong anyway
We need to fetch back the time
They have stolen from us
You've never danced like this before
We don't talk about it
Stoned in paradise
Shouldn't talk about it

Coldest winter for me
No sun is shinin' anymore
The only thing I feel is pain
Caused by absence of you
Suspense controllin' my mind
I cannot find the way outta here
I want you by my side
So that I never feel alone again

Riding high and I got low
Rank and others
Couldn't see what she was worth
On the party
Behind the sunrise in the meadow
Month of July
I was a runner
Running high without a stop
Sticking to the
Imaginable spire-spot
On the party
Behind the sunrise in the meadow
Month of July
We go up to church
And ring the bell of happiness
We go so far and we
End up in richest poverty

I am attracted to you like the sun
To the moon that I'll be sweeping when I touch your skin
Take you soaring to the wide open space league
How we explode like the lights in the dark
And how we glow
Like it will never be the truth of the minds that we forget
So let me tell you what I know if I can
You know I try
I never want to leave the bubble we've made when we create
Mmmm you're my baby
And your sweet sweet sun makes me crazy
Mmmm you're my baby
I want to lay you down and see how you amaze me
You push me up to the inglorious shadows of a craving
And if we fall we blow up like exponential assembly
I never thought that some training can stand your mind from behaving
Did you forget the joy you've reaped and all the times that we made it
We were the pink gold soldiers of the century of blissful
We were 1969
We were Jimi and Janis
We are the prophets of the sails
We choose the way of dimension
We are caught up from the amount of the frenetic love tension

Dancin' on the ceilin'

Pictures that I thought that could faint
Colours I’ve just come along getting blurred
Like it ain't never gonna be the same
And I know that I've messed up with the chances I got
All I do is try to make it right
All I do is try to make it right
Guess I’ll do this all my life
Nothing ever seems to be easy
All I do is stand in the rain
I don't really know how to get there
Just tell me 'bout the rules of the game
Everybody says that I'm dreaming
But I'm just tryna cope with the pain
I don't really care for the rumours
Just tell me 'bout the rules of the game
But I don't know ’bout the rules of the game

I´m sitting on a fortune
And falling in love
Love´s the meaning now and you
Are the one who made it true
And my blood seems obviously
E-oh a haunting melody
I try to forget
You know memories
I´m still on the run
I´m begging on my knees
Will I ever learn
How to catch control?
Will I ever know?
You go into my soul

Your friends are gotta know
Your fucked up by yourself

Don't belong to gravity?
You keep sayin' I don't care
'Cause I won't join you goin' there
So I go flex like it's better than that
Both of us human in a way
We're good and bad within a day
Is there nothin' but to carry on?
We didn't make it to the moon
It doesn't matter if it's true
Down here it's always me and you
Still a Friday afternoon
Don't have to make it to the moon
Paper planes takin' flight
But don't you like that mystery?
How could we miss such a thing?

Thoughts are passing by outside my window
Thinking of the moments with you
Dreaming 'bout the things we missed to do
I'm feeling cut up tonight
Shadows on the ceiling
I'm feeling cut up tonight
Worried 'bout the leaving
I'm feeling cut up all the time
Like my love is on the line
I keep on going with a heavy heart
When I find myself without a feeling
Call me with an empty mood inside
Patiently I'm waiting for the healing
Every demon takes me on a ride
