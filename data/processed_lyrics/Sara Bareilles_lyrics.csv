"Looking at you
Counting the steps
Between us
A hundred and five
Little blades in a line
From your skin to mine
And I feel it
Eyes on the ground
But I can't look up now
Don't wanna give it away
My secret
In another life
My teeth and tongue
Would speak aloud what until now
I've only sung
'Cause I would die to make you mine
You bleed me dry each and every time
I will come back 1000 times
You can make me wait forever
Push me away and tell me never
I will come back 1000 times

Kiss me goodnight like a good friend might
Console myself as I resign to release you
'Cause I would die to make you mine
You bleed me dry each and every time
I will come back 1000 times
You can make me wait forever
Push me away and tell me never
I will come back 1000 times
Cover my mouth
Don't let a single word slip out
Nothing could be worse
Than the risk of losing what I don't have now
Is it so bad if I wanna cry out–
That I would die to make you mine?
You bleed me dry almost every time
I will come back 1000 times
Make me wait forever
Push me away and tell me never
I will come back 1000 times
I will come back 1000 times
When letting go is braver than keeping
When innocent words turn to lies
And you can't hide by closing your eyes
When pain is all that they offer
Like the kiss from the lips of a monster
When home is the belly of the beast
The ocean is wild and over your head
And the boat beneath you is sinking
Surely someone will reach out a hand
And show you a safe place to land

The ocean is wild and over your head

Surely someone will reach out a hand

Be the hand of a hopeful stranger
Be the light in the dark of this danger

Be the hand of a hopeful stranger
Little scared but you're strong enough
Be the light in the dark of this danger
'Til the sun comes up

Step one  original sin
Underneath the leaves  Adam found Eve
Both of them found something sweet under the apple tree
Then it was over  roads divide
Step two  learning how to lie
Let me ask a question to present day
How the hell did Eve end up with all the damn blame?
All the damn blame
To all the dirty looks  the kitty-cat calls
To the ones who try and throw us up against the back walls
Let me tell you something you'll understand:
Only the little boys tell you they're a big man
To all my sisters and all our friends
We have to thank them  please
Strength means blessed with an enemy
You make me stronger  stronger
Now hand me my armor
(Hand me my armor  hand me my armor)

Step three  I see
The unforgettable  incredible ones who came before me
Brought poetry  brought science
Sowed quiet seeds of self-reliance
Bloomed in me  so here I am
You think I am high and mighty  mister?
Wait 'til you meet my little sister
You make me stronger  stronger
Now hand me my armor
What you didn't do to bury me
But you didn't know I was a goddamn seed
You don't scare me  I am of the earth
So tired of your empire
Blind men only set the world on fire
Sad you can't see it
You brought the flame  here comes the phoenix
You make me try harder
You make me stronger  stronger
Hand me my armor
You make me stronger  stronger
Hand me my armor
(Hand me my armor  hand me my armor)
(Hand me my armor  hand me my armor)
Hand me my armor (Hand me my armor)
It's a bad idea me and you
I've never known anything so true
It's a terrible idea me and you
You have a wife
You have a husband
You're my doctor!
You've got a baby coming
It's a bad idea me and you
Let's just keep kissing till we come to
Heart stop racing let's face it making mistakes like this
Will make worse what was already pretty bad
Mind stop running it's time we just let this thing go
It was a pretty good bad idea
Wasn't it though
It's a bad idea me and you
It's a bad idea me and you
It's a bad idea me and you
Hold me close while I think this through
Umm....
Hmm........yeah

I need a bad idea

I need a bad idea
I need a bad idea
Just one
Heart keep racing let's make mistakes let us say so what
And make worse what was already pretty bad
This secret is safe
No reason to throw it away
When there's love to be had
Hold me tight as I tell myself that you might make sense
And make good what has been just so bad
Let's see this through
It's a pretty good bad idea
To burden your mouth for what you say
No pieces of paper in the way
'Cause I can't continue pretending to choose
These opposite sides on which we fall
No right minds could wrong be
This many times
My memory is cruel
I'm queen of attention to details
Defending intentions if he fails
Until now: he told me her name
It sounded familiar in a way
And I could have sworn I'd heard him say it
Ten thousand times
Leave unsaid unspoken
You and me
Always between the lines
Between the lines

That we'd move from the shadows on the wall
And stand in the center of it all
Mine was so easy to uncover
He'd already left with the other
So I've learned to listen through silence
Leave unsaid unspoken
I tell myself all the words he surely meant to say
I'll talk until the conversation doesn't stay on
Leave unsaid unspoken
Between the lines
Between the lines
That'll eat this up babe
I know that it's your soul but could you bottle it up and
Get down to the heart of it
No it's my heart you're shit out of your luck
Don't make me tell you again my love love love love
Love love love love
I am aiming to be somebody this somebody trusts
With her delicate soul
I don't claim to know much except soon as you start
To make room for the parts
That aren't you it gets harder to bloom in a garden of
Love love love love
Love Love love love
Worth trying to be and it's
I do it for love
We can understand the sentiment you're saying to us
And get started
At keeping your part of the bargain
You're killing me sweetly with love love love love

Started as a flicker meant to be a flame
Still a baby in a cradle gotta take my first fall
Baby's getting next to nowhere with her back
Against the wall
You meant to make me happy make me sad
But save your resolutions for your never new year
There is only one solution I can see here
Love you're all I ever could need
Only one good thing worth trying to be
Only gonna get get what you give away
You can turn a phrase into a weapon or a drug
You can be the outcast
Or be the backlash of somebody’s lack of love
Or you can start speaking up
Nothing’s gonna hurt you the way that words do
When they settle ‘neath your skin
Kept on the inside and no sunlight
Sometimes a shadow wins
But I wonder what would happen if you
Say what you wanna say
And let the words fall out
With what you want to say
And let the words fall out
I just wanna see you
I just wanna see you
I just wanna see you
I wanna see you be brave

Fallen for the fear
And done some disappearing
Bow down to the mighty
Maybe there’s a way out of the cage where you live
Say what you wanna say

With what you want to say
And let the words fall out
And since your history of silence
Won't do you any good
Did you think it would?
Let your words be anything but empty
Why don't you tell them the truth?
Say what you wanna say
And let the words fall out
With what you want to say

I just wanna see you
I just wanna see you

But what kind of heart doesn't look back
At the comfortable glow from the porch  the one I will still call yours?
All those words came undone and now I'm not the only one
Facing the ghosts that decide if the fire inside still burns
Holds my love in his hands  still I'm searching for something
Out of breath  I am left hoping someday I'll breathe again
I'll breathe again
Open up next to you and my secrets become your truth
And the distance between that was sheltering me comes in full view
Hang my head  break my heart built from all I have torn apart
And my burden to bear is a love I can't carry anymore
Holds my love in his hands  still I'm searching for something
Out of breath  I am left hoping someday I'll breathe again
It hurts to be here
I only wanted love from you
It hurts to be here
What am I going to do?

I'm the one that you always choose
She will falter and gift her blame
And it starts all over again
Again again again again..
She is bright lights and cityscapes

And she'll take all you ever have
But I'm gonna love you
But I'm gonna love you
You'd never have to ask
I'm gonna love you
'Til you start looking back
I'm gonna love you so right
I wouldn't need a second chance
Shield your eyes from the truth at hand
Tell me why it'll be good again
All those demons are closing in
And I don't want you to burn
Nevermind what I said before
I don't want any less anymore
You are carbon and I am flame
I will rise and you will
Remain

Long ago  and so many years before we
Ever were  ever dreamed we even could be
There was her and her very first heartbeat
All alone in a corner of the night sky
Spiral bones of a supernova starlight
Fell in love with another burning bright
She dreamed of a way to ignite
She said
Tonight
Break me to pieces  I
I think you're just like heaven
Why
Let's see what a fire feels like
I bet it's just like heaven
(Just like heaven)
(Just like heaven)
Such a shame  nowhere near even a near miss
Light years away from the hope of being sun-kissed
Anchored home in her interstellar sea
But poor lonely Cassiopeia
So she sighs  and she burns with desperation
Learns to cry over love of constellations
Then: a spark from a star shooting too close
They both smiled  what a day to explode!
She said

Long ago  in a sky built before us
Stuck between the dead and the living
Filled a cemetery in the center of Queens
I started running the maze of
Built a cemetery in the center of Queens
Not meant to be wasted
We can always be chasing the sun
So fill up your lungs and just run
But always be chasing the sun
So how do you do it
That my earth is somebody's ceiling
Of a cemetery in the center of Queens
There's a history through her
And to open our eyes and to learn from the sky
From a cemetery in the center of Queens

But always be chasing the sun
All we can do is try
And live like we're still alive
All we can do is try
Is it all that you dreamed of?
Oh  if I knew what had been there waiting
I'd have screamed out and jumped up
Now here I am
With my feet on the sand
And a body that won't move
The tide's coming in
And I'm bound for a swim
In a pair of cement shoes
He takes what he can  what he wants
Doesn't matter if it's ever been given
I took the bait and a chance on a man
Sold by the boy that he lived in
And I was wrong to believe that strength makes you strong
And I had hope in a change I would see in us both
And now I'm heavy
He lifts me  but never once carried
Door number two  I've already walked through
Ask me the question:
Who coulda guessed I would be here at this crossroad?
Plain to be seen that it's all up to me
I'm no longer alone  though

Nothing moves
It's a game to be played and to lose

But maybe I'm getting ready
And this might catch fire and char this ground
I might lift this up to only be the one
Who's gonna get let down
Will I be enough to get this on its way
To find some higher ground?
Before the waters rush  I've got to make a change
Or else I know I'll drown
Baby  look around
Door number two  I've already walked through
In a instant  and who I was has disappeared
I was lost for you to find
And now I'm yours and you are mine
Two tiny hands  a pair of eyes
An unsung melody is mine for safekeeping
And I will guard it with my life
I'd hang the moon for it to shine on her sleeping
Starting here  and starting now
I can feel the heart of how
Everything changes
Oh my heart's at the wheel now
And all my mistakes  they make sense
When I turn them around
Everything changes

I was meant to be a warrior
I've lost a grip on where I started from
I wish I'd thought ahead and left a few crumbs

But you'll never see
You're so busy makin' maps with my name on them in all caps
You got the talkin' down  just not the listening
And who cares if you disagree? You are not me
Who made you king of anything?
So  you dare tell me who to be?

Oh  ooh
Don't think I need to tell you more
I needed a raise
Here's a simplification of everything we're going through
You plus me is bad news (Oh)
But you're a lovely creation
And tongue tied and twisted
But this is the last time
You'll hear the beautiful sound of love coming down
Love on the rocks
You love the chase but hate me for the runaround
We both just tired of the whole thing (Tired of the whole thing)
And I just pretend I'm listening (Listening)

The bustle and the buildings
The weather in the fall

I made up my mind when I was a young girl
I've been given this one world
I won't worry it away

Apartment on the second story
Strangers in a brand new city
Both remembering last night
Kitchen table and a bottle of wine
The only thing on my mind is you
The way the moonlight flickered in
We were stars of some old classic film
With Miss Simone
But Miss Simone
No one but Miss Simone
Moving boxes cover the floor
I've never quite been here before
Finally made a house feel like home
The years are flying past us now
But you and I have figured out how
To conjure up a feeling so true

Sifting through our yesterdays
We'll pull that memory from its sleeve
And play that song of you and me

 I'm gonna do this right
 I won't be far to follow
 I'm gonna love you so
At any given moment  you could reappear
Thin air  you're out there in it somewhere
If I could only get there  I could breathe again
Tell me how to start
What comes after you?
I am in the dark
Love what now?
No such thing as over you
I don't want it anyway
I wouldn't even try to
If I don't let go  then there is

Somebody's hands who felt like mine
Turned the key and took a drive
Was free
Buckley on the radio
Cigarette was burning slow
So breathe
Just yellow lines and tire marks
And sun-kissed skin and handle bars
And where I stood was where I was to be
No enemies to call my own
No porch light on to pull me home
And where I was is beautiful
Because I was free
Once upon another time
Before I knew which life was mine
Before I left the child behind me
I saw myself in summer nights
And stars lit up like candle light
I make my wish but mostly I believed

My love  I see you're growing tired
So set the bad day by the bed
And rest a while  your eyes can close
You don’t have to do a thing but listen to me sing
I know you miss the world  the one you knew
The one where everything made sense
Because you didn't know the truth  that's how it works
’Til the bottom drops out and we learn
We're all just hunters seeking solid ground
Don't stop trying to find me here amidst the chaos
Though I know it's blinding there's a way out
Say out loud  we will not give up on love now
Hold me in the dark and when the day appears
We'll say we did not give up on love today
I'll show you good  restore your faith
I’ll try and somehow make a meaning of the poison in this place
You were written in the stars that we are swimming in
And it has no name  no guarantee
It's just the promise of a day I know that some may never see
But that’s enough  if the bottom drops out
I hope my love was someone else's solid ground

Or where we let the floors get wet
So what if the hardwood stains?
'Cause we're collecting evidence
Of one remarkable storm
Instead of only staying dry and warm
So we won't sleep tonight
While we brace against the wind
We'll go where they take us
Until we find ourselves shelter again
We won't settle for the silence
We won't drown in the tears
We'll say every single word even if we think they'll hurt
Let the rain wash away these tears

Most days I don't recognize me
That these shoes and this apron
That place and its patrons
Have taken more than I gave them
It's not easy to know
I'm not anything like I used to be
Although it's true
I was never attention's sweet center
I still remember that girl
She is hard on herself
She is broken and won't ask for help
She is lonely most of the time
She is all of this mixed up
And baked in a beautiful pie
It's not what I asked for
Sometimes life
Just slips in through a backdoor
And carves out a person
Who makes you believe it's all true
And now I've got you
You're not what I asked for
I would give it all back for
A chance to start over
And rewrite an ending or two
For the girl that I knew
Who'll get hurt
But who learns how to toughen up
When she's bruised and gets used
By a man who can't love
And then she'll get stuck
And be scared of the life that's inside her
Growing stronger each day
'Til it finally reminds her
To fight just a little
To bring back the fire in her eyes
Used to be mine
She is lonely most of the time
She is all of this mixed up
And baked in a beautiful pie
 wondering
 beds are made
 but a thin disguise
 checking in
 she wonders where the rain is
 that's my favorite part
 shiny
 but gold is all I see
Sometimes I still see her
My mother  the dreamer
She'd say  Nothing's impossible  child
A dream needs believing
To taste like the real thing
Like some stranger you recognize
So pure  so electric
So sure  so connected
To those little believers inside
May we all be so lucky
But dreams are elusive
The kind we've gotten used to is
Nothing I can feel
Nothing I can hold
Nothing I can have
Nothing that I know
Dreams come and they go
But hold them and keep them
(But hold them and keep them)
And know that you need them
(And know that you need them)
When your breaking point's all that you have
A dream is a soft place to land
May we all be so lucky
Near that medal 'round your neck?
St. Jude's wearin' a smile
I can't go face the world
My bones won't hold me up
Of someone who loves me
You let me cry it out
'Cause you know that sometimes I can't stop
To stand up when the bottom drops
The weight of all the world
Can blind me to its beauty
But every time I need to be reminded
Someone who loves me

You rub the stars in my bright eyes

And I was destroyed leaving all my friends behind

Where I met a girl nearly three times my age
And soft curves
Just a schoolboy crush
But you remind me of her

I was lonely and misunderstood

And over slices of blueberry pie
