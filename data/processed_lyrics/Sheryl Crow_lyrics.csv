lyrics
" he's a flipped out cat
 Jekyll and Hyde
 I'm not at home
 I'm not at home
Handing me a skinny margarita with a salt rim
Sunset in the rearview on the PCH  I'm all in
It's a beautiful life
Blow your mind and make you say Ah!
When I open my eyes
Baby  that's when the dreams stop
That's why I hate my  that's why I hate my
That's why I hate my alarm clock
That's why I hate my  that's why I hate my
That's why I hate my alarm clock
Rolling 'round a bed of cash
Office calls  don't call 'em back
No  I ain't got time for that
Loading up my G4
Catch me down in St. Tropez
Just another average day
Paparazzi caught me making love on a surfboard
It's a beautiful life
Blow your mind and make you say Ah!
When I open my eyes
Baby  that's when the dreams stop
That's why I hate my  that's why I hate my
That's why I hate my alarm clock
That's why I hate my  that's why I hate my
That's why I hate my alarm clock

Lost my job and lost my keys
Got me beggin' please
Put this day out of its misery
'Cause when I finally fall asleep
It's a beautiful life
Blow your mind and make you say Ah!
When I open my eyes
Baby  that's when the dreams stop
That's why I hate my  that's why I hate my
That's why I hate my alarm clock
That's why I hate my  that's why I hate my
That's why I hate my alarm clock
That's why I hate my alarm clock
This ain't no disco
It ain't no country club either
This is LA
All I wanna do is have a little fun before I die
It's apropos of nothing
He says his name is William
But I'm sure he's Bill or Billy or Mac or Buddy
And he's plain ugly to me
And I wonder if he's ever had a day of fun in his whole life
We are drinking beer at noon on Tuesday
In a bar that faces a giant car wash
The good people of the world
Are washing their cars on their lunch break
Hosin' and scrubbin' as best they can in skirts and suits
They drive their shiny Datsuns and Buicks
All I wanna do is have some fun
I got a feelin' I'm not the only one
All I wanna do is have some fun
I got a feelin' I'm not the only one
All I wanna do is have some fun
Until the sun comes up over Santa Monica Boulevard

I like a good beer buzz early in the mornin'
And Billy likes to peel the labels from his bottles of Bud
He shreds them on the bar
Then he lights every match in an oversized pack
Before blowin' and cursin' them out
And he's watching the bottles of Bud as they spin on the floor
And a happy couple enters the bar
Dangerously close to one another
All I wanna do is have some fun
I got a feelin' I'm not the only one
All I wanna do is have some fun
I got a feelin' I'm not the only one
All I wanna do is have some fun
Until the sun comes up over Santa Monica Boulevard
Otherwise the bar is ours
The day and the night and the car wash too
The matches and the Buds and the clean and dirty cars
All I wanna do is have some fun
I got a feelin' I'm not the only one
All I wanna do is have some fun
I got a feelin' I'm not the only one
All I wanna do is have some fun
I got a feelin' the party has just begun
All I wanna do is have some fun
I won't tell you that you're the only one
All I wanna do is have some fun
Until the sun comes up over Santa Monica Boulevard
But you went to the world and you broadcast me
Trust is something you can't see
Hope you're feeling super chic
Since you made a joke out of me
Here you come walking down the street
With your fake sunshine pouring down on me
'Least I can say I have a heart
'Cause you broke it in two
Now I'd rather be alone in the dark
Just a map of the world in our hands
Everything was you and me
I can steer this boat ashore
'Cause there is no us anymore

I'll get over you
Here you come walking down the street
With your fake sunshine pouring down on me
Now there's a hole where there was a heart
'Cause I'd rather be alone in the dark
Here you come walking down the street
With your neon smile flashing down on me
Now there's a hole where there was a heart
'Cause I'd rather be alone in the dark
But every now and then you come to mind
'Cause you were always waiting to be picked to play the game
When you knew that I was always on your side
But your demons and your angels reappeared
Leavin' only traces of the man you thought you'd be
Leavin' me with no place left to go from here
Leavin' me so many questions all these years
Easy to start over with the ones you hold so dear
This isn't how it's really meant to be
How to pull it close and make it stay
And I'm left to carry on and wonder why

I bring you apples from the vine
How quickly you forget
I run the bath and pour the wine
I bring you everything that floats into your mind
But you don't bring me anything but down
You don't bring me anything but down
When you come 'round
You are a raging sea
I pull myself out every day
I plea insanity
'Cause I can't leave and I can't stay

When you come around
When you come around
No more long and wasted nights
Can't you make it easy on yourself?
You wish you were never wrong
I've been seeing you so long  but nothing has changed
You tried Adderall and alcohol  sadly  the fact remains
You're terminally normal  I'm sorry to say
So I shaved my head  I changed my name
I gave my pills away
'Cause if I can't be someone else
If I can't be someone else
Oh  if I can't be someone else
I might as well be myself  myself
Be myself
Hanging with the hipsters is a lot of hard work
How many selfies can you take before you look like a jerk?
I took an Uber to a juice bar to hear a new indie band play
They got ninety-nine million followers in only one day
Well  I snapped that pic  and I made the slip
I got into a stranger's car
Well  the heels don't fit
I finally quit
And headed back to my favorite bar

You stay together too long

Where the king of the world watches TV
And the people await for his latest mandate
To a nation of angry believers
His words are a drug while his loyal band of thugs
Cover up all his many transgressions
As long as you're still the obsession?
Is it too late to turn back now?
Too late to see the light?
Do you make a vow to Heaven and Hell?
How'd you treat thеm? Is it so hard to love?

And a fear that they'll quench the world's fires
But His name is a shield to the ones who would wield

Curtains tied up like a bat

As you throw your dinner out the kitchen door
No one said it would be easy
But no one said it'd be this hard
No one said it would be easy
But no one thought we'd come this far
You can't seem to ever fold up a shirt
And I bring it up and you think I'm a jerk
But I think we're here to stay
I can't imagine it any other way
No one said it would be easy
But no one said it'd be this hard
And no one said it would be easy
No one thought we'd come this far

When he looks at me
When he looks at me and smiles
No one said it would be easy
But no one said it'd be this hard
No one said it would be easy
No one thought we'd come this far
Half the time  you'd swear that she is crazy
Flowered drinks and low-cut dress
That's the way I know her best
She says she's lonely  how could she be?
Every night she's got company
Oh Marie
I sure hope you're happy
Oh Marie
What about me  Marie?
She likes the way she looks in her Camaro
She likes lingerie  but he prefers the sombrero
She's so famous on the block
She stumbles home around four o'clock
She claims the guys are hard to please
She wears teen perfume behind her knees
Oh Marie
I sure hope you're happy
Oh Marie
What about me  Marie?

All day long she fills me up with dogma
She's all magazines and benzedrine and vodka
There was one man she truly loved
He took everything but her bear-skin rug
And now and then it's clear to me
That need is love and love is need
Oh Marie
I sure hope you're happy

My mama taught me wrong from right
I was born in the South
Sometimes I have a big mouth
When I see somethin' that I don't like
I gotta say it
Well  we've been driving this road for a mighty long time
Payin' no mind to the signs
Well  this neighborhood's changed
It's all been rearranged
We left that dream somewhere behind
Slow down  you're gonna crash
Look out  babe  you've got your blinders on
Everybody's lookin' for a way to get real gone
Real gone

He's got high paid friends

But how I weep for those who've gone
Into rooms of grief and questioned wrong
But keep on killin'
It's in the soul to feel such things
But weak to watch without speaking
If God be willing
There is a train that's headed straight
For redemption day
Fire rages in the streets
And swallows everything it meets
It's just an image often seen

Your many virtues laid to waste
And we aren't listening

On why we waited 'til so late

No riches in trade for the fate

There is a train that's headed straight
For redemption day
It's buried in the countryside
Exploding in the shells at night
It's everywhere a baby cries
Freedom
Freedom
Freedom
Freedom
The day Aldous Huxley died
And her mama believed
That every man could be free
And her daddy marched on Birmingham
Singing mighty protest songs
And he pictured all the places
Where he knew that she belonged
But he failed and taught her young
The only thing she'd need to carry on
He taught her how to
Baby  run
Baby  run
Past the arms of the familiar
And their talk of better days
To the comfort of the strangers
Slippin' out before they say so long
Baby  loves to run
She counts out all her money
In the taxi on the way to meet her plane
And stares hopeful out the window
At the workers fightin' through the pouring rain
And she's searchin' through the stations
For an unfamiliar song
And she's thinkin' about the places
That she knows she still belongs
She smiles the secret smile
That's sure she knows exactly how to carry on

Could there still be life in Kenton's swing
With the Kennedys gone and everything?

Democrat grandparents and draft-dodging brothers
Riots down the street and discontented mothers

Money is the ex-wife and the ex-girlfriends
Money you hid is the money they're spending
Here's to the brand new diamond bracelet
Here's to the too tight ankle bracelet
Here's to the days before you went down
'Cause what goes around comes around and around
I wouldn't want to be like you
I wouldn't want to be like you
No way
But that don't make it true
I wouldn't want to be like you
No way
But that don't make it true"
