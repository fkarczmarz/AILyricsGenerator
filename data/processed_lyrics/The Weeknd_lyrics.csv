lyrics
" girl  I've been ducking left and right
 you're no good
 I fell for you  I fell for you
 time in
 lyin'
 I'm so glad we're acquainted  oh
 I'm so glad we're acquainted
 you're no good
 'get about you  'get about you
 time in
 lyin'
 I'm so glad we're acquainted  oh
 I'm so glad we're acquainted
 yeah
 try to  try to run
 sh-yeah
 I'm so glad we're acquainted  oh
 I'm so glad we're acquainted
 they know they not the only
Fightin' for my life  I couldn't breathe again
I'm fallin' in too deep (Oh  oh)
Without you  I can't sleep (Fallin' in)
'Cause my heart belongs to you
I'll risk it all for you
I want you next to me
This time  I'll never leave
I wanna share babies
Protection  we won't need
Your body next to me
Is just a memory
I'm fallin' in too deep  oh
Without you  I can't sleep
Insomnia relieve  oh
My darkest hours
Girl  I felt so alone inside of this crowded room
Different girls on the floor  distractin' my thoughts of you
I turned into the man I used to be  to be
Put myself to sleep
Just so I can get closer to you inside my dreams
Didn't wanna wake up 'less you were beside me
I just wanted to call you and say  and say

Oh  baby
Where are you now when I need you most?
I'd give it all just to hold you close
Sorry that I broke your heart  your heart
Never comin' down  uh
I was running away from facin' reality  uh
Wastin' all of my time out living my fantasies
Spendin' money to compensate  compensate
I be livin' in heaven when I'm inside of you
It was simply a blessing wakin' beside you
I'll never let you down again  again
Oh  baby
Where are you now when I need you most?
I'd give it all just to hold you close
Sorry that I broke your heart  your heart
I said  baby
I'll treat you better than I did before
I'll hold you down and not let you go
I know it's all my fault
Made you put down your guard
I know I made you fall
Then said you were wrong for me
Can't hide the truth  I'd stay with her in spite of you
You did some things that you regret  still ride for you
'Cause this house is not a home
Without my baby
Where are you now when I need you most?
I gave it all just to hold you close
Sorry that I broke your heart  your heart
And I said  baby
I'll treat you better than I did before
I'll hold you down and not let you go
I'm living someone else's life
Suppressing who I was inside
So I throw two thousand ones in the sky
Together we're alone (Together we're alone)
I'm falling only for the night
So I throw two thousand ones in the sky (The sky)
And rewire all my thoughts?
Call me up and I'll send for you
Take me down to your altitude
I don't know if I can be alone again (Alone again)
I don't know if I can sleep alone again (Alone again)
Check my pulse for a second time (A second time)
I don't know if I can be alone again (Alone again)
I don't know if I can sleep alone again

I've been tryna call
I've been on my own for long enough
I'm goin' through withdrawals
You don't even have to do too much
I look around and

I made sure I held you close to me
So call out my name (Call out my name)
Call out my name when I kiss you so gently
I want you to stay (Want you to stay)
I want you to stay even though you don't want me

Blood on pillow and one bruised eye
Drunk too much  you know what I'm like
But you shoulda seen the other guy
This ain't the right time for you to fall in love with me
And I know my lies could not make you believe
We're running in circles  that's why
In my dark time  I'll be going back to the street
Promising everything I do not mean
And only my mother can love me for me
In my dark time

Pullin' me back every time

Making those promises that I could not keep
Only my mother could love me for me

Making those promises that I would never keep
In my dark time  this is all I could be
Only my mother could love me for me
In my dark times
In my dark time
I just can't say I don't love you (Yeah)
It's hard for me to communicate the thoughts that I hold
Let me tell the truth
I try to find a reason to pull us apart
It ain't workin' 'cause you're perfect

Two puffs for the lady who be down for that
Whatever  together
Bring your own stash of the greatest  trade it
Roll a dub  burn a dub  cough a dub  taste it
Then watch us chase it
With a handful of pills  no chasers
Jaw clenching on some super-sized papers
And she bad and her head bad
Escaping  her van is a Wonderland
And it's half-past six
Read skies 'cause time don't exist
But when the stars shine back to the crib
Superstar lines back at the crib
And we can test out the tables
We got some brand new tables
All glass and it's four feet wide
But it's a must to get us ten feet high
She give me sex in a handbag
I get her wetter than a wet nap
And no closed doors
So I listen to her moans echo
I heard he do drugs now
You heard wrong  I been on it for a minute
We just never act a fool  that's just how we fuckin' live it
And when we act a fool  it's probably 'cause we mixed it
Yeah  I'm always on that okey dokey
Them white boys know the deal  ain't no fuckin' phony
Big O know the deal  he the one who showed me
Watch me ride this fucking beat like he fuckin' told me
Is that your girl  what's her fucking story?
She kinda bad but she ride it like a fucking pony
I cut down on her man  be her fuckin' story
Yeah  I'm talking 'bout you  man  get to know me
Ain't no offense  though  I promise you
If you a real man  dude  you gon' decide the truth
But I'm a nice dude with some nice dreams
And we could turn this to a nightmare: Elm Street
I'm so gone  so gone
Bring out the glass tables (Ooh  ooh)
Bring the 707 out
I'm so gone  so gone
Bring out the glass tables (Ooh  ooh)

Tell me what you really like
Baby  I can take my time
We don't ever have to fight
Just take it step-by-step
I can see it in your eyes
'Cause they never tell me lies
I can feel that body shake
And the heat between your legs
You've been scared of love and what it did to you
You don't have to run  I know what you've been through
Just a simple touch and it could set you free
We don't have to rush when you're alone with me
You are not the single type
I'm just tryna get you high (I'm just tryin'  babe)
And faded off this touch
You don't need a lonely night
You just gotta let me try (Try)

And the blinds don't work  you don't gotta check the sky
We'll be going all night  'til light
I got a test for you
You say you want my heart
Well  baby  you can have it all
There's just something that I need from you
Is to meet my boys
And you've been going hard  baby
Now you rolling with some big boys  baby
Got a lot you wanna show off  baby
Close that door before you take your fucking clothes off  baby
Don't mind  all my writings on the wall
I thought I passed my peak  and I'm experiencing fall
And all I wanna do is leave 'cause I've been zoning for a week
And I ain't left this little room  tryna concentrate to breathe
'Cause this piff so potent  killing serotonin
In that two floor loft in the middle we be choking
On that all black voodoo  heavy gum chewing
Go on if you thirsty  baby  if you thirsty
Grab a cup of that XO  baby  I been leaning
Back from the come down  girl  I've been fiending
For another round  don't you blame it on me

Taste that lean when you kiss my mouth
Bed so wet when I eat you out
Girl's friends scream that I'm creeping out
If they're not down  better keep 'em out
Ex-man hollering  keep him out

Bet a shot of this cognac  ease you out
Just one night  trying to fucking leave you out

Bitches that we came with got all of your bitches jealous (Oh!)
'Bout to leave the crib with a couple of my pirates
Driving by the streets we used to walk through like a triumph
Mix it in a potion like a science
That liquid G diet got a nigga so quiet
'Cause the shit so strong  got me feeling like I'm dyin' (Feeling like I'm dyin')
Shit so raw  nothing else can get me higher (Get me higher)
Only time you see me's when I'm balling with my niggas

Just sold out the O2 at my own pace
I can say that I’m attached to nobody
I've been getting paper while these niggas tryna stop me
Shout my nigga Doc  that’s a mentor
Had some bad business  nothing personal
But now that word out that we back
On some young Quincy Jones  dark skin Michael Jackson
And these the motherfuckers that they packaged
Their new shit all be soundin' like my past shit
Bring your girl to my show  give her floor seats
Then she go downtown like she owe me
XO  XO  XO
Mix it up  pour it up  take it down slow
This my sound  nigga  fuck your sound
Did it from the ground  ask around  bitch
When I touch down  I'ma shake shit up
Fuck your new man  I'ma break it up
He can come back when I go on the road
But that pussy mine for the next three months
’Cause the kid back  kid back  kid back
Cop ten whips for my niggas when we land
Queen Street nigga making money overseas
Had a few more debts  I'ma pay it all in cash
Shout out XO  shout out to the boy
Broke bread on tour  man  it’s all love now
Shout my nigga Stix  doing good in these streets
Bet he popping more bottles than us right now
Reason why they stressing  city never sunny
When the kid come through with more niggas than Apollo
But ain’t shit funny  can’t nobody stop me
All my hoes are trained  I make all of them swallow
All of them swallow  all of them swallow
All of them swallow  (I make) all of them swallow

I got a brand new place  I think I've seen it twice all year
I can't remember how it looks inside
So you can picture how my life's been
I went from starin' at the same four walls for 21 years
To seein' the whole world in just 12 months
Been gone for so long I might have just found God
Probably not if I can't keep up with lovin'
And I can't stand talkin' to brand new girls
Only bitches down to fuck when you shower them with ones
Probably not if my niggas round them up
Probably not if we take 'em to my spot
Probably not if I tweak all day just to sleep at night
Goddamn  I'm high
My doctor told me to stop
And he gave me somethin' to pop
And I mix it up with some Adderall's
And I wait to get to the top
And I mix it up with some alcohol and I pour it up in a shot
I don't care about you  why you worried 'bout me?
All I want is that smoke  give me all of that smoke
Last week was my rough week
I'm still drippin' down from my nose
And I don't know how to drive  I make my driver get high
But If he goes under that 110  believe my driver get fired
And I don't got any friends  I got XO in my bloodwork
And I'm posted up down in Florida  
Ft. Lauderdale to that MIA
Cold drinks with Grand Marnier
To the break of dawn  Kahlua milk
White Russian when the sun hits
White Russians with tongue tricks
I like the feeling of tongue rings
She like the way my whole tongue flip
She grind hard for tuition
She grind hard 'til her teeth chip
I make her hide it with gold grills
I make her suck it with gold grills
In the back room of the VIP  she don't ever sleep…

Twisting turns in 'em  the only girls that we fuck with
Seem to have 20 different pills in 'em
They tell us that they love us
Even though they want a next man
And the next man's bitch want the third man
Rehearse lines to them and then we fuck faces
Yeah  we know just how to get a buzz
Mix it with the hash  come fuck with us
These bitches can't touch what we got if they wanted
I'll plug any nigga that'll step

'Cause I'm not as hard as I make it seem to be
And it could have went so many ways
So many ways it can go
'Cause ain't nobody feels the way that I feel when I'm alone

I'm fucking gone right now
From the morning to the evening
Complaints from the tenants
Got the walls kicking like they six months pregnant
Drinking Alizé with our cereal for breakfast
Girls calling cabs at dawn quarter to seven
Rockin' with our city like a sold out show
House full of pros that specialize in the ho'in'
Make that money rain as they taking off they clothes
Order plane tickets
Cali is the mission
Visit every month like I'm split life living
Let the world listen
If a hater's caught slipping
Then my niggas stay tight
Got my back like Pippen
Fast life gripping
Codeine cups paint a picture so vivid
Fakes try to mimic
Get girls timid
But behind closed doors they get poles so rigid

Push it to the limit
Push it through the pain
I push it for the pleasure like a virgin to the game
A virgin to that money
A virgin to the fame
So this my only chance
And when I'm over only pray
That I flow from the bottom
Closer to the top
The higher that I climb
The harder I'ma drop
These pussy ass niggas tryna hold on to their credit
So I tell them use a debit
Watch they image start to lessen
I warn them like discretion
Why these niggas testing?
Always fucking testing
Why these niggas testing?
Shit that I got them on straight bar hopping
To the music of the ambiance
Get shit popping
Zombies of the night (Zombies of the night)
Niggas ain't talking if they hyping to the crew
Get it in like pockets
Downtown loving
When the moon coming
Only place to find bassheads and hot women
Better slow down
She'll feel it in the morning
Ain't the kind of girl you'll be seeing in the morning
Ain't no nigga that she holding
Look at all that money
The money is the motive (The money is the motive)
All that money
The money she be folding (The money she be folding)
