"Oh  oh
What if I changed my mind?
What if I said it's over?
I been flying so long
Can't remember what it was like to be sober
What if I lost my lives?
What if I said game over?
What if I forget my lines
And I lose all my composure?
Honestly she's the only one that's watching over me
Gives me oxygen when it gets hard to breathe
And if I'm wrong or right
She's always on my side
And if I lose the fight
I know she'll bring me back
Bring me back  bring me back to life
Bring me back
Bring me back  bring me back to life
You might also like
What if we never met?
What if I never saw her?
'Cause I've been burning up for so long
In a world that just keeps getting colder
Honestly she's the only one that's watching over me
Gives me oxygen when it gets hard to breathe
And if I'm wrong or right
She's always on my side
And if I lose the fight
I know she'll bring me back
Bring me back  bring me back to life
Bring me back
Bring me back  bring me back to life
Nobody does this like you
I've been around the world
I seen a lot of girls
I been a lot of places
I seen a lot of faces
Nobody does this like you
Honestly she's the only one that's watching over me
Gives me oxygen when it gets hard to breathe
And if I'm wrong or right
She's always on my side
And if I lose the fight
Not like this
I don't drink to get drunk
I feel all the right funk
If there's somethin' I want
I'll take all the right wrongs now
I'm gonna stay in my zone
I'm tired of pickin' that bone
And I can't be bothered
Shame is you won't say that to my face
You might also like
I've done this before
Time for me to move up
So many hours have gone
Heart beats the pump of my blood
No strings for you to pull on
You've got your tongue in your cheek
So pardon if I don't speak
Can't tune my chords
Shame is you won't say that to my face
I've done this before
Flashing lights
Shame is you won't say that to my face
Shame is you won't say that to my face
It hurts so bad that I didn't when you asked for more
Your dad probably loves me more than he ever did now
'Cause I finally got out
'Cause sometimes it's better that way
Gotta let it go so your heart don't break
'Cause I love you
Know you might not feel quite the same way
But I love you
Why? Why wait to fight?
Give it a try
Can we save tears in your eyes?
I'm making you cry
Why wait to hate? Can we save love?
I can't let you fall through the floor too
It's a gamble to take any more of you
(It's a gamble to take-take more you)
You might also like
So why would we ruin that?
Now you wanna ask for names
We can't let this fruit go bad
Sayin' things we can't take back
Say you feel the same
Why? Why wait to fight?
Give it a try
Can we save tears in your eyes?
And watching you cry
In her eyes  where I wanna be
And her smile is all I see
She knows I need her loving
She knows I need her touching
She plays with my heart and emotion
I give her my love and devotion
She gives thoughts and a notion
I need her body  it needs me too
I need somebody to love me blue
I've been doing it wrong for too long
I said I've been at it wrong for too long
I've been doing it wrong for too long
In the clouds  where the angels sing
In her eyes  where I wanna be
She knows I need her loving
She knows I need her touching
She plays with my heart and emotion
I give her my love and devotion
She gave me her thought and a notion
I need her body  she needs me too (Too)

I feel depleted from feelings I've been revealin'
It's do or die  I'm not goin' willing
But when it's time  wrap in white linen
I rap this  I say it for my sanity
Whatever the calamity  I did this for myself
Fuck all of your fantasies
You're a snake  fell off the ladder
I prefer speakin' in analogies
I've had enough of all this wet
And I can't trust that you're my family
I don't know what's next
The brain dead that I never miss
My brain lives with the cannabis
Can I resist the dark abyss?
Leave a mark on this with no start  just exist
My mind's in a prism shape
And in timеs like a prison state
Therе's no right that I feel of late
There's no light if my view's at stake
And which life should I choose to take?
What's left  is it room or space?
There are rumours we have to face
I prefer sooner than after late
I seen actors after BAFTA's be more straight
I mean down the barrel
I hear 'em sing  it's the same carol
They're tryna sprint in a long run  Mo Farah
They're tryna fix when it's long gone  don't bother
There's no other  the thought shudders through most lovers
I wanna bed you  but still sleep is death's cousin
So two weeks is now four dozen
Years that pass by  can't press no rewind
Just watch my life by and lock the right ties

That's when you hit me up
That's when we feel a little closer
Just when I started thinkin'
It's like a force we can't explain
I thought of you in the next moment
Givin' me that feelin'
Could be my suspicion
Like you come into the picture
I don't wanna miss out on another love
So I'm gonna dive right in

Go through Armageddon
Girl I got you
So I will follow
Hold you close standing on the edge of no tomorrow
So I still follow

That's how I feel the soul inside her body
Can't believe my eyes I swear
Fingertips touch all I want

I'd rather be anywhere  anywhere but here
I close my eyes and see a crowd of a thousand tears
I pray to God I didn't waste all my good years
All my good years
All my good years
The voices screaming loud as hell
We don't care 'bout no one else
Nothing in the world could bring us down
Now we're so high among the stars without a worry
And neither one  one of us wants to say we're sorry
I'd rather be anywhere  anywhere but here
I'd rather be anywhere  anywhere but here
I close my eyes and see a crowd of a thousand tears
I pray to God I didn't waste all my good years
All my good years
All my good years
Too much drugs and alcohol
What the hell were we fighting for?
'Cause now the whole damn world will know
That we're too numb and just too dumb to change the story

If it means I get to fly again
I put my all in
Like a dream I’m trying to fight against
I don't mind wishing
We're just dancing in the dark again
The light blows
Don’t wanna spend time on the issue
We'll never grow old when I'm with you
When I'm with you
The sun never comes up
When I'm with you
I can find you when you're lost
Girl you'll never see me running out

If you wanna stay up late
Girl we'd still make it
If the planets all faded away
You might think I'm crazy
But I know you're my baby anyway
Girl you took two minutes out of my life
Yeah who told ya I ain't with it? I need ya
I don't want 'em back

All in the streets
Burning my eyes red
Not slept for weeks
Testing your torment
My future is bleak
Lost in the moment
With no words to speak
I can't find no peace
(I can't find no peace)
Am I a fool
Waiting for you?
What if you never come back?
What if you never come back?
There's nothing new
What if we never know why hearts deceive us?
The night calls to dreamers
My sleep was stolen
I'm searching for thieves
These memories in my head
So vivid to see

Time heals pain and promotes self-soothin'
When the scars are gone  you can't see bruising
Wanna take these watches  chains and gold rings
