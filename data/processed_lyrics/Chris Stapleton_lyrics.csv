lyrics
"Good news is hard to find
And I work on the factory line
And all I do is stay behind
Call my mama like I should
She says daddy ain't doing too good
Me and him should wet a line
Just can't seem to find the time
But I love my life
Man it's something to see
It's the kids and the dogs and you and me
It's the way it's alright when everything goes wrong
It's the sound of a slow simple song
Finally saved some money up
'Til I had to fix my truck
Talked to brother the other day
He didn't have too much to say
Tryna quit these cigarettes
I can't seem to kick em yet
Sister got laid off last fall
And I got high cholesterol

Man it's something to see
It's the kids and the dogs and you and me
It's the way it's alright when everything goes wrong
Folded wings that used to fly
They've all gone wherever they go
Broken halos that used to shine
Angels come down from the heavens
Just to help us on our way
And they find some other soul to save
Seen my share of broken halos
Folded wings that used to fly
They've all gone wherever they go
Broken halos that used to shine
Broken halos that used to shine
Don't go looking for the reasons
Don't go asking Jesus why
We're not meant to know the answers
They belong to the by and by
They belong to the by and by

Oh  why you got to be so cold?
Why you got to go and cut me like a knife

Right here in the middle of my soul
What am I supposed to say
If anybody asks me about you?
I guess I'll tell 'em I'm without you
How am I supposed to live
When I built my life around you?
Try to put yourself in my shoes

I guess he's finished talkin' to the Lord
He used to fold his hands and bow his head down to the floor
But daddy doesn't pray anymore
I remember even when the times were bad
He thanked Jesus for everything he had
For a good wife and three children and the food upon our plates
Daddy doesn't pray anymore
I guess he's finished talkin' to the Lord
He used to fold his hands and bow his head down to the floor
But daddy doesn't pray anymore
There was a time when we didn't get along
'Cause I thought I was right and he was wrong
Still when I laid down at night I'd hear him get down on his knees
And say a little prayer for me
Daddy doesn't pray anymore
I guess he's finished talkin' to the Lord

Today I followed daddy down to church
And listened to the preacher read God's word
And we sang his favorite hymn but daddy didn't make a sound
And this afternoon we'll lay him in the ground
Daddy doesn't pray anymore
I guess he's finally walkin' with the Lord
He used to fold his hands and bow his head down to the floor
I can't look up enough to see the sky
There ain't no good light here below
Death Row
Death Row
Don't want no preacher man to come around
I don't need him to lay my burden down
Already told Jesus everything I know

When it's time for my last request
Tell my mama that I did my best
Tell my baby that I love her so

The minute that I saw you walkin' over
I figured I was diggin' my grave
But you're just the kind of trouble I crave
Just the kind of trouble I crave
And mama always set a good example
Daddy always gave me good advice
Jesus tried to steer me in the right direction
But the devil always made me think twice

The alarm clock rang two hours late
The garbage man left all the trash on the sidewalk
And the hinges fell off of the gate
And this morning at breakfast  I spilled all the coffee
And opened the door on my knee
Was to have you walk out on me
Last night you came home late  and I knew you'd been drinking
By that old mellow look on your face
And you fill such a big empty space
And I laid down beside you  and I wanted your loving
'Cause your love makes my life complete
Was to have you walk out on me
So excuse me for looking  like my world just ended
And excuse me for looking  like I just lost my best friend
And excuse me for loving  and being forgiving

The last thing I needed  the first thing this morning
Was to have you walk out on me
About an old friend of mine
Somebody left her in a shopping cart
In a parking lot for us to find
Just a fuzzy black pup
She was hungry and feeling alone
We put her in the back seat
And told her we were takin' her home
With the heart of a rebel child
Be just as free as you are wild
A few kids later
We moved out on the farm
And she followed those kids around
And she loved to chase squirrels
And playin' out in the snow
She'd take off like a bullet

It was rainin' on a Monday
The day that Maggie died
She woke up and couldn't use her legs
So I laid down by her side
She put her head on my hand
Like she'd done so many times
I told her she was a good dog
Then I told her goodbye
With the heart of a rebel child
Be just as free as you are wild
I had a revelation
As the tractor dug a hole
I can tell you right now
That a dog has a soul
And I thought to myself
As we buried her on the hill
I never knew me a better dog
And I guess I never will
With the heart of a rebel child
Be just as free as you are wild
With the heart of a rebel child
 gave me forty days
 ten for the judge
And kicked me out the door
Now I'm livin' in one room
And sleepin' on the floor
I think I'm gonna kick my boots off
And put some music on
And since I'm all alone
I might as well get stoned
I might as well get stoned
And get it off my mind
Ain't got a thing to do
All I've got is time
The bottle's all I've had
To be a friend of mine

Think I'll find a long whitе line
Curse the world and lеave it all behind

Everything changes like the desert wind
I'm just a traveller on this earth
Sure as my heart's behind the pocket of my shirt
I'll just keep rollin' 'til I'm in the dirt
'Cause every turn reveals some other road
My heartbeat's rhythm is a lonesome sound
Just like the rubber turnin' on the ground
Always lost and nowhere bound
I'm just a traveller on this earth
Sure as my heart's behind the pocket of my shirt
I'll just keep rollin' 'til I'm in the dirt
'Cause every turn reveals some other road

When I'm gone
Somebody else will have to feel this wrong
Somebody else will have to sing this song
Somebody else will have to sing along
Sing along
I'm just a traveller on this earth
Sure as my heart's behind the pocket of my shirt
I'll just keep rollin' 'til I'm in the dirt
'Cause every turn reveals some other road
As they marched along the way
A fife and  drum began to play
All on a beautiful morning
One was gentle  and one was kind
One came home  one stayed behind
A cannonball  don't pay no mind
All on a beautiful morning
Cannonball  don't pay no mind
Though you're gentle  or you're kind
You don't think of the folks behind
All on a beautiful morning
Two girls waiting down the railroad track
For their darlings to come back
One wore blue  and one wore black
And not have her checking  my breath
I'm tired of her turning her questions
Into the Gettysburg Address
There's no reason why she shouldn't trust me
The fact that she don't makes me mad
Can't count all the times that I've begged her
I used to drink like a fish and run like a dog
Done a whole lotta shit not permitted by law
People called me the Picasso of painting the town
I've finally grown up
I've finally changed and that someone I was
Is somebody I ain't
But she finds it hard to believe that she's turned me around
So I'll probably die before I live all my
Up to no good livin' down
Gave up on bringing her flowers
That just kept making things worse
I ain't been guilty of nothing
But being the man she deserves

I used to cuss like a sailor and howl at the moon
And I woke up some mornings with I-don't-know-who
But I never dreamed back then I'd have to pay for it now
Up to no good livin' down
 just a guitar and a roof
 when I poured I never missed
 I’d just lose anyway
 I’ve come around
 I’ve come around
 I guess only time will tell
 I’ve come around
And shoot up a crowd tryna have fun
And the band will play and go on with the show
And you're gonna get your turn
Devil gonna watch you burn
But I had friends in your company
You're gonna get your turn
Devil gonna watch you burn
Before you mail out your bombs or pull a trigger in a synagogue

 you know what song
 tonight I'm wondering
 it's about to drive me mad
And it looks like the end of the rainbow ain't no pot of gold
The things that I've done
I doubt anyone will remember after I'm gone
The places I've been
There's some I'd go back to and some where I won't go again
And most of the time I'm feelin' like I'm fadin' into the night
But when I'm with you
I feel like a dreamer
That's had all his dreams come true
Like my skies are all blue
When I'm with you
I got a good job
And I'm thankful to be workin' when so many good peoplе are not
Sometimes I can't stand
How my back and my hands
Thеy won't work like they used to
Somewhere in my mind
I'm still searchin' for something I know that I'm not gonna find
When I know for sure
I've got so much more
Than a man ever needs

I'm forty years old
You were lookin' at a magazine
It was red carpets and limousines
And the grass seemed so much greener
All we wanted was to get there fast
So we packed up everything we had
Runnin' on hope and a tank of gas
Like dreams ain't just for dreamers
We couldn't wait to leave that life behind
And try to find salvation in that city limit sign
And one of those L.A. nights
When the stars come out
And shine
And they burn so bright
They drown the downtown lights
When the stars come out
Everybody's got a part to play
Everybody's tryin' to find a way
To say what needs sayin'
Everybody's got a friend of a friend
Somebody that can get you in
Beggin' angels for a sin
In a game that we're all playin'

But I'll be over it by noon
That's the difference between whiskey and you
But your forgiveness
There ain't a thing that I can do
That's the difference between whiskey and you
At times I wonder if they ain't both the same
But one's a liar that helps to hide me from my pain
And one's the long gone bitter truth
That's the difference between whiskey and you
I've got a problem but it ain't like what you think
I drink because I'm lonesome and I'm lonesome 'cause I drink
But if I don't break down and bring it on myself
It'll hit out of the blue

And a pain in my heart 'cause I could not forgive her
That's as deep as the river is wide
I'm lost and I'm lonesome when I look in the mirror
I don't like the man that I see
Pride made a fool out of me
So I drink all night
But the hurtin' won't stop
And every shot I take just turns into teardrops
When I lay down to sleep
And I pray I don't open my eyes
To a whiskey sunrise
The cold wind blows and the leaves start to scatter
And the rain will be comin' on soon
And everything's wrong and nothin' don't matter
And a black cloud is crossin' the moon
So I drink all night
But the hurtin' won't stop
And every shot I take just turns into teardrops
And I lay down to sleep
And I pray I don't open my eyes
Feels like it's a loaded gun
My heart always wants to run
Oh-oh-oh-oh
If you want a cowboy on a white horse
Ridin' off into the sunset
If that's the kinda love you wanna wait for
White horse
Right now's just not the time
Some things a man's just got to do
I wish you could change my mind

And today dealt me another hand of heartaches that I'll play
What we said and what we meant
And time keeps raising the stakes
Tonight I'll find you in my dreams
And tomorrow I'll wake up and have to feel you fade away
That's the way it goes it seems
Tears filled with pain and they fall like rain
Constant reminders every day
Without your love
