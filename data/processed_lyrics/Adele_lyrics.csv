lyrics
"I won't say a word
So why don't we just play pretend
Like we're not scared of what is coming next
Or scared of having nothing left?
I know there is no tomorrow
All I ask is
If this is my last night with you
Hold me like I'm more than just a friend
Give me a memory I can use
Take me by the hand while we do
What lovers do
It matters how this ends
'Cause what if I never love again?
I don't need your honesty
It's already in your eyes
No one knows me like you do
And since you're the only one that mattered

Hold me like I'm more than just a friend
Give me a memory I can use

What lovers do
It matters how this ends
'Cause what if I never love again?
Let this be our lesson in love
Let this be the way we remember us
I don't want to be cruel or vicious
And I ain't asking for forgiveness
All I ask is
If this is my last night with you
Hold me like I'm more than just a friend
Give me a memory I can use
Take me by the hand while we do
What lovers do
It matters how this ends
I just wanna spend all my time with you (It feels so good)
I'm so hard to impress  don't leave me on this stretch alone
When I'm out at a party  I'm just excited to get home
And dream about you
All night long
I don't know how you got through to me (I'm so cold)
But every time that you text  I want to get on the next flight home
And dream next to you
All night long
Maybe it's the way you remind me of (Where I come from)
Or how you make me feel beautiful (And thеn some)
The sight of you is dramatic  one glimpsе and I panic inside
I get lost in our hours 'cause you possess powers I can't fight

That's why I dream about you
All night long
All night long
It's been there for days on end
And it's been waitin' for you to open up yours  too
I'd like to hear the words roll out of your mouth finally
Say that it's always been me
That's made you feel a way you've never felt before
And I'm all you need and that you never want more
Then you'd say all of the right things without a clue
But you'd save the best for last like I'm the one for you
You should know that you're just a temporary fix
This is not rooted with you  it don't mean that much to me
You're just a filler in the space that happened to be free
How dare you think you'd get away with tryin' to play me  yeah?
Why is it every time I think I've tried my hardest
It turns out it ain't enough?
You're still not mentioning love
What am I supposed to do to make you want me properly?
I'm takin' these chances and getting nowhere
And though I'm trying my hardest  you go back to her
And I think that I know things may never change
I'm still hopin' one day I might hear you say

But  despite the truth that I know
I find it hard to let go and give up on you
Seems I love the things you do
Like the meaner you treat me  more eager I am
To persist with this heartbreak of runnin' around
And I will do until I'm findin' myself with you
And make you feel a way you've never felt before
And be all you need so that you never want more
Then you'd say all of the right things without a clue
And you'll be the one for me and me  the one for you
And I'll tread any dangerous road
Throw me to the water
I don't care how deep or shallow
Because my heart can pound like thunder
So can I get it right now? Mmm
Can I get it right now? (Can I get it here?)

You think that I can't see you from over here
And I can guarantee I know just how it feels
To never be free completely
Sometimes you just feel so empty
Like lately when I have been missing you
And I would still do anything for you
But we need to learn how to love who we're loving
It's hard but we must we've got to let it go
And turn off the urge to know what could have been
But I will love you forever
Trying to make you jealous made me feel proud
But now I'm in too deep to climb out

How did it slow down? I go round and around
Thinking about it all the time
I gave you everything you never gave me
I never lied and I never faked it
Only wanted for you to save me
There's too much that I haven't said
Did you find the note that I wrote?
I hid it in the seam of your coat
It was hard to write with a lump in my throat
Do you even know that I can't let go?
Why were you so cold? Let the truth be told
What was I thinking? I gave you everything
But you still went for the kill

When you're in doubt  go at your own pace
All my friends keep on tellin' me that this feeling won't last  mmm
I have nothin' to feel no more  I can't even cry
When will I begin to feel like me again?
I'm hanging by a thread
My skin's paper-thin  I can't stop wavering
I've never been more scared
Cry your heart out  it'll clean your face
When you're in doubt  go at your own pace
Cry your heart out  it'll clean your face
When you're in doubt  go at your own pace
When I wake up  I'm afraid of the idea of facin' the day
I would rather stay home on my own  drink it all away
I created this storm  it's only fair I have to sit in its rain

All love is devout  no feeling is a waste
But give it to yourself now before it's too late
Your love is useless without it
Sitting on the sea
Soaking up the sun
He is a real lover
Of making up the past
And feeling up his girl
Like he's never felt her figure before
A jaw dropper
Looks good when he walks
Is the subject of their talk
He would be hard to chase
But good to catch
And he could change the world
You can find him sitting on your doorstep
Waiting for a surprise
And he will feel like he's been there for hours
And you can tell that he'll be there for life
Daydreamer
With eyes that make you melt
He lends his coat for shelter
Plus he's there for you
When he shouldn't be
But he stays all the same
Waits for you
Then sees you through
There's no way I could describe him
What I've said is just what I'm hoping for
But I will find him sitting on my doorstep
Waiting for a surprise
And he will feel like he's been there for hours
And I can tell that he'll be there for life
 not a single word was said
 and a heaviness in my head
 please remember me once more
 the less I know
 and a heaviness in my head
 please remember me once more
 please remember me once more
That I've been washin' my hands in forever
I know there is hope in these waters
But I can't bring myself to swim
When I am drowning in this silence
I was still a child
Didn't get the chance to
Feel the world around me
I had no time to choose what I chose to do
So go easy on me
There ain't no room for things to change
When we are both so deeply stuck in our ways
You can't deny how hard I've tried
I changed who I was to put you both first
But now I give up
I was still a child
Didn't get the chance to
Feel thе world around me
Had no time to choose what I chose to do

I had good intentions
And the highest hopes
But I know right now
It probably doesn't even show
I was still a child
I didn't get the chance to
Feel the world around me
I had no time to choose what I chose to do
Despite my empty mouth  the words are in my mind
Because you lighten up my heart when I start to cry
I need to get away to feel again
Try to understand why
Don't get so close to change my mind
Please wipe that look out of your eyes
It's bribing me to doubt myself
Simply  it's tiring
This love has dried up  and stayed behind
And if I stay  I'll be a lie
Then choke on words I'd always hide
I need to taste the kiss from someone new
I'm bored to say the least and I  I lack desire
But they don't know you like I do
Or at least the sides I thought I knew
I can't bear this time
It drags on as I lose my mind
Reminded by things I find
Like notes and clothes you left behind
I won't rise until this battle's won
My dignity's become undone
But I won't go
I can't do it on my own
I'm willing to take the risk
I won't go
I can't do it on my own
I'm willing to take the risk
What if I lose my heart and fail the climb?
I won't forgive me if I give up trying
I heard his voice today
I didn't know a single word he said
Not one resemblance to the man I met
Just a vague and broken boy instead

To watch them turn to dust

I'm willing to take the risk
I won't go

Will he still love me even when he's free?
Or will he go back to the place where he
Will choose the poison over me?
When we spoke yesterday
He said to hold my breath and sit and wait
He won't go
He can't do it on his own
He's willing to take the risk

 after all these years  you'd like to meet
 can you hear me?
 you never seem to be home
 I can say that I've tried
 it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore
 how are you?
 I'm sorry

Love will soon come
Have I not learned anything?
I don't want to live in chaos
It's like a ride that I want to get off
It's hard to hold on to who I am
When I'm stumblin' in the dark for a hand
(Hold on)
Let time be patient
(You are still strong)
Let pain be gracious
(Love will soon come)
I'm my own worst enemy
Every day feels like the road I'm on
Might just open up and swallow me whole
How do I feel so mighty small
When I'm struggling to feel at all?

How come we've both become a version of a person we don't even like?
By puttin' ideas in our heads that corrupt our hearts somehow
And yet I don't know anybody who's truly satisfied
But the higher we climb feels like we're both none the wiser
So I hope I learn to get over myself
Stop tryin' to be somebody else
So we can love each other for free
Why am I obsessin' about the things I can't control?
Why am I seekin' approval from people I don't even know?

The only regret I have
I wish that it was just at a different time
A most turbulent period of my life
Why would I put that on you?
But because of that period of time
Even though it was so much fun
I didn't get to go on and make new memories with him
Couldn't help myself  you're too good to be true
I fall short each time  every time he ain't here
You and your charm creep closer  closer and near
Like a bomb before explosion  ticking by your call
You're the wiser one  disguised from greed
And I'm just a child who longs on her knees
But I found a boy who I love more
Than I ever did you before
So stand beside the river I cried
And lay yourself down
Look how you want me now that I don't need you
So you thought that I'd crumble to my knees
At the first sight of you crawling back to me
To whisper  Will you leave your man?
'Cause you swear that this time you can stand by me
I won't stand by you
'Cause I found a boy who I love more
Than I ever did you before

And being out and stuff like that to keep my mind off of him

So come on and give me the chance
To prove I am the one who can
Walk that mile
Until the end starts
I know it ain't easy giving up your heart
I know it ain't easy giving up your heart
Your one and only
I promise I'm worthy
To hold in your arms
So come on and give me the chance
To prove I am the one who can
Walk that mile
Until the end starts
Come on and give me the chance
To prove I am the one who can
Walk that mile
So desperate to find a way out of my world and finally breathe
But when the pain cuts you deep
When the night keeps you from sleeping
Just look and you will see
That I will be your remedy
When the world seems so cruel
And your heart makes you feel like a fool
I promise you will see
No river is too wide or too deep for me to swim to you
When the pain cuts you deep
When the night keeps you from sleeping
Just look and you will see
That I will be your remedy
When the world seems so cruel
And your heart makes you feel like a fool
I promise you will see
When the night keeps you from sleeping
Just look and you will see
When the world seems so cruel
And your heart makes you feel like a fool
I promise you will see
I will be your remedy
It's better when something is wrong
You get excitement in your bones
And everything you do's a game
Who wants to be right as rain?
It's harder when you're on top
'Cause when hard work don't pay off and I'm tired
So wipe that dirty smile off
And now I've had enough of love
Who wants to be riding high
When you'll just crumble back on down?
You give up everything you are
They make believe that everything
Is exactly what it seems
But at least when you're at your worst
You know how to feel things

Reaching a fever pitch and it's bringing me out the dark
Go ahead and sell me out and I'll lay your shit bare
See how I'll leave with every piece of you
Don't underestimate the things that I will do
There's a fire starting in my heart
The scars of your love remind me of us
They keep me thinkin' that we almost had it all
I can't help feeling
We could've had it all (You're gonna wish you never had met me)
You had my heart inside of your hand (You're gonna wish you never had met me)

Until you kissed my lips and you saved me

But my knees were far too weak
To stand in your arms
Without falling to your feet
But there's a side to you
That I never knew  never knew
All the things you'd say
They were never true  never true

Watched it pour as I touched your face

That you found a girl and you're married now
I heard that your dreams came true
Guess she gave you things I didn't give to you
Ain't like you to hold back or hide from the light

We were born and raised in a summer haze
Bound by the surprise of our glory days

Always make a mess of everything
It's about time that I face myself
All I do is bleed into someone else
Painting walls with all my secret tears
Filling rooms with all my hopes and fears
I'll never learn if I never leap
I'll always yearn if I never speak

Means to lose all the things I can't live without
