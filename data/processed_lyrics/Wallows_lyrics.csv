lyrics
"Oh  why are girls in songs always seventeen?
She  was from a movie scene
And now she plays in my head all day
She called me up
And let me in
I couldn't feel my legs
She walked me back
Into her room
But just to see
A 1980s horror film
She had the curtains down so there was no glare
She pulled up a chair  and gave me the bed
And all these crazy things went through my head
It seemed so long
I need someone
I don't know what to say
She was sitting there
I could touch her hair
But still we watched
Her 1980s horror film

Jamie
I don't know what to say to you
I feel you're always on my mind
And now that I know what I need
I'm taking the long way 'round
In my mind
It's not right
I can't help the way I feel anymore
And I need to
Can it be that you feel this way too?
The lights were off
The mood was right
She came and laid with me
I looked into her eyes
And tried to make her mine
But then she said:
I'm really not that into guys
1980s horror film
1980s horror film
1980s horror film
Placed your head upon my shoulder
Now it feels like you don't know me
These are all the things that we'll choose to remember
Did you cross your fingers when you said forever?
Did it look the same with the other before me?
Am I just a name you flip through in your story
Of people
You've made to love you?
You could've given me a warning
'Cause you had me holding out for nothin'
If you knew that all your walls would cave in
But you had me holding open the door

You've made to love you?
How can you have someone to lean on
If they don't get through?
You could've given me a warning
'Cause you had me holding out for nothin'
If you knew that all your walls would cave in
But you had me holding open the door
'Cause you had me holding out for nothin'
'Cause you had me holding out for nothin'
 but I don't have an answer
 let's pretend to fall asleep now
 will we regret this?
 Are you bored yet?
 you should tell me
 Are you bored yet?
 you should tell me
The night is young but we're still getting older
Can you see ourselves in love like this forever?
Or are you afraid that's too much pressure?
At the end of the day
A face in the crowd
When you're not around that's fading
If you wanted I would never call you
Never think about you or never let you go
But at the end of the day
Are we on our way to breaking?
There's a place you used to take me almost twice a week
And at first you made me nervous I could hardly speak
I don't really think about it anymore
Is that a problem or just something to ignore?
Time on my hands
Falling like sand
Just take it back if you need an escape plan
At the end of the day
A face in the crowd
When you're not around that's fading
If you wanted I would never call you
Never think about you or never let you go
But at the end of the day
Are we on our way to breaking?

Don't blame yourself if they look away

A face in the crowd
When you're not around that's fading

Never think about you or never let you go

Are you running away from something?
Are you worried you're feeling nothing?

I lie awake and feel you shake
Is it just your dream or reality?
A reflection of your thoughts lately
I wanna wake you but you won't let me (Here we go again)
Who were you kissing in the back of your car?
Who are you thinking of when you end the day?
'Cause I know you can see we're more than a secret
You know I can be just what you want
'Cause I've been out until the morning
And I don't think I'll last another night
I knew the feeling would be forming
After I took a look into your eyes
I'll take on your responsibilities
And you've got everybody calling
But I know that you're calling after me
You could have mе on my back every night
I don't mind the things that you'vе been doing

That I'd give you all mine
I know we've only hardly met
Remember every word you said
The way we sat in the heat
And you wiped off my sweat
The way you grazed my arm
The way you got in my head
Maybe you should come inside
Maybe we could talk all night
You don't have to mince your words
Anything you say is fine
I can always slow it down
We can take the long way 'round
But I think you havе what I need
And maybe I need it now
You don't need to make a sound
You know I can hold it down
Everything you hopе to find
I think I've already found

Scream at the games we've played

We were wanting to grow up every weekend

Hands touching in the dark
Symmetry isn't art

Well maybe you're better now
All because I let you down
I know there's so much I didn't say
I don't want to be that way
I guess that's a price you pay
For giving your trust away
When you left for a while and I kind of lost my mind (Hey)
Realized the older I get  I get more insecure
If I don't have you by my side  then I can't be sure
I'm not alright  but I don't need comfort
I don't want to talk
So could you tell me that it's over  tell me that it's over
Tell me that it's over now?
Then I could shut this off (Woo)
I went to send you off  felt off by what I saw there
Him in the leopard pattern coat that you wished you'd sharе
You in your brand new sweatsuit and your fresh platinum hair
Your Fjällrävеn Kånken's packed and I watch him stare

To 'Heaven or Las Vegas'
Bedroom rearranged again
And snow out on the pavement
Colors from outside
Bathed in orange and white
Let's invite your friends for a backseat drive
It's not a crime if you take what's given
It's just a crime if you're payin' for it
What's the fun if you know what's comin'?
I don't want to escape it
Standing outside of your house
It's pretty dark out
Good thing there's lights
It's pretty cold though
I just need you right here
To warm me up this time
Words turn to a cough
You say I'll never get you off
Now when you stand in a crowd
Is your mind in the gutter?
Your head on the run

And when we tear down the walls completely

There's a song that I still hear faintly
It's just a recipe for my love
Some's gone and some doesn't feel right
I need a new place to stay
And I don't think I'm gonna find it
Just take it back and tell me no
It's easier to be alone
Than to be lied to
Why'd you waste all the time?
Back and forth in my mind
Was it worth all the doubt?
Can we go through the years?
Take you there every night
Say that it's only right
White noise that plays in my head
Try to recall the words you said
Can you slip into my dreams?
And then I'll never wanna wake up
I hear you talk when you're not there
It comes at me from everywhere
And take my mind away?

Okay
Found with or without separation is what I've learned

Who feels alone in the world?
You do
Too complicated
It's not the same anymore
You're through
You're signing off again
But you're my only friend
I don't know what to say
I feel the ending close
Pick up the pieces
Finding a place in the world to be
Too many reasons
To keep an ear at the door for me
Will you come back again?
I only need a friend
When it's all said and done
Girl
Girl
Girl
If I'm too forward  just slow me down
But can you see I can't sleep?
I wonder what it'd be like with you next to me
I think you're what's costing me
The permanent price  the look in your eyes
I know what you mean without saying a thing
So please tell me now  but don't let me down
The words that you say are the price that I pay
Feels like I've been runnin' out of the means I need to survive
I know I'm not ready to die
I won't let it happen
Lock the door  but what for?
No one to walk in on me anymore
Think my place needs a new facе
Feel free to occupy my space sometime

Well  what are your plans?
I think you should stay
'Cause I hope that we can feel the way we do now for all time
You and I  we grew up in the suburbs
Now you're gone  the city's down a number
It is not the same without you around  oh
I see you there  still shy but smiling

All the times I've tried to forget her
I am hanging on to something real

As I walk slowly from your house
Back in your room remain the words I wanna say to you
But couldn't leave my mouth
Does it come as a surprise?
Language of averted eyes
Silence is what I do best
Wasting time around my head
So I talk to myself instead
Sitting out the weekend
Couldn't do it again
Say you want it right now
But I wouldn't know how
It's something that I can't do
Then what am I supposed to?
Quite the people pleaser
If only I could please her
Indecisive feelings of enjoyment
I'm aware there's somethin' I should tell you
But my voice annoys me
Bite my tongue off with a smile
I can't feel it anymore
'Cause recently the line is blurred
Between depression and bliss

Just a trick of the light I've seen before
I can never tell what's real anymore
I remember when we ran from the pool
All the decorations up in your room
And I couldn't find the right words to use
But I knew that you knew
All the places I return to
All the faces that remind you
I can still see you at the place I know when I close my eyes

Remember you're not the only one in this
