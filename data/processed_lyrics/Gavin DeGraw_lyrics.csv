"I don't wanna get too close
See this isn't where my head is
But I just found someone special
And that's really something special if you knew me
Nice to meet you anyway
I believe you're very fine
'Cause I just found someone special
And that's really something special if you knew me
Nice to meet you anyway
And the sky opened up
With the soil of the sun
Dreaming of my true love
I don't mean to be so strange
But my life just took a change

'Cause I just found someone special
And that's really something special if you knew me
Nice to meet you anyway
And the sky opened up
With the soil of the sun
Dreaming of my true love
So before this goes too far
Let me tell you what you are
But I'm terribly distracted
And I'm trying to be verbal
And I'm back into this circle
'Cause I just found someone special
And that's really something special if you knew me
Nice to meet you
Nice to meet you
Nice to meet you anyway
Nice to meet you anyway
Nice to meet you anyway
Nice to meet you anyway
And even if you want me to stay here
I'm telling you right now I should leave
I hope you understand what I mean
I hope you understand what I mean
I hope you understand what I mean
Knocking back
Knocking down you go all night
All night
Blow 'em away
Pourin' it on
Laugh at the jokes
Sing a few songs you know all right
All right
All right
Don't you know I'm on to you?
Your eyes are bright as chandeliers
But I see the truth
Got them falling from the roof
Hypnotized and paralyzed but
That's nothing new
I'm onto you

Left Santa Fe
They're buying you rings
Giving you cars
Every time
Don't you know I'm on to you?
Your eyes are bright as chandeliers
But I see the truth
Got them falling from the roof
Hypnotized and paralyzed but
That's nothing new
I'm onto you
It started with a white lie
You thought it was a good time
Now they got the fever
Oh be bop a lula
Now everybody wants you
But I'm looking right through
And I want to tell you
Get yourself together girl 'cause nothing lasts forever
Don't you know I'm on to you?
Your eyes are bright as chandeliers
But I see the truth
Got them falling from the roof
Hypnotized and paralyzed but
That's nothing new
 feel alright
 you and I
 you arrested my mind
 with the wrath of a God
 you stood by me
 it doesn't need space
 and I'll be the king
 you arrested my mind
 with the wrath of a god
 it's the least I can do
 you arrested my mind
 in the shape of your mouth
 with the wrath of a God
 you stood by me
 you arrested my mind
 in the shape of your mouth
 with the wrath of a God
 you stood by me and I'll stand by my belief
 stand by my belief
I failed algebra and I miss you sometimes
We're at war again  save the world again
You can all join in  but you can't smoke inside
'Cause there's too many hipsters and I just can't relate
You're my neon gypsy  my desert rain
You're the best I ever had
And I'm trying not to get stuck in my head
But I read that soda kills you and Jesus saves
On the bathroom wall where I saw your name
You're the best I ever had
I won't be the same
Night sky full of drones  this neighborhood of clones
I'm looking at the crowd and they're staring at their phones
They groom the coast line here  the sun will disappear (Oh God!)
And maybe once a year  I think I'll clean my car

Caught my reflection  I drop the call
I've been medicated with cigarettes and alcohol
You're the best I ever had
And I'm trying not to get stuck in my head
But I think I dropped my wallet in Santa Fe
Lost the only picture I had of you that day  and
You're the best I ever had
I won't be the same
Hey West Virginia  Hey North Dakota
I think I love you  but don't even know ya

You're the best I ever had (You're the best I ever had)
And I'm trying not to get stuck in my head (Get stuck in my head)
But I passed a lonely sign on the interstate
Saying  Find someone before it gets too late
You're the best I ever had (You're the best I ever had)
I won't be the same
I think I love you  but don't even know you (I won't be the same)
Hey Massachusetts  Hey Minnesota (You're the best I ever had)
I think I love you  but don't even know you (I won't be the same)
It's been a long  long time coming
But I know a change is gonna come  oh yes it will
It's been too hard living  but I'm afraid to die
'Cause I don't know what's out there  beyond the sky
It's been a long  a long time coming
But I know a change is gonna come  oh yes it will
I go to the movie
And I go downtown
Somebody keep telling me Don't hang around
It's been a long  long time coming
But I know a change is gonna come  oh yes it will
Then I go to see my brother
And I say Help me please
But he winds up knockin' me
Like I'm back down on my knees
Please  yeah
There were times when I thought I couldn't last for long
But now I think I'm able to carry on
Leaning on the mother tree
Your favorite fruit is chocolate covered cherries
Nothing from the ground is good enough
Body rise
Look what's over me
Are walking down upon this face
To guide me
Give me your strength
Remember seeking moon's rebirth
Rains made mirrors of the earth
The sun was just yellow energy
If it's a living promise land
Even over fields of sand
Seasons fill my mind and
Cover me
Bringing back
More than a memory

I'm lovesick somewhere tonight
I don't need writing on the wall
I've felt it for so long
Am I even on your mind?
Or are you now in...
Someone else's eyes
Someone else's arms
Someone else's obvious moves
I'm a jealous guy
I hear people talk
And it isn't hard to believe
I think you cheated on me
I've been this lovesick before
I've felt just like this before
There was another just like you
I loved her for so long
But I had poison on my mind
And I drove her into...
Someone else's eyes
Someone else's arms
Someone else's obvious moves
I'm a jealous guy

And it isn't hard to believe
I think she cheated on me

Someone else's eyes

 you think your name is 'pass the...'
It didn't change the way I feel
And I was wishing I'd break down your walls
The kiss will know if lips stay still
There is a line I crossed
And when you missed  I lost
I'm not a loser
Girl  you know that I'll be back again
My dear  I went for the steal
Maybe it was rushed
Oh my crush  I've got a crush
I suppose that I could hold it in  ooh
But you excite my every cell
Sources say that senses are your friends
My senses say that I should tell
You that I'm not ashamed
You might just feel the same
But you have to try it
If you're ever really gonna know

I just get better with time
Come home to this sea  harboring in me
I don't believe in four-leaf clovers
All the luck they're supposed to bring
I've used all my wild cards
But there's something I can do
To get close to you
I've got dreams of love and I love you
I know you feel the same way too
I feel your spirit when you're near me and when you're away
Somehow  somewhere I'll see you again
But until then I've got dreams of loving you
Thinking bout every little thing we ever did crazy
Sipping on that memory lane
That lane never closes  seven days of the week
I can drive in my sleep
Cause I've got dreams of love and I love you

Wipe that dust of yourself
It's time to separate the men from the boys
And the women from the girls
And the tools from the toys
Even if you're freaking out: just relax

Now everything will change
Back when it used to hurt

How bout that?
We blew all our money
And crashed in your Mercedes
But didn't get the names
And my whole damn party lost power
Bruises on my knee

Think I mighta lost a fight
Found a drink receipt

She thought you spoke things you mean
Caress her skin like it's glass
She hears your voice making plans
And sees your face in her hands
You don't wanna see somebody beg
As you feel her heart surrender
You begin to fall
How do you say that something's through
When it never even started
At least not for you
You breathe her air and you leave
You keep your mind on yourself
And lie the glass on the shelf
After the heavenly speech
Your body throws holy heat
The angels sing when our eyes meet

But I'm trying with perfect faith
When I let you in
I began to win
And now I'm just all gold
After all I've done
And the road I've run
I wanna thank you

But there's nothing like the warmth of the one
Who has put in the time and you know is gonna be there
Back your border when she knows someone crossed it
Take the pain of protecting your name
From the crutch to the cane to the high wire
I'm in love with a girl who knows me better
Fell for the woman just when I met her
Took my sweet time when I was bitter
Someone understands
And she knows how to treat a fella right
Gives me that feeling every night
Wants to make love when I wanna fight
Now someone understand me
I'm in love with a girl (I'm in love with)
I'm in love with a girl (I'm in love with)
Out the many broken back doors and windows
Through the valley of the love of the lost
Is a hole that has cut through the souls
Fallen down from the tones without reading innuendos
And they found inner peace for the moment
The moment was over in time
The drifters fun has a short life

Somethings you just can't keep
She might take her coat off
Lay you down and float off
Let her fly away
She's as light as a feather
But she'll kick off of her cloud
Got nothin' to do with the weather
When you're wakin' up alone and she's nowhere to be found

Had to call it a day
From an ex who showed up falling to
Grand piano falling on the edge of the parkway
Got no good advice
Hotline called me twice
Do you have a quote to lend me
Or a friend to send me?
But I got no help at all
So I loosened my lips
And let a little prayer I memorized
Do what I just wished

I'll be the one to keep you warm
I'll take you way out of the storms
When the fear takes you down
When the doubt takes you under
You're not in this alone
You got me
Ooh
Oo yeah
OOh
You got me
Ooh
Oo yeah
OOh
You got me
I'll be the one to lead you home
I'll be the one to keep you warm
I'll take you way out of the storms
I'm gonna give you all that I can say
The truth is harder to amuse
But when you know it's wrong
You got to cut it loose
Oh  it's better up ahead
The worst is over now
Remember what I said
Live  you don't have to look back
But if you ever do
You know where I'm at
The thought of you to disappear
Shutting the door and walking out of here
To know there's something you must find
That I never had  believe me that I tried
Oh  it's better up ahead
The worst is over now
Remember what I said
Live  you don't have to look back
But if you ever do
You know where I'm at

Calm down
I do declare a conversation
We tried
And put it on the line
Sometimes
The feeling can survive
Oh  it's better up ahead
The worst is over now
Remember what I said
Live  you don't have to look back
But if you ever do
You know where I'm at
Oh  if you ever do
If you ever do
 take me now  to the lake of fire
 hard as a rolling stone
 it comes around  when you're out of time
 I had reached the end
 slowly you removed it all
 you brought me back to life
 show me I'm not alone
 don't mean you not strong
 I fear no hell since you came along
 I had reached the end
 slowly you removed it all
 you brought me back to life
 by it
 gave you control
 inside it
