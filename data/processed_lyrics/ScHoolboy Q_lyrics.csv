lyrics
"Everybody get the (Two) fuck out the way right now
(Three) Car doin' doughnuts in a flash
If I ain't got nothin' that matter on me
You lil' boys can't match  milli' on me
D-boy fresh since school '03
Throw it back like replay
Most of y'all won't be safe
I came from hard knocks
Gang tats and stovetops

I must live my worth
Chain drip down my shirt
My block been Iraq
Cocaine to a rock  deuce deuce in a sock
Every dollar closer to a drop
Every drop is closer to a cop
Every cop is closer to a cell
Hit the cell  your ticket right to hell
No job  no bail
No fam  no meal
Institution another nigga  fail
Go from pussy to a prison tale
Fuck that  I quit while I'm ahead
Ship my music off like Amistad
Turn it up and hear the ghetto pledge
Live righteous  nigga  like my brother said
King Tut  Martin Luther
Malcolm X  but I'm the shoota'
Top ramen  knowledge for the noodle
Finally gettin' praised  yeah  kudos
Doing bad  still love and need
Connect said it's something up his sleeve
Said  I rather bust off them keys
Yeah  nigga  Birds And The Beez
Birds And The Beez
Birds And The Beez

Wanna do a song  but it's hard to carry on
And my daughter hungry  sitting home
And my girl  she said she feeling lone'
I can tell it's over in her tone
Only time I call is for a loan
She be stressing  so depressing
Always worried every time a lil' nigga gone
Stay strong for the future  stick together  yeah suture
Get a couple whips  yeah Kunta
Schoolboy  but gangsta was his tutors
Say the money be the root of evil
Look around and see what it do to people
Veins full of heroin using PCP inject the body with a needle
Lord help us  swear to God
Dope dealers  get a job
Keep it real  this shit ain't really cool
Being in a cell  you ain't alive
Niggas quick to show out over cheese
Love to help the devil do a deed
So I rather bust off them keys?
Yeah  nigga  Birds And The Beez
Birds And The Beez
Birds And The Beez
Birds And The Beez
Tired of the same ol' shit
Niggas they faking it
Niggas out here living foul
Better yet they flagrant
Keep these niggas right up out the game
Get these niggas right up out my lane
I just wanna do this fucking music  boy and leave this dope alone and count my change
Q  I wanna see you do your thang
Entertainment business living limelight
Hop on every track and move them trains
Show these motherfuckers that you been tight  then they ever been
It's evident that you intelligent  but you can't escape that life
And for you  my nigga  I would sacrifice myself to make it just to see you hold the mic
And hit the stage and rock the set
But it's hard to change when your from the set
Won't you think about it nigga  life or death
Life of a cracker  I’d like to hang you by the neck
Do you wanna see the boys in jet  or you wanna see them runway jets?
Fly to Singapore  one way that  tell the pilot we got stacks on deck
Swear to God  its hard out here for a young black man to live
If you don't do it for yourself  then please do it for your kids
My nigga  won't you tell Michelle  I love your daughter?
Please don't let her grow up life without a father
Look at what you bought her  money couldn't buy
All she need is love  put that shit aside
At the same time  know they got to eat
Know you got to hustle  make ends meet
Got the block hot  you keep runnin'  cops say freeze
Birds or the Beez
Birds or the Beez
Tired of the same ol' shit
Niggas they faking it
Niggas out here living foul
Better yet they flagrant
Keep these niggas right up out the game
Get these niggas right up out my lane
I just wanna do this fucking music  boy and leave this dope alone and count my change
Count my change
Living out his backpack every night
Needed a new place to sleep
Three to get ready cause I feel I finally did it
Four's for the jealous rapper mad because he finished
Turn that mothafucka to a critic
I was hanging on them corners late
Nigga praying up to God just hoping that he hear a nigga
I know the world got more problems and it's much bigger
To all my niggas that'll never make it out the streets
To all my niggas first time stepping in the pen
To all my niggas that's gon' fuck around and die today

We all blessed my nigga
Now how the fuck I'm 'posed to say this?
You see my nigga just lost his son
Kiss her on the head as I cry for a bit
Thinking of some bullshit to tell him
Whether it's money or some weed or putting in work
Told myself that after y'all moved
Tell Floyd to enjoy his newborn seed
We all blessed my nigga
And you ain't gotta shed no tear
I'll be everywhere but I'ma always be right here
I ain't forgot those years
I'll be everywhere but I'ma always be right here
Of obituary carry crates
Of a scary picture with a family member that relate to ya
In December you was finna pin another case
Recognize you listened and you didn't hit the block again
That's because the minute after you had knew you would be slain
Open up another chapter in the book and read 'gain
Story of a gun-clapper really tryna make a change
You reject these niggas that neglect your respect
Blast at anybody say that you can't flip
This crack into rap music every other zip is a track
In a minute everybody gon' be winning
Put a little faith in it then recognize that we all
Lord  please forgive me for all my sins
Yeah  nigga wake up to the same shit every day  homie
Walk through the valley of the shadow of death  no rules  right
Washing my sins off in hell's water
Feel like the Bible told me lies as I pray to 'em
Kneel down  put my faith in 'em  will you answer me?
But if God won't help me  this gun will
I swear I'm gon' find my way
Uh  four corners
Cat and mouse chase  got cheese to catch
High on on some drug  I'm Space Cadet
Dreaming I don't live up on the block no more
Trapping  trying to make it out this obstacle
Life on the edge  hell a block away
Pretty Snow White turned eight today
Selling that base  no Dr. Dre
Uh  guess who in the building?
Bucket hat with a strap like a pilgrim
Uh  kneeling down with some questions to address like
Why the ones who commit the worst sins live the best?
The Ten Commandments  I can mark five checks
But I sense flaws  the Bible preaching blind threats
Streets held me down  got faith in a Pyrex
Faith in a four-five  I call it the clarinet
Sewer full of drugs when the toilet digests
From the cop raid  all can relate from the streets
To the wall from niggas to compadres
When the sun go down  I'm predicting a heatwave
Forecast your whole body  heat on  room full of homi's
I just pray that the Lord got me

Kill mine  kill yours  make it even
Soul need saving  Mr. Preacher
I know I only come around when it's Easter
Funerals  Thanksgiving  Christmas time
When I'm in jail or when my card declined
Uh  will you answer me?
Take me out of hell and make plans for me?
Misery loves company  ain't a surprise
It was just me and my niggas  we was trying to survive
But we would never make it out alive
Shit  we living to die—oxymoron
Hope to get to heaven 'til that day arrive
Running through the alley  hope the bullet don't collide
Car window shattered  glass on my right side
Dogs bark in the backyard  rootin' for me
Out of shape belly  courtesy of 40
Spoiled only child  baby boy Jody
Same jacket on from back in the day
Praying that the Lord come and take me away
But if God won't help me  this gun will
I swear I'm gon' find my way
Mic check  mic check  mic check
But if God won't help me  this gun will
I swear I'm gon' find my way
Yeah  ScHoolboy  what up  nigga? Let's take these niggas down
Ayo  tuna fish sandwiches bread  dry and stinking
Black Lincoln  burgundy Mac  I clap a king-pin
Caught me in the airport dusted that I was thinking
On how to stay rich and get bills with my acquaintances
Yeah  money is the issue  I diss you
It's no problem at all  yo  the bunch on the pistol
'Cause I'm a suitcase king
Cooling at the gambling spot with a screwed face grin
New Beige Bent  we stay winning  play it again  yo
Put the bone in your jaw  now say it again
Round nightfall under the tents  coming to rinse
Get out the way or let the shotty dispense
Revenge killers who make the events iller
This is more realer  snatch you right up out of the Benz
The Wu wheelers who huddle up  coupes knows the truth
You know the whoopty-whoop  solo or group  I kill niggas
Oxy like concerts  always my bread first
Get Mine my nickname  O-X and cocaine
Nina my new thing  blew up before fame
Heart filled with octane  fire in my soul
Burn through my shoestring  came up from boosting
Du-rags and flatlines  drive-bys at bedtime
Get down  I heard mom  someone lost they grandson
Thank God that I'm straight  no wonder my mom prayed
Lost one of my cuzzos  cursed from them devils
Good weed and me time  goodbye to Nissan
Cause one day this rappin' gon' pay
So now we 'bout to break the bank
Money be on my mind

We scored no goalie  she's just a groupie
Her pussy lukewarm like long lay  her head be Bombay
Oh  you don't really see it that I'm gone?

Watch my flow in four inches
All gold for my Adventist
Pulled it down and she kissed it
All gold where my wrists is
Just because I got dreads don't get it twisted
Moving my whip down the boulevard

Most my life on 51st  went to school on 52nd
Used to fight on 49th  Grandma said be home by night

And became a fucking G  moved my crack across the street

Didn't know what he was saying 'til them years done jumped to three
Learned the game  slanging hoes and every car door need a key

Enemies be left to right  we don't call our shit the trap
Bitch we call our shit the set  unless we OD with Reynold's Wrap
After crack it's Oxy next  but thank God the yay was yay
Slang to him and slang to her  ask a fiend they will concur
