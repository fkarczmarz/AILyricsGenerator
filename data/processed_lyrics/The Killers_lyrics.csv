" long brown hair and foolish eyes
 God gives us hope
 vandalized
 don't you know the kingdom's under siege
Is there room for one more son?
One more son
I wanna shine on in the hearts of man
I want a meanin' from the back of my broken hand
I'm so much older than I can take
And when there's nowhere else to run
Is there room for one more son?
These changes ain't changin' me
The cold-hearted boy I used to be

Last call for sin (Bring yourself down)
With all these things that I've done
If you can hold on
On the field  I remember you were incredible

On the mats with the boys  you think you're alone
With the pain that you drain from love
In a car with a girl  promise me she's not your world
'Cause Andy  you're a star
Get down  hey
Leave your number on the locker and I'll give you a call
Leave your legacy in gold on the plaques that line the hall
On the streets  such a sweet face jumped in town
In the staffroom  the verdict is in
In a car with a girl  promise me she's not your world

Go on to bed
Nobody knows what lies ahead
Life is short to say the least
We're in the belly of the beast
Long may your innocence reign
Like shells on a shore
May your limits be unknown
May your efforts be your own
If you ever feel you can't take it anymore
Don't break character
You've got a lot of heart
Is this real or just a dream
Rise up like the sun
Labor till the work is done
Be still
One day you'll lead
Fearlessness on your sleeve
Was there something out there for me
Be still
Close your eyes
And if they drag you through the mud
It doesn't change what's in your blood
When they knock you down

Rise up like the sun

Your last chance to find a go-go dance to disco now
Please believe me  Natalie  listen Natalie  this is
Your last chance to find a go-go dance to disco now
Forget what they said in SoHo  leave the Oh nos out
And believe me  Natalie  listen Natalie  this is
Your last chance
There is an old cliché under your Monet  baby
Remember the arch of roses right above your couch?
Forget what they said in SoHo  leave the Oh nos out
Yes  there is an old cliché under your Monet  baby
You left the station now to the floor
With speculation  what was it for?
In that old hallway  Mom says  Why don't you
Stay? You've been away for a long time
Believe me  Natalie  this is (Your last chance)
Your last chance to find a go-go
Forget what they said in SoHo
And walk away
If my dreams for us can't get you through just one more day
It's alright by me
God  help me somehow
There's no time for survival left
The time is now  'cause this might be
Your last chance to disco
You say it's hard enough to live
How do you know that you're right?
I awoke on the roadside
In the land of the free ride
And I can't pull it any longer
The sun is beating down my neck
So I ran with the devil
Left a trail of excuses
Like a stone on the water
The elements decide my fate
Watch it go
When I offer you survival
You say it's hard enough to live
How do you know that you're right?

But I'm pushing on for that horizon

Now I've got that blowing wind against my face
So you sling rocks at the riptide
Am I wrong or am I right?
I get my glory in the desert rain
Watch it go (When I offer you survival)
When I offer you survival
You say it's hard enough to live
How do you know that you're right?
If you're not nervous anymore
Higher and higher
We're gonna take it down to the wire
We're gonna make it out of the fire
We're gonna take it down to the wire
We're gonna make it out of the fire
We're gonna take it down to the wire
Higher and higher
It ain't hard to hold
When it shines like gold
Puts out a cigarette and gets on the bus
She's sittin' on a secret
But there's a whisper in her heartbeat
And she can hear it just enough to keep her alive
When she's breathing in the blowback
There's nothing you can offer she ain't already tried
But she's breathing in the blowback
Born into poor white trash and always typecast
It's just a matter of time
She fights back
(Breathing in again)
Breathing in the blowback
She is sucking on a Tic-Tac
'Cause the blacktop's burning up what's left of the fuse
And she knows where she comes from
Doesn't need you dragging her all through it again

Can you cast out a demon?
Can you wrangle the wind?
We took a back road
We're gonna look at the stars
We took a backroad in my car
Down to the ocean
It’s only water and sand
And in the ocean we'll hold hands
And on the cold wet dirt I cry
Don’t you wanna come with me? Don’t you wanna feel my bones
On your bones?
It's only natural
A cinematic vision ensued
Like the holiest dream
There's someone calling
An angel whispers my name
But the message relayed is the same:
But it's gone to the dogs in my mind
I always hear them when the dead of night
Comes calling to save me from this fight
But they can never wrong this right

Let me introduce you to the featherweight queen
She got Hollywood eyes
But you can't shoot what she's seen
Her mama was a dancer
And that's all that she knew

It's what pretty girls do
I'm throwin' caution

Gave me reservation and the like

Eh  I— I think the train is a way to find your way out of this life  if you get hit by it

Carrying sheet metal and household appliances through the pouring rain
They were planning on getting married after graduation
Had a little baby girl  trouble came and shut it down
Things like that ain't supposed to happen
In this quiet town  families are tight
Good people  they still don't deadbolt their doors at night
In this quiet town
When we first heard opioid stories  they were always in whispering tones
Now banners of sorrow mark the front steps of childhood homes
Parents wept through daddy's girl eulogies
And merit badge milestones with their daughters and sons
Laying there lifeless in their suits and gowns
Somebody's been keepin' secrets

Well  part of me is still that stainless kid  lucky
In this quiet town  salt of the land
Hard-working people  if you're in trouble  they'll lend you a hand

School let out and the sun beats down
Smoke billows from a Sunday train

Breaking out of this two-star town
I'm gonna turn this thing around
Can you read my mind? (Oooh)
Can you read my mind? (Oooh)
A subtle kiss that no one sees
A broken wrist and a big trapeze
'Cause I don't shine if you don't shine

Waiting on some sign
I pull up to the front of your driveway
With magic soaking my spine
Can you read my mind? (Oooh)

Are your excuses any better than your senator's?
He held a conference and his wife was standing by his side
He did her dirty but no-one died

Black-fisted and strong singing Redemption Song
He motioned me to the sky

I'd been on her trail for a little while
But that was the night that she broke down and held my hand
A teenage rush
But that ain't much

We got engaged on a Friday night
I swore on the head of our unborn child
That I could take care of the three of us

But don't give up on me
'Cause I'm just in a rut

I hope you understand
That steadily reminds you of who I really am
The money from my mother's men
But I don't really mind that it's starting to get to me
Nobody ever pulls the seams 'round here
But I don't really mind that it's starting to get to me
I've got this energy beneath my feet
Like something underground's gonna come up and carry me
I've got this sentimental heart that beats
But I don't really mind that it's starting to get to me now
Why do you waste my time?
Is the answer to the question on your mind
And I'm sick of all my judges
So scared of what they'll find
But I know that I can make it
As long as somebody takes me home
Every now and then
Have you ever seen the lights?
I took a shuttle on a shockwave ride
Where people on the pen pull the trigger for accolades
I took a bullet and I looked inside it

Boy  one day you'll be a man

We lost track of the time
Dreams aren't what they used to be
Some things slide by so carelessly
Smile like you mean it
Smile like you mean it
And someone is calling my name
From the back of the restaurant
And someone is playing a game
In the house that I grew up in
And someone will drive her around
Down the same streets that I did

It started with a low light
And then they took my blood type
It left a strange impression in my head
You know that I was hoping
That I could leave this star-crossed world behind
But when they cut me open
I guess I changed my mind
Have just flown too far from the floor this time
'Cause they're calling me by my name
And they're zipping white light beams
Disregarding bombs and satellites
That was the turning point
That was one lonely night

You'd better look it over
Before you make that leap
And you know I'm fine

Steve painting houses while Bobby went and gone insane
They buried my sister but daddy he stayed the same

The book will be open
In front of the judge
Unquenchable fire
Or keys to the kingdom

I married my high school sweetheart  so we've been marri—
We've been together 11 years
Um  I don't really travel much so I've just been here  ha-ha
Uh  my little brother  he moved into the community
And they tried to tape him to a flagpole or a tree up at the high school
So if you don't fit their mold—
Just a nice  small community  everybody knows everybody
Good place to live and to raise kids
We'll be here forever
So  yeah  it's a good area
I was born right here in Zion
God's own son
His Holy Ghost stories and bloodshed
Never scared me none
While they bowed their heads on Sunday
I cut out through the hedges and fields
Where the light could place its hands on my head
In the west hills

One still on the vine

On hillbilly heroin pills
We get out and watch the sunset
Peaceful and still
And free in the west hills
Free in the west hills
When the sheriff kicked my door down
I was sleeping in my own bed
And the mess I got caught up in
Rained hard down on my head
They got me for possession
Of them hillbilly heroin pills
Enough to kill the horses that run
Free in the west hills
They got me for possession of enough to kill
The horses that run
Free in the west hills

If this life was meant for proving
I could use more years to live
But fifteen in a guardhouse
That's more than I'm willing to give
And if there really is a judgement
When He pulls my chart
He'll reject my actions
But He will know my heart
And He'll prepare a place for me
Where happiness instills
And the light puts its loving hands on my head
Free in the west hills
They got me for possession of enough to kill
The horses that run
Free in the west hills
Free in the west hills
Free  free in the west hills
