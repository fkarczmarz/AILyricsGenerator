lyrics
"You're sleepwalking with a delirious head
Oh  go to sleep
Not much of what you say makes any sense
Cook up some myths then ask for obedience
Even though you mean well  well most of the time
You've aided delusion and created bias in our minds
All of this will be gone someday
You and me and everyone we know
Leaving memories and traces for the afterglow
All of this will be gone someday
All of this will be gone someday
All of this will be gone someday
All of this will be gone someday
All of this will be gone someday
All of this will be gone someday
You and me and everyone we know
You'll see it all clear
How steep the fall is
How long the way back is
On the verge of success
It's all white and fluffy
Horizons are blurred
Horizons are blurred
By the time you reach your goal
Tongues will be twisted
To the point where you'll lose track of your soul
Distorted pictures is all you deliver
Distorted pictures is all you deliver
Distorted pictures is all you deliver
Distorted pictures is all you deliver
Seems you intended to come back for more
It was summerlove leave this town
It's too cold to bathe and the leaves are brown
Summerlove left this town
It was too cold to bathe and the leaves turned brown
The sun went down
And with it the love we found
That's the way things are sometimes
Through your weakest moments to leave them behind you?
We'll cast some light and you'll be alright
The sirens inside you waiting to step forward
Disturbing silence darkens your sight
We'll cast some light and you'll be alright
Crosses all over the boulevard
Crosses all over the boulevard
Crosses all over the boulevard
Crosses all over the boulevard
Repeatedly reminded by the looks on their faces

It's not what it seems
Uncover the mystery
Tell everyone what you see
It's not what it seems
Vulgar when brought to light
Betray the image
There's nothing between the sheets
It's not what it seems
But deadweight on velveteen
Vulgar when brought to light
Vulgar when brought to light
Don't wash the dirt off of your hands
You're doing the same mistake twice
Making the same mistake twice
Come on over
Don't be so caught up
It's not about compromising
I see darkness down the line
I know it's not fine
But don't wash the dirt off of your hands
You're doing the same mistake twice
Making the same mistake twice
I see problems down the line
I know they're not mine
Come on over
Don't be so caught up
It's all about colonizing
Don't let the darkness eat you up

Lo extraño de simplemente ser
Un alma curiosa singular
Compleja en su calma y tempestad

Lleno de belleza y de dolor
Dime por qué será

När vi tog första stegen
Ifrån oceanen
Det slog mig den gången
När vi vadade fram genom vattnet
Jag la mig på marken
Och tackade himlen
Att vi fick stiga på land
Att vi fick känna på sanden
Nu kan vi säga
Att vi har varit på jorden
Hur underbart var det!
Hur underbart var inte det!
En stund på jorden
Jag vann över bergen
Jag delade på havet
Jag var den starkaste av oss
Men den svagaste ändå
Jag fick hålla dig I handen
När du fick lämna dina drömmar
Och försonas sen med tiden
Jag fick se dig tacka livet
Att vi har varit på jorden

Every branch of the tree has to learn
Make the best of this short-lived stay
Take this dream of a better day
Build a place where we all can belong
Some will pass us unnoticed by
In the face of our ancient drives
To each one on their own
But we are here together
Reaping what time and what we have sown
We don't choose where we're born
We don't choose in what pocket or form
But we can learn to know
Ourselves on this globe in the void

But still haven't burnt any old
Please don't let me down this time
I've come a long way to just fold back into line
Keep both feet on the ground
While I change the wings
I promise one day I'll be coming around
From my cloud to see what it's all about
But please don't let me down this time
I've come a long way to just fold back into line
Please hold me back
If I tend to lose it and steer into old tracks
Please don't let me down this time
I thought that we were just beginning
And now you say we're in the past
Look me in the eye and tell me we are really through
You know it's one thing to say you love me
But another to mean it from the heart
And if you don't intend to see it through
Why did we ever start?
I want to hear you tell me you don't want my love
Put your hand on your heart and tell me
It's all over
I won't believe it till you
Put your hand on your heart and tell me

They like to talk about forever
Most people never get the chance
Do you wanna lose our love together?
Do you find a new romance?

One night to speed up truth
We had a promise made
Four hands and then away
Both under influence
We had divine sense
To know what to say
Mind is a razor blade
Wouldn't be good enough
One night of magic rush
The start a simple touch
One night to push and scream
And then relief
Ten days of perfect hues
The colors red and blue
We had a promise made
We were in love
Wouldn't be good enough
Wouldn't be good enough

Sharing different heartbeats
In one night

The one which allows them to sleep well

The one which will lead us to our own bliss

If you had to leave today?
Leave everything behind

But when you hear the sound you realise it’s just the wind
And you notice it matters
Who and what you let under your skin
If put to the test
Would you step back from the line of fire?
Hold everything back
All emotions and desires
Convince yourself
To be someone else
And hide back from the world

Is my timing that flawed?
Our respect runs so dry

Staring vacantly now free against my will

On dust grains in the air
All berries in the tree
Earn a steady flare

To find spinning tops in play
