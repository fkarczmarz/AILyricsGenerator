lyrics
"You try and hold me down with your complaints
You cry and moan and complain  you whine an tear
Up to my neck in sorrow the touch you bring
You just don't step inside to  to 14 years
So hard to keep my own head  that's what I say and you know
I've been the beggar  I've played the thief
I was the dog they all tried to beat
But it's been 14 years of silence
It's been 14 years of pain
It's been 14 years that are gone forever and I'll never have again
Your stupid girlfriends tell you  that I'm to blame
Well  they're all used up has-beens out of the game
This time I'll have the last word  you hear what I say?
I tried to see it your way  it won't work today
You just don't step inside to  to 14 years
I've been the dealer hangin' on your street
I was the dog they all tried to beat

But it's been 14 years of silence
It's been 14 years of pain
It's been 14 years that are gone forever and I'll never have again
Bullshit and contemplation  gossip's their trade
If they knew half the real truth  what would they say?
Well I'm past the point of concern  it's time to play
These last four years of madness sure put me straight
You don't get back 14 years in just one day
Oh  I tried to see it your way
Back down in the gutter's more than you deserve
Screaming fucking banshee  you know that's what you are
Pussy full of maggots  isn't that absurd?
Dizzy little dreamer with your head down in the stars
Fucking little schemer lost yourself inside the art
Syphilitic priestess baby  I know who you are
Parasitic demon sucking acid through your heart
Absurd
Absurd
Absurd
Listen  motherfuckers  to the song that should be heard
Back down in the gutter's more than you deserve
Screaming fucking banshee  you know that’s what you are
Pussy full of maggots  isn’t that absurd?

Ain't it fun when your friends despise what you've become?
Ain't it fun when you know that you're gonna die young?
It's such fun
Ow
Ain't it fun when you're taking care of number one?
Ain't it fun when you feel like you just gotta get a gun?
Ain't it fun when you - just - can't seem to find your tongue?
'Cause you stuck it too deep into something that really stung
It's such fun
I punched my fist right through the glass

I've been thinking about  thinking 'bout sex
Always hungry for something that I haven't had yet
Panties round your knees with your ass in debris
Doing that grind with a push and a squeeze

You let me down  honey
I ain't playing childhood games no more

And taste the flame  woah yeah yeah
Down in the gutter  dying in the ditch
Face of an angel with the love of a witch

Making love  cheap heartbreaker
Broken-backed  nasty ball-breaker
Stay outta my bed  outta my head
If it's loving you  I'm better off dead
Down in the gutter  dying in the ditch
Face of an angel with the love of a witch
Emotions ripped  gone on a binge
Light-lipped  I said you're off the hinge
Telling lies of such fame and glory
I don't even want to hear your story
Down in the gutter  dying in the ditch
Face of an angel with the love of a witch
It's such a pity that you're such a bitch
It's time to burn-burn the witch
I think it's something each person's supposed to take in their own special way
 better
 better
 now
 now
 had I known or I'd been shown back when how long it'd take me
 no matter what you'd pay me
 this tragedy won't ask for absolution
 the change of heart cures my infatuation
 to provide the spark for my determination
 better
 better
 I'd manage to avoid the invitation
 you'll find your inspiration
 better
An' everybody warms themselves to a different fire
An' sometimes we get burned  you'd think sometime we'd learn
The one you love is the one that should take you higher
You ain't got no one  you better go back out and find 'em
Just like children hidin' in a closet  can't tell what's goin' on outside
To think the one you love could hurt you now is a little hard to believe
When I look around an' everybody always brings me down
A moment to try and understand another one's despair
Breakdown (Let me hear it now)
Breakdown (Let me hear it now  yeah)
Breakdown (Let me hear it now)

I've come to know the cold  I think of it as home
When there ain't enough of me to go around  I'd rather be left alone
But if I call you out of habit  I'm out of love and I gotta have it
Would you give it to me if I fit your needs? Like when we both knew we had it
Now  the damage's done and we're back out on the run
Funny how everything was roses when we held on to the guns
Just because you're winnin' don't mean you're the lucky one
Breakdown (Let me hear it now)
Breakdown (Yeah)
Breakdown (Let me hear it now)
The vicious traffic squad cars are after our lone driver
The last American hero  the-the electric sitar
The demi-god  the super driver of the golden west
Two nasty Nazi cars are close behind the beautiful  lone driver
The police cars are getting closer  closer
Closer to our soul hero in his soul mobile
The last beautiful free soul on this planet
But it is written
If the evil spirit arms the tiger with claws
Brahman provided wings for the dove
Thus spake the super guru
Who look at life this way  that's what the old folks say
But every time I'd see them makes me wish I had a gun
Guess I'd have more fun
Ooh  the Catcher in the Rye again
Ooh  won't let you get away from him
It's just another day like today
You decide 'cause I don't have to
And then they'll find and I won't ask you
At any time or long hereafter
If the cold outside's as I'm imagining
It to be
Ooh  the Catcher in the Rye again
Ooh  won't let you get away from him
It's just another day like today

When all is said and done  we're not the only ones
Who look at life this way  that's what the young folks say
As if they'd ever change as that were mine to say
But every time I'd see them makes me wish I had a gun
'Cause what used to be's not there for me
And ought to for someone that belonged
Insane  like I do
On an ordinary day  not in an ordinary way
For anybody or anyone
That needed comfort from somebody
Needed comfort from someone
Who cared to be not like you and unlike me
And then the voices went away from me
You were the instrument  you were the one
Took our innocence beyond our stares
Gonna find out for yourself
Gonna leave this thing to somebody else
If they were missionaries
Real-time visionaries
Sittin' in a Chinese stew
To view my dis-infatuation
I know that I'm a classic case
Watch my disenchanted face
Blame it on the Falun Gong
'Cause it would take a lot more hate than you
To end the fascination
Even with an iron fist
When all I've got is precious time
It don't really matter
Guess I'll keep it to myself
It's time I look around for somebody else

'Cause it would take a lot more time than you
Have got for masturbation
Even with your iron fist
More than you got to rule the nation
When all we've got is precious time
But all I've got is precious time
It don't really matter
I guess you'll find out for yourself
So you can hear it now from somebody else
You think you got it all locked up inside
It's like a walk in the park from a cell
(It don't really matter)
Now you're keeping your own kind in hell
(It don't really matter)
(It don't really matter)
While their arms reach out for your help
 you just can't reach
 he gets it
 time can't deny
 Peace could last forever?
 they shot Kennedy
 while it buries the poor
 sellin' soldiers in a human grocery store
 the wars go on as the years go by
 to create a vacuum
 while it buries the poor
 sellin' soldiers in a human grocery store
 sellin' soldiers in a human grocery store
 I don't need one more war
Ever come back to this world again
Kinda like it in a coma 'cause no one's ever gonna
Oh  make me come back to this world again
Now  I feel as if I'm floating away
I can't feel all the pressure  and I like it this way
But my body's calling  my body's calling:
Won't you come back to this world again?
Suspended deep in a sea of black
I've got the light at the end  I've got the bones on the mast
I could leave so easily  my friends are calling back to me
When all I needed was clarity  and
Someone to tell me what the fuck is goin' on
Goddamn it
Slipping farther and farther away
It's a miracle how long we can stay
In a world our minds created
In a world that's full of shit
Help me
Help Me
Come on... His airways.. someone's got to protect his airways. I want two...
Where's the defibrillator?
Two IV's over here  please. That's two more now. We're losing him
Let's go
Help Me
Slow-motion here. This guy's going...
Bastard
Let's get him in ER
...Going out on us
Who's got the defibrillator?

Please understand me
I'm climbing through the wreckage of all my twisted dreams
But this cheap investigation just can't stifle all my screams
And I'm waiting at the crossroads  waiting for you
Waiting for you  where are you?
No one's going to bother me anymore
No one's going to mess with my head no more
I can't understand what all the fighting's for
But it's so nice here  down off the shore
I wish you could see this  'cause there's nothing to see
It's peaceful here and it's fine with me
Not like the world where I used to live
I never really wanted to live  ah
I know
Okay  we're starting to lose this guy. I want that IV and his airway protected!
Let's get some people in here!
Get the crash cart please  we're losing this guy. He's going... Give me an airway please
... Going under.
Clear
Zap him again
How about an IV  stat?
Okay... you better protect the airway  you're starting to lose him. clear!
Zap the son of a bitch again
Listen to me
Axl  are you listening to me?
Don't walk away from me!
'You are such a fucking prick  I am so pissed with you
Get back over here!
All I hear is bullshit  all the time
All you ever wanna do is have sex  sex sex
I just don't give a shit anymore
I love you
You live your life like it's a coma  won't you tell me why we'd wanna?
But who am I to tell you that I've seen any reason why you should stay?
Maybe we'd be better off without you  anyway
You got a one-way ticket  on your last chance ride
Got a one-way ticket to your suicide
Got a one-way ticket  and there's no way out alive
An' all this crass communication that has left you in the cold
Isn't much for consolation when you feel so weak and old
But if home is where the heart is  then there's stories to be told
Got your mind in submission  got your life on the line
But nobody pulled the trigger  they just stepped aside
They be down by the water while you watch 'em waving goodbye
They be calling in the morning  they be hanging on the phone
They be waiting for an answer  but you know nobody's home
When the bell's stopped ringing it was nobody's fault  but your own
There were always ample warnings  there were always subtle signs
And you would have seen it comin' but we gave you too much time
And when you said that no one's listening  why'd your best friend drop a dime?
Sometimes  we get so tired of waiting for a way to spend our time
An' it's so easy to be social  it's so easy to be cool
And I wish that I could help you with what you hope to find
When you reach the point of breaking  know it's gonna take some time
 these feelings  I share
 like  wreck my car
 sometimes  I feel like I'm beating a dead horse
 never change
 I saw the look in his eyes
 but sometimes  I feel like I'm beating a dead horse
 I guess some things never change
 never change
 oh  yeah
 I feel like I'm beating a dead horse
 yeah  I'd be smiling
 smiling
 not that you'd care
No one can live in sorrow  ask all your friends
Times that you took in stride  they're back in demand
I was the one who was washing blood off your hands
Don't you cry tonight
And don't you cry tonight
I know the things you wanted  they're not what you have
With all the people talking  it's driving you mad
If I was standing by you  how would you feel
Don't you cry tonight
Don't you cry tonight
And don't you cry tonight

I thought I could live in your world as years all went by
With all the voices I've heard  something has died
And when you're in need of someone  my heart won't deny you
So many seem so lonely with no one left to cry to  baby
And don't you cry tonight
And don't you cry tonight
And don't you cry
Don't you ever cry
Don't you cry  don't you ever cry
Don't hang your head in sorrow and please don't cry
Something is changing inside you and don't you know?
And don't you cry tonight
And don't you cry tonight
Give me a whisper and give me a sigh
Give me a kiss before you tell me goodbye
Don't you take it so hard now and please don't take it so bad
I'll still be thinking of you and the times we had  baby
And don't you cry tonight
Don't you cry tonight

Don't damn me when I speak a piece of mind
'Cause silence isn't golden when I'm holding it inside
'Cause I've been where I have been and I've seen what I have seen
I put the pen to the paper 'cause it's all a part of me
Be it a song or a casual conversation
To hold my tongue speaks of quiet reservations
Your words  once heard  they can place you in a faction
My words may disturb  but at least there's a reaction
Oh yeah  oh  oh yeah
Sometimes I wanna kill  sometimes I wanna die
Sometimes I wanna destroy  sometimes I wanna cry
Sometimes I could get even  sometimes I could give up
Sometimes I could give  sometimes I never give a fuck
It's only for a while  I hope you understand
I never wanted this to happen  didn't want to be a man
So I hid inside my world  I took what I could find
I cried when I was lonely  I fell down when I was blind

How can I ever satisfy you?
And how can I ever make you see that
Deep inside  we're all somebody
And it don't matter who you  you wanna be?
But now I gotta smile  I hope you comprehend
For  this man can say it happened 'cause this child has been condemned
So I stepped into your world  I kicked you in the mind
And I'm the only witness to the nature of my crime
But look at what we've done to the innocent and young
Whoa  listen to who's talking 'cause we're not the only ones
The trash collected by the eyes and dumped into the brain
Said  it tears into our conscious thoughts  you tell me  who's to blame?
I know you don't wanna hear me cryin'
And I know you don't wanna hear me deny
That your satisfaction lies in your illusion
But your delusions are yours  and not mine
We take for granted  we know the whole story
We judge a book by its cover and read what we want
Between selected lines
Don't hail me and don't idolize the ink
Or I've failed in my intentions  can you find the missing link?
Your only validation is living your own life
Vicarious existence is a fucking waste of time
So I send this song to the offended
I said what I meant and I've never pretended
As so many others do  intending just to please
If I damned your point of view  could you turn the other cheek?
Oh
Don't damn me when I speak a piece of mind
'Cause silence isn't golden when I'm holding it inside
'Cause I've been where I've been and I've seen what I have seen
I put the pen to the paper 'cause it's all a part of me
Don't damn me
I said  don't damn me
I said  don't hail me
Ah  don't damn me
Ouh
Smoke 'em if you got 'em
Don't know why I'm here
Livin' on the run for oh so long
I gotta go collect
'Cause I got no more patience
Double talkin' lies
That's how I felt back then
'Cause I got no more patience
Double talkin' liar (Lies)

How it was gonna be?
Guess we'll have to wait and see
And I'm much too young to let love break my heart

With all the changin' seasons of my life
Maybe I'll get it right next time
And now that you've been broken down
Got your head out of the clouds
Back down on the ground
And you don't talk so loud
And you don't walk so proud
Anymore and what for?
Well I jumped into the river
Too many times to make it home
I'm out here on my own
And drifting all alone
If it doesn't show
Give it time to read between the lines
'Cause I see the storm is getting closer
Seems everything we've ever known's here
Why must it drift away and die?
I'll never find anyone to replace you
Guess I'll have to make it through
This time
Without you
I knew the storm was getting closer
And all my friends said I was high
But everything we've ever known's here
It's a mass of confusion  like the lies they sell to you
You got a glass-jawed toothache of a mental disease
And they be running 'round back  see them line up on their knees
'Cause the kiss-ass sycophants  throwing penance at your feet
When they got nowhere to go  watch them come in off the streets
While they're banging out front inside they're slamming to the crunch
Go on an throw me to the lions and the whole damn screaming bunch
'Cause the pissed-off rip-offs  they're everywhere you turn
Tell me how a generation's ever supposed to learn
This fire is burning  and it's out of control
It's not a problem you can stop  it's rock n' roll
I read it on a wall  it went straight to my head
It said  Dance to the tension of a world on edge
We got racial violence  and who'll cast the first stone?
And sex is used any way it can be

And I don't need your jealousy  yeah
Why drag me down in your misery? (Yeah)
And when you stare  you don't think I feel it
But I'm gonna deal it back to you in spades
When I'm having fun  you know I can't conceal it
And when you're talking about a vasectomy  yeah
You got your bitches with the silicone injections
Crystal meth and yeast infections
Bleached blond hair  collagen lip injections

No effort spared to save what we had
All in good faith I would not hesitate

Someday you'll find someone that you can call your own

Nightrain
I can see a love restrained
Don't you know I feel the same? Yeah
Nothin' lasts forever
And we both know hearts can change
And it's hard to hold a candle
In the cold November rain
But lovers always come and lovers always go
If we could take the time to lay it on the line
Or I'll just end up walkin'
In the cold November rain

'Cause nothin' lasts forever

As if they thought of rain

It was a bargain for the summer and I thought I had it all
Where she was while she was sleepin' in another woman's bed
If there's nothin' I can gain from this or anything at all
It'd be the knowledge that you gave me when I thought I'd heard it all
It was a long time for you
It was a long time for me
It'd be a long time for anyone but
Looks like it's meant to be
All the way from California on the way to your next call
To those non-negotiations to simulate a cause
For the betterment of evils and your ways around the laws
That keep you up and sitting pretty on a pedestal or bed

But then  it seems that I had seen it in her eyes
Though it might not be wise  I'd still have to try
With all the love I have inside  I can't deny
I just can't let it die  'cause her heart's just like mine
And she holds her pain inside
So  if you ask me why she wouldn't say goodbye
I know somewhere inside
There is a special light  still shining bright
And even on the darkest night  she can't deny
So  if she's somewhere near me
I hope to God she hears me
There's no one else could ever make me feel I'm so alive
I hoped she'd never leave me
Please God  you must believe me
I've searched the universe and found myself within her eyes
No matter how I try  you say it's all a lie
So  what's the use of my confessions to a crime
Of passions that won't die
In my heart?
