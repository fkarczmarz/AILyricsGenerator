Set the time for the battleground
Guided missiles will hunt you down
Drones surround your homes
Don't breathe  you're not safe underground
Political landscape shape has been polarized
Now it's time to reveal the zeal
Everybody breathe  get mobilized
Radiation beams out your screens
It's like a poltergeist
Trying to buy the American dream
But it's overpriced
5 bill deal for thе fighter jets
Bein' shippеd to the Middle East
It'll cost 10 billion more dollars for neighbors to feel safe to breathe
(Breathe)
Breathe with me
Sometimes you got to stop and breathe (Breathe)
Breathe with me
Come breathe with me
Sometimes you got to stop—

He pulls on the strings of his guitar
She pulls on his pants  bam  he pulls on her bra
Breathe  (Uh uh) if you believe
Everything under the sun  it was born to be free
The shadow is bound to the tree
And cannot leave with the traveler
The battle is fought on the daily basis
The sturdy man replaced the straggler
As long as there is a breath of life  there's always hope
Defeat the strife  don't let go that rope
(Breathe)
Breathe with me
Sometimes you got to stop and breathe (Breathe)

 Always tell your Mummy
 Always tell your Mummy
 Always tell your Mummy
 call your boys
 sirens on
 bring your colours to the floor
I used to check out lyrics upon the format
My lyrical form is clouds on your brainstorm
Dance missions clubs like spores react by strobe visions
And hurrying more reflects on the dance floor
Needles collapse while atmospheres continue
The cosmic boss with Prodigy
Flipping astrology
My intellects devour
With diesel power

I leave cords to mics hanging like spring leaves
My metaphor range is strange as angles
My intellects proceed with diesel power
Back attack the wack packs you faxing me
My amplifier blows on your world's higher
Persistent intelligent kingpin
Flippin' astrology
As I roll with Prodigy
With diesel power
Four twenty-one

Horrible circle breaks  then worship the freaks
The dog is barking mad  has gone and run away with no leash
The heat is coming  stop running  leave your blood on the streets
We stick together  stormy weather  we don't fuck with police
Go!
You bet you can't hold me down
We fight fire with fire
We fight fire with fire

We fight fire  we fight

The control of your mind and your body
But the architects of the New World Order have ways to force you into submission
The public will be coursed into accepting a National Identification Card
It'll be disguised in the cloak of benevolence
Once the National Identification Card is in place
It will become the ID Card
Write a check in the super market or even drive your automobile
Yo where've you been at man?
Yo we need you man
You gotta put out that knowledge
Kick that street knowledge G
I need my fix of that dope
P’s song is a natural tryptamine
I was under the spell of Kangol and reserved notes
It took me 33 years for me to see the truth
Ever so clear I was too young
I couldn't articulate myself the right way son
They wanna put me in a straightjacket in a padded room
And tell the world there's 12 monkeys so they can be confused

They say life is like Chess
But fuck that I'm tired of playing games with you kids
Inspire every party to map where it's poverty
I started with a Mobb but now I got an army
With soldiers and troopers
The TV and the radio scared the death of us
So we hit the YouTube up
Now I got millions of views
Now watch how many rappers follow what P do
Now I'm too hoody to conform to the program
I'm too much of a rebel for me to try to fit in
Nigga! It don't matter on the color of your skin
Right now you either positive or you negative
