lyrics
"I'm tired of wanting more  I think I'm finally worn
For you have a way of promising things
And I've been a forest fire  I am a forest fire
And I am the fire  and I am the forest
And I am a witness watching it
I stand in a valley watching it
And you are not there at all
So today  I will wear my white button-down
I can at least be neat  walk out and be seen as clean
And I'll go to work  and I'll go to sleep
And I'll love the littler things
You love me so hard and I still can't sleep
You're growing tired of me
And all the things I don't talk about
It's not that I don't want you
It's just that I fell in love with a war
And nobody told me it ended
And it left a pearl in my head
And I roll it around
It's not that I don't want you
There's a hole that you fill

But it's just that  I fell in love with a war
And nobody told me it ended
And it left a pearl in my head
And I roll it around
Over and over again  my nail colors are wearing off
See my hands  pretty boy
What do they tell you?
'Cause I've looked down at them  not knowing why
And after everything's done and I'm all undone
You can hear my high heels walking on
Clickety-clacking through the night
I'm carrying my bag of bones
Fluorescent store lights  you shine through the night
Illuminate my pores and you tear me apart
Mercy on me  would you please spare me tonight?
I'm tired of this searching  would you let me let go?
I know my room is a mess
Over and over again I tell myself I'll clean tomorrow
Just move the stuff up off the bed
And do what you came here to do
But first  open up a window for me
And let the cool air in  feel the night slip in
As it softly glides along your back
And I hope you leave right before the sun comes up
So I can watch it alone

Mercy on me  would you please spare me tonight?
I'm tired of this searching  would you let me let go?
And I can take a little bit more
Let's shake this poet out of the beast
Just a  just a little bit more
Honey  what'd you take?
Think my brain is rotting in places
I think my heart is ready to die
I think my body is falling in pieces
I think my blood is passing me by
Honey  what'd you take? What'd you take?
Honey  look at me
Tell me what you took  what'd you take?
Honey  what'd you take? What'd you take?
Honey  look at me
Tell me what you took  what'd you take?
I think my fate is losing its patience
I think the ground is pulling me down
I think my life is losing momentum
I think my ways are wearing me down
But if I gave up on being pretty  I wouldn't know how to be alive
I should move to a brand new city and teach myself how to die

 with a little bit left
 I learned I'm a drinker
 a drink feels like family
 what's the matter? Lookin' like your sticker
 you can take it from me
 ooh-ooh-ooh
Can I sleep in your house tonight?
Mom  is it alright
If I stay for a year or two?
Mom  I'll be quiet
It would be just to sleep at night
And I'll leave once I figure out
How to pay for my own life too
Mom  would you wash my back?
This once  and then we can forget
And I'll leave what I'm chasing
For the other girls to pursue
Mom  am I still young?
Blank  open eyes watch the moonflower bloom
All these twenty years trying to fill the void
Crack baby  you don't know what you want
But you know that you had it once
And you know that you want it back
Crack baby  you don't know what you want
But you know that you're needing it
And you know that you need it bad
With wild horses running through your hollow bones
Wild horses running through your hollow bones
Ooh-oh
But all I saw was your burning body waiting
All these twenty-years on a vacation
Crack baby  you don't know what you want (Ooh)
But you know that you had it once (Ooh)
And you know that you want it back
Crack baby  you don't know what you want (Ooh)

Hanging onto a cliff that stretched him everyday
And when she'd ask to hold hands
He would smile and let one of his hands go
And when he'd say goodnight and leave her doorstep
He'd use his last strength to wave back
He'd return his waving hand back to its cliff
'Cause Dan had never danced outside of his room
When no one was home and he would stop to hear the door
So when he moved with you and felt his body let go
Of course you couldn't know it was you and you alone
That he had shown his bedroom dancer to
Shown his bedroom dancer to

For I'm starting to learn I may never be free
But though I may never be free
And I sit on the curb 'cause it's the prettiest night
With no one else in sight
You know I wore this dress for you
These killer heels for you
With every breath of the breeze
Aah-ah! Aah! Aah! Aah! Aah!
And I will forget how to cry
I'll keep going to work  and you won't see a change
I will go jogging routinely
Calmly and rhythmically run
And when I find that a knife's sticking out of my side
I'll pull it out without questioning why
And then  one warm summer night
I'll hear fireworks outside
And I'll listen to the memories as they
I will be married to silence
The gentleman won't say a word
Runs a river that will never find home
And then  one warm summer night
I'll hear fireworks outside

I don't know where to put my hands
I've been trying to lay my head down
But I'm writing this at 3 a.m
I don't need the world to see
I don't think I could stand to be
Where you don't see me
I end up on a tree-lined street
I look up at the gaps of sunlight
I miss you more than anything
I don't need the world to see
I don't think I could stand to be
Where you don't see me
And autumn comes when you're not yet done
I don't think I could stand to be
And I've turned down every hand
That has beckoned me to come
You're my number one  you're the one I want
And I've turned down every hand
That has beckoned me to come
'Cause you're the one I got  you're the one I got
So I'll keep turning down the hands
That beckon me to come
Though I'm a geyser  feel it bubbling from below
And hear the harmony only when it's harming me
But I will be the one you need
The way I can't be without you
I will be the one you need
It took me a while till I knew
It just took me a while till I knew
Now I lay as I study a blank wall
Would you spare me your voice if I call?
'Cause you waited and watered my heart till it grew
You just grew a little smarter too
So I don't blame you if you want to
There's some kind of burning inside me
It's kept me from falling apart
And I'm sure that you've seen what it's done to my heart
But it's kept me from falling apart
Would you just tell me what I'm meant to do?
'Cause I've waited and watered my heart till it grew
You can see how it's blossomed for you

 I didn't hear him leave
 and I turned around to see
 all the cookie wrappers and the empty cups of tea
 take the train
 one last rumble
 take this heart
 take the moon
 maybe I will see you  in the night  I'll see you
 take this heart
Filling all of our room
Curses as you find the string

 someone to watch me die
With all its opinions about the things that I've done
And on an inconvenient Christmas  I eat a cake
A whole cake  all for me
Ooh  oh-oh
And then I get sick and throw up and there's another memory that gets stuck
Inside the walls of my skull waiting for its turn to talk
For me to be left alone in a room with the things that I've done
A whole cake  so please don't take
Take this job from me
A whole cake  so please don't take
To remember your mouth  how it tasted true
Being with you makes the flame burn good
So if you need to be mean  be mean to me
I can take it and put it inside of me
If your hands need to break more than trinkets in your room
You can lean on my arm as you break my heart
I'm what's left of when we swam under the moon
Now the rest of my days are just waiting for when
You've calmed down and tell me  I was meant for you
Baby  being with you makes the flame burn good
If you need to be mean  be mean to me
I can take it and put it inside of me
If your hands need to break more than trinkets in your room
You can lean on my arm as you break my heart

Apologies from the intercom
And I am relieved that I'd left my room tidy
They'll think of me kindly when they come for my things
They'll never know how I'd stared at the dark in that room
With no thoughts like a blood-sniffing shark
And while my dreams made music in the night
You wouldn't leave 'til we loved in the morning
You'd learned from movies how love ought to be
And you'd say you love me and look in my eyes
And did you know the Liberty Bell is a replica
Silently housed in its original walls
And while its dreams played music in the night
I always wanted to die clean and pretty
But I'd be too busy on working days
So I am relieved that the turbulence wasn't forecasted
I couldn't have changed anyways

And I have nothing ahead of me
You're the sun  you've never seen the night
But you hear its song from the morning birds
But awake at night I'll be singing to the birds
Don't wait for me  I can't come
Your mother wouldn't approve of how my mother raised me
But I do  I think I do
And you're an all-American boy
I guess I couldn't help trying to be your best American girl
You're the one
You're all I ever wanted
I think I'll regret this

Your mother wouldn't approve of how my mother raised me
But I do  I finally do
And you're an all-American boy
I guess I couldn't help trying to be the best American girl
Your mother wouldn't approve of how my mother raised me"
