lyrics
" I will use them both
 I don't want to feel alone
 oh
 God knows we've tried
 I knew we'd be fine
 oh
 lord
 oh
 yeah)
All my favourite conversations
Always made in the A.M
Feels like this could be forever tonight
There could be a World War III goin' on outside
You and me were raised in the same part of town
Got these scars on the same ground
Remember how we used to kick around just wastin' time?
Won't you stay till the A.M.?
All my favourite conversations
Always made in the A.M
'Cause we don't know what we're sayin'
We're just swimmin' 'round in our glasses
And talkin' out of our asses
Feels like this could be forever right now
Don't wanna sleep 'cause we're dreamin' out loud
You and me were raised in the same part of town
Got these scars on the same ground
Remember how we used to kick around just wasting time?

Straight into my heart and stole it
Through the doors and past the guards (Ow!)
Just like she already owned it
And we danced all night to the best song ever
'Cause we danced all night to the best song ever
I think it goes (Woo!)
Said her name was Georgia Rose (Ow!)
And her daddy was a dentist
Said I had a dirty mouth (I got a dirty mouth)

I know you say that you don't like it complicated
That we should try to keep it simple
You're gonna want the air that I breathe
You're gonna wish you never left me

 they make you look so small
 but I still hear your call
 let me be the one to
 you don't even know me
 let me be the one to
 you'd be saving mine
 but you've fallen down so far
 I wanna break these walls
 but I still hear you call
 let me be the one to
 you don't even know me
 let me be the one to
 you'd be saving mine
 let me be the one to
 you don't even know me
 let me be the one to

Seen a lot of faces  never knowing where I was
The sun will be rising back home
Living out of cases  and packing up and taking off
Made a lot of changes  but not forgetting who I was
The moon will be rising back home
Don't forget where you belong  home
Don't forget where you belong  home
If you ever feel alone  don't
You were never on your own
And the proof is in this song
I've been away for ages  but I got everything I need
I'm flicking through the pages I've written in my memory
Don't forget where you belong  home
Don't forget where you belong  home
If you ever feel alone  don't
You were never on your own

You've never seen it look so easy
Baby  you're my only reason
If I didn't have you  there would be nothing left
The shell of a man that could never be his best
If I didn't have you  I'd never see the sun
You taught me how to be someone  yeah
All my life  you stood by me
When no one else was ever behind me
All these lights  they can't blind me
With your love  nobody can drag me down

The roof was pretty windy and she didn't say a word
Party dying downstairs  had nothing left to do
Just me  her and the moon
Then down came the lightning on me
Love can be frightening for sure
All I know at the end of the day
Is you want what you want and you say what you say
And you follow your heart even though it'll break sometimes
All I know at the end of the day
Is you love who you love  there ain't no other way
If there's something I've learned from a million mistakes
You're the one that I want at the end of the day

You're the shinin' distraction that makes me fly home
I'm like a boat on the water
But I know in my heart
You're not a constant star
But I'm not done yet
Falling for your fool's gold
And I knew that you turned it on for everyone you met
But I don't regret
Falling for your fool's gold

You've been sleepin' with my sweater
And that you can't stop missin' me
Bet my friend's been telling you
I'm not doin' much better
Because I'm missin' half of me
And bein' here without you
Is like I'm wakin' up to
Only half a blue sky
I'm walking around with just one shoe
I'm half a heart without you
With half an arrow in my chest
'Cause I miss everything we do
I'm half a heart without you
Forget all we said that night
'Cause we both got split in two
If you could spare an hour or so
We'll go for lunch down by the river

So long I've been waiting
To let go of myself and feel alive
So many nights I thought it over
Told myself I kind of liked her
But there was something missing in her eyes
I was stumbling
Looking in the dark (Oh-oh)
With an empty heart
But you say you feel the same
Could we ever be enough? (Oh-oh)
And it's alright
Calling out for somebody to hold tonight
You'll never feel like you're alone
I'll make this feel like home
So hot that I couldn't take it
Wanna wake up and see your face
And remember how good it was being here last night
Still high with a little feeling

You'll never feel like you're alone
One as beautiful as you are sweet
With just a hint of pain
For the feeling that I get when you are gone
I wanna write you a song
I wanna lend you my coat
One that's as soft as your cheek

'Cause I let my guard down
For when you're lonely and forget who you are

For when you're lonely and forget who you are (Forget who you are)
I'm missing half of me when we're apart
For your eyes only
Keep on falling when I know it hurts
Going faster than a million miles an hour
Down to Earth
It's like I'm frozen but the world still turns
Stuck in motion and the wheels keep spinning 'round
Moving in reverse with no way out
And now I'm one step closer to being
Two steps far from you
When everybody wants you
Everybody wants you

We sailed an ocean and drowned in the wave
Built a cathedral  but we never prayed
Point of no return and now it's just too late to turn around
I try to forgive you but I struggle 'cause I don't know how
We built it up so high and now I'm falling
It's a long way down  it's a long way down from here
We had a mountain  but took it for granted
We had a spaceship  but we couldn't land it
We found an island  but we got stranded
Point of no return and now it's just too late to turn around
I try to forgive you  but I'm struggling 'cause I don't know how
We built it up so high and now I'm falling
It's a long way down from here
Such a long way down from here
It's a long way down
It's a long way down
Such a long way down
It's a long way down
It's impossible to know if after this we can still be friends  yeah
I know you're sayin' you don't wanna hurt me
Well  maybe you should show a little mercy
The way you look  I know you didn't come to apologise
Oh  why you wearing that to walk out of my life?
If tomorrow you won't be mine
Won't you give it to me one last time?
Unforgettable together  held the whole world in our hands
I know there's nothing I can do to change it
But is there something that can be negotiated?
Oh  why you wearing that to walk out of my life?
If tomorrow you won't be mine
Won't you give it to me one last time?

Won't you give it to me one last time?

Wanna drive in the night to the end of the earth and go over the edge
Lips so good I forget my name
I swear I could give you everything
You can take it and take it
You can break it and break it
Never enough
It's never enough
Never enough
Come on
Come on
Wanna pull an all-nighter and get into something we'll never forget

Her mother doesn't like that kind of dress
Everything she never had  she's showing off
Driving too fast  moon is breaking through her hair
She's heading for something that she won't forget
Having no regrets is all that she really wants
(Ooh) We're only getting older  baby
(Ooh) And I've been thinking about it lately
(Ooh) Does it ever drive you crazy
(Ah-ah-ah) Just how fast the night changes?
(Ooh) Everything that you've ever dreamed of
(Ooh) Disappearing when you wake up
(Ooh) But there's nothing to be afraid of
(Ah-ah-ah) Even when the night changes
(Ooh) It will never change me and you
Chasing her tonight  doubts are running 'round her head
He's waiting  hides behind a cigarette
Heart is beating loud and she doesn't want it to stop
Moving too fast  moon is lightin' up her skin
She's falling  doesn't even know it yet

 heart devoured

And then?
Right
Remember the day we were giving up
When you told me I didn't give you enough
And all of your friends were saying I'd be leaving ya?
She's lyin' in bed with my t-shirt on
Just thinking how I went about it wrong
Say what you're feelin' and say it now
'Cause I got the feelin' you're walkin' out
And time is irrelevant when I've not been seeing ya
The consequences of falling out
Are something I'm having nightmares about
And these are the reasons I'm cryin' out to be with ya

You're my kryptonite

Something's gotta give now

That I need you here with me now
'Cause you've got that one thing
And fall into my arms instead

Tongue tied over three words  cursed
Running over thoughts that make my feet hurt
Bodies intertwined with her lips
Now she's feeling so low since she went solo
Hole in the middle of my heart like a Polo
And it's no joke to me
So can we do it all over again?
If you're pretending from the start
Like this  with a tight grip
Then my kiss can mend your broken heart
I might miss everything you said to me
And I could lend you broken parts
That might fit like this
And I will give you all my heart
So we can start it all over again
Can we take the same road? Two days in the same clothes?
And I know just what she'll say if I can make all this pain go
Can we stop this for a minute?
You know  I can tell that your heart isn't in it or with it
And tell me with your mind  body and spirit
I can make your tears fall down like the showers that are British
Whether we're together or apart  we can both remove the masks
And admit we regret it from the start

But do you really want to be alone?

When I first saw you from across the room
'Cause I'm not good at making promises
But if you like causing trouble up in hotel rooms
And if you like having secret little rendezvous
If you like to do the things you know that we shouldn't do
And if you like midnight driving with the windows down
And if you like goin' places we can't even pronounce
If you like to do whatever you've been dreamin' about
So let's start right now

Or the arms that hold you any time you want them

Ooh-ooh-ooh
There's a moment when you finally realise
There's no way you can change the rolling tide
Escape from the city and follow the Sun

Wanna go back there every night

Wanna roll back like pressing rewind

Who's this whisper telling me that I'm never gonna get away?
I know they'll be coming to find me soon
But I fear I'm getting used to
Being held by you
Who's this man that's holding your hand and talking 'bout your eyes? (Oh-oh-oh)
Used to sing about being free but now he's changed his mind (Oh-oh-oh)

I leave my heart open
But it stays right here empty for days
She told me in the morning
She don't feel the same about us in her bones
It seems to me that when I die
These words will be written on my stone
The ground beneath my feet is open wide (Oh-oh-oh)
The way that I've been holding on too tight (Oh-oh-oh)
With nothing in between
I drive all night to keep her warm
I spend her love until she's broke inside
Written on these walls are the colors that I can't change
Leave my heart open
But it stays right here in its cage
I know that in the morning
I'll see us in the light up on the hill

I spend her love until she's broke inside ('Til she's broke inside)
The story of my life
Drifting  weightless  waves try to break it
I'd do anything to save it
Why is it so hard to save it?
My heart  your heart  sit tight like bookends
Pages between us written with no end
So many words we're not saying
Don't wanna wait till it's gone
You make me strong
I'm sorry if I say I need you
But I don't care  I'm not scared of love
'Cause when I'm not with you  I'm weaker
Is that so wrong? Is it so wrong
That you make me strong?
Think of how much love that's been wasted
People always trying to escape it
Move on to stop their heart breaking

Fire and water for your love

The fact that we can sit right here and say goodbye
Means we've already won
A necessity for apologies between you and me
Baby  there is none

Ah-ooh  goodbyes are bittersweet
But it's not the end  I'll see your face again

I'm watching her dance  dress is catching the light
In her eyes  there's no lies  no lies
There's no question  she's not in a disguise
With no way out and a long way down
Everybody needs someone around
But I can't hold you too close now
Through the wire  through the wire
What a feeling to be right here beside you now
Holding you in my arms
When the air ran out and we both started running wild
The sky fell down
But you've got stars  they're in your eyes
And I've got something missing tonight
What a feeling to be a king beside you  somehow
I wish I could be there now
Through the wire  through the wire  through the wire

It's too late  it's too late  am I too late?

Don't need makeup to cover up (Huh)
Bein' the way that you are is enough
Everyone else in the room can see it
Everyone else but you
Baby  you light up my world like nobody else
The way that you flip your hair gets me overwhelmed
But when you smile at the ground  it ain't hard to tell
If only you saw what I can see
You'll understand why I want you so desperately
Right now I'm looking at you and I can't believe

Standin' out from the list of the things I've done
All the rest of my crimes don't come close
To the look on your face when I let you go

How to fix up a heart that I let down
Where do broken hearts go?

Seconds and hours
Maybe they had to take some time
I know how it goes
I know how it goes from wrong and right
Silence and sound
Did they ever hold each other tight like us?
Did they ever fight like us?
You and I
We don't wanna be like them
We can make it till the end
Nothing can come between you and I
Not even the gods above
Can separate the two of us
I figured it out
Saw the mistakes of up and down
Meet in the middle
There's always room for common ground
I see what it's like
I see what it's like for day and night
Never together
'Cause they see things in a different light like us
But they never tried like us
