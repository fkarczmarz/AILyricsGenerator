lyrics
"When it's not worth dyin' for?
Does it take your breath away
And you feel yourself suffocatin'?
Does the pain weigh out the pride
And you look for a place to hide?
Did someone break your heart inside?
You're in ruins
Throw up your arms into the sky
You and I
When you're at the end of the road
And you lost all sense of control
And your thoughts have taken their toll
When your mind breaks the spirit of your soul
Your faith walks on broken glass
And the hangover doesn't pass
Nothing's ever built to last
You're in ruins

Throw up your arms into the sky
You and I
Did you try to live on your own
When you burned down the house and home?
Did you stand too close to the fire
Like a liar looking for forgiveness from a stone?
When it's time to live and let die
And you can't get another try
Somethin' inside this heart has died
You're in ruins
Throw up your arms into the sky
Throw up your arms into the sky
A welfare child where the teamsters dwelled
The last one born and the first one to run
My town was blind from refinery sun
My generation is zero
I never made it as a working-class hero
21st century breakdown
I once was lost  but never was found
I think I'm losin' what's left of my mind
To the 20th century deadline
I was made of poison and blood
Condemnation is what I understood
Video games to the tower's fall
Homeland Security could kill us all
My generation is zero
I never made it as a working-class hero

21st century breakdown
I once was lost  but never was found
I think I'm losin' what's left of my mind
To the 20th century deadline
We are the class of  the class of '13
Born in the era of humility
We are the desperate in the decline
Raised by the bastards of 1969
My name is No One  the long lost son
Born on the 4th of July
Raised in the era of heroes and cons
That left me for dead or alive
I am a nation  a worker of pride (Pride)
My debt to the status quo
The scars on my hands and a means to an end
It's all that I have to show
Hey
Hey
Hey
I swallowed my pride and I choked on my faith
I've given my heart and my soul
I've broken my fingers and lied through my teeth
The pillar of damage control
I've been to the edge and I've thrown the bouquet (Hey)
Of flowers left over the grave
I sat in the waiting room wasting my time
And waiting for Judgment Day
I praise liberty
The freedom to obey
Is the song that strangles me
Well  don't cross the line
I can't even sleep from the light's early dawn
 oh  well‚Äù

Sings like American eulogy
The dawn of my love and conspiracy
Forgotten hope and the class of '13
Tell me a story into that good night
Sing us a song for me
Hysteria
Mass hysteria
Mass hysteria
Mass hysteria
Red alert is the color of panic
Elevated to the point of static
Beating into the hearts of the fanatics
And the neighborhood's a loaded gun
Idle thoughts lead to full-throttle screamin'
And the welfare's asphyxiatin'
Mass confusion is all the new rage
And it's creating a feeding ground for the bottom feeders of hysteria

True sounds of maniacal laughter
And the deaf-mute's misleadin' the choir

Because the martyr is a compulsive liar

I don't wanna live in the modern world
I don't wanna live in the modern world
I don't wanna live in the modern world

A hostage of the soul on a strike to pay the rent
The last of the rebels without a common ground
I don't wanna live in the modern world
I don't wanna live in the modern world
I don't wanna live in the modern world
I don't wanna live in the modern world
I am a nation without bureaucratic ties
Beyond the up-to-date and the neo-gentrified
The high-definition for the low resident
Where the value of your mind is not held in contempt
I can hear the sound of a beatin' heart
That bleeds beyond a system that is fallin' apart
With money to burn on a minimum wage

You are the moonlight of my life every night
Givin' all my love to you
My beatin' heart belongs to you
I walked for miles 'til I found you
I'm here to honor you
If I lose everything in the fire
I'm sendin' all my love to you
With every breath that I am worth here on Earth

Assured that all my love's for you

On your birth certificate
So strike the fuckin' match to light this fuse  'use

And he don't even know that you exist
Stand still when it's do or die

And I smell like shit
Peel me off this Velcro seat and get me movin'
I sure as hell can't do it by myself
