lyrics
"That washed off the world  the streets looking brand new
I will not be great  but I'm grateful to get through
The feeling came late  I'm still glad I met you
The memory hurts  but does me no harm
Your hand in my pocket to keep us both warm
The poor thing in the road  its eye still glistening
The cold wet of your nose  the earth from a distance
See how it shines
See how it shines
See how it shines
See how it shines
Oh-oh-ooh
Oh-oh-ooh
Oh-oh-ooh
Oh-oh-ooh
Sometimes  there's a thought like you choose what you're doing
But it comes to naught when I look back through it
I remember the view  streetlights in the dark blue
The moment I knew I'd no choice but to love you

The speed that you moved  the screech of the cars
The creature still moving  that slowed in your arms
The fear in its eyes  gone out in an instant
Your tear caught the light  the earth from a distance
See how it shines
See how it shines
See how it shines
See how it shines
Oh-oh-ooh
Oh-oh-ooh
Oh-oh-ooh
Oh-oh-ooh
Darling  there's a part of me
I'm afraid will always be
Trapped within an abstract from a moment of my life
The weeds up through the concrete
The traffic picking up speed
All my love and terror balanced there between those eyes
See how it shines
It just dropped a twenty-storey height
If there was anyone to ever get through this life
And we will again
Movin' on in time and takin' more from
Everything that ends
And all things end
All that we intend is scrawled in sand
And slips right through our hands
And just knowin' that everything will end
Should not change our plans when wе begin again
I havе never known a silence like the one fallen here
Never watched my future darken in a single tear
I know we want this to go easy by bein' somebody's fault
But we've gone long enough to know this isn't what we want
And that isn't always bad

And all things end
All that we intend is built on sand
Slips right through our hands
And just knowin' that everything will end
Won't change our plans when we begin again
And all things end (Knowin' we can always start again)
All that we intend (Knowin' we have another day)
Is scrawled in sand (Knowin' we can always start again)
Or slips right through our hands (Knowin' we have another day)
And just knowing (Knowing we can always start again)
That everything will end
Should not change our plans
She likes to roll here in my ashes anyway
Played from the bedside is Stella by Starlight
That was my heart  the drums that start off Night and Day
The same kind of music haunts her bedroom
I'm almost me again  she's almost you
I wouldn't know where to start
Sweet music playing in the dark
Be still  my foolish heart
Don't ruin this on me
I wouldn't know where to start
Sweet music playing in the dark
Be still  my foolish heart
Don't ruin this on me
Tell me who and I'll be thanking them
The numbered lovers of Duke Ellington
Do I owe each kiss to lip and cheek
As soft as Chet can sing Let's Get Lost?
And let the good times roll
Let smoke rings from this paper  doll
Blow sweet and thick till every thought of it don't mean a thing

The very thought of you and am I blue?
A love supreme seems far removed
I get along without you very well some other nights
Oh  the radio news reader chimes
Reporting Russian lullabies
She'll turn to me awake and ask  Is everything alright?
And  Lord
I wouldn't know where to start
Sweet music playing in the dark
Be still  my foolish heart
Don't ruin this on me

Sweet music playing in the dark (I wouldn't know where)
Be still  my foolish heart
Toying somewhere between love and abuse
Calling to join them the wretched and joyful
Shaking the wings of their terrible youths
Freshly disowned in some frozen devotion
No more alone or myself could I be
Lurched like a stray to the arms that were open
No shortage of sordid  no protest from me
With her sweetened breath  and her tongue so mean
She's the angel of small death and the codeine scene
With her straw-blonde hair  her arms hard and lean
She's the angel of small death and the codeine scene
Feeling more human and hooked on her flesh
I lay my heart down with the rest at her feet
Fresh from the fields  all fetor and fertile
It's bloody and raw  but I swear it is sweet
With her sweetened breath  and her tongue so mean
She's the angel of small death and the codeine scene
With her straw-blonde hair  her arms hard and lean

Wonder if better now having survived
The jarring of judgement and reason's defeat the sweet

With her straw-blonde hair  her arms hard and lean

Mmm  mmm  mmm  mmm
When I was a child  I heard voices
Some would sing and some would scream
You soon find you have few choices
I learned the voices died with me
When I was a child  I'd sit for hours
Staring into open flame  something in it had a power
Could barely tear my eyes away
All you have is your fire
And the place you need to reach
Don't you ever tame your demons
But always keep them on a leash
Mmm  mmm  mmm  mmm

Just as it was  baby
Before the otherness came
And I knew its name
The highs hit the heights of my baby
And its hold had the fight of my baby
And the lights were as bright as my baby
But your love was unmoved
How long you would wait for me and how long I've been away
The shape that I'm in now  your shape in the doorway

When the gyre widens on and when the wave breaks
When St. Peter loses cool and bars the gates
When the birds are heard again in their singin'
Once atrocity is hoarse from voicin’ shame
And when the earth is trembling on some new beginnin'
With the same sweet shock of when Adam first came
Be as you've always been
Be as you’ve always been
That freed the first man and will do so again
Which side of the wall really suffers that cost?

When the bodies starvin' at the border

Be as you’ve always been?

Singin' at me as the first thing
How the mouth must be employed in every corner of itself
A promise softly sung of somewhere else
And as a young man blessed to pass so many road signs
And have my foreign ear made fresh again on each unlikely sound
But feel at home  hearin' a music that few still understand
A butchered tongue still singin' here above the ground
The ears were chopped from young men if the pitch cap didn't kill them
They are buried without scalp in the shattered bedrock of our home
You may never know your fortune
Until the distance has been shown between what is lost forever
And what can still be known
So far from home to have a stranger call you darling
And have your guarded heart be lifted like a child up by the hand
In some town that just means home to them
With no translator left to sound
 but she burns
 but it's clean
 don't fuss over me
 all while she stains
 just like she throws
 it's a crime
 but she loves
 I'm all but washed
 it's divine
You'd end up in one when you'd stay
We had nowhere to go and every desire for goin' there
I heard once  it's the comforts that make us feel numb
We'd go out with no way to get home
And we'd sleep on somebody's floor and wake up feelin' like a millionaire
Wish I'd known it was just our turn (We just got by)
Being blamed for a world we had no power in (But we tried)
You and I had nothin' to show (We didn't know)
But the best of the world in the palm of our hands (Anythin'  darlin')
And darlin'  I haven't felt it since then
I don't know how the feelin' ended
But I know bein' reckless and young
Is not how the damage gets done
We knew what our love was worth (When we had nothin')
Now we're always missin' somethin' (I miss when)
I miss when we did not need much

You were steerin' my heart like a wheel in your hands (Turn back  darling)

I don't know how the feelin' ended
But I know bein' reckless and young
Is not how the damage gets done
Why did we never run
Before our chance was gone?
Why did we never run
Before our chance was gone?
All I needed was someone
When the whole wide world felt young
All I needed was someone
You take in the blackness of air
The likes of a darkness so deep
And sit unseen with only the inner upheld
Your reflection can't offer a word
To the bliss of not knowin' yourself
With all mirrorin' gone from the world
Fills it with somethin' or someone
No closer could I be to God
Or why he would do what he's done

How before I heard it from your mouth
My name would always hit my ears as such an awful sound?
Undiscovered underground
And the first time that you kissed me
I drank dry the River Lethe
The Liffey would have been softer on my stomach all the same
But you spoke some quick new music
That went so far to soothe this soul
Some part of me must have died
The first time that you called me baby
And some part of me came alive
The first time that you called me baby

When was the last time?
Some part of me must have died
The final time that you called me baby
But some part of me came alive
The perfect creature rarely seen
Since some liar brought the thunder

If I could hold you for a minute

Oh  please  give me mercy no more
That's a kindness you can't afford
I warn you  babe  each night  as sure as you're born
You'll hear me howling outside your door
Don't you hear me howling  babe?
Don't you hear me howling  babe?
Don't you hear me howling  babe?
Don't you hear me howling?
Don't you hear me howling?
No better version of me I could pretend to be tonight
Soul deep in this swill with the most familiar of swine
For reasons wretched and divine
Laughing her way through my feeble disguise
No other version of me I would rather be tonight
'Cause with my mid-youth crisis all said and done
Run her hands through my hair
Ride 'round picking up clues
We'll name our children Jackie and Wilson
Raise 'em on rhythm and blues

Me and my Isis growing black irises in the sunshine
Every version of me dead and buried in the yard outside
We'd sit back and watch the world go by
Run her hands through my hair
Ride 'round picking up clues
We'll name our children Jackie and Wilson
Raise 'em on rhythm and blues
I start digging up the yard for what's left of me in our little vignette
For whatever poor soul is coming next
Run her hands through my hair
Ride 'round picking up clues
We'll name our children Jackie and Wilson
About that night  the bugs and the dirt
Why were you digging? What did you bury
Before those hands pulled me from the earth?
I will not ask you where you came from
I will not ask and neither should you
Honey  just put your sweet lips on my lips
We should just kiss like real people do
I knew that look  dear  eyes always seeking
Was there in someone that dug long ago
So I will not ask you why you were creeping
In some sad way  I already know
So I will not ask you where you came from
I would not ask and neither would you
Honey  just put your sweet lips on my lips
We should just kiss like real people do
I could not ask you where you came from
I could not ask and neither could you
Honey  just put your sweet lips on my lips
Alarms are struck and shore is shook by sheer atrocity
A cure I know that soothes the soul does so impossibly
A moment's silence when my baby puts the mouth on
Me and my babe relax and catch the manic rhapsody
All reason flown as God looks on in abject apathy
A squall and all of me is a prayer in perfect piety
A moment's silence when my baby puts the mouth on me
When the meaning's gone
There is clarity
And the reason comes on the common tongue of your loving me
And it's easy done
Our little remedy
And the reason comes on the common tongue of your loving me
What yields the need for those who lead us oh-so morally
Those that would view the same we do through their deformity
Who view the deed as power's creed as pure authority
This moment's silence when my baby puts the mouth on me
Since it all begun
To its reckoning
There the reason comes on the common tongue of your loving me
Be thankful some know it lovingly
There the reason comes in the common tongue of your loving me

Weaves through the checkpoints like a needle and thread

Seen like a speck out from the shore
Swimming out beyond the breakers
Like he's done his life before
He feels a coming of a squall
Will drag him out a greater length
But knows his strength and tries to gather it
And he swims on
Turning back to shore again
Above the outer atmosphere
Of a world he's never seen
And looking down to his new home
He feels the rising of a wave and knows at once
He will not weather it

Picture six feet freshly dug
The sharp temporary walls
At the long-term cliff edge of the world
Light and air find some new deepness there
And usher down the sky
Where one stands by and tries make sense of it

Measure the silence of a house
The unheard footsteps at the doorway
The unemployment of the mouth
And remembering again the full extent
Of what forever is
With each grave
I think of loss and I can only think of you
