lyrics
"Exhaust fumes and rest stops who drive hard for their bucks
And nobody acknowledges that boys in bands got it so damn bad
But we love like the last cigarette we'll ever have
I'm putting miles on my body  bout due for a tune up and this gas station food ain't really helping but
I'm loving every minute  every road sign's a reminder of exactly why we did it to begin with
This is how it has to be
A kiss for luck  submerge myself
And in 7 weeks resurface
Even if we don't look back again
Tired boys and wired eyes
Exposing imperfections
To the public eye we're perfect
Even if we don't look back again
And it's a lifestyle that I wouldn't recommend
Wild 'N Out on a level Nick Cannon couldn't comprehend (fuck outta here)
We made a lot of friends and even more enemies
Some of which were genuine and others just pretend to be
It's all gravy baby  life's lovely
Even when the gray rain cloud's right above me
The girl's textin' me talkin' about gettin' all cuddly
Cause you paint a pretty picture but the frame is so ugly
You might also like
This is how it has to be
A kiss for luck  submerge myself
And in 7 weeks resurface
Even if we don't look back again
Tired boys and wired eyes
Exposing imperfections
To the public eye we're perfect
Even if we don't look back again
And now it's back in a van with four of my mans
Until we catchin' a tan on the Florida sands
I feel like tourin' this land's made me more of a man
From killa California to the shores of Japan
Good times stayin' up late in Austin
Coast to coast VA to Chicago
To gettin' up with Johnny Cupcakes in Boston
And smokin' the most grade A in Colorado
Home ain't home no more
I hug the road and kiss the concrete and sometimes I even hear her heartbeat
No matter where we go or where we at
We carry upstate on our back  it's like that
This is how it has to be
A kiss for luck  submerge myself
And in 7 weeks resurface
Even if we don't look back again
Tired boys and wired eyes
Exposing imperfections
To the public eye we're perfect
Even if we don't look back again
This is how it has to be
A kiss for luck  submerge myself
And in 7 weeks resurface
Even if we don't look back again
Tired boys and wired eyes
Exposing imperfections
To the public eye we're perfect
Even if we don't look back again
So a lot of you don't realize
There's a whole subculture of boys driving around in vans
(Even if we don't look back again)
Looking for your daughters  and your lottery tickets. Love it or leave it  I'm like this
(Even if we don't look back again)
I love my life. Bitches.
(Even if we don't look back again)
I don't know where you're going
Or when you're coming home
I left the keys under the mat to our front door (Ya)
For one more chance to hold you close
(It's your boy Travie  Gym Class Heroes)
I don't know where you're going (Let's go  yeah)
Just get your ass back home
We both knew this type of life didn't come with instructions (No)
So I'm trying to do my best to make something out of nothing
And sometimes it gets down right shitty in fact
When you call and I don't even know what city I'm at
Or what day of the week in the middle of the month
In a year I don't recall
It's like my life's on repeat and the last time we spoke I told you I wouldn't be long
That was last November  now December's almost gone
I'd apologize  but I don't realize what I'm doing wrong
I never know
I don't know where you're going
Or when you're coming home
I left the keys under the mat to our front door (That's love  yeah)
For one more chance to hold you close
I don't know where you're going (Uh-huh  okay  what's that?)
Just get your ass back home

And you've been nothing but amazing and I'll never take that for granted
Half of these birds would've flew the coop but you  you truly understand it
And the fact you stood beside me every time you heard some bogusness (Tough love)
You deserve a standing O cause they'd have just been over it
Like we don't hear what they saying
We'll just drive by and keep waving
'Cause you and I above all that  just let 'em wallow in it
And now they all choked up  yuck  'cause they be swallowin' it
I don't know where you're going (Yeah)
Or when you're coming home (Alright)
I left the keys under the mat (I'm coming home  mama)
(Mama  I'm coming home)
To our front door (That's love)
For one more chance to hold you close
I don't know where you're going (Yeah  yeah  yeah)
Just get your ass back home
No one holds me down like you do  sweetheart
You keep doing that  I'll keep doing this
And we'll be alright  trust that
We put the us in trust  baby
Ahh  let's go!
I don't care what you're after
As long as I'm the one  no
I don't care why you're leaving
You'll miss me when you're gone
I don't know where you're going (Uh-huh  uh-huh)
Or when you're coming home (Okay)
I left the keys under the mat (I'm home now  baby  let's go)
To our front door (Uh-huh)
For one more chance to hold you close
I don't know where you're going
Just get your ass back home
You played the role of superglue when I was fallin apart
Through all the papercuts and all the broken hearts
You played the role of superglue when I was fallin apart
Thank you  you know exactly who you are
You played the role of superglue when I was fallin apart
Through all the nightmares and anxiety scares
You played the role of superglue when I was fallin apart
Hi  it's so quiet
Where did the music go?
I was boppin my head and tappin my feet
And having a grand old time  more please!
I want more  give me more music
Give me it  now! I want it
Hey! Do you remember  that time when we were listening
To some fine music  by the Gym Class Heroes
And it was two minutes ago?
Do you remember that? That was cool
Hey! Do you remember  that time when we went fishing
With Fat Tommy and we wore clown shoes
And we caught some lake trout
But they had big teeth and antlers and Fat Tommy said
Those are not lake trout
Those are space cowboys from West Lancanshire
And I said  I don't believe you
And Fat Tommy said  I don't believe me!
And now it never happened
Hey! Anyways I'm outta here
This is not novelty
This is nothing delicate
This is the result of some Google search for something relevant
Stake claim immediately
Cause hot products cool down
At which point will flot the new sounds
Take fame intravenously
But when nature turns to habit
I'll be sure to leave the scene and start stacking it
This is nothing fraudulent
This is that sure shot itchy finger lingering behind your target audience
You got em all convinced
But we ain't buying it buddy
Demand for lies is high
And you're supplying it
Truth is brutal and consumes you if you let it
Type that in your little away message and set it
Keep singing songs
That I can write in my sleep like I'm counting sheep
Keep singing songs
Man you're boring me  with your monotony
Keep singing songs
Just following the leader with your blah blah blah
Keep singing songs
That I can write in my sleep like I'm counting sheep

And this is not a fashion statement
It's elegant intuition
Far beyond your bed wetter kindergarten compositions
This is a part of me
How can you sleep at night
When what you don't bite you write half-heartedly
Go join the army
And be the best you can be
Give new meaning to blowing up overseas
Please
We kick them doors down when nobody would let us in
And give you that proverbial taste of your own medicine
We took your formula and relabeled it
And sat patiently and giggled it when you drank it
See poison street cred weigh just about the same reflesh
Pop bottles and dropped names
And you'll dismiss it cause it isn't what you're used to
But who the fuck died and made you King Koopa?
Keep singing songs
That I can write in my sleep like I'm counting sheep
Keep singing songs
Man you're boring me  with your monotony
Keep singing songs
Just following the leader with your blah blah blah
Keep singing songs
That I can write in my sleep like I'm counting sheep
Wow  congratulations on your new purchase
I heard you bought a crib on Biters Block downtown plagiarism's paradise
You're not a movement
You're purely amusement
The poster boy for Xerox and the role model for parasites
You serve no purpose
You're purely decorative
And bore use to death with your auditory sedatives
Oh they don't see
No  we don't sleep
And hog tie your runaway bride with cold feet
We built this city on lock and load logic
And burned it down the same night
So go ahead and put your tears on ice baby
I think we got a winner
And kiss your crucifix your boy's a certified sinner
Keep singing songs
That I can write in my sleep like I'm counting sheep
Keep singing songs
Man you're boring me  with your monotony
Keep singing songs
Just following the leader with your blah blah blah
Keep singing songs
That I can write in my sleep like I'm counting sheep
Keep singing songs
That I can write in my sleep like I'm counting sheep
Keep singing songs
Man you're boring me  with your monotony
Keep singing songs
Just following the leader with your blah blah blah
Keep singing songs
That I can write in my sleep like I'm counting sheep
It’s a dirty rotten shame  shame
It’s a dirty rotten shame  shame
I'm not the one who would jump the gun
And be blinded by the sun
I even made you pinky swear just so I was reassured
Silly me for being such a 'natic for that kitty cat
You told me it's the truth but I'm still afraid
I'm not the one who would jump the gun
And be blinded by the sun
You said you were in love but the games you played
I hope that you're having fun
You see I need you to take off my shades
And be blinded by the sun

Upstate New York's finest  baby (Upstate berserkers in the building!)
Mad   how you feeling? You ready? I am
Let's go!
Ooh (hey!)  well I'll be damned
I've been around the world and I'm back again
From Japan to Amsterdam  with a ticket in my hand
Ooh (yeah!)  well I'll be damned
I've been around the world and I'm back again
From Japan to Amsterdam  with a ticket in my hand
What type of fuckery has been required lately?
It seems like these MC's heads need deflating
And imma play the pin because I've been waiting
Now make my mark on pop culture for my generation
80's babies from the age of Nintendo
Kangaroos with the zippers  had a couple those
Breaking 2 had me spinning on my elbows
Couldn't get me out my shell toes if hell froze
You know I miss you more then Shaq miss free-throws (That's a lot)
You put it back in the air  when the wee's gone
Reminiscing 'bout when we were young  but now we've grown

Let's talk about the scene for a minute (yes)
I know we ain't been seen in a minute (nope)
We left before a minute now we all up in it
Never been the type with tight jeans I won't fit it
When I see them scene girls that they all gonna get it
And I'm living clean now  a lotta y'all won't get it
So fresh and so clean  in my Eugene fitted
While I'm laughing at the baby  y'all crying at the clinic
I read a couple blogs and they had my ass livid
But now I got my own  the world gotta live with it
Never played basketball  but I could show you how to pivot
Making moves in that black hatchback Honda Civic
Like I did in high school  wishin' I could relive it
But I can't  so let's go on and give the hook a revisit
Ooh (hey!)  well I'll be damned
I've been around the world and I'm back again
From Japan to Amsterdam  with a ticket in my hand
Ooh (yeah!)  well I'll be damned
I've been around the world and I'm back again
From Japan to Amsterdam  with a ticket in my hand
Maybe I'm wrong
But after 26 years I feel I've paid my dues
So when you play this song
Just know that I live my life the way I choose
And now I stand here proudly in L.A
For a sold out crowd
And when no one's around  I refuse
To be inferior to you
Ooh (hey!)  well I'll be damned
I've been around the world and I'm back again
From Japan to Amsterdam  with a ticket in my hand
Ooh (yeah!)  well I'll be damned
I've been around the world and I'm back again
From Japan to Amsterdam  with a ticket in my hand
Ooh (hey!)  well I'll be damned

From Japan to Amsterdam  with a ticket in my hand
Ooh (yeah!)  well I'll be damned

From Japan to Amsterdam  with a ticket in my hand
Ooh (hey!)

We have to take our clothes off (so sexy)
We have to party all night (?)
We have to take our clothes off
To have a good time  oh no no no
Excuse me miss
I couldn't help but to notice how alone you are
I dig the attitude and how you're acting like you own the bar
Got me flashing keys and I don't even own a car
Like you ain't feeling my charm  because I know you are
I'm trying to see how your lips feel
Oh I'm sorry  my name is Travie and I'm pretty much a big deal
Oh  you've never heard of me
That sounds absurd to me
The way you stole my attention was flat out burglary
What do you say let's exit stage left so me and you can
Possibly reconvene and play some Naked Peek-A-Boo
Cause after all the blouse you're wearing is kinda see through
And it's obvious I'm heading wherever you're leading me too
Such an angel with a devilish angle
And quite the certified sweet talker
And you're buying every line of it girl
And I don't really blame you
If I was in your shoes I'd probably do the same too

Now here's another barn burner for the slow learners
Put your helmets on and take a seat on the short bus
Next stop  right around the corner from your momma live
No turning back so you better buckle up
Shit  don't be concerned with mine
I feel like a Speak-n-Spell way I got you learning my lines
I change my name to did he really just say that shit? (Yep)
I'll take a mile if you let me
Six-five  two hundred plus and so sexy
My legs going numb for keeping my phone on vibrate
To hide the fact your girlfriend keeps textin' me
And I've been trying to never mind it man
But every time I get a new number  she finds it damn
And you thought you had it sewn up
Until right around amazing o'clock when I showed up
We have to take our clothes off (so sexy)
We have to party all night
We have to take our clothes off
To have a good time  oh no no no
Got chicks  all hot chicks
Indie-rock chicks  and hip-hop chicks
Slim chicks  round chicks

Indie-rock chicks  and hip-hop chicks
Slim chicks  round chicks
Good grief girl  you're giving me goosebumps
Standing there in your underwear and new pumps
It's like the more time we waste and less time I get to taste you
Honestly I could easily replace you
It's not a scam girl
That's how I am girl
Peter Pan  I'm a sucker for Smucker's jam girl
It's clear I'm only here for good clean fun
Shut up and kiss me like the antidotes under my tongue

You know what it is
It’s hard to look innocent when I got cookie crumbs all over my face
I like girls
They like me
They look so good in 7 Jeans
Want you to be the one
And my only
I want to be faithful
But I can't keep my hands out the cookie jar
You see I got this problem
I need help trying to solve it
'Cuz meeting after meeting
And I'm still a cookie-holic
And I'll say I ain't do it
With my face covered in chocolate
My girl be setting booby traps
To catch me eating Scooby Snacks
I left crumbs in the bed once
But I told her I was through with that
She still don't be believing me
And I guess that I'm cool with that
But I got a sweet tooth
That'll never come loose
And the truth of the matter is

And I'll never turn down some Oreos if you got them
Butter pecan Puerto Rican
Or them oatmeal raisin Asians
Double Stuf or Thin Mint
'Cause I got a sweet tooth
That'll never come loose
And the fact of the matter is
I like girls
They like me
They look so good in their 7 Jeans
Want you to be the one
And my only
I want to be faithful
But I can't keep my hands out the cookie jar
I'm a monster for these cookies
I'm a beast for their treats
I'm an animal for their crackers

So if you wanna see us gone
Then I suggest you keep our name out of your headlines
Unless you wanna mess that is
Your best bet is to set your dirty laundry separate from the clean before your deadline
Admit it you wanted to be an artist
But your parents and that tiny voice inside you said it wasn't worth the hardships
What better way to compensate then to hate on everything you wish you were
But didn't have the balls to harness
Cuz you flirted with a chick who's got my tongue in her esophagus
Bitches post anonymous
Give me one good reason I shouldn't dead this debate
Don't worry I'll wait....
That's the fuck I thought
Cat got your tongue
Next time get your facts right
Google me and act right
How can I be with...
Be without your hate
It gives me peace of mind
So please don't tell me it's over

Hey Mr. Internet
Here's a list of shit you didn't know but now you do
Exploit my bad habits
Tell them I do drugs
Tell them Travis smokes more crack than Tyrone Biggums does
Tell them I can't rap
Tell them I dumb it down
Tell them not to buy tickets whenever my band's in town
And how I buy magazines for the sake of seeing my name
Tell them I how frequent parties trying to get that page 6
Tell them so and so someone saw pictures of my dick
Make me out to be an asshole that don't deserve his fans
Make me more insecure than I already am
Kick dirt on my accomplishments if you're ever bored
Just document it well and don't forget to hit record
Let them keep bogging trash im gonna take the garbage out
Say the fucking baby
Never been fake and they are clayer than Aiken
Hate cuz I'm ahead so much so my drop be hating
License plate reads hating
Eat my dust
Just hate us
So if you wanna see us gone

Lips sealed but my fingers are flying
And as the hours pass  they grow more impatient
My phone is magnetic  especially when I'm sauced up
And I admit that I'm ashamed
But there's Melissa  Theresa and Emily what a toss up
But that's the best part of the game
And I'm really an anonymous  aspiring alcoholic
Drowning the days pain in hops  barley and grain
Thinking of ways to convince one to join me
In the company of low-lives  sort doing the same
It's like fish and my words are like lures
If they bought the bait cool  if not call it a night
We can't  more like we should have and I know
And I try  to be a good boy but it's hard
Now ask yourself this  is love a tender thing
Too rough  too rude  too boisterous?
Well  I'll tell you what man
I had it once and it was fun but not enough
'Tis torture and not mercy
Heaven is where my phone lives
In my pocket  so cozy oh what a joy replies give
See  Melissa's babysitting and Theresa's working late
But Emily's on her way to East 11th on the train
And that's when I remember Patty from West Philly
She said  I'm in your area  three minutes away
It's like fish and my words are like lures
If they bought the bait cool  if not call it a night

He wrote back  Me too.. I was just sitting here thinking bout you
I know I want him but I can't and I shouldn't
Tried to put my phone down  damn! But I couldn't
Stayed on the phone with him all night long
Txt Message when I'm gone
We can't  more like we should have and I know
And I try  to be a good boy but it's hard
This the diary of a breathing onomatopoeia
Now here's another broken link for anyone who thinks my life's together
I rock a raincoat despite the pleasant weather
God placed a permanent dark cloud above my head
But he was nice enough to loan me a holy umbrella
Thank ya fella  how considerate
I'm the illegitimate son of accident-prone degenerates
Today's forecast partly cloudy with a good chance of rain
So I wear my sarcasm badge proudly
And  flash a devilish grin
That'll make the most masculine of men skeptical of his existence
And when the rain begins  I'll take a seat to retire
And admire the spectacle from a distance
For instance  there was this cat the other day
Shooting me ice grills  but when I looked he looked the other way
Now any other day I wouldn't let this type of shit bother me
Today it was enough to make my lucky charms soggy
Looked him dead in the eyes and analyzed how it effected him
He broke down in tears talkin 'bout how God neglected him
Make this rain go away
If that sun  can come out today
Life would be more worthwhile  worthwhile

And all it took was a sewin’ needle to deflate my swollen ego
Then  pop pop! went my God complex
I never thought nineteen years after my first breath
I'd be in art school surrounded by corny fucks debatin who's more depressed
I'm twenty-two now  and still can't deal with what's real
But I'll be damned if I give up and settle for pills
Shit my daddy taught me better  mommy taught me how to crack 40's
And jack six-packs in oversized sweaters
Over time weather changes  so I'm in the rain waitin
For the flood gates to open impersonatin
My favorite VH-1 Behind the Music tragedy
Catastrophe never tasted so acidic before
I'm PH balanced for the floor but strong enough to stay afloat
And doggy paddle long enough to catch that life preserver rope
And then  I'll be on a parallel ladder laughin like
Damn my man  for the love of Pete what happened
Finally I'll step to you  kindly disrespect you
Look you dead in the eyes and analyze how it affects you
Watch you break down in tears talkin bout how God neglected you
Make this rain go away
If that sun  can come out today
Life would be more worthwhile  worthwhile
You ever watch a whole day wash away
Like your very last match that got wet the second you struck it
Well go ahead relieve your stress  kick that bucket all you want
A cigarette that never mattered's what you're stuck with
You ever watch a whole day wash away
Like your very last match that got wet the second you struck it
Well go ahead relieve your stress  kick that bucket all you want
A cigarette that never mattered's what you're stuck with
Make this rain go away
If that sun  can come out today
Life would be more worthwhile  worthwhile
Make this rain go away (You ever watch a whole day wash away  Like your very last match that got wet the second you struck it)
Funny style cat and his girl looked like a turtle
High school track he ran the hurdle
His peers shed tears senior year when he got murdered
Now Alberto was your average A student
His family was picture perfect his older sister was prom queen
His dad a decorated vet for the Vietnam team
Or the way he flamboyantly shook his hand when he would wave to her
She thought nuttin' of it and just shoved it in the closet
Until the day the word dripped out like leaky faucet
Alberto was homosexual  I ain't have nothin' against it
But little Ronnie Johnson and all his football player friends did
And couldn't wait to get to gym so they could really bust his nuts
He'd make silly gestures and compare him to Micheal Jackson
Alberto couldn't take it he just stopped showin' up
And whenever he walked them halls he just felt like throwin' up
(Gotta show 'em you're more than gay..)
See he had dreams to be a track star
Until the warm April night them gay jokes went way too far
Ronnie begged for his forgiveness and invited him to a party
Cause his parents went away and left him plenty of Bacardi
Except it was all deception and left him all unprotected
It was a plan Ronnie had scammed to get him in the right place
Verbally degrade him and rearrange his pretty face
One punch turned into fifty they beat him till he was dizzy
Now Alberto lie in blood while his peers look on in fear
He took his last breath and passed away his senior year
Needless to say it was one big tragedy
And how was Ronnie gonna explain it to his family
While they were on vacation takin' in sights
He got wasted and killed a kid that night

And started to listenin' to her peers - oh dear!
Now Maria was your typical obnoxious analytical
Headstrong rebel flippin' off the principal
While moms worked two jobs just to buy supper
Jugglin' family and heroin addiction
He overdosed and left a notice of eviction
Who saw solace in the records she found
And she would stay up late at night
Recitin' songs to herself under pale moonlight
Rightin' wrongs that her pops made
Carrie Anne had other plans
Homecoming queen versus ugly duckling
And the story ends the same way
Okay Ronnie's parents went away for a couple of days
And told him no drinkin' - what the fuck was they thinkin'?
Maria was oblivious that her boyfriend had already been invited
Or so she thought
Carrie Anne hated Maria cause she could sing
And when her man was gettin beat she was nowhere in sight
Now her boyfriend lie in blood and she had no idea
Alberto passed away and she got hooked her senior year
Needless to say it was one big tragedy

(Ladies and Gentlemen of the court)
(I like this first and foremost)
Slam the gavel Judge Judy got a grudge
Interrogating me for days on end and I won't budge
I'm on some Eddie Murphy raw Baby it wasn't me shiz
And you can throw the book at me and I'm a throw it right back
Slap the district attorney and ask him How you like that?”
Then I'm a jump in front of the jury like my life is in your hands
Then break each and all their fingers just to make em' understand
This is obviously a case of mistaken identity
Plus this face is too pretty to be in a penitentiary
Paranoid like Chris and Snoop was out to kill me
Walkin' on a thin wire. Why they tryin' to Marlo Stanfield me?

And I think it went down like this
I woke up in the back of a squad car
Handcuffed until they threw my ass behind bars
Something a little different you can bob your head to it
But they tryin' to give me 25 to life for every line
But just imagine the monster you gonna make of me
And the moment that we all feared
Guilty on all charges for the dopest album of the year!

I mean no disrespect and I apologize if this fucks up your program
You tell me I'm gonna burn for lying but that He can turn water to wine? (laughs)
Well if there's a hell below then we're all gonna' be just fine
So there I stood six feet of sin  a walking contradiction
But am I wrong for posing questions or am I just another lost soul searching?
Then she gave me a look so unchristian and told me she'd pray for my children
I said  If you're so holy you'll probably out-live me but if I bought a Jesus piece do you think he'd forgive me?
Maybe I would be a fool to think
That somewhere in the sky's a place for me
What good would it be to pray for me
You won't save me  don't pray for me
Now I've never been religious
I'm just a big fan of logistics
And if it makes sense then I'm all for it
I even pray if the situation calls for it
Somebody asked me if I believe in miracles
I try to answer without sounding satirical
I'm 3 years past my expiration and yet I'm still fresher than a newborn
So I guess that's my explanation but it's safe to say I've never seen a unicorn and I never chase rainbows
But I hear the devil wears designer clothes
So does God have a favorite brand?
And for that matter  is he even a man?
And will I go to hell for even saying that?
Only time will tell I'm just relaying facts

Shallow babble and a  bunch of punch lines you probably won't get

I could waste thirty-two bars tellin you how to live

Or  a little ditty 'bout Jack & Diane
Spit 'em at you with a catchy hook look
I could  strike a nerve with some four letter words
That'll make Richard Pryor proud  or better yet
I could  sing a jingle that'll contort and mingle
Every single solitary letter in the alphabet
I could tell you whatever you want to hear
But if I just said hello would you listen to me?
I could sell a blind man new ears
If I just said hello would you listen to me?
I'm tryin hard to make it perfectly clear
But I'm dyin’ because there ain't nobody listenin’ to me
Been relyin’ on myself on myself for more than twenty-two years

Breaker breaker can I get some reply  or maybe some kind of sign
To let me know that you're listenin to me?

For the sake of sounding conscious but  that's just obnoxious
I could take off these bandages and  expose these papercuts
And put 'em in the air with both  my middle fingers up
Or talk about myself in third person like I'm better than you
Cause there's nothin else better to do

Cleverly explainin exactly how wack you are  but

My first love was a chick from the sticks named Geneva
Had to take the 88 upstate just to see her
Now I'm realizing how much I really need her
But something told me follow my heart and head eastwards
Told her I was leavin' for her older sister Manhattan
Super high maintenance and way too into fashion
Didn't even tell her piece and left her number on a napkin
Now I heard she went Hollywood and began acting
In all the wrong places
I've been falling in love
With all the wrong faces
Please take me home

Please take me home
She could tell that I wasn't bilingual
We can hit South Beach and drink mojitos
And maybe you can introduce me to your people

Only I know that I can’t do it alone

Miniature grown man HAH
Third of three sons big bird and squirt guns
Aunt Tammy dressed up like a clown when I turned one
Scared the shit out of me but thanks for trying
Sitting in my high chair throw a kick and crying
I remember everything every single detail
But he had to go to work and bust his ass for them dollars
Now it all makes sense back then I wasn't having it
Obsessed with He-man so young and so adamant
More concerned with Castle Grayskull than baseball
Then I learned that if I worked a little I could have it all

And when no one was looking I threw the papers out
Got caught made Dad furious

Don’t act like you my momma ‘cause my dad bought you some jewelry
Oh that sounds cool to read
I sat back and watched pops play the ladies like chess checkmate

Simply seeing your paycheck broken down to fractions
Papa was a pimp married 4 times
Indecisive tried to strike a gold mine
Sifting through the sand something like a 49
And up to the point where my chest become a cold mine
But when they come and go I’ll be here to the bitter end pop just letting you know
I never understood temptation I guess we both got a little David Ruffin in us

And I been staring out this window for the past eleven hours
Thinking of all the opportunities this window has to offer
From the twenty third floor and a filing cabinet east Manhattan
And FDR is beautiful as I'm watching all the cars passin'
Then a couple stars twinkle so I started laughin'
And a couple walk by and they look so happy
I booked this room at this place called The Last Resort
Now is you is or is you ain't with me?
And I fully understand if you got other plans
But I can't see you hand in hand with another man
I been on auto-pilot since we last spoke
And I don't wanna board this flight on a bad note
I want you to think about it but either way I'm going
And if you really love me then here's your chance to show it
I see a window and all I can think about is

And I don't have to board a plane for me to show I love you
And all this talk about the afterlife is kinda creepy
I kinda smiled and we both walked to the window
I pulled it shut and started staring at the sky
I wiped a couple tears away then we looked at each other
And I could see the stars twinkle in her eyes

It was the middle of spring
Walkin' with my boys
Contemplating what summer will bring
We started talkin' about girls
And it was the funniest thing
As I started remembering some of my funniest flings
See there was Ashley
She caught my eye the very second that she passed me
I kissed her once
Then she started to harass me
She called all night long
I had to buy a brand new phone
To have a mouth like that should be a felony
Wouldn't believe half the shit that she was tellin' me
I mean dirty vocab
She used to talk like she was grown
And after that there was Tiffany
The one with the cute cousin
Are you kiddin' me?
She had a man
But that didn't mean shit to me
He tried to catch us all the time
But I was just to god damn smooth
And I can't forget to mention Carrie
But that situation quickly got scary
Cuz after two days she's like 'let's get married'
Can you believe that shit?
I had to pack my bags and move!

But she looked so damn good
She almost made my ass convert
And after that there was Lisa
I bumped into them at Cam's gettin' pizza
The greatest night of my life
Schlep's the rock that kill two birds
And there was Erica
She had the stankest breath in North America
I tried to slip her tic-tacs
But they were scared of her
And when we made out
I always had to plug my nose

I only kissed her

I used to make her bring me aspirin
I'm doin fine thanks for askin
I even tried to make a muzzle
But her mouth would just not quit
I hate to bring her up again
I didn't want her
That girl I talked about
In That girl's a dog song
Almost made me lose my grip
The meth head
She used to sniff like a fist full
One time she chased me down the street with a pistol
She tried to say I took her stash
She bugged out and tried to kill my ass
And at last we got Kimmy
And broke up with me
And so I ripped up all them letters that she sent me
I cried for like 3 days
Then it was back to my evil ways
They say I gotta change my evil ways

Unless I'm bloody
Let's go
I'd like to think I pride myself on being humble
And let these other motherfuckers lose touch like a fumble
Cause you can keep a level head and have fun too
At least till my name's in the same lane as ?
You gonna have to respect me for making being uncool cool
So insecure I'm tugging at my t-shirt
Cause I swear the girl behind me staring at my love handles
I just wanna change the channel or delete them
Where the fuck is Adam Sandler when you need him?
I'm Christopher Walken
And I gotta thank God often
Cause otherwise I'd be like these other guys
This type of scene just ain't my thing

In a room full of people
So now I'mma seat on this stoop
And I'mma gonna lace up my boots
And keep on walking till I make my way home

That's probably why I ain't sayin' shit
Oh what the hell I might as well get wasted
Cause I'd rather be sedated
Than conversate about whose sneakers are more outrageous
Or whose outfit's the latest
This type of scene just ain't my thing
And everybody too cool for school
And yet somehow I never felt so alone
In a room full of people
So now I'mma seat on this stoop
And I'mma gonna lace on my boots
And keep on walking till I make my way home
Ladies and gentlemen
Boys and girls
I'd advise you all
To the Papercut Chronicles II
It don't get much better
This type of scene just ain't my thing
And everybody too cool for school
And yet somehow I never felt so alone
In a room full of people
So now I'mma seat on this stoop
And I'mma gonna lace on my boots
My man Tom introduced us but I was too shy to say hi
When I finaly built up enough nerve to drop a line
You made it clear you wasn't just a MySpace mistress
And I didn't take it personal
When you ignored my request to be your friend
I spilled my guts and hit send
Waited 2 weeks for a response and got nothin
Honestly it only made me want you more
Week 4 rolled around and I was this close to letting go
But something wouldn't let me even though i hardly knew you
Its plain to see we were meant to lock lips
You knocked me out with the brass knuckle tats on your hips
I was on this website late nite lurken
When I got a message from you labeled urgent
You sayed you wasn't impressed by lame dudes with no game
But the fact that you hit me back made me smile
You must of saw something you liked when you was skimming through my profile
You caught me at the most pivitle moment
Now I'll mailing my love with a dozen digital roses
So click approve
So sick
But show me some kind of sign
And let me know its time to make my move
Click approve
Come on girl baby I'm one of a kind and I ain't got time to lose
Click approve
Killin me here just show me some kind of sign
And let me know its time to make my move
Click approve
Come on girl baby I'm one of a kind and I ain't got time to lose

Lets face it
Its a sad situation that we have to resort
To keyboard as a means of making relations but
I don't have the patients I'll get straight to the point
So this is me at my most honest
No egos
No Gym Class status just Travis
Love it or leave it but you got to admit
On the scale of 1 to Awesome I'm the shit
Just get over it and add me God damn it I've been waiting too long
I even wrote a song about it like to hear it here it go
If I'm being too annoying let me know. . . just let me know
But its hard for me to not hate when I'm on MySpace
I never see my face in your Top 8
Approaching 6 weeks now its kind of obvious
That you either occupied or playin a game
All my money on the matter this is not a L O L matter
Why would you pass up a chance this great
If I had 2 forces
And I split them down the middle
I could swing back and forth for 3 days
Rephrase
If I had 2 horses and I beatem wit authority
I'd gallop all the way to Canada to see your face
But All I got is powerbook and iChat
Beside I hit you all the time but you never write back
I stay on my feet . . . .Shit
And be persistant till my name is under who you'd like to meet
My man Tom introduced us but I was too shy to say hi
When I finally built up enough nerve to drop a line
You made it clear you wasn't just another myspace mistress
And I didn't take it personal
When you ignored my request to be your friend I spilled my guts and hit 'send'
Week 4 rolled around and I was this close to letting go

When I got a message from you that was labled 'urgent'
You said you weren't impressed by lame dudes with no game
They're all the same tryin' to get your instant messenger name
But the fact that you're hittin me back made me smile
You must've saw somethin you liked when you was skimming through my profile

Who cares if we don't know each other's last name
All I know is that I'm smittin with your pictures wishin you would feel the same
I'll admit I get a lil jealous when other dudes leave you comments
Of me and you speaking in tongues in this mansion I bought
But it's all wishful thinking
Just give me some kind of sign to let me know I'm not freakin you out
I check my inbox 10 times and there ain't nothing
You probably busy doing something sexy
I just hope I'm in your thoughts next time you log in
I'll be here when your man ain't fully down as he used to be
I’m sick and tired of being so sick and tired
Comin’ home from tour you yelling before I get through the door
With that so and so said this and that
Why you still with me for?
Goin’ through my phone I made you feel like a fool
When Alexander’s my dude
Sometimes I think you do it simply cause you’re bored
If you really loved me we’d be making love not war
But you’d rather waste the little time we do have
Going back and forth
Are you sorry now? Well too bad!
I can’t believe I wasted all this fucking time
Instead of fighting with you I could have been writing rhymes or...
Hanging out with Stitch and watchin’ Up or something
You never tried to meet me halfway
You played these little immature ass ga-ay-aymes
I tried to be the best man I can but you were too dumb to understand
That I can have any girl but I stayed with you
I guess everybody plays the foo-ooh-ool and
Now you think you’re coming back to me

Or try to tell me you forgot to take your Midol
Cause you ain’t blaming this one on your period
Huh? What? Wait? Nope I’m not hearing it
The crash dummy final grabbed the wheel and now he’s steering it
And I probably shoulda done something faster
You’ve been dropped from the label and I’m keepin’ your masters
Travie you’re a bastard!
Call me what you want to
P.S. I froze all your accounts and uh… leave that ring on the counter

I just need time to walk it off
But I can’t do it
I’ll write it on my own time
Hey look I made it on my own (on my own)
Makin’ a mess as I progress
I wrote the greatest lines at the strangest times

When the door shuts  it's like another papercut
And I'm stuck with a hand full of band-aids
Until she comes back around like them ceilin fan blades
Claims she loves me but  she cuts me into pieces
When I'm sewed up  here comes another papercut
Now I'm stuck with a hand full of band-aids
Until she comes back around like them ceiling fan blades
We met twenty-two years back  fresh out the womb
Now she consumes me  no room for self these days
And she's so demandin - do this  do that
Don't forget to take your medicine
I hate it when her face is invading my head again
The welcome mat reads please take off your shoes
But she disregards the statement
I've grown accustomed to bending my beliefs
To  satisfy her needs but I'm fed up
With plugging cuts everytime they bleed
So I dip my pen in the puddle
What a bloody mess its been tryin to end this struggle
But I love her  she's the reason for the lesions
Man I love her  I start bleeding when she's leavin
And every scar on my fingertip is a reminder of
All the lessons learned on my missions tryin to find her but
I'll sit alone 'til she comes back home
And I'll be waitin by the phone {*ring*} hello?

When I'm sewed up  here comes another papercut
Now I'm stuck with a hand full of band-aids
Until she comes back around like them ceiling fan blades
She don't live here no more  I heard she's stayin down the street
With a deadbeat that don't treat her right with two bad-ass kids
Guilt and regret  and I'm willin to bet
My last album that she's wishin she was kissin me
Man the nerve of this bitch  pardon my French but it's been 10 days
And I'm gettin kind of lightheaded
Maybe I'll write her a letter  in a gentleman's way
And send it  with the hopes that she might get it
I can't believe I let her run all over me
But  all I think about is when she's here and holdin me
I love her  she's the reason for the lesions
Man I love her  I start bleeding when she's leavin
And every scar on my fingertip is a reminder of
All the lessons learned on my missions tryin to find her and
I can't complain  I kind of like the pain
She ain't even got a name she just lives in my brain and
She says she loves me but  she comes and goes when she pleases
When the door shuts  it's like another papercut
And I'm stuck with a hand full of band-aids
Until she comes back around like them ceilin fan blades
Claims she loves me but  she cuts me into pieces

Says she loves me but (she really thinks that I'm an asshlole)
She says she loves me but (my ears are too big)
She says she loves me but (I pick my nose too much)
She says she loves me but (she says I never really listen)
She says she loves me but (I take too many pills)
She says she loves me but (I never pay my bills)
She says she loves me but (I wait until the last minute)
This is. You silly for this one
Whats wrong with me? Its Travie
Why you doing this to me? Ha ha
That one of my jokes a have the pretty young things laughing
A chubby little bastard with a nack for little debbie snacks
But what I lacked in looks I made up for it in passion
No advance and plus we make it happen
And ya concious more obnoxious in that laffy taffy snappin
With no regards for tidal waves I finally established
Til water comes in gallon drums and wipes away my palace
But now I'm sitting lovely off in wonderland with Alice
With purple people passing me at the caterpillars chalice
Like I should quit writing these songs right
Take it back to 86 you wanna lick sike
Don't try to hide like I can't see you
Your parents must a been trans you so see through

Before I utter words and before I start to begin
Let me make sure you clear I'm about securring the win
I puzzle up my words while I piece another concoction
Cause I'm stubborn with the thought that failure is never an option
I grinds like a carpenter til my calluses bleed
With the passion from my heart to the many mouths that I feed
That's why I look at most of you stupid I know its odd
Because you can't really do nothing to me unless you God
Well being that none of you ain't him
You can't fuck with me now watch me erase them
Now trust me see I'm so determined
I'm walking through the heap of gauntlets how the fire was burning
Or how the tire was turning on the rim of the V
I laugh and shake it off the shit they be doing to me
With all the yappin and talking and so and so
You think that you could ever stop the kid OH NO
Fuck you because I do this for my loved ones
Fuck you because I do this for my loved ones

Everything you said is finally setting in
The training wheels fell off and I kept pedaling
Now I'm riding wheelies on this industry
Say the word and I'll ghost ride this bitch instantly
Good looking pop all the strength that you giving me
Wasn't for you Gym Class would be history
I'm on my upstate shit
I was Brooklyn broke but now I'm upstate rich
Getting brain from two dames with french accents
I don't mess with local chicks I get em upstate shipped
Like I should quit writing these song right
Take it back to 86 you wanna lick sike

Simply for lack of better stimulation
Motivation comes and goes like gas station patrons
So sedation compensates for unexpected vacations (thank you)
That's my pre-gratitude
Post-please leave me alone that's just my rude attitude
I'm really mommy's little angel
But that angel on my shoulder got strangled
For trying to tangle with his nemesis he caught him on the wrong day
And got cut like DJs spinning doubles (let the fucking song play)
I'm on my way to the store ignoring the city
To purchase a pack of Marb' Reds with a stack of rolled pennies
Quite simply put: me and my pockets share interest
I learned my lesson the first time
I just couldn't keep up with that ever-changing Jordan line of foot apparel
With seven shades and twenty tones
Put myself in every painting and use my spit as mat medium
Cast the same reflection and interpret the same dreams

Just to turn around and walk back
Like Thank God for walkmans.
I'm only yawning cause these simply minded mortals make me sleepy
So what do I do? I resort to T.V
In the seemingly lousy attempt to numb myself with lackluster images
And insignificant information like Willis was really Ty Bridges
Just to have the upper hand in monotonous conversations
And for lack of better stimulation
I'm painting portraits of dysfunctional families with gloomy faces
You misconstrue it but your babies will embrace it
The basic essentials of a very bitter young man
That kicks rusty soda cans and walks on decrepit bricks
With a permanent pair of headphones trying to make these lectures stick
And watch them die before they realize that their cause was nonexistent
Like their cause was nonexistent..
Feeling like I'm worthless (Feeling like I'm worthless)

Reminiscent of that joke we used to say when we were snotty nose
My purpose got defeated when my mind turned paraplegic
Not to mention tainted urine samples and the attention span of a second-grader
More fascinated with building blocks than wasting time stressing his daily lesson
I stepped on the left cause right's wrong (wrong)
So what do I do? I resort to friendly games of ping pong and sing a song in Sixpence
Feeling like I'm worthless (Feeling like I'm worthless)
Content with the fact that I know this city's mine

Three xanees down
I'm pounding honey grounds
I'm pillmatic
The oxycontin got my stomach rotting
Pillmatic
I swear to God I'm not an addict
Thinking back on when it all started
I found pink hearts in mommy's little pocket book
And took 'em
Popping when she wasn't looking
I guess it runs in the family
I'm liable to eat any pill you randomly hand me
Save the greenery
I'm looking for them labels reading
May cause drowsiness be careful when operating machinery
Beautiful pharmaceuticals
Residue in my cuticles
Sniffing them when its suitable
Wishing they made 'em chewable
Catch me in the source with five pills next to my name
Like fuck five mics I want five vic fame
If killing pain is the name of the game
Then I'm your number one draft pick
Dash quick to the closest medicine cabinet
Kill the whole bottle
Never played the role model position
I'm just living
So take 2 of these and call me in the morning
I'ma take 4 and finish this 40 cuz life's boring

A couple meds to ease the pain of the papercuts
The doctor says slow down maybe later buts
This world is crazy so I stay medicated
When my social lights are out
They turn them on again
I need em till I'm bored again
Oxycontin on juice on gin
Equals projectile wild style burner on a porcelain

Did you hear about Travis? (No What?)
I heard he was hooking up with a teacher! (Nice!)
And I can hear 'em talking in the hallways (let em' keep talkin')
I'm always late for lunch
Learning dirty little lessons from you (So sexy)
Now my name is on the lips of every cheerleader in my school
Now I'm a legend in the locker room
Legendary Baby!
I was just a snotty nose degenerate with fake pass perfection
Dodging teachers out to give my late ass detention
Hardly a heart throb but I made do
Using them same circle yes or no notes I used in grade school
Folded love letters with the tab that read pull here
Writing back and forth in notebooks for a full year
I use to day dream about Miss Maglassin
A type of fantasy you kind of feel guilty for having but who hasn't?
The only difference besides the age is that I acted on it
And who wouldn't?
A school boys crush a mature womans lust
And they hit it off so well
And I could tell the day she asked me to stay after class that it was all bad
But I just bit my lip and acted all mad
That's a rap

We gave a brand new meaning to after school special
The second that are lips touched
She kissed my ribs and counted each one out loud
I tried my hardest not to giggle but I couldn't cause it tickled so much
She pulled my pants to half mast
I said Hurry Miss M you're gonna make me late for math class!
The way she praised my balls was vicious
That's what I like to call sack religious
One time became twenty times
Before we knew it we stopped caring about where we were doing it
From the classroom to the bathroom
And when all the students were gone we'd even do it in the staff room
From F's to A's in less then three days
Now the under achiever's the one with the best grades
Had the third floor shaking without breaking a sweat
God damn it felt good to be the teacher's pet
And I can hear 'em talking in the hallways (let em' keep talkin')
I'm always late for lunch
Learning dirty little lessons from you (So sexy)
Now my name is on the lips of every cheerleader in my school
Now I'm a legend in the locker room
Legendary Baby!
Goodness gracious accusations started flying through the building
Cruel as school children
This isn't how its suppose to be
Reminiscent of Don't Stand So Close To Me
And it was mostly my fault for letting the shit happen
After all I was only 15 and she was showing me things my virgin eyes had never seen
And I never forgot the little meeting she called
But when she saw my reaction it made her appalled
Then you ain't going to let me pass
Some punishment lady and as I turn toward the door I look back
She had her clothes on the floor
Needless to say I passed with flying colors
And I can hear 'em talking in the hallways (let em' keep talkin')
I'm always late for lunch
Learning dirty little lessons from you (So sexy)
Now my name is on the lips of every cheerleader in my school

Steady over kicks and snares
So what you scared for unprepared for
Tunnel rat schematics far from your average rappers new era
We rockin' sewer caps
Breathin' bricks exhale trainrail city life at its finest with
That nonsense behind us
This is how we do it
I'm just a hooligan get drunk while in a j spittin raw sewage
Splinter cell movements. turnstyle jumper
Punks step up to get beat down bumper
Alias and bright colors
So bright leave you cryin' like late night mothers
Hover board kick flips
Landin' a little to the left
As you can bet every result was a split lip
Skip school make shortcuts
Act foolish like kids with the windows on the short bus
Welcome to shellshock
Ringin' in your ears like the bells that el rock
It doesn't matter whether or not the cell locks
If you can find silence in the coldest cell block
This is shellshock

A sad day for aspiring artists
Almost 20 years after the fact I'm still on my hustle
Diggin' graves for an aspiring artists
Pushing daises up
And never compromise the arts to make a crowd clap
Shit on since the first show
But we turned feces to fertilizer
So when you diss it's just food for the flowers to grow
Too young to drive
Put live hip hop in the ears of upstate kids
Got name for playing basements and such and making songs that our friends loved
And when the fish bowl got too small to hold the goldfish
We filled our gills with water and ripped that mother fucker like
So take a step back
And a breath in
Let it out now

How many punishments endured for fucking up in school?

Something producin' to the dreams your pop's dreams lent you
Stay focused when nothing seemed to make sense
Stealing verses with that Cassius Clay confidence
You learn to be a man without losing the boy in you

And wishin I was gone nine hours ago
I coulda written nine verses just in time for the show
Slacker mindstate livin on time that's borrowed
My motto's I'll stop procrastinatin tomorrow
And strung up sarcasm to make the melody wholesome
And now they chargin for oxygen and the bill's due next week
I didn't apply for runnin’ towards something that's fake
And sittin’ high horse is a car and a dope place
Now I'm schemin on plots to make my pockets swell

I'm trying to get this round over here
What do you think I'm just working for you here?
Here you are miss.
It's from this guy over here.
From the second she shimmied in
I was intrigued by her essence
And my first instincts to make sure that my presence was felt
Simple and plain
I'm probably jumping the train
But all I could see was my name engraved on her belt
Hit the pause button
Damn!
I don't even know this girl
And I'm already practicing my sweet-nothings
I tend to wear my heart on my sleeve
But that night the Jagermeister had my sleeves rolled up
I think she caught me grillin' now I'm spillin' my drink (don't look don't look)
I knew our feelings were in sync so now she gave me the wink
A Cyrano de Bergerac (shut the fuck up)
The introduction didn't grab me
So I left it on the shelf and kept moving
Assuming that this planet rotates
I'll just procrastinate until the day I bump into my soulmate
Who would've thunk I would be pissy ass drunk when time came for collision
So I made the decision to just keep my composure (cool cool)
Until she started getting closer
The minute that she stepped in the door
The type of girl I'd have to make a couple mix tapes for
To me she equaled MC squared and everything else was mathematics
So I washed myself for what seemed like three hours
With tears and rusty water
I need some of that Calgon take me away action immediately
Before I start scrubbing my hands hard repeatedly
I'm stuck somewhere lethargic between reality
And a fuckin Tool video - WAKE ME UP!
I've said goodbye too many times in these 22 long ones
And here I am wavin again  so long friend
I should have told her how this town doesn't like it when people leave
So it finds ways to keep them
It sows seeds and reaps them
Ask her mother how her smile touched souls and warmed cold hearts
Monique I miss you
I wish I could've kissed you farewell
And given you that tattoo you always asked for
But when I'm done tattin Thug Life on God's stomach
I'm goin to wash my hands
I don’t know what it is about her
She makes me so fucking special when…
I’m fucking..
When I close my eyes that's when she appears
I grab her by the thighs (come here) and I pull her near
But to my surprise (wah?!) it's just what I fear
Cause when I turn on the lights there's no one there
I am by myself and I'm dancing all alone
I am by myself and I know that nobody's home
I am by myself and I'm dancing all alone
I am by myself and I know that nobody's home
And just like that she's right back (don’t go)
She'll stay the night as long as I play the right track
She likes the lights low
And when she winds slow
I'm buyin' what she's selling
Ain't no telling where my mind goes (uh-huh)
She leaves my mind blow like old speakers
She always comes and goes but I never leave her
She is like my favorite cut or replay (ha-ha!)
She makes them paper cuts go away
I hope she stays

 this The Story of the Year right here
Just waking up in the morning and to be well
Ya ever feel like your train of thought's been derailed?
Half the population's just waitin' to see me fail
Some of us do it for the females
And others do it for the retails
Every time you fall it's only making your chin strong
Or when you hear this song from that big lady
Until the referee rings the bell
Until both your eyes start to swell
Until the crowd goes home
What we gonna do y'all?
Gonna live life til we're dead
Here comes a fighter

Textbook version of the kid going nowhere fast
And now I'm yelling kiss my ass
It's gonna take a couple right hooks a few left jabs
For you to recognize that you really ain't got it bad
Until the referee rings the bell
Until both your eyes start to swell
Until the crowd goes home
What we gonna do y'all?
Gonna live life til we're dead
Here comes a fighter
Everybody put yo hands up
What we gonna do?
What we gonna do?
What we gonna do?
What we gonna do? Ya'll
What we gonna do?
What we gonna do?
What we gonna do? Ya'll
If you fall pick yourself up off the floor (Get up)
And when your bones can't take no more
Just remember what you're here for
Cause I know I'mma damn sure
Gonna live life til we're dead
Here comes a fighter
Till the referee rings the bell
Till both ya eyes start to swell
Till the crowd goes home
 it's so sexy how she can't remember last night
 she's at the bottom of that bottle
 you know you can do better
 when the fact that you can't have her
 she's at the bottom of that bottle
 it's not worth keeping me
 she's at the bottom of that bottle
By Jackson Pollock throwin multicolored thoughts at a rapid pace
As I tweak your audio and visual
So together we enhance one another that's common sense
With my chiaroscuro inspiration sparkin the knife
And make my face popular like Andy did to Marilyn
As long as Grayskul continues spinnin hot shit
On his twin twelve-hundred color wheels of steel
Only the real can truly feel it
Or do it cause you love it or for cash that's your decision

Anything goes when my ink pen flows
I'm inclined to like paint rhymes
And I suppose if you chose the path that I chose
You know the cycle asshole don't front
A gift or a curse  I don't know I'm still undecided
And those that lack the passion I have may despise it
So tell them kids to keep colorin outside the lines
Until they lose they limitations and they minds is free
Tell the teachers that you want your money back this time
And tell Bob Ross thanks for all the happy little trees
And tell my momma that her baby boy's doin just fine
Although he's runnin out of patience but his mind is free
And tell my pops that I'll pay his money back sometime
It's every boy's dream.)
Yeah  just breathe baby

Yipe Yo Ki Yah  Gitty up
As the white stallion bucks
And kicks me in my nose until my face bust  fuck
And they say that they can keep the pace up  but its
Clear as a mirror they don't want to race us
As I stare in this mirror and powder my face up
And I never ever been one to make up
Any allegations that alligators ate us
And from the spine I spit shots  you gonna need 8 cups
Game and money  call me Mr. Monopolist
Ms. Aphrodite what is your synopsis
You can be the goddess of my white castle
Reach me on the hotline and burn your nostrils
Professor cool  I bring class to gym
And since I am the hero I must save them

My track - yo we should have a freestyle on this
Freestyle? Hit 'em off with something
Quit picking your nose? Fuck you
And five pound pronouns and predicates
This is Schlep's etiquette for sloppy fable manners get your napkins
'Til your eyeballs pop out
So you can actually see what an actual MC looks like
And if I had to pick and choose
