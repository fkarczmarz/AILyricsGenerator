lyrics
"Changing their mind from the paint on a sign?
In how they think it ought to be
And they're not going easily
Belief is a beautiful armor
But makes for the heaviest sword
Like punching underwater
You never can hit who you're trying for
Some need the exhibition
And some have to know they tried
It's the chemical weapon for the war that's ragin' on inside
From emptiness to everything
And no one's going quietly

We're never going to win the world
We're never going to stop the war
We're never going to win the world
We're never going to stop the war
Is there anyone you can remember
Ever surrendered with their life on the line?
We're never going to win the world
We're never going to stop the war
We're never going to win the world
We're never going to stop the war
What puts a hundred thousand children in the sand?
What puts the folded flag inside his mother's hand?
Towering in shiny  metallic purple armor
Queen Jealousy  envy waits behind him
Her fiery green gown sneers at the grassy ground
Blue are the life-giving waters taken for granted
They quietly understand
The once happy turquoise armies lay opposite ready
But wonder why the fight is on
But they're all bold as love
Yeah  they're all bold as love
They're all bold as love
Just ask the axis
My red is so confident that he flashes
Trophies of war and ribbons of euphoria
Orange is young  full of daring
But very unsteady for the first go around
In fact  I'm trying to say it's frightened like me
And all these emotions of mine keep holding me from
Giving my life to a rainbow like you

I'm bold  bold as love
Yeah I'm bold  bold as love

Hear me talking to you
I can't retrace how I got here
I cheat the light to check my face
It's slightly harder than last year
But all at once it gets hard to take
It gets hard to fake what I won't be
Because one of these days I'll be born and raised
And it’s such a waste to grow up lonely
They don’t fly as high as they used to
But all at once it gets hard to take
It gets hard to fake what I won't be
Because one of these days I'll be born and raised
And it’s such a waste to grow up lonely
I call on both of my brothers
But they do not have each other

So line on up and take your place
Show your face to the morning
Because one of these days you’ll be
Born and raised and it
There must be more behind the summer
I want someone to make some trouble
Been way too safe inside my bubble  oh
Take me out and keep me up all night
Let me live on the wilder side of the light
Carry me away
Carry me away
Carry me away
Carry me away
Carry me away
Carry me away
You carnivore  you loose cannon
Can I have some more? I can't understand it
You fast car  you foolish spender
You know you are  and I surrender
So come on over and wake me up
Put some of your tequila in my coffee cup
You know I need you  and that's for sure
You're just the kinda crazy I've been lookin' for

I weigh three times my body
I worry
I throw my fear around
But this morning
There's a calm I can't explain
Ooo-ooo
Ooo-ooo
By the time I recognize this moment
This moment will be gone
But I will bend the light pretending that it somehow lingered on
When all I got's
And I will wait to find
If this will last forever
And I will wait to find
If this will last forever
And I will pay no mind
When it won't and it won't because it can't
It just can't
It's not supposed to

Was there a second of time that I looked around?
Did I sail through or drop my anchor down?
Was anything enough to kiss the ground
And say I'm here now?
And she is here now
So much wasted in the afternoon
So much sacred in the month of June
And I will wait to find
And I will wait to find
That it won't and it won't
And it won't
And I will pay no mind
Worried 'bout no rainy weather
And I will waste no time
She puts the color inside of my world
But she's just like a maze
Where all of the walls all continually change
And I've done all I can
To stand on the steps with my heart in my hand
Now I'm starting to see
Maybe it's got nothing to do with me
Daughters will love like you do
Girls become lovers who turn into mothers
It's the same she's been standing in
Since the day she saw him walking away
Now she's left
Cleaning up the mess he made
Daughters will love like you do
Girls become lovers who turn into mothers

Boys will be strong
And boys soldier on
But boys would be gone without warmth from

Looking out for every girl
You are the God and the weight of her world

Girls become lovers who turn into mothers
Dear Marie  tell me what it was I used to be?
And if you’re further up the road
Can you show me what I still can’t see?
Remember me  I’m the boy you used to love
When we were fifteen
Remember me  I’m the boy you used to love
When we were fifteen
Now I wonder what you think
When you see me on the magazine
From time to time
I go looking for your photograph online
From time to time
I go looking for your photograph online
Some county judge in Ohio is all I ever find
Dear Marie  tell me do you still believe in me?
Dear Marie  tell me do you still believe in me?
Well I’ve got my dream  but you’ve got a family
Yeah I’ve got that dream  but you’ve got yourself a family
The waking up is the hardest part
You roll out of bed and down on your knees
Is she standing in my room?”
No she’s not
When you’re dreaming with a broken heart
The giving up is the hardest part
Will you wake up by my side?”
No she can’t
Do I have to fall asleep with roses in my hand?
And would you get them if I did?
No you won’t

Just a great figure eight or a tiny infinity
Love is really nothing
But a dream that keeps waking me
How can it be?
'Cause I'm just about to set fire to everything I see
So young and full of running
All the way to the edge of desire
I have to have you now
Wired and I'm tired
Think I'll sleep in my clothes on the floor
Or maybe this mattress will spin on its axis
And find me on yours

It breaks my heart

Oh  honey
Oh  honey
It's just a wave
It's just a wave
And I know

That when it comes
Loves Jesus and America too
She's a good girl  crazy about Elvis
Loves horses and her boyfriend too
Yeah  yeah
It's a long day living in Reseda
There's a freeway running through the yard
I'm a bad boy 'cause I don't even miss her
I'm a bad boy for breaking her heart
And I'm free
Free fallin'  fallin'
And I'm free
Free fallin'  fallin'
All the vampires walking through the valley
They move west down Ventura Boulevard
And all the bad boys are standing in the shadows
And the good girls are home with broken hearts
And I'm free
Free fallin'  fallin'

And gravity wants to bring me down
Dream of ways to throw it all away
Gravity is working against me
And gravity wants to bring me down
And can't sustain like one half could
It's wanting more that's gonna send me to my knees

It's wanting more that's gonna send me to my knees

 with half of my heart
 stay the man who can only love himself
 'til the day you came
 half of my heart's got a grip on the situation
 with half of my heart
 later on
 half of my heart
 half of my heart
 half of my heart
 half of my heart
Inside my chest to keep me up at night
Dream of ways
To make you understand my pain
Clouds of sulfur in the air
Bombs are falling everywhere
It's heartbreak warfare
Once you want it to begin
No one really ever wins
In heartbreak warfare
If you want more love
Why don't you say so?
If you want more love
Why don't you say so?
Drop his name
Push it in and twist the knife again
Watch my face

How come the only way to know how high you get me
Is to see how far I fall?
God only knows how much I'd love you if you let me
But I can't break through it all
I don't care if we don't sleep at all tonight
Let's just fix this whole thing now
I swear to God we're gonna get it right
If you lay your weapon down
Red wine and Ambien
You're talking shit again
It's heartbreak warfare
Good to know it's all a game
Disappointment has a name
It's heartbreak warfare
It's heartbreak warfare
Is the same drink that puts me on the floor
And the new thing I wanna try some more
Is the same mistake I used to make before
If I'm helpless tell me now
Tell me now
If I'm helpless tell me now
Tell me now
If I'm helpless tell me now
Tell me now
And I'll stop trying to figure it out
The same brain that brings me ecstacy
Is the same pain that gets the best of me
And the one I love the most just said to me
A broken heart is all I'll ever be

See  you met me at an interesting time
And if my past is any sign of your future
You should be warned before I let you inside
Hold on to whatever you find  baby
Hold on to whatever will get you through
Hold on to whatever you find  baby
I don't trust myself with lovin' you
I will beg my way into your garden
And then I'll break my way out  when it rains
Just to get back to the place where I started
So I can want you back all over again
(I don't really understand)
Hold on to whatever you find  baby
Hold on to whatever will get you through
Hold on to whatever you find  baby

I guess I just feel like
Everyone's lyin' to make it on through
I guess I just feel like I'm the same way too
I guess I just feel like good things are gone
And the weight of my worries is too much to take on
I think I remember the dream that I had
That love's gonna save us from a world that's gone mad
I guess I just feel like
What happened to that?
I guess I just feel like the joke's gettin' old
And the future is fading and the past is on hold
But I know that I'm open and I know that I'm free
And I'll always let hope in wherever I'll be
I guess I just felt like givin' up today

I can feel the love I need
But it's never gonna come the way I am
Could I change it if I wanted?
Can I rise above the flood?
Will it wash out in the water
Or is it always in the blood?
How much like my brothers do my brothers wanna be?
Does a broken home become another broken family?
Or will we be there for each other like nobody ever could?

I don't think I'm going to go to L.A. anymore
I don't know what it's like to land
And not race to your door
I don't think I'm going to go to L.A. anymore
I don't think I'm going to go to L.A. anymore
I'm not sure that I really ever could
Hold on to your hotel key
And your bedroom neighborhood
And be sleepwalking in Hollywood
I'm going to steer clear
Or burn up in your atmosphere
I'm going to steer clear
Because I'd die if I saw you
I'd die if I didn't see you there
So I don't think I'm going to go to L.A. anymore
I don't think I'm going to go to L.A. anymore

I think I'm going to stay
Going to stay in the gray
Think I'm going to stay
And all the street lights say
And the canyon lines say
The sunset says
We see this all the time
I wonder where I am in my relationship to you
I watch that pretty life play out in pictures from afar
I wonder where I am in my relationship to you
You got me crying  as was your plan
But when my loneliness is through
I'm going to find another you
You take your sweaters
You take your time
You might have your reasons
But you will never have my rhyme
I'm going to sing my way away from blue
I'm going to find another you
When I was your lover
No one else would do
If I'm forced to find another
I hope she looks like you
Yeah and she's nicer too
So go on baby
Make your little get away
My pride will keep me company
And you just gave yours all away
Now I'm going to dress myself for two
Once for me and once for someone new
I'm going to do some things you wouldn't let me do

To pick you up and take you from this place
Love on the weekend

Like only we can
Like only we can
Love on the weekend
Love on the weekend
I'm coming up and I'm loving every minute of it
You be the DJ  I'll be the driver
You put your feet up in the getaway car
I'm flying fast like a  a wanted man
Oh  love on the weekend
Love on the weekend
We found a message in a bottle we were drinking
Love on the weekend

(Love on the weekend)
 it seems to me
 I'm growing older
 all the time
 to let light through
 I can understand
 I'm getting over
 but I'm moving on
 girl
 baby
To see the colors of the city lights
A trail of ruby red and diamond white
Hits her like a sunrise
She comes and goes and comes and goes
Like no one can
Tonight she's out to lose herself
And find a high on Peachtree Street
From mixed drinks to techno beats it's always
Heavy into everything
She comes and goes and comes and goes
Like no one can
She comes and goes and no one knows
She's slipping through my hands
She's always buzzing just like
She can go before she burns away
You might also like
I can't be her angel now
You know it's not my place to hold her down

She's slipping through my hands
She's always buzzing just like
She can go before she burns away
She comes and she goes
Like no one can
She comes and she goes
She's slipping through my hands
She's always buzzing just like
That you wonder what you still believe in
And you can't remember why you said goodbye
You'll hear an old familiar sound and hope it's her when you turn around
But never  never on the day you leave
Love grows in the time it's been
Since you last heard her sing
She'll cut her hair and move somewhere
She don't owe you anything
No  it's never on the day you leave
You can tell how it's gonna be
To watch a girl become a ghost before your eyes
You wish you'd given her one more kiss
To put away for a night like this
But never  never on the day you leave
Love grows in the time it's been
Since you last held her hand
She'll fight for you like hell
Then force herself to like some other man
You might also like
No  it's never on the day you leave
That you remember Christmas Eve
And all the things you miss about her crazy family
You'll know how lonely it is to see a little drug store Christmas tree
But never  never on the day you leave
No never  never on the day you leave
So maybe it'd be better off to write her
And leave a little note right there beside her
That says maybe we're not perfect
But I'll be damned if I ever leave
Damned if I ever leave
Ah...
I'm the boy in your other phone
Lighting up inside your drawer at home  all alone
Pushing 40 in the friend zone
We talk and then you walk away  every day
Oh  you don't think twice 'bout me
And maybe you're right to doubt me  but
But if you give me just one night
You're gonna see me in a new light
Yeah  if you give me just one night
To meet you underneath the moonlight
Oh  I want a take two  I want to break through
I wanna know the real thing about you
So I can see you in a new light
Take a ride up to Malibu
I just wanna sit and look at you  look at you
What would it matter if your friends knew?
Who cares what other people say  anyway
Oh  we can go far from here
And make a new world together  babe

What do I do with all this  what do I do with all this
Condescendingly
Take a seat  take your life
Plot it out in black and white
Well I never lived the dreams of the prom kings
And the drama queens
I'd like to think the best of me
Is still hiding up my sleeve
They love to tell you
Stay inside the lines
But something's better
On the other side
I want to run through the halls of my high school
I want to scream at the
Top of my lungs
I just found out there's no such thing as the real world
Just a lie you've got to rise above
So the good boys and girls take the so called right track
Faded white hats  grabbing credits and
Maybe transfers
They read all the books  but they can't find the answers
And all of our parents  they're getting older
I wonder if they've wished for anything better
While in their memories  tiny tragedies

Just a lie you've got to rise above
I am invincible
I am invincible
I am invincible
As long as I'm alive
I want to run through the halls of my high school
I want to scream at the
Top of my lungs
I just found out there's no such thing as the real world
Just a lie you've got to rise above
I just can't wait 'til my ten year reunion
I'm going to bust down the double doors
And when I stand on these tables before you
Step out of that black chiffon
Here's a dress of gold and blue
Sure was fun being good to you
This one we made just for fall
And winter runs a bit too small
This mint green is new for Spring
My love didn't cost a thing
You're like twenty-two girls in one
And none of them know what they’re running from
Was it just too far to fall
For a little paper doll
Fold a scarf  Moroccan red
Tie your hair behind your head
Strap into some heels that hurt
You shoulda kept my undershirt
You're like twenty-two girls in one
And none of them know what they're running from
Was it just too far to fall
For a little paper doll

Cut the cord and pull some strings
Make yourself some angel wings

Was it just too far to fall?
Come down and get the door for me
Rosie
I know you said no more for me
But that was all before this dream that just came to me
Don't leave me here
Under the January rain
Come let me in
Take my heart by the hand
And lead me back to your room
And sing me your tune
Rosie
You don't have to hide his things
I'm fine with all the sorrow that tomorrow brings
Don't you know my love is true
Don't leave me here
Under the January rain
Come let me in
Take my heart by the hand
And lead me back to your room
And sing me your tune

Loving like we do
Takes way too long to get over you
And remember the line we drew
But call me over and I'm coming through
We're searching for the night together
Where we don't fall apart
Might be now and it might be never
It's just another shot in the dark
It's just another shot in the dark
And I wonder what it all means
Strange conversation with you in my dreams
And I don't know what I'm gonna do
I've loved seven other women and thеy all were you
We had a run of bad romancеs
They always missed the mark
So close your eyes now and take your chances
It's just another shot in the dark
It's just another shot in the dark

I want you in the worst way
Is the gate code still your birthday
If you thought you met your Casanova
And he left you with a broken heart
Remember when it's done and over
It was only just a shot in the dark
It was only just a shot in the dark
It's just another shot in the dark
Shoulda done more
Shoulda learned a lesson from the year before
Shoulda been honest
Shoulda just cried
Shoulda told me there was nothing left inside
Now the road keeps rolling on forever
And the years keep pulling us apart
It shouldn't matter
You shoulda just broken
You shoulda come clean
You shoulda been sad instead of being so fucking mean
It shouldn't be easy
But it shouldn't be hard
You shouldn't be a stranger in your own backyard
Now the road keeps rolling on forever
And the years keep pulling us apart
It shouldn't matter
You might also like
I shouldn't be angry
I shouldn't hold on
I shouldn't leave you messages in every little song
It could have been always
It could have been me
We could have been busy naming baby number three
Now the road keeps rolling on forever
And the years keep pulling us apart
If it's on someone then I blame the both of us
It shouldn't matter
Shouldn't matter
Shouldn't matter
It's not the storm before the calm
This is the deep and dyin' breath of
This love that we've been workin' on
Can't seem to hold you like I want to
So I can feel you in my arms
Nobody's gonna come and save ya
We pulled too many false alarms
We're goin' down
And you can see it too
We're goin' down
And you know that we're doomed
I was the one you always dreamed of
You were the one I tried to draw
How dare you say it's nothin' to me?
I'll make the most of all the sadness
So you leave me feelin' dirty
'Cause you can't understand

I still feel like your man

The prettiest girl in the room she wants me
I know because she told me so
She says come over
I'd like to get to know you
But I just don't think I can
'Cause I still feel like your man
Still feel like your man
I still feel like your man

I know the world is black and white
I try to keep an open mind
But  I just can't sleep on this tonight
Stop this train
I want to get off and go home again
I can't take the speed it's moving in
I know I can't
But honestly  won't someone stop this train?
Don't know how else to say it
Don't want to see my parents go
One generation's length away
From fighting life out on my own
Stop this train
I want to get off and go home again
I can't take the speed it's moving in
I know I can't
But honestly  won't someone stop this train?

So scared of getting older
I'm only good at being young
So I play the numbers game
To find a way to say that life has just begun
Had a talk with my old man
Said  Help me understand
Don't stop this train
And don't think I couldn't ever understand
I tried my hand
Once in a while  when it's good
It'll feel like it should
And they're all still around
And they're still safe and sound
And you don't miss a thing
'Til you cry when you're driving away in the dark
Singing  Stop this train
I want to get off and go home again
I can't take the speed it's moving in
I know I can't
Lying there in that position
There's things you need to hear
So turn off your tears
And listen
Pain throws your heart to the ground
Love turns the whole thing around
No it won't all go the way it should
But I know the heart of life is good
Bad news never had good timing
Will defend the silver lining
Pain throws your heart to the ground
Love turns the whole thing around
But I know the heart of life is good
Pain throws your heart to the ground
Love turns the whole thing around
Fear is a friend who's misunderstood
But I know the heart of life is good
The rest of us  we're born to disappear
How do I stop myself from being just a number?
How will I hold my head to keep from goin' under?
Down to the wire
I wanted water  but I'll walk through the fire
If this is what it takes to take me even higher
Then I'll come through
How did they find me here?
What do they want from me?
All of these vultures hiding right outside my door
I hear them whispering
They're tryin' to ride it out
They've never gone this long without a kill before
Down to the wire
I wanted water  but I'll walk through the fire
If this is what it takes to take me even higher
Then I'll come through

Wheels up
I got to leave this evening
I can't seem to shake these vultures off of my trail

If this is what it takes to take me even higher
Then I'll come through

 oh
Desperately hating his whole place
Dreamed to discover a new space
And buried himself alive
Inside his basement
Tongue on the side of his face meant
He's working away on displacement
And what it would take to survive
Because when you're done with this world
You know the next is up to you
And his wife told his kids he was crazy
And his friends said he'd fail if he'd try
But with the will to work hard
And a library card
One-man submarine ride
That morning
The sea was mad and I mean it
Waves as big as he'd seen it
Deep in his dreams at home
You might also likeFrom dry land
He rolled it over to wet sand
Closed the hatch up with one hand
And peddled off alone
Cause when you're done with this world
You know the next is up to you
And for once in his life it was quiet
As he learned how to turn in the tide
And the sky was a flare
As he came up for air
One-man submarine ride
One evening
When weeks had passed since he's leaving
The call she planned on receiving
Finally made it home
She accepted
The news she never expected
The operator connected
The call from Tokyo
Cause when you're done with this world
You know the next is up to you
Now his friends bring him up when they're drinking
At the bar with his name on the side
And they smile when they can
As they speak of the man
Turn off the lights and the telephone
Who says I can’t get stoned?
Who says I can’t be free?
From all of the things that I used to be
Re-write my history
Who says I can’t be free?
It’s been a long night in New York City
It’s been a long night in Baton Rouge
I don’t remember you looking any better
Who says I can’t get stoned?

Fake love for an hour or so

Wait on fate to send a sign

My girl  she isn't the one
I saw coming
And sometimes I don't know which way to go
And I tried to run before

Kind of morning that lasts all afternoon
Just stuck inside the gloom
4 more exits to my apartment but
I am tempted to keep the car in drive
And leave it all behind
Because I wonder sometimes
About the outcome
Of a still verdictless life
Am I living it right?
Am I living it right?
Am I living it right?
I rent a room and I fill the spaces with
Wood in places to make it feel like home
But all I feel's alone
It might be a quarter life crisis
Or just the stirring in my soul
You might also like
Either way--I wonder sometimes
About the outcome
Of a still verdictless life

But it's hiding the quiet superstitions in my head
Don't believe me
Don't believe me
When I say I've got it down
Everybody is just a stranger but
That's the danger in going my own way
I guess it's the price I have to pay
Still everything happens for a reason
Is no reason not to ask myself
Am I living it right?
Am I living it right?
Am I living it right?
Why? Tell me why?
Woke up empty-handed
Never heard you say goodbye
Do you remember summer said she'd go forever
Then you turn as cold as the weather
And left me here to cry and cry
Tell me
Why you no love me?
Why you no love me?
Why you no even care?
Why you no love me?
Why you no love me?
Why you no will be there?
Empty like the promise you made me
Three times makes you family
Why can't you see I'm yours?

Laying on the ocean floor
Walking through the wilderness
Wild blue deeper than I ever knew
Wild blue on a bed of grey
I found myself when I lost you
All the tears I meant to cry
Dance across the evenin’ sky

It's not a vacation if I lose you to the Eiffel
You're gorgeous but you can't fly
A hidden admirer sent me roses white as fire
Wildfire
Wildfire
Wildfire
We could string some lights up the hill beside it
Tonight the moon's so bright you could drive with your headlights out
Because a little bit of summer's what the whole year's all about
Put your feet up next to mine
We can watch that water line get higher and higher
Hasn't it been some kind of day?
You and me been catching on like a wildfire
Don't get up  just to
Get another  you can
Drink from mine  we can't
Leave each other
We can dance with the dead
You can rest your head on my shoulder
If you want to get older with me
Because a little bit of summer makes a lot of history

You got this room for two
One thing I've left to do
One mile to every inch of
Your skin like porcelain
One pair of candy lips and
Your bubblegum tongue
And if you want love we'll make it
Swim in a deep sea of blankets
I take all your big plans and break 'em
This is bound to be a while
Your body is a wonderland
Your body is a wonderland
Something 'bout the way

Crawling towards the pillowcase
You tell me where to go
And though I might leave to find it
I'll never let your head hit the bed
Without my hand behind it

But you look so good it hurts sometimes
Fiery raining meteors
It all ends unfortunately
But you're gonna live forever in me

Just wait and see
Parts of me were made by you
And planets keep their distance too
The moon's got a grip on the sea
And you're gonna live forever in me

Life is full of sweet mistakes
And love's an honest one to make
Time leaves no fruit on the tree
