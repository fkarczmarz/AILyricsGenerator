"Drain from you
Oh  darling  I feel all of your energy
As it starts to fade from you
And I see all your shadow in pieces on the floor
People  they want more from you and
I see all shadow
All my love
All my love
Oh  ever since I was a child with you
I kept a place in my heart safe for you
All my love
All my love
All my love
I hope that you stay young and wild and free
You'll have America
And I hope that you're better than all of your friends
I hope that they hold you until the end
You can have America
But all of our time chasing America
Though she never had a home for me
All of our time chasing a dream
Hmm-hmm  hmm-hmm
A dream that meant nothing to me
And see where I found you  where they all lay
All of the greats  they are here to stay
Here in America
And I hope that you find it  all that you arе
In the hеart of America
Hmm  hmm
But all of our time chasing America
But she never had a home for me
Hmm-hmm  hmm-hmm
All of our time chasing a dream
Hmm-hmm  hmm-hmm
A dream that meant nothing to me

And all the parties  they fade
I'll just be left here in America
 see them everywhere
 I don't even care
 I don't wanna move
 but all I see is you
 but you are all I see
My only hope is to let life stretch out before me
And break me on this lonely road
I'm made of many things  but I'm not what you are made of
Only now do I see the big picture
But I swear that these scars are fine
Only you could've hurt me in this perfect way tonight
I might be blind  but you've told me the difference
Between mistakes and what you just meant for me
Don't say you ever loved me
Don't say you ever cared
My darkest friend
Words
Have you forgotten all the lies you left there so fresh
Turning old in the air
And now  you have no weapons
You can try to get close to those I love
Do you really think they don't know what you're made of

Bones of ribbon don't stop me now
Feet don't stop me now

You won't know 'till you know you know it enough
Feet don't stop me now
On Californian soil
And I left my pride
With that woman by my side
I never had a willing hand
And I never had a plan
But I'm glad I found you here
But I'm glad I've got you here
But I never had a name
And I never felt the same
They keep on trying it on
And they will keep on trying it on
And they will keep on trying it on

And so you do what you're told
I never had a willing hand
And so you pack up all your bags
But I'm glad I've got you here
But I'm glad I've got you here
But I never felt the same
And this life is just a game
They keep on trying it on
They keep on trying it on
And they won't keep on trying it on
For a lifetime and it shows
Got the way I seem to
Keep my distance from you
Baby there's no need to go
Prove you love me when it shows
And the ones before you
Make it hard to love at all
Every time I try
To make myself seem small
In the arms of others
Who never loved me better
All the ways I tried
To make myself less selfish
It never made them stay
And I can't love me like this
I can't love me like this
Tell them to find other plans
I need to know that everything's alright

That beautiful decay
Bring your words and bring your art
All of these words we say
Let's put something magical
So special in a day
And I guess that's control
It is forgetting your name

So they all laugh at your predicament

And I need this drink
Will you sit with me
And bring all of your friends
Chase the morning light
Till all of this ends
There's a whisper that our God is a she
She sits on high over the land and the sea
Her breast is heavy in a brand new world
Tell your grandmother and your boys and your girls
She's got a brand nеw favourite
Tell all the shrinks and hatеrs
Give her a dream and she will give you her word

Could you have your arms around my...?

And who will notice when you're gone?

And break the news that you have vanished

In the kitchen a real mister with that jacket on
The girls all cooking

I am the fine idea you crave
I live and breathe under the moon
And when you cross that bridge
I'll come find you
Stay awake with me
You know I can't just let you be

Take your hand and come and find me
I don't have a skin like you do
To keep it all in like you do

The only one I have
Is the one I stole from you

Visions that wake me relentless  leaders mean nothing to me
Are we talking now  baby?
There is a life here for free
Are we talking now  baby?
Talking to you  talk to me
All  all of these roads are leading to nowhere you see
Whеn this world ends as we know it  what's left will bе you and me
So all  all of these changes are the visions of futures I see

And would you want me standing in the same light?
I wasn't wary of trouble when it's under my skin
They never made me aware of all of those things
And they were your words so don't leave them on their own
I will build you the happiest home
When I'm with you I'm not alone
I still believe I might not be enough
But it goes against the grain
All of these things I've seen you're not
And it is about the ordinary life
But would you want me standing in the same light?
Well I wasn't wary of trouble when it's under my skin
They never made me aware of all of those things
I will build you the happiest home

Aware of the monsters I was talking to
Dream in colour and I count to ten
I ain't got no one and I've got no home
Under the stars
They will never find us
Or know where we are
Under the bright moon
Where I'll wait for you
I'm young but you seem confused
I'm wiser than those kings sat upon the thrones
Dream in colour and I count to ten
I ain't got no one and I've got no home

And I'm wasting my young years

I heard you keep on running
I heard you keep on coming but
Here comes the rain and thunder
 this life  you are  something I can't understand
 they get ahead  blue against my better sense
 be close  but miles apart
It's strange what desire can make foolish people do

And I'd never dreamed that I'd lose somebody like you

Breath of mine  be all that you need

Wear another truth on your turned-up sleeve
This is everything I dream

You say it's not where we are
It's not what we choose
Looking out from all that you have built
With red skies  I will drift
