lyrics
"If it's a seven hour flight or a forty-five minute drive
With your hands between your thighs
Stop and wait a sec
What did you expect?
I'd probably still adore you
With your hands around my neck
Or I did last time I checked
Not shy of a spark
The knife twists at the thought
That I should fall short of the mark
It's no harsher than the bark
The middle of adventure
Such a perfect place to start
I'm going back to 505
If it's a seven hour flight or a forty-five minute drive
With your hands between your thighs
You might also like
But I crumble completely when you cry
It seems like once again you've had to greet me with goodbye
I'm always just about to go and spoil the surprise
Take my hands off of your eyes too soon
I'm going back to 505
If it's a seven hour flight or a forty-five minute drive
 they might wear classic Reeboks
 you know
 you know
 no
Does it wipe that stupid look off of your face?
I saw this aura over the battleground states
But I'm still handcuffed to the briefcase
That I'd meet so many Lolas
Can I please have my money back?
My virtual reality mask is stuck on Parliament Brawl
With God on videocall
The trainer's explanation was accepted by the steward
A montage of the latest ancient ruins
Soundtracked by a chorus of You don't know what you're doing
That I'd meet so many Lolas
And all of my most muscular regrets
Explode behind my eyes like American sports
Hoo

And a Helter Skelter 'round her little finger
And I ride it endlessly
She's got a Barbarella silver swimsuit
And when she needs to shelter from reality
She takes a dip in my daydreams
My days end best when the sunset gets itself behind
That little lady sittin' on the passenger side
It's much less picturesque without her catchin' the light
The horizon tries but it's just not as kind on the eyes
As Arabella
Just might've tapped into your mind and soul
You can't be sure
Arabella's got a '70s head
She's made of outer space
And her lips are like the galaxy's edge
And her kiss the colour of a constellation
Fallin' into place

My days end best when the sunset gets itself behind
That little lady sittin' on the passenger side
It's much less picturesque without her catchin' the light
The horizon tries but it's just not as kind on the eyes
As Arabella
Just might've tapped into your mind and soul
You can't be sure
(That's magic) In a cheetah print coat
(Asking if) I can have one of those
(Organic) Cigarettes that she smokes
(Wraps her lips) 'Round a Mexican Coke
(Makes you wish) That you were the bottle
Just might've tapped into your mind and soul
It's more a question of feeling than it is a question of fun
Will the ending reek of salty cheeks and runny makeup alone?
Or will blood run down the face of a boy bewildered and scorned
And you'll find yourself in a skirmish where you wish you'd never been born?
You tie yourself to the tracks and there isn't no going back
Are you pulling her from a burning building or throwing her to the sharks?
Can only hope that the ending is as pleasurable as the start
Now the shaggers perform and the daggers are drawn
Who's the crooks in this crime?
Now the shaggers perform and the daggers are drawn
Who's the crooks in this crime?

Of the day of the most flawless heist of all time
You knew that it'd be trouble right before the very first kiss
Quiet and unassuming but you heard that they were the naughtiest
She pleaded with you to take it off but you resisted and fought
To describe this thing
That you say we're all grandfathered in
I'll use the search engine
(We've got much to discuss)
Too much to discuss over a bucket of balls
I can recall the glow of your low beams
It's the big night in Tinsel City
Life became a spectator sport
I launch my fragrance called 'Integrity'
I sell the fact that I can't be bought
Have I told you all about the time that I got sucked into a hole
Through a handheld device?
Since the last time you tried
I've recognised the glow of your low beams numerous times
I'll be by the Batphone if you need to get ahold
Panoramic windows looking out across your soul
You might also like
You go in through the door
Vengeance Trilogy wallpaper walls
They have re-decorated it all
They've changed all the lights and the bar's down the side
I've recognised the glow of your low beams numerous times
Through fairly opaque blinds in the sitting room
I'll be in a nose dive in my flying shoes
Right behind your closed eyes like a memory from your youth
I'll be by the Batphone if you need to get a hold
You've made yourself quite the bed to lie in
Do your time travelling through the tanning booth
So you don’t let the sun catch you crying
My teeth are beating and my knees are weak
It's as if there’s something up with the wiring
You can poke your head behind the mountain peak
Don't have to mean that you've gone into hiding
I'm watching your every move
I feel the tears are coming on
It won't be long
It won't be long
Straight from the cover shoot
Still a trace of body paint
On your legs and on your arms and on your face
And I'm keeping on my costume
And calling it a writing tool
And if you’re thinking of me
I’m probably thinking of you

There's still a trace of body paint
On your legs and on your arms and on your face
Yeah
So kind of you to bless us with your effortlessness
We're grateful and so strangely comforted
And I wonder  are you putting us under?
'Cause we can't take our eyes off the t-shirt and ties combination
Some want to kiss  some want to kick you
There's not a net you couldn't slip through
Or at least that's the impression I get  'cause you're smooth and you're wet
And she's not aware yet  but she's yours
I imagine that it's there on a plate  your whole rendezvous rate
Means that you'll never be frightened to make 'em wait for a while
I doubt it's your style not to get what you set out to acquire
The eyes are on fire  you are the unforecasted storm
(Brian) Calm  collected and commanding
(Top marks for not trying) You leave the other story standing
With your renditions and jokes  bet there's hundreds of blokes
That have wept 'cause you've stolen their thunder
Are you putting us under?
'Cause we can't take our eyes off the t-shirt and ties combination
But it was only a look-a-like
She was nothing but a vision trick
Under the warning light
But my chances turned to toast
When I asked her if I could call her your name
I thought I saw you in the Rusty Hook
Huddled up in a wicker chair
I wandered over for a closer look
And kissed whoever was sitting there
'Til I asked awfully politely
And I elongated my lift home
I smelt your scent on the seatbelt
And kept my shortcuts to myself
I thought I saw you in the Parrot's Beak
Messing with the smoke alarm
It was too loud for me to hear her speak
And she had a broken arm
And she wrote it out in Letraset

I'm worried I'll forget your face
And I've asked everyone
I'm beginning to think I imagined you all along
I elongated my lift home
I smelt your scent on the seatbelt
And kept my shortcuts to myself
I saw your sister in the Cornerstone
On the phone to the middle man
When I saw that she was on her own
I thought she might understand
You were practicing a magic trick
And my thoughts got rude as you talked and chewed
On the last of your pick and mix
That I haven't been called cold before
As you bit into your strawberry lace
And then offered me your attention in the form of a gobstopper
It's all you had left and it was going to waste
Your pastimes consisted of the strange
And twisted and deranged
And I love that little game you had called Crying Lightning
And how you'd like to aggravate the ice-cream man
On rainy afternoons
The next time that I caught my own reflection
It was on its way to meet you
Thinking of excuses to postpone
You never looked like yourself from the side
But your profile could not hide
The fact you knew I was approaching your throne
With folded arms you occupied the bench like toothache
Stood and puffed your chest out like you'd never lost a war
And though I tried so not to suffer the indignity of reaction
There was no cracks to grasp or gaps to claw

And your pastimes consisted of the strange

And I hate that little game you had called Crying Lightning
And how you'd like to aggravate the icky man on rainy afternoons

And I hate that little game you had called
Your pastimes consisted of the strange
And twisted and deranged
Do you ever get that fear that you can't shift the type
That sticks around like summat in your teeth?
Are there some aces up your sleeve?
Have you no idea that you're in deep?
I've dreamt about you nearly every night this week
How many secrets can you keep?
'Cause there's this tune I found
That makes me think of you somehow an' I play it on repeat
(Do I wanna know?) If this feelin' flows both ways?
(Sad to see you go) Was sorta hopin' that you'd stay
For sayin' things that you can't say tomorrow day
Crawlin' back to you
Ever thought of callin' when
You've had a few?
'Cause I always do
Maybe I'm too
Busy bein' yours
To fall for somebody new
Crawlin' back to you
You might also like
So have you got the guts?
Been wonderin' if your heart's still open
It's just I'm constantly on the cusp of tryin' to kiss you
But I don't know if you feel the same as I do
But we could be together if you wanted to
(Do I wanna know?) If this feelin' flows both ways?
(Sad to see you go) Was sorta hopin' that you'd stay
For sayin' things that you can't say tomorrow day
Crawlin' back to you (Crawlin' back to you)
Ever thought of callin' when
You've had a few? (Had a few)
'Cause I always do ('Cause I always do)
Maybe I'm too (Maybe I'm too busy)
Busy bein' yours (Bein' yours)
To fall for somebody new
Crawlin' back to you
(Do I wanna know?) If this feelin' flows both ways?
(Sad to see you go) Was sorta hopin' that you'd stay
For sayin' things that you can't say tomorrow day
(Do I wanna know?) Too busy bein' yours to fall
When there was tears on the steering wheel dripping on the seat
Several hours or several weeks
I'd have the cheek to say they're equally as bleak
It's the beginning of the end
The car went up the hill and disappeared around the bend
Ask anyone  they'll tell you that it's these times that it tends
And do me a favour and break my nose
Or do me a favour and tell me to go away
Or do me a favour and stop asking questions
And the eyes were all red  you could see that we'd cried
And I watched and I waited till she was inside
Forcing a smile and waving goodbye
Curiosity becomes a heavy load
Too heavy to hold  too heavy to hold
Curiosity becomes a heavy load
Too heavy to hold  will force you to be cold

Do me a favour and ask if you need some help
She said  Do me a favour and stop flattering yourself
And to tear apart the ties that bind
Perhaps fuck off might be too kind
Echo through the room
More point to a wedding disco
Without a bride or groom
With their trilbies and their glasses of white wine
And all the weekend rockstars are in the toilets
Practicing their lines
Fake tales of San Francisco
Echo through the air
Wishin' they weren't there
The band were fuckin' wank and I'm not havin' a nice time

There's this image of you and I
And it goes dancing by
In the morning and in the night time
There's all these secrets that I can't keep
Like in my heart there's that hotel suite
And you lived there so long
It's kind of strange now you're gone
I'm not sure if I should show you what I've found
Isn't it hard to make up your mind
When you're losing and your fuse is fireside?
There's all those places we used to go
And I suspect you already know
But that place on memory lane you like still looks the same
But something about it's changed
I'm not sure if I should show you what I've found
Isn't it hard to make up your mind
When you're losing and your fuse is fireside?
You might also like
And I thought I was yours forever
Or maybe I was mistaken
But I just cannot manage to make it through the day
Without thinking of you lately
I'm not sure if I should show you what I've found
Isn't it hard to make up your mind
Now you only get it in your night dress
Discarded all the naughty nights for niceness
Landed in a very common crisis
Everything's in order in a black hole
Nothing seems as pretty as the past though
That Bloody Mary's lacking in Tabasco
Remember when you used to be a rascal?
The best you ever had is just a memory and those dreams
Flicking through a little book of sex tips
Remember when the boys were all electric?
Now when she's told she's gonna get it
I'm guessing that she'd rather just forget it
Clinging till I'm getting sentimental
Said she wasn't going but she went still
Likes her gentlemen not to be gentle
Was it a Mecca dauber or a betting pencil?

Come on in  the water's lovely
Look  you could meet someone you like
During the meteor strike  it is that easy
Lunar surface on a Saturday night  dressed up in silver and white
With coloured Old Grey Whistle Test lights
Take it easy for a little while
Come and stay with us  it’s such an easy flight
Cute new places keep on popping up
Since the exodus  it's all getting gentrified
I put a taqueria on the roof  it was well reviewed
Four stars out of five
And that's unheard of
Mr. Bridge and Tunnel on the Starlight Express
The head of special effects in my mind’s eye
Hokey Cokey with the opposite sex
The things you try to forget  doesn't time fly?
I'm in no position to give advice  I don't want to be nice
And you know that
Take it easy for a little while
Come and stay with us  it's such an easy flight
Cute new places keep on popping up
Around Clavius  it's all getting gentrified
The Information-Action Ratio is the place to go
And you will not recognise the old headquarters

Take it easy for a little while (Take it easy for a little while)
Come and stay with us  it's such an easy flight
Cute new places keep on popping up

And one of 'em's alright  the other one's a scary'un
His way or no way  totalitarian
He's got no time for you looking or breathin'
How he don't want you to  so step out the queue
He makes examples of you  and there's nowt you can say
Behind they go through to the bit where you pay
And you realise then that it's finally the time
To walk back past ten-thousand eyes in the line
And you can swap jumpers and make another move
Instilled in your brain you've got somethin' to prove
To all the smirkin' faces and the boys in black
Why can't they be pleasant? Why can't they have a laugh?
He's got his hand in your chest  he wants to give you a duff
Well  secretly I think they want you all to kick off
They want arms flying everywhere and bottles as well
I said a thousand million things that I could never say this mornin'
Got too deep  but how deep is too deep?
Well  this town's a different town today
Said  this town's a different town to what it was last night
You couldn't have done that on a Sunday
And that girl's a different girl today
Said  that girl's a different girl to her you kissed last night
You couldn'ta done that on a Sunday
Of course not

Da-da  da-da-da
Subcommittee sang to me in its scary voice
You slowly dropped your eyelids
And in response to what you whispered in my ear
The leader of the free world
Reminds you of a wrestler wearing tight golden trunks
He's got him sen a theme tune
They play it for him as he makes his way to the ring
And in response to what you whispered in my ear
In the daytime
Bendable figures with a fresh new pack of lies
Summat else to publicise

And your shoulders are frozen (Cold as the night)
I bet that you look good on the dancefloor
I don't know if you're lookin' for romance or
I don't know what you're lookin' for
Dancin' to electro-pop like a robot from 1984
I wish you'd stop ignorin' me
Because it's sending me to despair

Montagues or Capulets
Just banging tunes and DJ sets and
Dirty dancefloors and dreams of naughtiness
I don't know if you're lookin' for romance or
I don't know what you're lookin' for
Dancin' to electro-pop like a robot from 1984
Breathin' in your dust
I wanna be your Ford Cortina
I will never rust
If you like your coffee hot
Let me be your coffee pot
I just wanna be yours
Secrets I have held in my heart
Are harder to hide than I thought
Maybe I just wanna be yours

Mind games  mistakes
My sweet fireball
My sweet rigmarole
I want it all
I want it all
Old dogs  new tricks
Can you feel it?
Space age country girl
Stone cold miracle
I want it all
I want it all
And then suddenly it hit me  it's a year ago
Since I drank miniature whiskey and we shared your Coke
Said  ain't it just like you to kiss me and then hit the road?
Leave me listening to the Stones' 2000 Light Years from Home

And you're kissin' to cut through the gloom
With a cough drop coloured tongue
And you were sittin' in the corner with the coats all piled high
And I thought you might be mine
In a small world on an exceptionally rainy Tuesday night
In the right place and time
When the zeros line up on the 24-hour clock
When you know who's callin' even though the number is blocked
When you walked around your house wearin' my sky blue Lacoste
And your knee socks
I got a feelin' I might have lit the very fuse
That you were tryin' not to light
You were a stranger in my phonebook I was actin' like I knew
'Cause I had nothin' to lose
When the winter's in full swing and your dreams just aren't comin' true
Ain't it funny what you'll do?

Never stopped you lettin' me get hold of the sweet spot
By the scruff of your knee socks
You and me could have been a team
Each had a half of a king and queen seat
Like the beginning of Mean Streets
You could be my baby (Could be my baby)
You and me could have been a team
Each had a half of a king and queen suite

You could be my baby (Could be my baby)
All the zeros lined up
You and me could have been a team
Each had a half of a king and queen suite
Like the beginning of Mean Streets
You could be my baby (Could be my baby)
But the number's blocked
You and me could have been a team
Each had a half of a king and queen suite
When you've come undone
Like the beginning of Mean Streets
You could be my baby (Could be my baby)
When the zeros line up on the 24-hour clock
When you know who's callin' even though the number is blocked
When you walked around your house wearin' my sky blue Lacoste

Knee socks
 have you started feeling old yet?
 I'm sure that you're still breaking hearts
 it gets easier
Make you feel alright
They bring you back to life
Mad sounds in your ears
Love buckles under the strain
Of those wild nights
Run but you cannot hide
Mad sounds in your ears
All night long they reappear

Remember cuddles in the kitchen  yeah  to get things off the ground

Ah  but it's right hard to remember that on a day like today
When you're all argumentative  and you've got the face on
Well  now then mardy bum
Oh  I'm in trouble again  aren't I? I thought as much
'Cause you turned over there
Pullin' that silent disappointment face  the one that I can't bear

When you're all
I can't hold down the urgency
You've got to make your descent slowly
And oil up those sticky keys
Coax me out my low
And have a spin of my propeller
It's a necessary evil
No cause for emergency
Borrowed the beak off a bald eagle
Oh  momentary synergy
Coax me out my low
Sink into tomorrow
Coax me out my low
And have a spin of my propeller
My propeller won't spin
And I can't get it started on my own
When are you arriving?
Oh  my propeller won't spin
And I can't get it started on my own
When are you arriving?
Oh  my propeller won't spin
And I can't get it started on my own
When are you arriving?
So you're on the prowl wondering whether
She left already or not
Leather jacket  collar popped like antenna
Never knowin' when to stop
Sunglasses indoors
Par for the course
Lights in the floors and sweat on the walls
Cages and poles
Call off the search for your soul
Or put it on hold again
She's having a sly indoor smoke
And she calls the folks who run this  her oldest friends
Sippin' her drink and laughin' at imaginary jokes
As all the signals are sent  her eyes invite you to approach
And it seems as though those lumps in your throat
That you just swallowed have got you going
Come on  come on  come on
Come on  come on  come on

Knowing full well that I know
May suggest there's somewhere from which I might know her

To do me no good
And you look like you could

Quite the little escapologist
Looked so miffed when you wished
For a thousand places better than this
You are the fugitive but you don't know what you're running from
You can't kid us and you couldn't trick anyone
Who wants to sleep in a city that never wakes up?
Blinded by nostalgia
Who wants to sleep in a city that never wakes up?
She was enraged by the way
That the emperors were trapped in the cage
And the days she deemed dull
Leading to nights reading beer bottles
You're such a fugitive but you don't know what you're running from

One for the road  ooh ooh
From the bottom of your heart
The relegation zone
I saw this comin' from the start
The shake  rattle and roll
The cracks in blackout blinds
Cast patterns on the ceiling
But you're feeling fine
I thought it was dark outside

One for the road
So we all go back to yours
And you sit and talk to me on the floor
There's no need to show me 'round  baby
I feel like I've been here before
I've been wonderin' whether later
When you tell everybody to go
Will you pour me one for the road?
I knew this would be on the cards
I knew you wouldn't fold

The mixture hits you hard
Don't get that sinking feeling  don't fall apart
Some out of tune guitar
Soundtrack to disaster

Back there by the baby grand
Did Mr. Winter Wonderland
I swim with the economists
And I get to the bottom of it for good
By the time reality hits
The chimes of freedom fell to bits
The shining city on the fritz
And you cry some of the hottest tears you ever cried
Multiplied by five

This stunning documentary
That no one else unfortunately saw
Such beautiful photography
It's worth it for the opening scene
I've been driving 'round listening to the score
Or maybe I just imagined it all
I've played to quiet rooms like this before
That it was a heart that he was stealing
Oh  he was ready to impress and the fierce excitement
The eyes are bright  he couldn't wait to get away
And I bet that Juliet was just the icing on the cake
Make no mistake  no
And even if somehow we could have
Shown you the place you wanted
Well  I'm sure you could have
Made it that bit better on your own
And I bet she told a million people that she'd stay in touch
But all the little promises  they don't mean much
When there's memories to be made
And I hope you're holding hands by New Year's Eve
They made it far too easy to believe
That true romance can't be achieved these days
And even if somehow they could have
Shown you the place you wanted
Well  I'm sure you could have
Made it that bit better on your own
And did a swap for the sand in an hourglass
You look like you've been for breakfast at the heartbreak hotel
And sat in the back booth by the pamphlets
And the literature on how to lose
Your waitress was miserable and so was your food
If you're gonna try and walk on water
Make sure you wear your comfortable shoes
Mysteries flashing amber go green when you answer
But the red on the rest of the questionnaire never changes
I heard the news that you're planning
To shoot me out of a cannon
You look like you've been for breakfast at the heartbreak hotel
And sat in the back booth by the pamphlets
And the literature on how to lose
Your waitress was miserable and so was your food
If you're gonna try and walk on water
Make sure you wear your comfortable shoes

Blank canvasses leant against gallery walls
Flowing towards sculptures of Anything Goes
On the marble stairs
Is that vague sense of longing kinda trying to cause a scene?
Guess I'm talking to you now
Puncturing your bubble of relatability
With your horrible new sound
When you said 'em out loud
Blank canvasses leant against gallery walls
Flowing towards sculptures of Anything Goes
On the marble stairs
Leading to almost wherever you want them to

Village coffee mornings with not long since retired spies
And help me to get untied

That you would rather be beside than in front of
But she's never been the kind to be hollowed by the stares
She swam out of tonight's phantasm
Grabbed my hand and made it very clear
There's absolutely nothing for us here
It's a magnolia celebration to be attended on a Wednesday night
It's better that than get a reputation as a miserable little tyke
At least that's the conclusion she came to in this overture
And the secret door swings behind us
Her arms were folded most indignant
Not looking like she was soon to leave
I had to squint in order to believe
Then like a butler pushing on a bookshelf
And unveiling the unexpected
Was suddenly embarrassed and corrected
How could such a creature survive in such a habitat?

Miles away from any half-useful imaginary highway
But golden boy's in bad shape

Everybody's on a barge
Floating down the endless stream of great TV

Staring at the television screen
They've sped up to the point where they provoke
You to tell the fucking punchline before you have told the joke

And it's the thousandth time that it's even bolder

They're all infected but he'll be alright

Although you're trying not to listen
Avert your eyes and starin' at the ground
She makes a subtle proposition
