"Ayy
I lost my mommy and my granny in the same month (What?)
A bunch of bitches talking down 'cause I’m coming up
I know some people in my own city hating on me (Damn)
I'm the only child  I never wanted to be in no clique
A born leader  I ain't never want to be like a bitch
I been a freak  so I keep a nigga sucking my clit
It's a difference in the bitch who rap and the bitch who rap for real
Bitch  you know your favorite rapper could never keep up with Megan
Bitch  we ain’t equal
Y’all fucking on the same niggas  pussy in the sequel
Disrespect me and this shit gon' get lethal
Booty club  who gon' show that pussy? This a free check
Throw that ass on me and my nigga get a free check
And I ain't hiding  but I can't let you know where I be at
’Cause it's gon' be the gossip of the city if they peep that
My secrets  keep that

I ain't gon' argue with no ho who just a fan of me (A fan)
You taking shots at a bitch that'll never care (Bah-bah-bah)
How it's on sight and I don't never see you nowhere? (Bitch)
Let him eat me out and still put him in the friend zone (Ah  ah)
Bitches wanna hang when they know they really hate me
I'm still winning even if you don't congratulate me
Stick the whole clip up in your throat and make you feel pussy
And since the nigga think he made me  tell him do it again
Bitch  we ain't equal
Y'all fucking on the same niggas  pussy in the sequel
Disrespect me and this shit gon' get lethal
Booty club  who gon' show that pussy? This a free check
Throw that ass on me and my nigga get a free check
And I ain't hiding  but I can't let you know where I be at
'Cause it's gon' be the gossip of the city if they peep that
My secrets  keep that
Another bitch shining ain't gon' dim my light (Uh-uh)
Another bitch beef ain't gon' make me fight (Yeah)
I never been a fan of competitive shit
'Cause I'm still a winner up against whoever it is (Ah)
Hoes showing fake love when they really hate to see it
Niggas tryna get some fame off my name  that's a shame
Real Hot Girl shit
Still the same bitch
Let me just take a second (Go Grizz)
Just got a lot to get off my chest (Haha)
People call me rude 'cause I ain't lettin' 'em try me
Sayin' I'm a ho 'cause I'm in love with my body
They keep sayin' I should get help
But I don't even know what I need
They keep sayin' speak your truth
Excuse me while I get into my feelings for a second
Not that anybody gives a fuck anyway
But everybody talkin' shit probably sucks anyway
Y'all don't even know how I feel
I don't even know how I deal
Today I really hate everybody
Bad bitches have bad days too
How a bad bitch always do
All I really wanna hear is it'll be okay
Bounce back 'cause a bad bitch can have bad days
All I really wanna hear is it'll be okay

I'm really thinkin' 'bout dialin' 9-1-1 'til I freak
'Cause they probably won't think it's that deep
I can't even handle smokin' weed
