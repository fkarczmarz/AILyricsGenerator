" BWA

 Gutta and Boobie ain't gon' stop unloading
 say they know 100it gang
 it's marijuana time
 I'm leanin right now

 say they know 100it gang
 it's marijuana time
 I'm leanin right now

 nigga main line wanna fuck with Luca Brasi
 juicier than sushi with no avocado
 like drinking chocolate martini moscatto
 lick it off her nipples in love what I got her
 but what's it to you? On twitter they follow
 one for the plug and one for the load
 one for the bitches and one for the dough
 I'm ring-ring-ringin'
 I'm ring-ring-ringin'
 one for the plug and one for the load
 one for the bitches and one for the dough
 I'm ring-ring-ringin'
 I'm ring-ring-ringin'
 how you choose to bother
 I don't feel like talkin'
 he say it's all the way retarded
 I just finished up a new performance
 wish you well
 one for the plug and one for the load
 one for the bitches and one for the dough
 I'm ring-ring-ringin'
 I'm ring-ring-ringin'
 one for the plug and one for the load
 one for the bitches and one for the dough
 I'm ring-ring-ringin'
 I'm ring-ring-ringin'
 one of my lil friends
 nowhere by a gym
 I just got it in
 none of your concern
 goin' out of biz
 gotta feed the kids
 you know what it is
 put that on the wrist
 one for the plug and one for the load
 one for the bitches and one for the dough
 I'm ring-ring-ringin'
 I'm ring-ring-ringin'
 one for the plug and one for the load
 one for the bitches and one for the dough
 I'm ring-ring-ringin'
 I'm ring-ring-ringin'
 she know I'm her bodyguard

 I'ma put you in the water
 one for the plug and one for the load
 one for the bitches and one for the dough
 I'm ring-ring-ringin'
 I'm ring-ring-ringin'
 one for the plug and one for the load
 one for the bitches and one for the dough
 I'm ring-ring-ringin'

VOICE: What up nig?
KG: What up nigga?
V: What you getting into?
V: Alright nigga
KG: Alright love you boy
V: Love you too nigga
KG: Alright. Keep all that!
(What you get into this weekend?)
Where was you when I was slumped over?
Gums hurting from a old bullet
In front the toilet while hunched over
Well at that time we were close friends
They say I killed him in cold blood
We wrestled for the gun but the gun went off

And your children are somewhere on the corner
6:00 AM water boiling
Think I'm addicted to the strong aroma
You know Flavar Lloyde lil' sister
She stole a Jag for to come and get me
Brandy fucking my nigga Ray
Know that didn't have shit to do with this
I was just stating the facts though
She bend over in front me from the back while I'm pounding
No regrets for the shit I did  that also mean for the niggas I killed!
And your children are somewhere on the corner
 that don't mean nothin'
 it make me know it's real
 you know I will
 now I got her face down
 she don't like to make sounds
 put her on the Greyhound
 sometimes you be so demandin'
 difficult but we manage
 caused emotional damage
 it make me know it's real
 you know I will
 you just gotta stay down
 say she just made it in town
 got some things to figure out
 I'm down on bended knees listenin' to The Weeknd
 it make me know it's real
 you know I will
 all night  all night
 just sold it all (Take it  cook it soft)
 ya heard me?
 just sold it all
 I'm a big gangsta  I turn her out with that foreign love
 a hunnid of 'em  just sold it all
 diamonds on when I'm talkin' love
 but I'm afraid to fall in love
 I only get excited when the pack touch down
 I'm a big gangsta  I turn her out with that foreign love
 a hunnid of 'em  just sold it all
 lil' nigga  you knowin' that I'ma do right with it
 they snortin' that tartar  I got 'em surrounded by white women
 I think my plug racist (Why is that?)
 put us a mattress in it
 I was tryna keep up with a image and still had to stack and get it
 next mornin' on Monday  I had to go back to prison
 I put it in throttle and got a new pack delivered
 she want a new body
 showin' no sympathy
 I did it for Mazi
 I went and tatted the face of a snake on the back of my kidney
 I give any man a chance ya heard me
 that fall back game in full effect
 you can leave your gun in the car  dick
 I'ma speak for him
 I'm a big gangsta  I turn her out with that foreign love
 a hunnid of 'em  just sold it all
 diamonds on when I'm talkin' love
 but I'm afraid to fall in love
 I only get excited when the pack touch down
 I'm a big gangsta  I turn her out with that foreign love
 a hunnid of 'em  just sold it all
 they takin' it out on me
 for real
 considered this taste for knowin' what foolish is
 I was movin' pills
 ain't asking a nigga for nothin'
 for real
 attemptin' to limit consumption of drinkin'  I'm through with this
 I got fat  I done grew some tits
 laser removing the crucifix
 I shot to Laredo to do it big
 boomin' knicks
 two for six
 I'm too legit
 two to six  scrapin' the dish
 that's goofy shit
 shawty petite and her booty big
 I deliver the fungus up under the trunk of the Honda Civic
 this bitch tried to bite me  he didn't want me to fuck her with 'em
 damn)
 I'm a big gangsta  I turn her out with that foreign love
 a hunnid of 'em  just sold it all
 diamonds on when I'm talkin' love
 but I'm afraid to fall in love
 I only get excited when the pack touch down
 I'm a big gangsta  I turn her out with that foreign love
And I pray the Lord take it all away
W-W-W-W-Winner's Circle
And pray it all away
We all the way
She get on her knees and look up at a star
Wonder why these niggas hate me?
Probably 'cause they know they ain't me
Throwin' shit and piss on all the staff members

Got some real niggas and we into sharin'

Mickie D's we was purchasin' salads
Jerk Villa curry chicken and cabbage
It ain't nothin' to fuck yo bitch dog
Starin' at me like the damsel in distress
Acapulco diamonds and they dancin' on my neck
Flawless no inclusions we don't fuck with VVS
Fall off in the club and its cardiac arrest
Her cardiac arrest
Maliyah dancin' to my song
I'm a plug who make music I'm like Tego Calderon
Still I'm bout that gangsta' shit so please don't rub me wrong
I need to see you naked with no clothes when I get home
Slighty narcissistic bae so please don't read me wrong
Bitch I'mma killer
Left the ho at the hotel
Whipped up at the gas station bought a box of Goodies and a digit
Need sixty dollars on pump four cause the gas tank like empty
Told her I'm sorry she say she forgive me
Entangled in my conversation as if I'm a Judas she look at me different
Would we get in trouble for fucking each other cause I use to fuck with your sister
I heard that your pussy get wet as a river and possibly need some assistance

Know it’s a name but don't know what to call it
My name is Kevin but she call me awesome
South by Southwest was performing in Austin
Ignored the BS and I ain't bout no talkin'
Don't make me spray this bitch like Madd Marvin
(Bitch what you ain’t hear me?) Bitch don’t make me spray this bitch like Mad Marvin
May God be with your families while you rest up in the skies
Shout out Roy and Ryan nigga’ dipping through that nine
I'm loving on Lil NaNa I met her at a Second Line
Drika booty bigger than a bitch I grip her from behind
And can we have a threesome I know that she don't mind
Know it's warmer than a sauna stroke her for a long time
Bae told the bitch to get here
Then she got off in the bitch ear
We a power couple don't trip
We a power couple that trick
Bread Winner escort service we'll buy bitch a new whip
Broke hoes car break down can't afford to get the bitch fixed
Fake bags in a air mattress can't afford to get the shit fixed
Thought I was sleep when you went in my pocket
Bitch I caught ya' (Oh my God!)
Don't make me spray this bitch like Madd Marvin
I don't get tired
 yeah?

You know everyday you grow  everyday you changin'
And I never tried to change on you but it's just like
I had to do it by myself for so long to where when you come back into my life it just don't feel right like
Feel like somethin's missin'
And you feel like - you just feel different
So you gotta forgive me if I act strange wit'chu
Never changed wit'chu
This is a burden that none of us want
The judge broke us up when I went back to court
Sentenced the time and it tore us apart
Beautiful creature and I know what you are
Prayed no one else get control of your heart
I hold it down  I was built for this part
Been away too long
I no longer know who you are
But I'll find you again  I'll find you again  love
I'll find you again  I'll find you again  love
I'll find you again  I'll find you again
I'll find you again  love  I'll find you again
All I knew was run it up and try to stack  stay focused
One day you be up to bat and I'm on it
Fingernails  tryna scrape
With the safety pin break it down to crack  whoever want it
Movin' reckless wit' the Gat  I protect the pack
I be stayin' strapped  niggas tryna jack  bitches tryna trap
Maybe it's perhaps  I be in the trap
Fall in the pen  I dive in your shit
I'm one in a million  I'm standin' on ten
Hit your bitch from the back  I supply her with dick
She was a virgin when she was with him
Showed her somethin'  fuck everyone else
I can't give you the world but I give you myself
If you was loyal put my love on the shelf
You are now just a notch on the belt
Guess I'll find someone else but I ain't got time for no one else
Grind hard  Glendale bein' chauffeured
Panoramic roof  in here we smokin'
Legal pistol anybody approachin' (boom!)
In your name in case we get pulled over (woo  woo)

We was all utterly rejected
We went from nothin' to somethin' together
People like what the fuck you see in her?
To you they like what the fuck you see in him?
Why you love him? You shouldn't trust him
He's a fuck up  so disgustin' and your family's sayin' fuck me
I'm successful and now they love me
Marble Slab  our first kiss
Recollectin' the night that you told me you need me
Told Tyra  Baby  gimme the keys
Put a dick on my hip on the highway  I'm speedin'
Just had a argument  you was too busy
I would get upset whenever you would leave me (don't leave me)
Joe changed form  got 'em tatted on my arm
Felt so alone and it wasn't easy
Late nights  grandmother's house
Talkin' takin' over the world together
Helped me through my insecurities
Sayin' you was gonna be my world forever
I comforted you through the death of our child
Had our first girl together
Our love is a fire inside and it's gon' burn forever
This is a burden that none of us want

Sentenced the time and it tore us apart

Momma pray for me my friends fake I need a hundred steppers
They hate the flick of my wrist

I told her I was a beautician whip out the scissors get rid of split ends
I'm full of myself bae I'm trippin'
Feel like I'm Brady whatever it is
Look who just sat at the table make yo ho go fetch him a plate
Then I pull up in the Porsche bet whoever willin' to race
Charges dismissed by the feds
Still gotta deal with the state
Whoop em I got plenty kush and you pussy
Pick 12 or somebody gon' lay in yo bushes
Two time convicted a stitch for the fully
Jump out I'm feeling no need for the hoodie
Streets love a nigga who really a gangsta
Go check my jacket you know I'ma pull it
Ar-Ab hit the line I'm like what's the business
Just find the lean I'ma sip it I don't trust no bitches
Look at the flick of that wrist
Video from the back how I'm killin' ya bitch
Lovin' my swag MC Hammer
Want to quit but I'm just 2 legit
Baltimore Oriole's hat Mr. Gates
Corner to corner they flooded with H
Hit the corner sto' backwoods and antropo
Money order 2 stamps and a envelope
Jumpin' and dodgin' the fence like I'm Mario
Camera belt buckle these rats catchin' audio
Runnin' the money up workin' no cardio
Left out of Boston and visited Denver
We had a threesome but we don't remember
Res from the grigy still stuck to my fingertips
Twistin' the stink stimulated my mental
SLS 550 matching interior while at the red light I stay lookin' serious
Want to question me I don't know nothing 'bout shit in kentucky I'm dealin' with Benjamin
Elephant whippin' the trunk in the front
But I still cannot figure out where the ignition is
While at the airport I'm being surrounded
I'm thinkin of flyin in private
All in the bathroom with my flight attendant
Ho why is yo hand in my privates?
On IG I talk I be lively
In public I'm movin' in silence
Penitentiary rules in effect
Give respect if I don't get it back I get violent
Carol City straight drop got em wildin'
Me June and Boola and Poo out our body
Oughta see my new bitch she exotic
Wasn't talkin bout you ho be quiet
Silver shadow Jaber reversible stock my new girl
I keep her right on side of me
Back to jail while suspected of robbery
Jumpin' bond I won't sign out my property
You think Brasi got bodies well probably
Dive in the crowd he a gangsta so possibly
Watch the rappers few bitch niggas knockin' me cuz
They bird and they chickens want flock to me
All in New York be with Maino and Capo
I rode by myself and ain't nobody stoppin' me
Ain't no more real niggas
I'm who Jay-Z and Kanye like to listen to honestly
They probably won't tell you that honestly
Super polite got a record that follow me
Tommy Hilfiger vest with the Guess denim jeans
Kango cap on ya top with the wallabees
Johnny Blaze she can sing like Rihanna but ratted on dude
It took everything out of me
Amber Rose had messed up with my nigga
When I get the rip I expect her to lie to me
Soldier sign in the middle of my forehead
A broke motherfucka who hatin don't bother me!

I was born a prince
The supreme council had advised against this
But I was in love  and I followed my heart
No getting used to living a human life (Uh-uh)
My skin glow in the dark  it's only safe for me to move at night
Sometimes my eyes turn black while in the pale moonlight (I got you)
I'm your guardian angel (Who?)  and it translates into Kevin (Kevin)
It hurt my heart to see you hurt  in desperate need of affection
Gave up my wings and fell in love  was 'posed to be your protector
Love somebody else  you broke my heart and it's just not getting better
The angels telling me that God won't let me back into Heaven
Bae  I'm tired of playing games with you
I know inside  you feel the same way I do
We the reciprocal of one another  come from the same star
We got the same moles under our nose and we got the same scars
Great pretenders  we on the Instagram actin' like we not involved
Back against the wall  what do you hold onto?
I know it's something that we all go through
Just aim for yours
When it rains  it pours
I'll learn how to fly again
I'll learn how to fly again
I'll learn how to fly again
I'll learn how to fly again

Your majesty
The royal court's decision is respected and it's entirely part of Breadwinner world court and executive style
But we both know our exercise of passionate speech by fluctuation of tone and pitch
May have aroused unwanted recollections of negative occurrences
But no harm would've ever come to one possessing royal blood from dying on hand
Only he that draws his sword shall be met with brute force
If you would've decreed that matter saying we were cleared for departure
I would've threw it all away and accepted whatever ridicule or consequence behind my actions
For I believe in our love
And one day maybe in this eternity or another
You'll see yourself for what I know you to be
A queen
If you ever need me for anything  this line never changes
Such is my love for you
For you are me  and I am you
I'm in love with you
The short moments we shared will forever be appreciated
I never withheld anything from you because my heart rests securely with you
I know you'd never do me a bitch ass thing
My heart will forever hurt to be in your arms
But at least we both know I'm willing to die for my beliefs
'Cause I've died for you before
And regret it not
For I did it all for the glory of love
In closing
I remain the same  I come as I leave
We just both good at pretending
I love you forever

Stack it to the ceilin'  do what you 'posed to do
Watch everybody that you keepin' close to you
Fuck over you bad and won't nobody notice
My heart kept the razor  ain't nothin' disposable
Gave it my all  went to war  I've been scarred
Dealt with a broad and she played with my heart
Played on by friends  not protectin' my cards
They would all say they was playin' their part
Came from the bottom  we aim for the stars
Won't shoot in the air  that's like playin' with God
Bitch  what up?

 ignorin' wrong and the right

 starin' right in the eyes
 what the fuck you want my heart for?
 what the fuck you want my heart for?
I want them dead presidents
Learn from every time you ever fail
If it never fail just grind smarter
On they hindquarters and they all acting
Kill me and get a call after
Made men believe what they didn't believe
Aim and I shoot for the stars
At the awards I ain't win no awards

We get road side assistance when we placing orders
Wrap the money up and then we send it 'cross the water
I'm fucking with the plug daughter
I'm fucking with the plug daughter
And if I ever leave her they gon' kill my family
In the middle of the kitchen
Water-whipping me a chicken
Breakin' down a brick on a island
Granite counter top with Italian marble
Duct tape and a box cutter
When I cop somethin
(Swear to God I cook the bitch and don't jump man
I ain't buying shit)
And legitimate dealings my name don't exist
Never flake: I get hit then I'm taking my lick
He know that this platinum he don't need no cash
Turn up in Phantoms and turn up in Jags
Ball in the mall and we leaving with bags
In love with Luca Brasi I got coke I'm in the mafia

Low key in a rental boo so please don't tell nobody
She just tapped her homegirl look girl there go Luca Brasi
I swear I'm out my body lord
This depression get the best of me
I'm in my thoughts I don't want to talk until tomorrow
The Luca comes out the day I'ma smile
All praise to Allah
I'm with my niggas Starlito I kill for you
My heart droppin' knowledge in interviews
My grandmother told me that someones gonna love me the others gonna try to get rid of you
Got a panoramic roof on my new Altima no Maserati
Low key in a rental boo so please don't tell nobody

This depression get the best of me
Fought with the pressure of deep depression while naked making confessions
Underneath the covers  colorin' in the dark
Gave LaToya my information and she ain't even call
Could it be women's intuition tellin' her I'm a dog?
Criminally involved  past-tense on my prior history dealing with the law
And this is no façade
Refrigerator in my chest just like Omarion
I got this icebox where my heart used to be (Excuse)
That's just a broken heart
Playing songs on my invisible guitar
Every night  I kiss your picture on the nightstand
Love's a battlefield  it's not a one-night stand
Alone  praying every day that I can stop thinking about you
But I would go to war with God for you  baby
I'd go to war with God for you  baby
I would go to war with God for you  baby
I'd go to war with God for you  baby
I would go to war with God
Every time we talk  it's like you end up getting aroused
Standin' while I'm sittin' down with my fingers under your blouse
Still looking you in the eye  you're looking back into mine
If I told you I was different  would you understand the difference?
Try to suppress the feelin' of this different way of livin'
Creatures of the night  we gon' be alright
In the twilight
Skin gleamin'  labeled a demon 'cause I can't even die
If I turn you into I
Your age would never age and forever be by my side
Spoke about the wisdom that entered into my thoughts
The will of the universe  including the Willendorf
This is art  I'm a God

Sometimes it's painful to relive the past
But sometimes you gotta relive the past in order to heal from it
I just told Richie we rich

I was young when my mama had me
Think I ran away from home 'bout the age of fifteen  juvenile detention
Talked about behind my back by my family members
H-hurtful feeling bein' the black sheep every family visit
Heart too big  I guess my loyalty got used against me
Learned to focus on myself  now I got tunnel vision
Kicked in my ass when I was down and went through hell to get back
Been to the group homes  I've been on lockdown and I've been upstate
Never spoke on this  they say that I murdered my best friend

Get 'em  Gates
I'm 'bout to clear my heart
Stand on the business and ain't ever fold
I got some uncles who killers (For real)
Who baggin' someone who ain't play by the code (Yeah)
My favorite rapper my cousin (Yeah)
I looked up to him ever since we was kids (For real)
Hope that he know that I love him
Guess all good things must come to an end
I know some industry niggas
And they never lived the way I lived
Sayin' I'm anti-social (What?)
I can't make you feel the way I feel (Uh-huh)
Head up high  got great ideas
'Cause I got blackballed and they scared of me
I'll die for you if I care for you
I'm a great friend  I'm just not a friend
And I'ma die for you if I care for you

I ain't tryna fall in love with you
See maybe he could love you different
But I'm just tryna fuck with you
And girl I'm tryna hit that pussy one time
One time one time will be cool
Wassup with it? Wassup with it?

Since the death of your lover you started fuckin' with busters
Affection showin' in public I love the kissin' you own it
Grip that ass bae I don't get tired

Hard to keep up with my lingo when I'm in the matrix
Exclusive word uses gets confusing but wait I'll explain it
Commitment-shy from past relationships I guess I'm tainted
I ain't ever changing

You posed to judge by what's on the inside
I ain't ever changing

A vision without action is merely a dream
In the car while roaming around
All my thoughts been roaming around
Where I come from like a hole in the ground
Silly me still holdin' it down
Every car pass by with the music on loud while bumpin' Roaming Around
Tellin' me to make a hit but I really don't get why they walked on Roaming Around
Out my window
I see everything I dream about and wish I had it (Retawdid  I'm retawdid)

Clock is ticking
Ain't' no time to kick it
Nothing comes from sleeping  but I’m dreaming on my true religion
Hustle  hustle  hustle
Gotta get it
On my true religion
Nothing comes from sleeping but a dream
(I'm 100it with it)

Did time I ain't ask for
Still sendin' mail through the hatch form
Different city within the city
More overcrowded than a ant farm
