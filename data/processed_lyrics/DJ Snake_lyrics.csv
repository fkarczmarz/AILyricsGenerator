"Look what I've been through
And now I'm out here  feel like my year
Got all my friends through
'Cause I want this life for life  for life
This life for life  for life
'Cause I want this life for life  for life
This life for life  for life
'Cause I want it for life
It's feeding all night
Look at my ride  look at my life
Waking the night
Dreamed of this life  I'll be so patient
Waited all night
You know now I'm flexing  I'm fucking these hoes
Rollie is finally Rolls
Touring the club and I'm killing these shows
And I'm stacking  I'm stacking these hoes
Bad bitch into my arm and she ain't never tell me no
I just hit the crib with a brand new bitch
They both gon' find that pole
'Cause they all down to go  they been kissin' on the low
They been sniffin' on that blow when I never trust a hoe
'Cause everybody wanna get paid  I ain't no free ride
If I come inside  it's the best day of her life and

Look what I've been through
And now I'm out here  feel like my year
Got all my friends through
'Cause I want this life for life  for life
This life for life  for life
'Cause I want this life for life  for life
This life for life  for life
'Cause I want it for life
The whole world mine (get it  get it)
Feel mad rich  never sold my soul
When I told my pops that I copped that Rove
And I told my mom to forget that stove
And to fuck that job cause I got that  that dough
Yeah  you know I got that money to blow
Yeah  you know that's how it goes
I puts it down (yeah)  I puts it down (whoo!)
I don't fuck around  I don't fuck around
Had no time for chillin' or sippin'  was rappin' and singin'
I came up on my own  now I got all that money callin' 'cause
I came from nothing  ain't that something?
Look what I've been through
And now I'm out here  feel like my year
Got all my friends through
'Cause I want this life for life  for life
This life for life  for life
'Cause I want this life for life  for life
This life for life  for life
 I'll lift you high
 it's no surprise

'Cause it's been a while since the summer began
Where did it go? Done in a flash
Something on my mind keeps on bringing me back
To us  back to us
'Cause I feel like someone else all by myself  all by myself
Pulling on my sweatshirt  looking at your picture
'Cause that broken summer's hanging over me
Drowning in the sunshine  and I spend a long time
Thinking girl  you got the best of me
Hopping on a flight  then make it back to Austin
Finding I get lost in all them Autumn leaves
I just walk around now  stranger in my hometown
Broken summer's hanging over me
Broken summer  broken summer
Broken summer  broken summer
Lover of mine  what would it take?
Could I walk the miles off of all our mistakes?
I'm getting tired  too far away
Though I keep on trying  it keeps taking me back
To us  back to us

My future looks brighter in your eyes (Your eyes  your eyes)

I'm lookin' forward  you're lookin' back
Help me pick out our next adventure on the map
Let's take it all in  let's catch a vibe
You give me feelings that I only reach when high
A little trouble in my heart  it makes you glad
You got me always  champagne and wine
But even when I sleep  somehow you rule my mind
Oh  lately

Tell me once more who's your love for?
What's your number when you're sober?
Clearly I'm not thinkin' clearly
Feels like time is movin' slower
And then the music pulls us closer
Oh when I start to think it over
I realize
You never call me when you're sober
You never call me when you're sober

Nearly Heaven when you're near me
We're addicted to this feeling
Feels like time is movin' slower

If the text ain't freaky  I don't wanna read it
He said he really wanna see me more

But I'm a boss bitch  who you gonna leave me for?
You hoes got no class  you bitches is broke still
I'm a whole rich bitch  and I work like I'm broke still
Why the love be so fake but the hate be so real? Uh

Give a little ooh-ooh  get it well done
Dancing on my ooh  make your girl wanna run
We keep moving 'til the sun come up

Blurring my vision
Seeing the same film again
Closer you pull me
Under the table
Sign of how this might end
But if you don't want to hold me
Maybe I can change your mind
And there's other ways to leave you
But I've only asked for you
As you move your body next to me
There's so much more to lose
All I wanted was your reckless heart
(Brr-ah)
