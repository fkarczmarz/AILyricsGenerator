lyrics
"The Lord and I've been friends for a mighty long time
Leaving Him has never ever really crossed my mind
Let me say just one thing
Belle
I'd like to take a little minute just to say now
Belle
The laughter of the sound has quieted down
The best thing we could do is have Him around
I think if love could abound
My heart was lost but now it's found
Seems so easy to me
To try to act naturally

I know that you can understand
A little country boy
Just a little country boy
Through many drunken country bars
He's my bright morning star
My bright in the morning
Belle
He's my joy in the morning time
Belle

(My everything)
My everything

In the evening
In the daytime
In the nighttime
(Little lady)
Hey! Hey!
Belle
What a beautiful time we had together
Now it's getting late and we must leave each other  yeah
Just remember the time we had
And how right I tried to be
It's all in a day's work
Call me
Losing your love  acting foolishly
Go on and take your time
'Cause you're only losing me
Love is a long ways from here
Tell you  it's all in the way you feel
If your love is real
Come to me
Call me  call me  call me
Come back home
The best thing I can do is give you your love
(Is give you your love  baby)
Let you go on your way
Feeling as free as a dove
And if you find you're a long ways from home
And somebody's doing you wrong
Just call on me baby
Come back home

Don't you ever go astray
Trust in God's word and believe it 'cause it'll never pass away
We will see Him in his glory riding on the clouds of joy
Greeting us with open arms and peace forevermore
I know that everything is gonna be alright
He's coming back
Like He said He would
He's coming back
For the true and good
Now when the sky is darkened
There will be no moonlight
We'll know the time has finally come
And He'll change the wrong to right
So if you're always searching
Trying to find the bottom line
Just give your love and life to God
He'll give you a peace of mind
I know that everything gonna be alright
He's coming back

That He'll return to take us home and fulfill the prophecy
I know that everything is gonna be alright
I know He's coming back just like He said he would
Peace and love and happiness
I know He's coming back for the true and good
Everything gonna be alright
He's coming back
Like He said He would

But life goes on and this world keeps on turning  yeah
Let's just be glad we had this time to spend together
There is no need to watch the bridges that we're burning
Lay your head (lay your head) upon my pillow  sweet baby
Hold your warm and tender body close to mine
Hear the whisper of the raindrops rolling softly
Make believe you love me one more time
For the good times

I'll get along  and I'm sure you'll find another
But baby  please remember
I'll be here (I'll be here)  I'm gonna stay right here
If you should find you ever need me  yeah
Don't say a word about tomorrow or forever and ever and ever and ever
There'll be time enough for sadness when you leave me  yeah
For the good times  yeah

Lay your head (lay your head) upon my pillow
Won't you hear the whisper  hear the whisper

But ever since you left  said goodbye
I wish you were here with me

Somethin' 'bout your kiss  gloom all around me
Seem like love is never gonna find me

Twenty-five robbers at my door
I got up and let 'em in
But I missed 'em all with a rollin' pin
Alright they took everything I own
Like a king down from his throne
I can't let it get me down
Yeah-ah-ah-ah
Change my smile into a frown
Oh hey yeah -eh

Change my smile into a frown
Just all about to send it southside
Now it's time for love again
Pain is found and finally went
Took everything I own
Like a king without his throne
I can't let it get me down
Change my smile into a frown

They don't want to see us do
All of the things we want to
You ought to be with me
You don't have to waste my time
If you want to be a friend of mine

And turn your back for another day
Ought to be the kind of girl
That can brighten this old world
And it's hard to see why you and me
Can't be together happily

Look at the smiling faces
Makes me know that no one can take your place
Love is the morning sun  shining so brightly
It's me that's missing your love  now
All the skies are gray  now messing up my day
Throwing up my hands  not being a man
Don't you know that's not going to pay?
Hey hey
Love is the morning sun  shining so brightly
It's me that's missing your love  now
(Your love  your love)
I'm tired of being alone  bye
Still in love with you  now"
