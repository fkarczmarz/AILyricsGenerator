Yeah  I know the person in the mirror's not a perfect one
I look at him every day and think he's not enough
My life's a book that I don't really like to open up
I'm twenty-six  but I feel like I live in chapter one
I always felt like no one listened to me  that's how I grew up
Church is where I found God  but it's also where I learned to judge
Yeah  I had to learn there's a difference between
What you want  and what you really need
I've always been motivated by comments from people tellin' me things they think I'll never be
And then I become it  this is my everything
There's so much that goes on in my head that people will never see
You probably be terrified of my memories  don't lecture me
Doesn't alter who I am as a person to take my energy  yeah

Hard days  cold nights
Staring down at an empty cup like
I'ma fill  I'ma fill it up
All day  all night
Ten feet down nearly my whole life
But I'll be rising  rising up
Sthgin dloC
I've been allowed to live life like I'm already grieving
I'm at a table of liars but don't eat what they feed me
My hoodie over my face  so nobody can see me
I'm on a plane  'bout to fly again
Looking out the window  take a moment to admire it
Wondering how high it is  wonder where the time has went
Then I shut the window and go back to feeling like I'm out my mind again  agh!
Yeah  seems like we're all trying to climb a ladder
It's crazy what we'll do to climb it faster
It's like we throw away the things in life that really matter
Just so we can make it to the top and wonder what we're even climbing after
I know the feeling of feeling like everything that you deal with
Hard days  cold nights
Staring down at an empty cup like
All day  all night
Ten feet down nearly my whole life
But I'll be rising  rising up
Sthgin dloC
We all want what we never had
The good life doesn't seem so bad
The good life doesn't seem so sad
Hard days  cold nights
Staring down at an empty cup like
I'ma fill  I'ma fill it up
All day  all night
Ten feet down nearly my whole life
But I'll be rising  rising up
We all want what we never had
The good life doesn't seem so bad
The good life doesn't seem so sad
Yeah  we all want what we never had
Hard days  cold nights
Staring down at an empty cup like
I'ma fill  I'ma fill it up

And all I ever wanted was somebody to feel me
And everybody wanna tell me that I'm out of my head
Are you serious?
Anybody out there hearin' this?
You've now entered in my mind
And you better get ready 'cause you might find
It's a little bit different than yours is
It's just been in mournin'
From the moment I quit recording
Then I'll skip the chorus
Yeah I'ma turn this beat to a murder scene
I don't live for the world
Wrote this with emotion
It's hard to get a break when the doors ain't open
It's hard to get a shot when the gun ain't loaded
What am I insane maybe? Plain crazy
You put me in a room with a mic you will not restrain me
This is the current condition of my state of mind

Don't tell me that this isn't real
Don't tell me this ain't how I feel
All I ever wanted was somebody to get this
All I ever wanted was somebody to play this
I never been a killer but I guarantee I kill tracks
What you're hearing now is me whether I'm in front or behind that curtain
Don't tell me that this isn't real
Don't tell me this ain't how I feel
Don't tell me that this isn't real
Don't tell me this ain't how I feel
Don't tell me that this isn't real
Don't tell me this ain't how I feel
All I have
I don't do drugs  I'm addicted to the pain though
Gotta have it  it's a habit I'ma break though
I just wanna take a hit  keep sayin' I'ma quit
Keep sayin' I'ma leave  but I stay though
I just want a little fix  I don't wanna take a risk
I don't like it when I drift from the safe zone
But lately  I been thinkin' I'ma have to
Lettin' go of things that I'm attached to
World don't stop just because I'm in a bad mood
You don't know what love is 'til you holdin' onto somethin' that you can't lose
That’s why I'm tryna get it together
I like to rap  but I ain't gon' do it forever
Forget the charts  I've been focusin' on holdin' my head up
Moment I get up  I just wanna know I'm doin' my best
'Cause I can feel the water tryna go up over my head
Most of my life  I always felt like I was holdin' my breath
Lookin' for somethin' in my life to be inspired again
I like to walk around and act like I don't know what it is
But I know what it is  I just never wanna commit

Runnin' from change
I'm lookin' for change
I'm searchin' for change
I'm lookin' for change
I just want  I just want change
Yeah  I don't like new things
Got a lot of mood swings
Oh  you wanna tell me somethin' negative?
I don't wanna hear what you think
Yeah  tossin' in my sleep
Every night for like two weeks
Thinkin' 'bout how I could have done this or done that better
Can't help it  that's just me
Lies  that's me avoidin' the change
Yeah  that's probably why the issues ain't goin' away
Yeah  that's probably why I always sit around and complain
Tellin' myself that I ain't never gettin' out of this place
Out of my face if you tellin' me I need to be different
That's the issue though  I'm always insecurity-driven
Takin' the wrong turns  actin' like I know where I'm headed
Waitin' for somethin' bad to happen  I can snap any minute
I need change
But difficult to do when I feel like I hate life
And everyone around me kinda thinks I'm a great guy
But I don't ever think it so I think I'm a fake liar
Change
It's somethin' that I know I should do
I'm a little uncomfortable  to tell you the truth
But to be honest with you lately  I got nothin' to lose
Lookin' for change
I'm lookin' for change
I'm searchin' for change
I'm lookin' for change
I just want  I just want—
I need a moment of silence
I don't like change  but I'll try it
I don't wanna hear what I should or I shouldn't do
Why are they always defiant?
See  all my emotions are liars
All my emotions are violent
They don't want freedom to find me
Mention the name and everybody riots (Change)
Yeah  that's why I'm checkin' my vitals
They keep on workin'  but I know
Breathin' don't mean you're alive  so
I bag up all of my trash and walk out on my tightrope
Positive thoughts are my rivals (Change)
I'm tryna be on their side though
Should I feel comfortable? I don't
Last year  I felt suicidal
This year  I might do somethin' different like talkin' to God more
I'm lookin' for change
I'm lookin' for (Yeah)
I'm searchin' for change
I'm lookin' for
I just want  I just want change
I'm lookin' for (Yeah)
I'm searchin' for change
I just want  I just want change
Yeah  I'm lookin' for (Lookin' for)

I'm lookin' for  yeah
Find somewhere that feels safe
Find somewhere the bad days
Don't come as often in this sad phase
Somewhere I can be loved
Where I don't have to run away from my flaws
And I don't have to be afraid of my thoughts
Doesn't have an exit
I don't learn my lesson
I don't see no endin' in sight
I don't feel the best when I try
Holdin' my head up high but it's not workin'
Makin' you cry makes me feel like a bad person (Bad person)
And something's got a hold on me
They don't see the world I see
Heartbеat in my chest feels weak
I just wanna run away
And find somewhere that feels safe
Find somewhere the bad days
Don't come as often in this sad phase
Somewhere I can be loved
Where I don't have to run away from my flaws
And I don't have to be afraid of my thoughts
You might also like
Always likes the sad trip
And ruin all my friendships
Way too many questions in my mind
I don't have the answers but I try
I said some awful things last week
Messin' with my self-esteem
Mixed up my priorities
I just wanna run away
Find somewhere that feels safe
Find somewhere the bad days
Don't come as often in this sad phase
Somewhere I can be loved
Where I don't have to run away from my flaws
And I don't have to be afraid of my thoughts
 feel myself evolving
 so much I'm not divulging
 but it's been awfully exhausting
 proceed indulging
 embrace the rigid
 that's fine with me
 portrayed uncivil
 I'm far from brittle
 you following?
— where am I goin' with this?
 so
 I will rock the boat
 it's probable
 incomparable
 impossible
 ain't codeine (Never)
 they told me
 Homie
 my initial thought was to wait
 you doin' alright?
 that's what I figured
 put 'em in shock
 Ready or not?
 the cream of the crop
 give me some props
 I get mistook
 How's he do it?
 but I did do the best I could
 Hollywood
 you don't know me good
 you don't know me good
 Hollywood
 you don't know me good
 you don't know me
 I always advance
 you know where I stand (Woo)
 I gotta expand
 I'm settin' up camp
 I put up my tent
 they fall in my hand (Woo)
 I don't even flinch
 ain't movin' an inch (Oh)
 you know I'm relentless
 no way to prevent it (Woo)
 and I don't regret it
 I'm happy I did it
 I ain't got no limits (Ayy)
 you payin' attention?
 they know where my head is
Started at a young age
Yeah  bought a house but I've been livin' on stage
Tryna find the real me  I ain't found it yet
Wake up every morning feelin' like I'm guilty
Talk to God  Can You hear me?
Lately  I'm a mess
I don't want no one to help me
Yeah  I don't want no one to help me and
If you think that I make decisions based off of what you think  then you're wrong
Can't nobody think for me  I got my own thoughts
Sometimes you don't know what you had until it's all gone  till it's all gone
If I took the hand that was dealt me then I would be nowhere in life
Yeah  I had to think smart
Threw away the deck and got my own cards
Long before I had the money to afford a car
I–I've been doin' me (Yeah)
I've been doin' me
Yeah  I've been doin' me
I've been doin' me
Followin' my dreams
Yeah  I've been doin' me
I've been doin' me
I've been doin' me
Yeah  I've been doin' me
I've been doin' me
Followin' my dreams
Yeah  I've been doin' me

Most of my life's full of regrets
Things I wanna take back  yeah
Wrote you a letter  wish that I had never sent that
Didn't even make sense  I don't even know
All I know is I get lower on the weekends
They tell me I should make friends  I just sit at home
I've been off the deep end and
If you think that I'm 'bout to change who I am just for you then you're so wrong
As a kid I built a house around my broke heart
Sometimes you don't know what you had until it falls apart  till it falls apart
If I took the hand that was dealt me then I would be nowhere in life
Yeah  I had to think smart
Threw away the deck and got my own cards
Long before I had the money to afford a car
I (yeah)–I've been doin' me (Oh  yeah)
I've been doin' me
Yeah  I've been doin' me (I have been)
I've been doin' me
Followin' my dreams
Yeah  I've been doin' me (Followin' my)
I've been doin' me
I've been doin' me (I've been followin' my)
Yeah  I've been doin' me
Followin' my dreams
Yeah  I'm just doin' me
Yeah  I'm just doin' me
Yeah  I'm reminiscin' back to both of us laughin'
Playin' old records  thinkin' every one of 'em's classic
Windows down  we on the street up in Michigan rappin'
We talked about it  but never really knew it could happen
My confidence about as low as the gas is
We didn't have the money for it  so we'd turn the key backwards and sit in parking lots for hours till the battery crashes
I think that we related 'cause both of us were lookin' for answers
A couple months ago I drove into Gladwin  got me all in my feelings
It's somethin' 'bout bein' somewhere that's familiar
Pull in the gas station  open up the tank then I fill it then laugh
I know you've been callin'  sorry I never call back
I know I've been distant  you know I never meant that
You can tell the family how I'm doing if they ask
Watchin' the world go round
Listening
To unfamiliar feelings and unknown sounds
Make a list of all my failed attempts
Runnin' outta space again
Highlight all the things I wish I never said (Stop)
That would mean that I would have to separate from my beliefs
Aren't these waters so deceivin'? (So dеceivin')
'Cause we just drift and drift and drift
Until we see something that we define as peaceful
That people leave you while I'm driftin'

Listening
To unfamiliar feelings and unknown sounds
How you're talkin' to yourself is rude
Driftin' I'm in the same boat as you
Climb until I'm outta breath
Questioning my every step (Woah)
My train of thought is leadin' me to different tracks
Positive that where I'm at is not where I should stay and that's (Why)
Convince yourself that no one in the world would ever want to
Passin' by the people that have been there to support you
Might get stressful when I'm driftin'
I see you in the distance
I'm convinced that I predict that all my wishes on my wish list won't be heard
'Cause I'm committed to the lie that feeling safe is unrealistic
When I'm driftin'
Watchin' the world go round
Listening
To unfamiliar feelings and unknown sounds
Ignorant to my ignorance
Give me the faith to rise and help me diversify
The feelings and words collide
Intensified by living a life deprived
I'd rather be burned alive
Than go back to thinkin' I'm insignificant (Insignificant)
Every impotent moment debated can trigger it
God is my witness definitive
But that's what gives me the energy lacked
Started with phone conversation and I
I guess we connect on our hatred for pills
It's real
You got me thinkin' things I never used to
But I miss you
But you make me smile every time that you call me

Got you on my mind
Got you on my mind
 ain't no way you could ignore it
 I'll do it in the mornin'
 don't focus on what's not important
 but do not show up on my doorstep
 I suggest that you avoid me
 only difference is there's more of us
 but I'm the one to shut it down
 woo!
 I don't let no one distract me
 I walk off the bus a different city than the last week
 they gon' tell you 'bout the past me
 last year I was in a bad place
 but they nasty?
 I could tell when Mama had me
 What does that mean?
 yeah! (Woo!)
 haha!
 woo!
 yeah!
 real life!)
Hear me out  I know it's been a couple years
Since I've reached
Out and said hello  I bet You're wondering
Why I keep
Obsessing on and stressin' all the little things
When I should be
Living life and soaking up the memories
I know I've been selfish  I have
No excuse to give You  it's true
Hanging by a thread's how I live
I don't know why  but I feel more comfortable
Livin' in my agony
Watchin' my self-esteem
Go up in flames  acting like I don't
Care what anyone else thinks
When I know truthfully
That that's the furthest thing from how I
Feel  but I'm too proud to open up and ask ya
To pick me up and pull me out this hole I'm trapped in
The truth is I need help  but I just can't imagine
Who I'd be if I was happy
You might also like
Yeah  been this way so long
It feels like somethin's off when I'm not depressed
I got some issues that I won't address
I got some baggage I ain't opened yet
I got some demons I should put to rest
I got some traumas that I can't forget
I got some phone calls I been avoidin'
Some family members I don't really connect with
Some things I said I wish I woulda not let slip
Some hurtful words that never shoulda left my lips
Some bridges burned I'm not ready to rebuild yet
Some insecurities I haven't dealt with  yes
I'll be the first to admit that I'm a lonely soul
And the last to admit I need a hand to hold
Losin' hope  headed down a dangerous road
Livin' in my agony
Watchin' my self-esteem
Go up in flames  acting like I don't
Care what anyone else thinks
When I know truthfully
That that's the furthest thing from how I
Feel  but I'm too proud to open up and ask ya
To pick me up and pull me out this hole I'm trapped in
The truth is I need help  but I just can't imagine
Who I'd be if I was happy
Don't know what's around the bend
Don't know what my future is
But I can't keep on livin' in—
Livin' in my agony
Watchin' my self-esteem
Go up in flames  acting like I don't
Care what anyone else thinks
When I know truthfully
That that's the furthest thing from how I
Feel  but I'm too proud to open up and ask ya
To pick me up and pull me out this hole I'm trapped in
The truth is I need help  but I just can't imagine
Who I'd be if I was happy
You look so misunderstood
And I wish I could help
But it's hard when I hate myself
Pray to God with my arms open
And I wish I could help
But it's hard when I hate myself
They bring out the worst in me
All the core beliefs
And every mornin' I wake up and feel like I am not worth it 'cause I'm at war with peace
It's kinda weird
Lately I been feelin' like the only way for me to get away is if I poured a drink
Is this really what I'm born to be?
That's what you get for thinkin' you're unique
What else can the world sell me?
But it's not healthy

I don't see you like I should
You look so misunderstood
And I wish I could help
But it's hard when I hate myself
Pray to God with my arms open
And I wish I could help
But it's hard when I hate myself
They know how to get to me
Suicide thoughts come and go like a guest to me
So don't talk to me like you think I'm so successful
What is success when hope has left you?
Come across like it's so easy
But I feel like you don't need me
When I feel like you don't need me
Then I feel like you don't see me
Throw it away and think about it later
Diggin' through the trash for drugs
I'm scared because
I don't see you like I should
You look so misunderstood
And I wish I could help
But it's hard when I hate myself
Pray to God with my arms open
And I wish I could help
But it's hard when I hate myself
I walk through the ashes of my passions
Reminiscin' with the baggage in my casket
Get lost in the questions I can't answer
Knee-deep in defeat of my own actions
But I can't have it
But I can't have it
I don't see you like I should
You look so misunderstood
And I wish I could help
But it's hard when I hate myself
Pray to God with my arms open
And I wish I could help
But it's hard when I hate myself
Hate myself
But it's hard when I hate myself
Hate myself
But it's hard when I hate myself
When I hate myself
It's kinda hard when I hate myself
I hate myself
 I'm comin'
 where's it at?
 my album (My album)
 but beneficial
 that wasn't a shot
 I just don't want him to grow up thinkin' that he'll never be enough
 we waited
 but you just left us
 I needed you
 I don't know what it's like to be addicted to pills
 it kills
 I'm thinkin' this isn't real
 yeah
 let me out of my cell
 but you don't know me that well
 tears runnin' down my face and I yell
 say you comin' to get us
 I'm humiliated
 all you have to say is no
 will you? You gon' keep poppin' 'til them pills kill you
 but I can still feel you
 I need the real thing
 Mom?
 I know them drugs have got you held captive
 they got your mind captured
 but I am not laughin'
 then where you at then?
 you and I sat in the livin' room
 tellin' me this isn't you
 guess you were singin' a different tune
 didn't you?
 I guess they came back to finish you
 not to scream at your funeral
 that person talkin' was pitiful
 I hate the way I remember you
 I could tell you felt hollow
 plus your life to them pill bottles
 plus your life to them pill bottles
 you know
 I'm like...
 you know?
 right?
 right?!
Yeah
Only time you ever call me
Is when you feelin' like
Don't nobody else wanna listen
When's the last time you saw me?
You probably don't remember that
I don't wanna hear the sorries
I'm tired of all the talkin'
But you ain't say a word to me
You don't care that you lost me
What's wrong with ya?
Had a picture of you sittin' on the dash in the car with me
Now it's in my closet with the other ones
Sittin' in a box I don't wanna open up
You took it all from me
Told me you would die for me
Wish that I could say that this has come as surprise to me
Told me that I never took the time
You might also like
Yeah
We used to talk like best friends
I remember that
I guess I don't know what happened to us
Now you got me questionin' what trust is
You told me you would be there for me
Now you wanna jump ship
Leave me here alone
Everybody else did
Who you havin' fun with?
You're the one that jumped in
Told me you had feelings
Now you tryna tell me that is not true
I ain't gotta clue who I'm lookin' at right now
But I know the person that I'm lookin' at is not you
Maybe that's the reason you been changin'
Maybe that's the reason why I'm feelin' like you're dangerous
Mm  mm
I miss the days when I had a smile on my face and
Wasn't so caught up in all of the small things
Wasn't so adamant that I could handle everything alone
And wasn't so cautious and always exhausted
And actually listened to things that my heart said  heart said
Ridin' my bike  just ridin' my bike
Not overthinkin' my life
Not always wonderin' if I'm a likable person
Or someone that nobody likes
Not always stressed about money or losin' my job
Or scared I ain't makin' a flight
Not always goin' to bed every night
With this knot in my stomach that never unwinds
What happened to me? Yeah  what happened to me?
When did I start to believe I wasn't worth it
Then question my purpose to breathe?
Wonderin' who I should be
Happiness out of my reach
Scared to get back on my feet
Need to get rid of what's detrimental  but it's hard to let go
When the thing that hurts you help you get to your dreams
See  I miss the days when I wasn't so faded
Love wasn't always invasive  I could embrace it
When did I break and become overtaken?
What was the moment I caved and
Gave away all of my faith and made a replacement?
I miss the days when  I miss the days when—

Give me my mind back  yeah
Give me my mind back
The one that told me I was worth somethin' when I fall flat
Yeah  fall flat
The one that told me I was worth somethin' when I'm off track
Back when my imagination wasn't in a cage and it was free to run fast
Yeah  give me my mind back
Before it was hijacked and wasn't described as
A place of limitation  always indicating I can't
Handle everything from my past
Handed anything it dissects 'til I'm depressed
I know I'm blessed  but I'm cursed too
Take me back when I was happy  but I wasn't actin'
Vulnerable but didn't see it like some kind of weakness
Or a thing that's unattractive
Had emotion  but I learned to mask it
Didn't know what I was runnin' after
Didn't know the older I would grow
The more I'd lose control and take in all the baggage
It's really sad when everything you thought was stable crashes
Everything you thought would take the sadness
Really only made it deeper  got me off the deep end askin'
Will we ever feel like we imagine?
Will we ever feel like we adapted?
Will we ever feel like we did back then?
Just take me back when  just take me back when
I miss the smiles we had when we were young (Oh)
I miss the memories of feeling love (Oh)

I just need a moment in my own space
But ain't that what we all say?
Sometimes I think back to the old days
In the pointless conversations with the old me
Yeah  back when my momma used to hold me
I wish somebody woulda told me
If you want love  you gon' have to go through the pain
If you want love  you gon' have to learn how to change
If you want trust  you gon' have to give some away
If you want love  if you want love
Yeah  as a kid I used to think life
Is moving so slow  I watch it go by
Look out the window on my bus ride
I thought the world was so small  through my closed eyes
I've always tried to control things
In the end that's what controls me
Maybe that's why I'm controllin'
I wish somebody woulda told me

Talkin' to the voices in my head  they make me think twice
Tellin' me it doesn't mean it's wrong because it feels right
I'm scared that one day I'll wake up and wonder where'd the time go
Talk about the past like it's the present while I rock slow
I'll sit in the living room and laugh with kids of my own
And tell 'em
If you want love  you gon' have to go through the pain
I wish you woulda told me
If you want love  you gon' have to learn how to change
I wish somebody woulda told me
If you want trust  you gon' have to give some away
You gon' have to give
If you want love  if you want love
If it wasn't for me  you woulda never wrote Therapy
I've been here for you  but how come you're never there for me?
It's a little bit twisted  but I miss when you and I had scary dreams
I don't really wanna talk about it!
Shut up!
Now  where were we?
Well  back in the day when
You and I had it all mapped out in the basement
Crying in your room like a baby
I wish mom was here!
We all do so we wouldn't have to hear about it every single record
You don't really wanna change me
Yeah  I'm the one that made this happen
Do you really wanna get rid of your main attraction?
Let's pack our bags and go back to Gladwin now
Yeah  it's time for the third record
And you know I got the content
I don't wanna make you nervous
But it ain't like it used to be  we got a lotta people watchin' (Watchin')
You told me that you don't want me in your life  that's pretty hard to digest (Digest)
And I told you I'd leave when we die (Die)  and we ain't died yet
You don't like the prison I built you? (Built you)
Yeah  you wanna know what the funny thing is?
You keep on talkin' to me like a stranger
But we've been together since you were a kid (Kid)  yeah
Took us from a no-name
Told you everything was okay
Now you tryna cut me out of it like I ain't never been a part of it
I am the heart of it  I made this whole thing
What's the point of havin' guns if you can't aim? (Can't aim)
What's the point of havin' blood with no veins? (With no veins)
What's the point of havin' love with no pain? (With no pain)
What I'm sayin' is me without you doesn't make any sense
I know I'm intense and controlling  but you need to learn how to cope with it
That's just the way that it is
If you didn't want me to live in your house  you shouldn't have let me move in
It's comfortable here and I like it  I got my own room and everything
It don't get better than this
You say you wanna own your life  then wake up and take your own advice
You're just mad 'cause you know I'm right
Held your hands on the coldest nights
You didn't tell 'em 'bout the times you and I used to hold the mic
Is this what you wanted?
Both of us out in the open? Let's do it then!
I mean  why are you doin' this?
I know that you're mad (That you're mad)  but I'm not in the mood for this
We got a record to drop (Drop)
So why you actin' like I'm not a part of it?
Aye  where is my shovel at?
Prolly out back where it always is
You can't get rid of all of me!
I'm the reason why—
Hey  I'm NF
Is it me or the fear talkin'? Ha! What a dumb question!
Thought I told you to keep your mouth shut
I mean  so what? You know I never listen
Rap about it for like three minutes
Wait a minute  you don't really think for a second that you're puttin' me in this?
*Thunk*
Here's a dose of your own medicine
What  you don't like how it tastes?
I think it's only right we go back to where you were created
He prolly don't even remember us  does he?
I wish I was burying anger
But both of us know I'ma need him for that song (That song)  he still lives in the basement
You'll spend the rest of your life in my backyard or back of my mind—depends how you see it
Tellin' me you want your room back  that's funny  what? You ain't got nowhere to sleep?
I'ma just look out the window and laugh at you  this is crazy to me
'Cause I thought you had me in prison this whole time  but I'm the one holdin' the keys
I come in your house with a microphone
Lookin' like I'm 'bout to set up a show in your kitchen
I'm out of my mind  but I feel like I'm in it
If I never make it  don't make any difference
I'm still gonna kill it  you know what the deal is
Ain't never no chillin' when I'm in the buildin'
NF is a monster  I am a villain
My music is sick  and you don't know what ill is
You better get back  I don't write any filler
I write what I feel and I'm feelin' a million
I'm 'bout to lose it
I'm on a whole different level of music
Don't treat me like I have no clue how to do this
You better rethink what you're thinkin' and move it
Now picture me writin' when I was a kid
Tryna make it in music  I think it is crazy
I spent all my money on studio time
Tryna get on my music so people could play it
I'ma keep it one hundred  my music was terrible
Learned to get better the more that I made it
Go back to my Moments album  most of you people
You prolly don't know what I'm sayin'  hold up
What you're witnessin' now? Don't try to figure me out
I grab on that microphone  jawin' the crowd
The moment you told me that you was a rapper
I couldn't believe it  you believe it now?
Step in the booth and I murder it
You never heard of a rapper that kill it like I do
I sleep on the couch in the studio
Stay up till three in the morning  and write till I get more
The moment I wake up I feel like I don't even sleep
And I'm ready to put out my record
But either way  I'm gonna wreck it
I look at the industry  look what it did to me
You'll never make it if you never grind
You put a whole lot of money into it
You better be ready to give it your time
I look at the past awful years of my life
And I promise you I have been givin' it mine
Try to keep up with this  I'm not a puppet
No string on my back  I'm one of a kind
Music is changing  no way to tame this
I am an artist  look what I painted
Hang up the caution tape  I'm dangerous
Does anyone know where my brain is?
Rappers are comfortable knowin' they're famous
But I  really don't care what your name is
And I  really don't care if I'm nameless
Y'all just drivin' around  I know where my lane is
Cocky? Nah  I'm competitive
This is a job for me  it's adrenaline
Don't try to box me in  I am Mayweather
I come in the ring  my punches are way better
I never drink  but I live in these bars
The moment you blink is the moment you lost
Say you a king  who put you in charge?
Don't care what you think  I'll break in your car
Climb on the top of it  sound the alarm
And wake up the neighborhood  rap in your yard
And carry the speakers on both of my arms
Till you keep sleepin' on me  I'm at large
Enough with the jokes  I ain't jokin'
You come in a session with me  I'ma show you what dope is
And when I say dope  I ain't talkin' 'bout smokin'
I'm talkin' 'bout music that has an emotion
I look at this mic  it's part of my family
Take it away  I'm comin' to find you
I've been through a lot in my life
And it's hard to get people to listen when no one's behind you
And then Capitol came in the picture and gave me a shot
And look at it now
I look at the team I'm dealin' with  agh
These people ain't playin' around
Lookin' back  I gotta laugh
I was in a whole different place a year ago
I look at the math  I look at the map
And thank you God  I swear it's a miracle
And I'm sorry  but I gotta leave
The least I can do if I murder a beat
Or the plane that I get on decides that it's my last day
I want you to know when you're alone and you feel afraid
You're not the only person in the world that isn't okay
And chat with memories that you and me aren't really fond of
Maybе you're just like me and feel thе need to stay in your rut
It's interestin' that nobody can walk in your shoes
You ever think about what it would be like
If the clouds were gone and you could see light?
Or just close the curtains up and stay inside?
I'm scared too and it gets so tempting
You hold dearly when you know clearly
You been so buried in your own fairytale
The soul's tearin' bunch of holes in me

See dead ends
In life we come to tend to raise some questions
Suggestion
Know that your feelings might give wrong directions (Infested)
You might have enjoyed become nothin' but dated
I told you that there was some hope we could make it?
Could you really improve and be somethin' worth savin'?
Convincing yourself that you don't really matter's
Like feedin' a cancer and letting it travel
The unthinkable and cancel our trips?
What's achievable depends on the risk
So pick up your chin and listen to this
Just in case my car goes off the highway
Or the plane that I get on decides that it's my last day
I want you to know when you're alone and you feel afraid
You're not the only person in the world that isn't okay
Just remember that that's alright
It's the rainy days that give us love for the sun
Everybody falls sometimes
Just remember that that's alright
It's the lows in life that make you cherish the highs
Just in case my car goes off the highway
Or the plane that I get on decides that it's my last day
I want you to know when you're alone and you feel afraid
You're not the only person in the world that isn't okay
Hey!
Leave me alone
I went from nobody to kinda famous
But I just leave 'em on the ground right next to my self-hatred
That means I obsessively obsess on things I think about
That means I might take a normal thought and think it's so profound (Leave me alone)
Like I'm undercover and don't wanna blow it
I got an umbrella for difficult moments

Hold up my balloons and cover up my face
I can feel them weighin' on me every day
I should let 'em go and watch 'em float away
I hate when they debate if we're underrated
We don't do enough interviews or go out in public lately
We don't post enough on our socials
To keep the buzz from fading (Leave me alone)
And all the fans embrace it (Leave me alone)
I don't need advice from my doubts right now
End of conversation (Leave me alone)
It's floating 'round
I'm kinda funny but don't really show it
I keep it together but have a disorder
I go to my room and I sit in my corner
And talk to myself in a language that's foreign (Leave me alone)
I think of a rhyme and I have to record it
Hold up my balloons and cover up my face
I can feel them weighin' on me every day
I should let 'em go and watch 'em float away
Tell them how I feel but they remain the same (They remain the same)
Leave me alone
It took a couple days to get a response
Hold up my balloons and cover up my face (Up my face)
But I'm scared if I do then I'll be more afraid
Walk towards you on a fine line
Everybody has a dark side
I feel embarrassed when they see mine
Rain falling from my dark skies
Shouldn't I see the sunshine now?
Wonder how I look in God's eyes
Am I a good person or a lost one?
Will this feel worth it when I'm all done?
Will I feel ashamed or like who I was?
Will the pain vanish or will more come?
Will I stay numb or regain love?
Maybe someday have a taste of freedom?
Will I take the poison out of my blood?
Or just leave it there inside of my lungs?
Why don't you accept me? I just need acceptance

Am I Hell-bound? Will I find Heaven?
Will I feel better or just regret it?
If I let you go and find the seven letters
Open all the doors and let the peace enter
How can I survive? Change your state of mind?
I wish that I could say I'm proud
I'm sorry that I let you down
Let you down
All these voices in my head get loud
I wish that I could shut them out
I'm sorry that I let you down
Le-le-let you down
I just wanna make you feel like everything I ever do
Thought about everything you were never even wrong
Walking towards you with my head down
That's parents for you

Ain't that what you always do?
What else can I offer you?
Feels like we're on the edge right now
I wish that I could say I'm proud

All these voices in my head get loud
I wish that I could shut them out
I'm sorry that I let you down
Le-le-let you down
That's not gonna work now
Packed all my clothes and I moved out
I don't even wanna go to your house
Every time I sit on that couch
Coulda made this work
And prolly woulda figured things out
But I guess I'm a letdown
Sit around and talk about the good times that didn't even happen
Feels like we're on the edge right now
I wish that I could say I'm proud
I'm sorry that I let you down
All these voices in my head get loud
And I wish that I could shut them out
I'm sorry that I let you down
I'm so sorry now
 then why'd you call last night?
 I heard you said I ain't the type for you
 I learned from it
 that's why it's so funny
 heard you threw away the pictures
 you told me that you needed distance
 then why'd you call last night?
 you goin' off the deep end
 cool
 yeah
 huh?
 huh?
 We should let it go and put it all behind us
 I saw it comin'
 tryna tell me all your problems
 I ain't got time for all this drama
 huh?
 then why'd you call last night?
 how you gonna lie like that?
 then why'd you call last night?
 yeah)
 I'll take it in
 I'll breathe it in
 what you tryin' to do?
 let me finish
 hey?
 see how you gon' lie to my face
 so don't even try it
 lost in the moment
 lost in the moment

 when was the last time we had it?
 'cause all that we do
 but that's what you get
 is this the way we wanna die?
 'cause I'm getting tired!
 I can no longer do this
 you don't know what you're doing
 you'll have to deal with the things
 lost in the moment
 lost in the moment
 lost in the moment
 lost in the moment
 yeah
 I'll take it in
Self-awareness
With a pair of gloves that I hope doesn't perish
My mistakes are like a screamin' parrot
Aren't we all searchin' for the serum
That could help us breathe and leave our state of peril?
All of us have made defensive scarecrows
That we scatter 'round our fields and treat like heroes
When they scare away the things that we should cherish
'Cause we're too embarrassed to admit the fear is that we're lost
We tend to get mad at the ones that call us out but the fact is
We need someone that'll be honest when we fly off the handle
I admit I throw a fit when I begin to unravel
I could sit here on the fence or maybe pick up the paddle
I'd love to pack arenas and all
But what I really wanna do is learn to handle my thoughts

When I'm lost
When I'm lost (Lost)
When I'm lost
And I'm hopin' it don't bury me
I used to be joyful and skip so merrily
But now I'm too cautious and tip toe carefully
My mind left and it's nowhere to be found
Am I a big ol' parody?
'Cause it's no fair to me
And now I'm at the point where I'm spending a grand a week on hypnotherapy
I got a group of loved ones that ain't my friends
And if I ever take an L then they might grin
And they all wanna see me stay in the cage I'm in
Anybody tryna enter my circle with no love (Hol' up)
I'm actually bored with having a sore heart
I was livin' so oblivious
It's kinda funny what a penny does
Mixed in with a mini buzz (I feel stuck)
Guess I was runnin' late for the train and missed it (What?)
The only thing I feel is pain and vengeance (What?)
So I'ma act out like a ragin' misfit (What?)
And every verse I lay gon' stay sadistic (Yeah)
You'll never see the day where my anger's dismissed
You better go and change your wish list 'cause I
Do not treat me like some adolescent kid
I am prayin' to the Lord with the Book of James
Hopin' He gon' add my testament
You probably can't relate
I just ain't the same when I'm lost (Lost)
Yeah
When I'm lost
When I'm lost
What's reality with all these questions?
Feels like I missed my alarm and slept in
Slept in
These walls are my blank expression
My mind is a home I'm trapped in
And it's lonely inside this mansion
And you get the uncut version of life when I go downstairs
That's where I write when I'm in a bad place and need to release
And let out the version of NF you don't wanna see
I put holes in the walls with both of my fists 'til they bleed
You might get a glimpse of how I cope with all this anger in me
I gotta thank you for this anger that I carry around
Wish I could take a match and burn this whole room to the ground
Then took me downstairs and beat me till I screamed and I cried
But I'ma keep the door shut and lock the lyrics inside

And slept in
These walls are my blank expression
My mind is a home I'm trapped in
Are you confused? Come upstairs and I'll show you what I mean
The moment I walk into it's the same moment that I wanna leave
I get sick to my stomach every time I look at these things
But it's hard to look past when this is the room where I sleep
Was the moment I realized that I was losing my mom
And I regret the fact that I struggled trying to find who I am
And I lie to myself and say I do the best that I can
Then get ticked off whenever I see it affecting my plans
And I regret watchin' these trust issues eat me alive
Insidious is blind inception
What's reality with all these questions?
Feels like I missed my alarm and slept in
And slept in
These walls are my blank expression
My mind is a home I'm trapped in
I built a safe room and I don't let no one in there
'Cause I don't want you to have the opportunity to hurt me
And I'll be the only person that I can blame when you desert me
I know that shuttin' the world out ain't solvin' the problem
But I didn't build this house because I thought it would solve 'em
I built it because I thought that it was safer in there
He must have picked a room and got comfortable and settled in
Is that me or the fear talking? I don't know anymore
It's lonely
It's lonely (It's lonely)
I mean this with love when I say it
I wanna answer the phone when you call me
The problem is  it's 10 a.m. and you're already drinkin'
You're probably already wasted
What's the point in having conversation with somebody that
I think that both of us live in the past  so we take for granted the present
Maybe next time I'm in Michigan  I'll come and visit
We ain't got a lot in common but both of us miss her
I might do some things you don't like
We all make mistakes  that's just life
They might say I changed  that's alright

These are the moments I know I'ma always hold onto and cherish 'em  yeah
Life's about taking chances  making moves
Not about what you did  it's what you do
Build on what you got and learn from what you lose
And never let people distract you from being you
I might do some things you don't like (Yeah)
We all make mistakes  that's just life (Life)

 I just wanna leave the negativity in my head
 I don't wanna see or
 I just want relief from my stress (Oh)
 starin' out the window doin' 85
 walkin' on that gray line
 I'm a hostage to my own pride
 I leave the situation
 I think I need a break from
 but… (Oh)
 I just wanna leave the negativity in my head
 I don't wanna see or
 I just want relief from my stress (Oh)
 this life got my head spinnin'
 would I stay trippin'?
 say I love him and laugh with him
 this whole business has got me feelin' jaded
 it's pretty hard to watch
 but stressin' me out 'til I drop
 that's where I live on a daily basis
 huh?
 you know? (Oh)
 I just wanna leave the negativity in my head
 I don't wanna see or
 I just want relief from my stress (Oh)
 I'm just hopin' that God helps me to stop stressin'
 I just wanna leave it)
 I don't wanna see or
 I just want relief from my stress (Oh)
 some days
 some days
 yeah
Or find a time machine and take me back when I was six
Would be to tell that little kid that he's gon' take a lotta hits
Yeah  I'd probably grab your hand and tell you life is hard
If you got questions or you need advice  then talk to God
'Cause He's the only one that listens even when you think He isn't
Even good people are great at makin' bad decisions  yeah (Oh)
They ain't gon' take it serious
You find out pretty quick that life is more than just appearances
I know some things we could avoid to save embarrassment
But everything that breaks you down can also build your character
'Cause people love to see you fail  just be aware of it
Don't let nobody tell you who to be or write your narrative
Look  we're all products of the things that we experience
But there's a big difference between confidence and arrogance
You hearin' this?
I know that you don't get it now  but you gon' get it later
I know you feel like you're alone and no one loves you maybe
And you gon' cover insecurities with lotsa anger
The weird thing is someday all of this will make you famous (Oh)
You start to write about your life and while they're all relatin'
Wish I could tell you that your future's nothin' but amazin'
That's just not the case  and I guess I just don't know how to say this

(That's just the way that it goes)
And I don't know if you can hear me or not
But if you can  I just need you to get it
I know you been questionin' life
Trust me  I know what it's like
I'm here for you if you need someone to listen
Do you need someone to listen?
But you probably already knew  you gettin' older now
Remember back when Mom picked us up from Grandma's house?
And she hid her boyfriend in the trunk and drove a couple miles?
Down the street  and then she pulled over to let him out
'Cause she ain't want Dad to know she had these type of dudes around
'Cause last time he found out  he had to take us from her
You know how we've always struggled with abandonment? (Yeah)
And when we feel like someone's leaving  we start panickin'? (Yeah)
And yo  I wish I could say I've learned to manage it
You think it's bad now  but you don't know the half of it
Passion is somethin' we have never lacked
We see it the most when we're writin' raps
They think it's funny now  let 'em laugh
I know you think it's just an outlet when you're really mad
But you don't know the platform you're about to have (Oh)
I know some things about the future you ain't ready for
I know some things that you gon' cover up  but can't ignore
And what hurts is they gon' surface at the worst moments
We walk around with the devil talkin' on both shoulders
Wish I could tell you that he disappears when we get older
But that's just not the case  and I know you feel out of place
I don't know if you can hear me or not
But if you can  I just want you to know
You gon' make a lotta mistakes
And they gon' laugh in our face
That's part of life  that's just the way that it goes
(That's just the way that it goes)
And I don't know if you can hear me or not
But if you can  I just need you to get it
I know you been questionin' life
Trust me  I know what it's like
I'm here for you if you need someone to listen
Do you need someone to listen?
You know how intoxicated people make us nervous?
To the point sometimes we shake and it feels so disturbin'
Don't be scared  that's just trauma tryna reach the surface
And tell us everyone we love is gonna try to hurt us
Which isn't true  but it's a lie that both of us believe in
Yeah  you might get a glimpse of happiness from your achievements
But what you'll learn as you get older  every time you reach one
Is you'll just make another goal that doesn't lead to freedom
See  some things about to happen that you can't imagine
At 25  you'll put out Therapy and gain some traction
Skip to track number four  now that's a really sad one
It sounds awesome  at the same time  it doesn't matter
You learn to realize that none of this will make you happy
I wish that I could look at you with empathy
Sometimes I feel like I've become what you were scared to be
Which makes it really hard to look at you with sympathy
'Cause if I'm feeling bad for you  then I have to feel bad for me
And that's just something I feel like we don't deserve
That's why I'm always looking down on you  I know it hurts
I'm sure you have a lot of questions
I've been tryna search to find us both some answers
I'll be here for you if things get worse
All I know is I'll be doin' this
All I know is things are movin' quick
That's convenient for me 'cause that's how I live
Now they see me out here movin' up
You don't like me  that makes two of us
I think I'm learnin'
I am way more than what people might think when they look on the surface
What is my purpose? Yeah
That is a question that I have been askin' myself and it hurts
I'm sick of people tellin' people I'm here 'cause of marketin' dollars  oh
You think that everything is gonna blow just 'cause you market it harder? No
Small circle  but the number's growin'
Hung up on him  I ain't ready for it
I'll get back to that when I make album four
Less talkin'  I've been workin' more
Better me is what I'm workin' towards
Last couple years  let's recap
I make a livin' off of writin' out my regrets
I'm doin' me  I don't care where the scene's at
Try to give me feedback  I don't really need that
I used to walk on stage in a V-neck
I used to wear a lil' tie with a black vest
I came a long way  why you lookin' upset?
Flow's switchin'  I got ADD
Brain scatters when you play the beat
It don't matter what you say to me
I'll be doin' this at eighty-three
I've been doin' this since ABCs
I'm livin' life in the fast lane
Wake up every mornin thinkin' I'ma have a bad day
Drive my own car  I don't like the valet
Park then I go into my mind with an AK
Shoot every thought in my head then it rotates
Losin' it all  but I think that I'm okay
Who is involved? I don't know  but I'm insane
I'm prolly not what you thought
I'm prolly not what you thought
I used to judge everybody that wasn't like me 'til I learned it was wrong
Girl told me I should get it together and get out the dark
I'm tryna give her my heart
That's when I sit in my car  writin' for hours until I can barely talk
I mean  where do I start? Feels like I'm fallin' apart
Act like my image is hard  I always put up my guard
Even when talkin' to God  sit in my room and I plot
Everything that I'm not  comes out in the music I jot
I give it all that I got  I give it all that I got
I'm tryna think out the box  no
Yeah  I got people standin' outside a bus screamin' my name
I don't come out and take pictures  they tell me I changed
Guess I don't know what to say
Guess I don't know what to say
I leave it all on the stage
I don't care where they go
Don't waste your money on my gravestone
I'm more concerned about my soul
Everybody's gon' die
Don't everybody live though
Sometimes I look up to the sky
And wonder…
Do You see us down here  oh Lord? (Oh Lord) Oh Lord? (Oh Lord)
Do You see us down here  oh Lord? (Oh Lord) Oh Lord? (Oh Lord)
Listen!
Yeah  everybody wants change
Don't nobody wanna change though
Don't nobody wanna pray
'Til they got something to pray fo'
Know everybody's gon' die
But don't everybody live though
Sometimes I look up to the sky
And wonder

Do You see us down here  oh Lord? (Oh Lord) Oh Lord? (Oh Lord)
It's easy to blame God but harder to fix things
We look in the sky like  Why ain't You listening?
Watchin' the news in our livin' rooms on the big screens
You see the same God that we're sayin' might not even exist
Becomes real to us but only when we're dyin' in bed
When you're healthy  it's like we don't really care for Him then
Leave me alone God. I'll call You when I need You again. (Need You again)
Which is funny  everyone will sleep in the pews
Then blame God for our problems like He's sleepin' on you
We turn our backs on Him  what do you expect Him to do?
It's hard to answer prayers when nobody's prayin' to you (Prayin' to you)
I look around at this world we walk on (Walk on)
It's a smack in the face  don't ever tell me there's no God (No God)
And if there isn't  then what are we here for?
Oh Lord (Oh Lord) Oh Lord (Oh Lord)
Do You see us? Do You see us?
Do you see us down here  oh Lord? (Oh Lord) Oh Lord? (Oh Lord)
Do You see us? Do You see us?
Can You see us? Can You see us?
Can You see us? Can You see us?
Do You see us down here  oh Lord?
Do You see us down here  oh Lord?
Can You see us down here  oh Lord?
Can You see us down here  oh Lord?
Oh Lord  oh Lord
Can You see us? (Can You see us?)
I could be off of my rocker potentially
Bigger I get  the more they thinkin' less of me
Don't be the one to insult my integrity
Put down the whistle  I'm done with you referees
Y'all don't know nothing  you think you ejected me
I gotta make it  these people depend on me
Ayy  that's how I'm living these days
Threaten my wife  keep digging that grave
I had a job making minimum wage
Told myself that I gotta get paid
Walk into class like  Gimme that A
Think I'm trash? Put a bag in your face
Here's a reminder that I still spit
Think I need to advise you to watch your lip
Or at least realize that I'm not no kid
Don't Google my name tryna find my crib
Write a pop song  then I write a song like this
Do a lot wrong? Doesn't matter  I learn quick
I'm an outlaw  my brain has no fence
Doesn't matter either way to me 'cause even if it did
Used to be employee  now I'm employer
Making big deals  now I gotta get lawyers
People tell me to relax and enjoy it
But when I kick back  I see warnings
So much time might pass  can't ignore it
Every time I rap and I'm recording
Might be my last so I absorb it 'cause

Tool bag without the pliers
Intros without the choirs
New car without the tires
Music without the writers
UFC without the fighters
Smoking without the fire
Cigarettes without the lighter
If I ain't got the bars  you see
Something ain't right like I'm incomplete
If you disagree  make 'em all retreat
Act like a boss when I compete
Take my thoughts into hyperspeed
When it's all gone and I hit my peak
At least I'll know that I took that leap
'Cause life is a process
And I am not here for the nonsense
Losing everything I worked for likes to weigh on my conscience
That why I block out the comments
Who's next? Who's next?
I don't know  I ain't been watching
Closing my ear to the gossip
I gotta make it or make it
No forfeit  my course different
Changed flows and I'm bored with it
Try to tell me I could never be the G.O.A.T. of rap  I ignore limits
I was born with this  you're trippin' thinkin' I'm slippin'
I'm enjoying this
Look at me  I'm on the tour selling more tickets
Even if the fourth record didn't sell a copy  I'ma do it like a hobby
I ain't quitting 'til the Lord tell me
I gotta make it or make it
I gotta make it or make it  yeah

Ayy  these are the options
Ah  these are the options
Woo  these are the options
 it's cold  but I like that
 trapped?
 but the keys are in my hands
 I don't make friends  judge me
 but it ain't that funny
 they love it
 I don't fit in the crowds
 I'm gettin' into character now
 but it feels right
 I won't bite ya
 I ain't tryna fit in yours
 but I've felt divorced
 I'm Nate  have we met before?
 of course
 agh!
 but I can see into the future better
 get the fans together
 but the songs are better
 feels like it's gone forever
 but you know the buzz is comin'
 yeah  the Hulk is runnin'
 it feels like I'm onto somethin'  yeah
 my head's in the clouds
 I am not good in crowds
 I know—been that way since a child
 I am nobody else
 I'm just being myself
 I guess for now
 I'll just be the outcast (Woohoo!)
 I guess I don't fit the mold of rap
 I don't wanna blend in with you little rappin' idiots—I'd rather be the outcast
 agh!
 with a weird crowd
 you don't like that?
 but I like it though
 yeah!
 they got me reminiscin' now!
 you done know I'm 'bout to go mad
 you ain't get that?
 must've missed that
 I can feel it again
 I lay in my bed  in my cell with the pen
 I keep wonderin' when
 they don't know who I am
 I don't wanna fit in
 my head's in the clouds
 I am not good in crowds
 I know—been that way since a child (Woo!)
 I am nobody else
 I'm just being myself
 I guess for now
 I'll just be the outcast (Ayy  oh!)
 tryna focus
 put it on the floor—tryna figure out my motives
 you should see me when the door opens
 might turn Joker like I'm Mike Posner
 I'ma die givin' everything that I have
 I don't need y'all's respect
 I don't ever take a night off
 better hop outta my car
 better find one
 it was therapy for me
 shut up! I'm tryna tell 'em my story!
 I wasn't yellin' at y'all  I was talkin' to the voices
 I'll just be the outcast (Ayy  oh!)
 I'll just be the outcast (Ayy  oh!)
Wrote this whole record while I was levitating
Sittin' in my room with the pen and paper  I'm innovative
They've been afraid of me since I was a second grader
I'm the kid on the playground mama told you to never play with
There's levels of music—and I'm in the elevator
Going up to the top floor  look how we elevated
What  you don't know the brand by now? You better get educated
Take both of my arms  rip 'em out the sockets and separate 'em
Don't matter  I still write a better record than yours without a hesitation
Never been more motivated
Just look at all the minds I have opened and penetrated
That's why they come to my shows wearing the NF hoodies and hats low like we're carrying weapons  ah!
Put the controllers away  it's game over
I promise I'm way colder
The fans keep saying that they're hungry for new music
Well that's pretty convenient 'cause I just made a plate for 'em
And I don't hear what none of y'all are saying
I just sit at the keys feeling the music
Got me thinking I'm Beethoven
The game needs a makeover
If you've been waiting  the wait's over
Yeah  they waiting on me to match the
Emotion that I had in the last one
What if I don't  they gon' tell me that I'm losing my passion?
If I do  am I repeating my actions?
There ain't nothing I can write that'll match that
My biggest fear writing this record wasn't putting out trash
It was disappointing myself and the fanbase
Now I want you to picture me:
I'm in a hotel rapping  crying on the floor of the bathroom
Tryna figure out if I'ma always feel the way that I feel or maybe someday I can learn to be happy
Pain's always been the root of my music
If I cut it off  how am I supposed to keep growing
If I let it go  won't my whole career be in ruins?
That's when I realized this whole conversation is stupid
I never cared to impress people that don't even know me
I just write what I feel  somehow it started a movement
Trying to enjoy a career  but I don't know how to do it
When I spend all of my time being afraid I'ma lose it!
But  then I figured out the reason they follow me
The reason why these fans surrounding me
It's not 'cause I'm a Rap God
I don't need you people to bow to me
All they ever did was doubt on me  now everyone's proud of me
Acknowledge me or not  you ain't ignoring the following
I'm just teaching 'em something they couldn't learn in they colleges
This is for the kids feeling like they live at the bottom and every day of they lives  feels like it's darker than Halloween!
Couple hundred thousand  that's what we did last year
Listen to Intro III  trying to kill my fear
They'll get that in a minute
We about to shatter the critics
I am a savage  admit it
A lot of baggage I live in
That's why the passion is different
Really don't care if they get it
We're only three records in it and this is just the beginning
I'm home!

I read your article  it kinda hurt me
I don't know who hired you or what your friends say in your circle
But the fact that you released it tells me two things are for certain
They get paid for trashin' people  I get paid 'cause I stay workin' (Yeah)
Dropped The Search and they emerge up outta nowhere to the surface
Just to peek behind the curtain  throwin' salt at all my burdens
I'm aware I shouldn't give this my attention  life's a journey
I should just stay on my path and learn to laugh  you think they heard me?
Why don't they find someone way more interesting to write about?
Us  we're kinda boring  aren't we? All we do is whine and pout
It's confusing  so amusing how I argue with myself
Hello
I spit it with ease  so leave it to me
You doubt it  but you better believe
I'm on a rampage  hit 'em with the record release
Depend on the week  I'm prolly gonna have to achieve
Another goal  let me go when I'm over the beat
I go into beast mode  like I'm ready to feast
I'm fed up with these thieves  tryna get me to bleed
They wanna see me take an L  yep  see what I mean?
How many records I gotta give you to get with the program?
Taken for granted  I'm 'bout to give you the whole plan
Open your mind up and take a look at the blueprint
Debate if you gotta  but gotta hold it with both hands
To pick up the bars  you gotta be smart
You really gotta dig in your heart
If you wanna get to the root of an issue
Pursuin' the mental can be dark and be difficult
But the pay off at the end of it can help you to get through it  ayy

Somethin' new  even when I lose  I make it look cool
Do the show  then we hit the room  wife is lookin'  oh
What to do? I don't need the shades up to like the view (Yeah)
It's time to get back in the swing of things
When my life crashes  I'm not the guy that'll flee the scene
I'll take ownership and own it and raise my hand if it's me
Just remember though  I'm only a man  I'm a human being
Don't they see? Shoot the breeze  I'd rather just stay discrete
People claim they're in your corner  but leave you in times of need
They don't listen  do they? (What?) They don't listen to anything
I'll accept advice if it's not presented ignorantly
Look  costs are high  they multiply
Then cause divides  I'm forced to fight
The poison I been sippin' on has quite the bite  it killed me twice
They rigged the lights so y'all can see
The parts of mine that aren't so bright
See  often I apologize  then authorize the awful times
To pop up (Nate!) like I'm right behind you
I'd advise you not to try to climb inside the mind like I do
Keep the rhyme book  expedite it  overnight it
Hold it tight and hope that time is on my side
'Cause if it's not  then I'll decide to override my own demise
I toe the line too close and I could improvise
I'd empathize  but recognize
The fact that I could jeopardize and wreck our lives
You better give me your attention  the undivided

Spread the news  I'm on the loose (Woo  woo  woo)

When did I lose myself?
All the words that leave my tongue
Feel like they came from someone else
When did I become so cold?
When did I become ashamed? (Oh)
Where's the person that I know?
I'm paralyzed
And if life is pain then I buried mine
I'm in the race of life and time passed by
Hands in my pockets
I just watch 'em
I'm underwater but I feel like I'm on top of it
I'm at the bottom but I don't know what the problem is

That nurse came into my room  she told me I'm sick in the head
I'm in hip-hop's hospital bed  with a pad and a pen and a brace on my neck
They told me that I'm never leavin'
Why? I am as ill as it gets
Any rapper that say that they runnin' the game
I'ma come in they session and cut off they legs  woo!
Strap a grenade to my head  pull out the pin
My music is mind-blowin'
Ain't nobody do it like I do it
You ain't ever been on my level
I got a problem with the way they keep on talkin'
And actin' like everybody gonna get it
Better sleep with your eyes open
You wanna know what I noticed?
Look around at my fan base and they ready (I see you!)
That last album was heavy (I see you!)
That last album was gritty
How you gon' match that? Just let me
Do what I do best  you're better off playin' Russian roulette
Than comin' in a booth with me 'cause I get
Y'all better watch it  take a look at where the clock is
It's my time
This ladder of music that I climbed
I took the machete  the game isn't ready
Them rappers  they comin' up on me
What  you lookin' for a high-five? Nice try! (Woo!)
Do not believe everything that you read on the internet
I do not know who your dentist is
But he should clean out your mouth
Don't call me a sellout  that's something I've never been
I've been through hell all my life though
But I know what Heaven is
Father forgive me  for I am a sinner
But You gave me music as medicine  woo!
If nobody want a problem when they get in my zone  better leave me be!
I'm a mean MC
Better feed me rappers or feed me beats  agh!
Feed me both of 'em
Umm  I'll let you know if I make it! (Yeah)
I wonder what life would be like
If I didn't stick out my neck
Two hundred dollars inside of my bank account  woo!
I was livin' on that
I need some money to pay for my rent
I need some money to pay for my gas
I'm not complainin'  I'm just bein' honest
I promise that I will not beg for respect  nah!
I get so frustrated  take a look at what I've created
Time is wasting  and I ain't waiting
You ain't never been in my book and I got a problem with it  why? 'Cause you actin' like you read my pages
I wreck these stages
Real talk  better give me space 'cause I am chasing
Something they told me that I won't make it  agh!
I'm not famous  I'm just Nathan (Woo!)
And I wonder how the world gon' take this
They might hate it
But you know anything about me
You know that don't mean I'm changin'
'Cause you know I'm real with it
Don't care if you feelin' it  I'm feelin' it
You don't like it? Then deal with it
And if God ain't real  real isn't
Used to wonder why I existed
I exist in the world that's real different
I doubt they will get it
My life is a mess  better watch your step when you step in it
Some of this brain is off-limits
I'm off in a world you don't get
'Cause you ain't ever been in it
In ten minutes I still couldn't explain what's inside my brain  don't mess with it
I've invested a lot of me inside these lines  I'm just protectin' 'em
Everybody wanna hear the real version of life
Then don't get so sensitive when I say something a little bit raw
I jot my thoughts and they call it negative
You wanna know where my heart is?
I stand out 'cause I wear my garbage
I work my hardest
And every time I look into the mirror I don't forget about where I started  woo!

Say goodbye to the old me

I know I could die any moment
If I do  just remember this
Yeah  handouts create lazy people I'm not impressed with
You want something in life  then why don't you go and get it?
Actions speak louder than words do—it's pretty quiet  isn't it?
Look at the world we live in  defined by comment sections (Woah)
Surround yourself with people that challenge how you think
Not people that nod their head and act like they agree
Those people will cut you open just to watch you bleed
These people gon' tell you that you won't ever make it
Then when you do  they gon' say they knew you were goin' places
That's just how it works  next thing you know you'll be overrated
Hearing people say they miss the old you—it's crazy  ain't it?
And perfect people don't exist  so don't pretend to be one
I don't need pats on the back from people for my achievements

If I do  just remember this
Yeah  don't take opinions from people that won't listen to yours
If money's where you find happiness  you'll always be poor
If you don't like the job you have  then what do you do it for?
The cure to pain isn't something you buy at liquor stores  nah
The real you is not defined by the size of your office
The real you is who you are when ain't nobody watchin'
You spend your whole life worried about what's in your wallet
For what? That money won't show up in your coffin  woo!
I fell in love with my pain and I slept with my regrets
Happiness saw it happen  maybe that's why she up and left
Joy called me a cheater  said she ain't coming back
I've always had a problem with relationships
But that's what happens when you see the world through a broken lens
Mistakes can make you grow  that doesn't mean you're friends
Yeah  they say when you grow up
You'll understand when you're older

We ain't friends anymore  you don't know me

That's kinda weird 'cause I don't remember signing my name up
Coming from people that give advice but never take none
I heard that life's too short  don't let it pass you by
We waste a lot of time crying over wasted time
It's not about what people think  it's how you feel inside
My biggest failures in life are knowing I never tried  woo!
I look at the world from a different angle
People change  even Satan used to be an angel
Think twice before you're bitin' on the hand that made you
Don't believe what you believe just 'cause that's how they raised you
Think your own thoughts  don't let them do it for you
Say you want a drink  don't wait for people to pour it on you
Cut out the liars  stay close to people you know are loyal
I've been overworkin' for weeks
I go home then purchase some things
That I know will not fill my needs
Have a dose of what I've achieved
Then get lonesome and I critique
Who I am and what I believe
Make up standards too high to reach
Untrained animal off the leash
Brought your hammock to hang with me?
Like a mannequin that can speak
What I have in store is unique
I just mop the floors with MCs
I can't stop until things are clean
I'm an amateur's what you think
So you stand there in disbelief
'Til I dislocate both your feet
Lots of action in every scene
I'm kidnapping all of your dreams
Hold 'em hostage and watch 'em scream (Ahh!)
Took a vision of my dreams
And then found a better way that I can make it
Something for you thinking you might run circles 'round me
Back in style like I was vinyl
I make songs and they go viral
Something's off if I go idle
They don't like this side of me 'cause I lack in compliancy
I question what I can see if you're not playing my CD
When I'm low I feel like I'm spiraling
Rip that cocky smile right off your face for thinking you're close to me
Selfishly watching y'all helplessly pretend you're on my planet
Trash bag is prolly buried somewhere full of my ashes
They gon' have a list of issues long as my shirts
'Til I open up on the beat like on my Therapy work
 it's time to let
 yeah
 I've
 but I'm all done
 scared
 yeah
 but I
 but I
 I'm done
 ooh)
 ooh)
 but
 I've already given you too much
 tell the truth
 don't be a fool
 I love you but not e-
 you're
 I (Ayy)
 but I think it's time to let go and say our goodbyes
 scared
 but I
 but I
 I'm
 ooh)
 so I'm not late
 my head aches
 great
 but at this rate
 my roommate's
 but don't pay
 but he still stays
 but she won't say
 but okay
 pull out the driveway
 pull up to the pump
 I look at my ashtray
 I park and walk inside—wait!
 I guess
 and now he wants to start a war
 I can't afford to
 gun is on the fore-
 I can't die today
 tryin' not to shake
 where's my cellphone at?
 icing on the cake
 I can hear 'em yellin'
 I want every dime! (Yeah)
 throw some cigarettes inside (Yeah)
 give me any kind
 I'm runnin' low on time and
 I don't wanna have to pull the trigger
 it's not a pretty picture
 you don't believe me? I'm just playin' with ya
 did he hear me movin'? Shh!
 could You send 'em to my present?
 and I start runnin' at him
 does he? Steppin' closer
 squeezin' on his throat
 then his elbow hits my nose and
 I try
 but my hands begin to slip and bullets start to fly
 I think it's still behind the counter
 did they call the cops?
 then he grabs my shoulder
 he's
 but the shirt he's wearing
 I know he knows I know
 he holds the barrel up
 get on the ground (*gunshots*)
 he's dialing 911
 grab his phone and try to help him up
 what's your emergency?
 I think he might've lost a lot of blood
 I think they're dead
 take a deep breath
I don’t know  it's alright
I've been dealin’ with some things like every human being
And really didn't sleep much last night (Last night)
I'm sorry  that's fine
I just think I need a little me time
I just think I need a little free time
Little break from the shows and the bus rides  yeah (Bus rides)
Last year I had a breakdown
Thoughts tellin' me I'm lost gettin' too loud
Had to see a therapist  then I found out
Somethin' funny’s goin’ on up in my house
Yeah  I started thinkin' maybe I should move out
You know  pack my cart  take a new route
Clean up my yard  get the noose out
Hang up my heart  let it air out (Air out)
I’ve been searchin'
What does that mean  Nate? I've been learning
Grabbin' my keepsakes  leavin’ my burdens
Well  I brought a few with me  I'm not perfect
Lookin' at the view  like this concerns me
Pickin' up the cues  right? I'm quite nervous
Hate it when I lose sight  life gets blurry
And things might hurt me
It's prolly gonna be a long journey  but hey (But hey)
It's worth it  though
Cold world out there  kids  grab your coats
It's been a minute  I know  now I'm back to roam
Lookin' for the antidote to crack the code
Pretty vivid  I admit it  I'm in classic mode
Don't need pity given to me  but I can't condone
Talkin' down to me  I'ma have to crack your nose for crackin' jokes
I'm lookin' for the map to hope  you seen it? (You seen it?)
Been makin' a whole lot of changes
Wrote a song about that  you should play it
I get scared when I walk on these stages
I look at the crowd and see so many faces  yeah
That's when I start to get anxious
That's when my thoughts can be dangerous
That's when I put on my makeup and drown in self-hatred
Forget what I'm sayin'  and—
Where'd the beat go?
Oh  ain't that somethin'?
Drums came in  you ain't see that comin'
Hands on my head  can't tell me nothin'
Got a taste of the fame  had to pump my stomach
Throw it back up like I don't want it
Wipe my face  clean off my vomit
OCD  tryna push my buttons
I said don't touch it  now y'all done it
I can be critical  never typical
Intricate with every syllable  I'm a criminal
Intimate  but never political  pretty visual
Even if you hate it  I'll make it feel like you're in it  though
You call me what you wanna  but never call me forgettable
Leave you deep in thought  I could never swim in the kiddie pool
Way that I been thinkin' is cinematic  it's beautiful
Yeah  the sales can rise
Doesn't mean much though when your health declines
See  we've all got somethin' that we trapped inside
That we try to suffocate  you know  hopin' it dies
Try to hold it underwater but it always survives
Then it comes up outta nowhere like an evil surprise
Then it hovers over you to tell you millions of lies
You don't relate to that? Must not be as crazy as I am
The point I'm makin' is the mind is a powerful place
And what you feed it can affect you in a powerful way
It's pretty cool  right? Yeah  but it's not always safe
Just hang with me  this'll only take a moment  okay?
Just think about it for a second  if you look at your face
Every day when you get up and think you'll never be great
You'll never be great—not because you're not  but the hate
Will always find a way to cut you up and murder your faith  woo
I've been developin'  take a look at the benefits
Nothin' to meddle with  I can never be delicate
Am I even relevant? That depends how you measure it
Take a measurement  then bag it up and give me the evidence
Pretty evident  dependable can never be tentative
I'm a gentleman  depending on if I think you're genuine
Pretty elegant  but not afraid to tell you to get a grip
Proper etiquette  I keep it to myself when I celebrate  ah (Ah)
It's that time again
Better grab your balloons and invite your friends
Seatbelts back on  yeah  strap 'em in
Look at me  everybody  I'm smilin' big
On a road right now that I can't predict
Tell me Tone that down  but I can't resist
Y'all know that sound  better raise your fist
I was talking to fans
And one of 'em pulled me aside and said
We never met  but I swear that you know who I am
I've been through a lot
I don't know how to express it to people  don't think that I can
But I got that Mansion CD on rotation
It's crazy for me
Kids hit me up  say they slittin' they wrists on the daily
This music is more than you think
Don't book me for just entertainment  it's entertainin'
Hearin' these parents  they telling their kids
My music is violent—you gotta be kidding me
I guess that your definition of violence and mine
Is something that we look at differently
How do you picture me  huh?
Want me to smile  you want me to laugh?
You want me to walk on the stage with a smile on my face
When I'm mad and put on a mask? For real though
I mean  what you expect from me?
I'm tryna do this respectfully
They say that life is a race
I knew my problems would prolly catch up eventually
I do my best to be calm
How you gon' write me and tell me you'd slaughter my family?
That's just a glimpse to the stuff that gets sent to me
These are the parts of my life they don't never see  woo!
I am aware  it's aggressive
I am not here for acceptance
I don't know what you expected
But what you expect when you walk in a therapy session  huh?

This girl at the show looked me in the face
And told me her life's full of drama (Yeah!)
Said her dad is abusive
Apparently  he likes to beat on her mama
I got so angry inside
I wanted to tell her to give me his number
But what you gon' do with it  right?
You gon' hit him up then he'll start hittin' her harder  that's real
These kids  they come to my shows
With tears in they eyes
'Magine someone looking at you
And sayin' your music's the reason that they are alive
Sometimes I don't know how to handle it
This type of life isn't glamorous
This ain't an act for the cameras (Nah!)
You see me walk on these stages
But have no idea what I'm dealing with after it  nah!
I put it all in the open
This is the way that I cope with all my emotion
I'm taking pictures with thousands of people
But honestly  I feel like nobody knows me
I'm tryin' to deal with depression
I'm tryin' to deal with the pressure
How you gon' tell me my music does not have a message
When I'm lookin' out at this crowd full of people I know I affected? Agh!
I got some things in my life (My life)
I know I should let 'em go (Let 'em go)
Let me jot it down (Jot it down)
Let me take a mental note (Mental note)
I put it all in this microphone (Microphone)
Think about that for a minute
What is the point of this song? I'm just ventin'
But what you expect from a therapy session  huh?
Therapy  therapy session
Therapy  therapy session
What you think about me
—That doesn't worry me
I know I handle some things immaturely
I know that I need to grow in maturity
I ain't gon' walk on these stages  in front of these people
And act like I live my life perfectly
That doesn't work for me
Christian is not the definition of what perfect means  woo!
I ain't the type to be quiet
I ain't gon' sit here in silence
If I wouldn't say what I say to your face
Then I promise you  I wouldn't say it in private
I am not lyin'
People go off on my page  and I'm tryin' to quit the replyin'
But this is ridiculous
You want me to keep it a hundred?
Okay  I'll keep it a hundred
I see a whole lot of talkin' on socials
But honestly  I don't see nothing in public
I kinda love it  yeah
Why don't you write us some happy raps?
That would be awesome
All of your music is moody and dark  Nate
—Don't get me started (Yeah!)
You wanna know what it's like if you met me in person?
Listen to my verses
This music is not just for people
Who sit in the pews and pray at the churches  nah!
I won't reject it
I don't expect everyone to respect it
I don't expect you to get my perspective
But what you expect from a therapy session?
Huh?
I mean  I think sometimes people—they confuse what I'm doin'
I write about life  I write about things that I'm actually dealing with
Something that I'm actually experiencing
This is real for me
Like  this is something that personally helps me as well
I'm not confused about who gave me the gift
God gave me the gift and He gave me the ability to—to do this
And He also gave me this as an outlet
And that's what music is for me
When I feel something  whether it's anger
Um  it's a passion about something—or frustration
Like  this is where I go
This is—this is—that's the whole NF Real Music thing  man
This is real for me—I need this
 and we go to bed angry
 I promise I'm changing
 drive you up the wall when I'm workin'
 I say somethin' that hurts you
 but we both in the same room
 which I know you relate to
 isn't it? 'Cause both of us know
 might get distant and I push you away
 I'ma do whatever it takes even if—
 and we go to bed angry
 I promise I'm changing
 I need time (Oh)
 time (Oh)
 way before I bought you the ring
 sittin' on the edge of my seat
 overanalyzin' everything
 tryna find a better version of me
 but you're close to it
 I'm tryin' to work through 'em
 I apologize for all of the stress
 you know I love you to death even if—
 and we go to bed angry
 I promise I'm changing
 I need time (Oh)
 time (Oh)
 I need time (Oh)
 and we go to bed angry
 I promise I’m changing
 drive you up the wall when I’m workin'
 I say somethin' that hurts you
 but we both in the same room
 which I know you relate to
 isn’t it? 'Cause both of us know
 might get distant and I push you away
 I'ma do whatever it takes even if—
 and we go to bed angry
 I promise I'm changing
 I need time (Oh)

 I apologize for all of the stress
 you know I love you to death even if—
 and we go to bed angry
 I promise I'm changing
 I need time (Oh)
 time (Oh)
 I need time (Oh)
 why don't you help me?
 I know I'm selfish
 my soul is jealous
 but I reject it
 I'm drowning
 they surround me
 but I don't feel it
 but then you steal it
 but I feel speechless
 you call it weakness
 I'm drowning
 they surround me
 I'm drowning
To get ahead of what I think I know is comin'
It's obvious you got a problem if you always tryna make it seem
As if you've never been afraid  then why you runnin'?
I could never look at what I do the way that other people can
And walk away  I can't be separated from it
Stickin' out my neck is how I made it where I'm at
(I'm) Outlandish  take chances
Gotta get it while I can with my damage
My sanity could leave but if it vanished
Don't matter to me  I'd still manage
Gue-guеss you could say I'm at an advantage
My vantage point can be quitе lavish
Got so many cadences  no way to pick
One  which bag is my hand in
Depends what mood I'm in
Lord knows I'm a hooligan
Losin' it  who can get gruesome with
You if it comes down to it?
You can bet I shoot direct  defuse the threat
And they wonder why the music has a huge effect?
Could it be 'cause I've been the go-to when it comes to depth?
'Cause I'm the one that they be callin' when the people get fed up
And want the music with the visuals  I got a vendetta
For any part of me that wanna make it hard to get set up
But take away the happiness  it can be kinda pathetic
But when I look at everything that's tryna give me a headache
'Cause I can see a side of me you'll never see  you can tell
When I'm at the breakin' point  I finally had to sit with the devil
I went into hell and I asked him what the problem is  yellin'
He tried to get me to live with him  even called me a sinner
And told me everything about me doesn't feel like a winner
So why continue when he's tellin' me I might as well give up?
But got offended when he told me I would live in a kennel
And I can never leave it  even if I made it to Heaven
He'd find a way to get me back and send a demon to get me
Skin and bones meet my ego
How's he look? He don't eat much
Let him starve  I don't feed him
Lift off when I'm ticked off  my pitfalls I latch on to like a pit dog
I sit calm with a sick thought of a sitcom of the life I live
Life I live's more like a sci-fi flick
I hide in  wanna watch? Dive right in
My silence doesn't mean I'm dyin'
Just means I'm careful with the time I spend  so

Tech N9na  next king up
Everyone knowin' that I'm a death bringer
That lingua vexing ya
Leavin' a regular rapper resting  bruh (Chyeah)
This is what  I give it such
An incredible wicked rush  a vivid gush
Of poetical livid stuff to rid his gruff
Said  I better go rip it rough and I lit it up
The prestige I gather from people lovin' the Tech speed (Whoop)
Lyrically elect me  Jet Li
The beat  it got ya bobbin' until your neck bleed (Whoop)
That is tellin' me Let's feed
On the bitter the bogus the hitter will focus
Deliver the doses and give a critter the dopest
Spitter to flow sick and now the quitter corrosive
A swig of the roguish'll give your liver cirrhosis (Chyeah)
The boogie monster reppin' with NF in the hoodie
Want to step into the session and fully conquer
The weapon to lessen our profession go bully bonkers (Chyeah)
Left in a wreck  never checkin' nor could he stomp us
Take his crown
Thought he was gonna make us run away in a battle with his fakeish frown
Shake his ground
Like I'm the Mechagodzilla  I'm such a killer when I break it down (Uh)
These flows are the cheat code for the weak Joes
That need those elite bros with the heat  so
They can eat on the D low
Off a beast yo' ego  got it vetoed (Chyeah)
Please close your beak foes  delete scrolls
Taken from me  thieves chose to try to decode (Chyeah)
Reload the beat  so I can reach each soul
I am the chosen and everyone is beholdin'
My energy is golden 'cause dominion is being broken
From enemies in the open approachin'  I'm never jokin'
The remedy bein' spoken  I'm hopin' that you're soakin' it up (Chyeah)
I'm in the motion  I'm dope and I'm never chokin'
My devotion to floatin' like an ocean  the Holy Ghost and
I'm scopin' the evil folk and revokin' the wicked notion
I'm croakin'  I'm really floatin' and quotin' that I'm closin' it up (Chyeah)
Talkin' behind my back
End up where N9ne is at see me and say
Kinda wack  you could not find the knack
Hit you with a rhyme attack freely and spray
I'ma beat you 'cause I'm greedy and slay  if you're creepy and cray
I'ma eat you like PB&J  kiwi and grapes
I'ma demolish 'em when the T be in play  pray!
A stunna recordin' in my number three Jordans
Dungaree sportin'  the tongue on me is gonna be scorchin'
The punishin' hunter eat like a hung-ary orphan (Chyeah)

In the room without a closet for skeletons

Take a seat  let me tell you my ridiculous dreams
I wanna rap  yeah  I know it's hard to believe
And I can tell you're already thinkin' I will never succeed
But I'm okay with it  I admit the lyrics are weak
I've been workin' on 'em  I'll be good eventually
I understand you gotta crawl before you get to your feet
But I been running for a while  they ain't ready for me  ahh
I know this prolly isn't really realistic
And honestly  I might not ever make a difference
But that don't make a difference  I'ma have to risk it
I've been crunchin' numbers  you ain't gotta be a mathematician
To see the odds ain't rootin' for me
I can't lie though  it's kinda how I like it to be
The underdog  yeah  you prolly think you know what I mean
But what I'm saying is they ever push me  I'm gonna swing  yeah
I could go to college  get in debt like everybody else
Graduate and prolly get a job that doesn't pay the bills
That don't make a lot of sense to me  forget the Happy Meals
I don't like the dollar menu  I would rather make a meal
Huh? Make a mil'? Nah  I said make a meal
Home-cookin'  get the grill  how you want it? Pretty well?

Everything I oversee  I just like to overthink
Mockin' me  you pay the fee  no return and no receipts
Those of you that don't believe  quiet  you don't know a thing
Quiet when I'm tryna sing  quiet when I'm making beats
Quiet when I'm tryna think  sorry  I don't mean to scream
I just feel like no one really gets me and it's sad to see
'Cause someday I'ma grow up and show all of you it's meant to be (Yeah)
Anybody wanna hear me rap? No
Come on  let me play a couple tracks  No
Come on  I can spit it really fast  No
You think I should throw this in the trash? No
Tricked ya  haters  go away before I hit ya
I am not a beggar or a kiss-up
You don't understand? Well  I forgive ya
I am not a quitter  you ain't really think that  did ya?
Maybe someday I could even be up on the radio
Have a tour bus and maybe even play a couple shows
Everybody in the crowd singing every word I wrote
Tellin' me that I am not the only one that feels alone
Huh? You feel alone? Yeah  I kinda feel alone
Wonder if that feelin' ever goes away when you get old
Will I ever make it as an artist? I don't really know
Might not make a lot of dough

Yeah  what's your definition of success? (Ayy)
I don't trust the thoughts that come inside my head (Woo)
I don't trust this thing that beats inside my chest
Who I am and who I wanna be cannot connect  why?
Don't think I deserve it? You get no respect (Woo)
I just made a couple mil'  still not impressed
Smile for a moment then these questions startin' to fill my head  not again!
I push away the people that I love the most  why? (Woo)
I don't want no one to know I'm vulnerable  why? (Woo)
That makes me feel weak and so uncomfortable  why? (Ayy)
Stop askin' me questions  I just wanna feel alive
Until I die—this isn't Nate's flow (Woo)
Just let me rhyme  I'm in disguise
I'm a busy person  got no time for lies  one of a kind
They don't see it  I pull out they eyes  I'm on the rise!
I've been doin' this for most my life with no advice (Woo)
Take my chances  I just roll the dice  do what I like
As a kid  I was afraid of heights  put that aside
Now I'm here and they look so surprised  well so am I  woo
They don't invite me to the parties  but I still arrive
Kick down the door and then I go inside
Give off that I do not belong here vibe
Then take the keys right off the counter  let's go for a ride
Why do y'all look mortified? (Ayy)
I keep to myself  they think I'm sorta shy  organized
Let You Down's the only song you've heard of? Well then you're behind (Woo)
Story time  wish that I could think like Big Sean does  but I just can't decide (aah!)
If I should stick my knife inside of Pennywise
I  I don't care what anybody else thinks—lies (Haha)
I do not need nobody to help me—lies
I kinda feel guilty 'cause I'm wealthy  why?
I don't understand  it's got me questionin' like
Why? Just tell me why—not back to this flow
Inside I feel divided
Back when I ain't had a dime  but had the drive
Nothin' to me's ever good enough
I could be workin' for 24 hours a day and think I never did enough
My life is a movie  but there ain't no tellin' what you're gonna see in my cinema (No)
I wanna be great  but I get in the way of myself and I think about everything that I could never be
Why do I do it though? Ayy  yeah
Why you always lookin' aggravated?
Not a choice  you know I had to make it
When they talk about the greatest  they gon' probably never put us in the conversation
Like somethin'  then I gotta take it
Write somethin'  then I might erase it
I love it  then I really hate it
What's the problem  Nathan? I don't know!
I know I like to preach to always be yourself (Yeah)
But my emotions make me feel like I am someone else
Me and pride had made a pact that we don't need no help
Which feels like I'm at war inside myself  but I forgot the shells
I hold my issues up for all to see  like show and tell
A lot of people know me  but not a lot know me well
Hold my issues up for all to see  like show and tell
A lot of people know me  but they don't know me well
