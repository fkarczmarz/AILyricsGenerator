Let me see you're Betty Boop
And I always up and leave
But for the first time in a while
I wanna throw away the key
And I know you've been in a couple more relationships than me
'Cause you talk a different talk
And you kiss me differently
After you loved me this way
After you loved me so good
How are you gonna tell me you don't wanna stay? Oh
I gave you what you wanted
Like a boy
You won't wake up beside me
'Cause I was born in the '90s
Like a boy (Go and treat me like)
Boy (Go and treat me like)
Boy (Ooh)

Ooh  oh  yeah
Why are we lookin' down on our sisters and brothers?
Isn't love all that we got? Mmm
Don't we know everyone's got a father and mother?
The day we know we're all the same
Together  we can make that change
Look around  there are too many of us crying
And not enough love to go around  oh-oh  oh
What a waste  another day
Another good one dyin'
But I know that the world will change
The day we know we're all the same
Why can't we just get along?
If lovin' one another's wrong
Then how are we supposed to get close to each other?
We gotta make that change  yeah
Why can't we just get along? Mmm

You got to lower the noise a little bit now
If she knows you're in love  she's gonna run  run away
I'm not making the same mistake
Won't be putting my heart on display
I'll just water my feelings down
I'm not going out looking dumb
Telling all my friends how you're the one
Those words never leaving my mouth
But the feeling gets
Stronger  baby
What am I gonna do now
When you touch me?
'Cause it's all getting too loud
Charlie  be quiet  don't make a sound
You've got to lower the noise a littlе bit now
If she knows you're in love  shе's gonna run  run away

But the feeling gets
Stronger  baby

On your mama's couch
2012 was nothing serious
And then we caught the feels
It got really real
Too good to be true
I thought that I'd be better when I found someone new

Shouldn't have been so cocky
Shouldn't have did you wrong (Woah)
Guess you don't know what you got until it's gone

There ain't no lips like your lips
And nobody else feels like this
(Cheating on you)
I thought that I'd be better when I found someone new
(Found someone new)
I said goodbye
This is gonna hurt  but I blame myself first
'Cause I ignored the truth
Drunk off of that love  it **** my head up
There's no forgetting you
You've awoken me  but you're choking me
I was so obsessed
Gave you all of me
I loved you dangerously
More than the air that I breathe
Knew we would crash at the speed that we were going
Didn't care if the explosion ruined me (Me  me)
Baby  I loved you dangerously
Mmm  mmm
I loved you dangerously
Usually  I hold the power with both my hands tied behind my back
Look at how things changed
'Cause now  you're the train
And I'm tied to the track

Baby  I loved you dangerously
And kissed my lips with goodbye
It was a matter of time
You know I know
There's only one place this could lead
But you are the fire  and I'm gasoline
I loved you dangerously
Ooh  more than the air that I breathe
Didn't care if the explosion ruined me (Me  me)
Mmm  mmm
Ooh  I loved you dangerously
While the truth is written all over your face
Soon as you hang up the phone (Yeah)
I just got one question that you might not be ready for
But I really gotta know
Ain't no way that you can say you don't remember
How I kept you coming over every night
If loving someone else is just a lie
Soon as you hang up the phone (Don't hang up the phone)
I just got one question that you might not be ready for
But I really gotta know

Oh-oh-oh-oh

Hands on your body like there's no one at the party

Turn that television up so nobody can listen
Hands on your body like there's no one at the party

Girls are all the same

And all the things that I believe
Baby  if you leave me now
A little in advance
Then I would've had some time to go and work it out
I think I've lost my chance
For the last three years I just hid it so well
Hoping that you'd figure it out because I never could tell it
Straight to your face
Never have I ever woken up in a cold hard sweat
From a dream wondering if you'd ever say Goodbye
If I didn't say it first
I'm done playing these games
I can't believe what I'm about to say
I won't tell you goodbye with my love left behind
Kiss me before I fucking lose my mind
Drink until my loneliness
Up 'til two A.M
Pacing 'round the bar
Hopin' that you might walk in

Ooh

'Cause I would rather die than feeling this inside
Tricks played on my mind
My love left behind
Guess you never know what good you got until it's gone
Thought I could find somebody new who could take your place
But there's only room for you in my world
But you say that I've changed like the East Coast weather
How the hell did I get caught up messin' with these LA girls?
I miss my baby
I'm missin' my baby (LA girls)

Messin' with these LA girls

Wish I could've seen that it was perfect how it was (Listen)

I'm down on all my luck
Sometimes  there's no one there by your side
I don't deserve this  baby
But I know I can't give up
Tough times  I'll just take them in stride
I said times are changin'
Tell me  how can I keep up?
Every time I turn around  there's a wall
But I'm climbing daily until I see the top
And I get up right after every fall
When you're brokenhearted and your lost without me
Flash every smile 'cause I've been lost for miles

When you only wanna do me dirty?
But I hit right back
Why you always wanna act like lovers
But you never wanna be each others'?

Up all night
Up all night
All the things that you said to me yesterday
Playin' over in my mind
It's a crime
It's a crime
How you're reelin' me in with the games you play
Then you hang me out to dry
So I tried to shake you out my head
Tried to dance with somebody new
Plus you got those lips so red
And that smokey voice you do
So I know it's pointless anyway
'Cause there ain't nobody else
That could light me up so bright
And break this crazy spell

Up all night
Up all night
All the things that you said to me yesterday
Playin' over in my mind
It's a crime
It's a crime
How you're reelin' me in with the games you play
Then you hang me out to dry
If I wait a little longer
Then maybe you'll come back around
Wait a little longer
Then maybe you'll be ready now
'Cause I would wait forever
For you to fall back into my arms
So come on
Up all night
Up all night
All the things that you said to me yesterday
Playin' over in my mind
It's a crime
It's a crime
How you're reelin' me in with the games you play
Then you hang me out to dry
Up all night
Up all night
All the things that you said to me yesterday
Playin' over in my mind
It's a crime
It's a crime
How you're reelin' me in with the games you play
Then you hang me out to dry
How you're reelin' me in with the games you play
We don't talk anymore  like we used to do
We don't laugh anymore
What was all of it for?
I just heard you found the one you've been looking
You've been looking for
I wish I would have known that wasn't me
'Cause even after all this time  I still wonder
Why I can't move on
Just the way you did so easily
Don't wanna know
What kinda dress you're wearin' tonight
If he's holdin' onto you so tight
The way I did before
I overdosed
Should've known your love was a game
Now I can't get you outta my brain
Oh  it's such a shame
That we don't talk anymore  we don't talk anymore
We don't talk anymore  like we used to do
We don't laugh anymore
What was all of it for?

I just hope you're lyin' next to somebody
Who knows how to love you like me
There must be a good reason that you're gone
Every now and then  I think you
Might want me to come show up at your door
But I'm just too afraid that I'll be wrong
Don't wanna know
If you're lookin' into her eyes
If she's holdin' onto you so tight
The way I did before
I overdosed
Should've known your love was a game
Now I can't get you outta my brain
Ooh  it's such a shame
That we don't talk anymore  we don't talk anymore
We don't talk anymore  like we used to do
We don't laugh anymore
What was all of it for?
Like we used to do
Don't wanna know
What kinda dress you're wearin' tonight
If he's givin' it to you just right
The way I did before
I overdosed
Should've known your love was a game
Now I can't get you outta my brain
Oh  it's such a shame
That we don't talk anymore  we don't talk anymore
We don't talk anymore  like we used to do
We don't laugh anymore
What was all of it for?
(Don't wanna know)
(What kind of dress you're wearin' tonight)
(If he's holdin' onto you so tight)
The way I did before
(I overdosed  should've known your love was a game)
(Now I can't get you outta my brain)
Oh  it's such a shame"
