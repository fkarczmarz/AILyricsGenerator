"Look at me  bitch  I'm an American superstar
I got guns for the snitches  roses for the bitches
Hop up out the whip  paparazzi taking pictures
I got guns for the snitches and roses for the bitches
Hopping out the whip  paparazzi taking pictures
Got guns for the snitches  roses for the bitches
Hop up out the whip  paparazzi taking pictures
I got guns for the snitches  roses for the bitches
Hopping out the whip  paparazzi taking pictures
Heavy metal for them boys  plenty petals for them gals
Got an appetite for destruction  you can call me Axl
Ask me bout what a nigga done done
Ask me bout what a nigga do well
Ask me bout where them bricks come from
That's what a snitch nigga do  they tell
I don't want nothing to do wit that there
If its a lick then I'm bringing them shells
Only position for me is a player
That's rite player  better get it right player
Might have to be an emergency
Lucky for you I'm up blowing my trees
Calming my nerves  no regular weed
Or somebody's shorty wit me  on her knees
I'm ready if its a problem  she sexy  Flo Rida hotter
Come test me get that revolver  ya messy just like a mobster
My broads deserve lobster  you're flawed  deserve choppers
Get served like Jimmy Hoffa  American show stopper

On top of more money  on top of my shit like flies
Open that Ferrari F-5 like eyes
Bumpin' down Ocean Drive
Jumpin out that Maybach with a bitch
Went back to tease them thighs
She gotta tattoo on her booty and it said 305
DJ Khaled say it's a movie now  don't forget your lines
'Cause you don't want me to edit  before we roll them credits
Bitch  give me my credit  I'm so energetic
I'm fucking like a rabbit  smoking on lettuce
Whatever I want I get it  I meant it if I said
And I say I keep a pump  and I ain't talking unleaded
If you want it come get it  cause boy I'm ready
I get that fast 'fetti  they should call me Tom Petty
Got two bitches  one peanut butter one jelly
I'm an american gangsta  already and I'm an American superstar

Had a dream of diamonds and stilettos
First class in Miami from the West Coast
Never wanted to be homecoming queen
Not just another girl in the strip club
Working hard  not a dollar's gonna miss her
Making sure she's gonna come home with me
One money  two honey
How much can I throw?
And for her I can't say no
I won't let go
I fell in love with a dancer  dancer
Throwing all this cake  ooh
It's your birthday girl  I like that there
In the champagne room until the sun comes up  oh my god
It's 3AM and we're only getting started
In the cab on the way to your apartment
Tonight you made the killing cause you're gorgeous
Yeah  we're gonna have a hell of a time

She was the neighborhood dream girl
When the groupies came to the show
When the money started to grow
Look at this girl we made now
Been around the world and I came right back for your love
Forgive me for the days and nights I was cutting up
Wanted the motions in the ocean and emotions covered up
From flashing lights in the club to magazine covered up
Fly you to Miami and cop you floor seats
And you would always tell me your heart was for me
Way before the models ripped the runway

Hey  I heard you were a wild one
Ooh  ooh
If I took you home  it'd be a home run
Show me how you do
I wanna shut down the club with you
Ooh  ooh
P-p-party rocker  fa' sho' stopper
More Chambull  number one club popper
Got a hangover like too much vodka
Can't see me with ten binoculars
So cool  no doubt by the end of the night
Got the clothes comin' off then I make that move
All black shades when the sun come through
Uh-oh  it's on like everything goes
What happens to that body is a private show
Stays right here  pri-private show
I like 'em untamed  I'm talkin' high pain
Tolerance  bottoms up with the champagne
My life  call my homie then we hit Spain
Keep it busy with the bail  we get insane
Hey  I heard you were a wild one
Ooh  ooh
If I took you home  it'd be a home run
Show me how you do
I wanna shut down the club with you
Ooh  ooh
I am a wild one  break me in (Yeah)
Saddle me up and let's begin (Yeah)
I am a wild one  tame me now (Now)
Running with wolves and I'm on the prowl
Show you another side of me
A side you would never thought you would see
Tear up that body  dominate you 'til you've had enough
I hear you like the wild stuff
Hey  I heard you were a wild one
Ooh  ooh (Oh)
If I took you home  it'd be a home run
Show me how you do
I wanna shut down the club with you
Ooh  ooh
I am a wild one  break me in
Saddle me up and let's begin
I am a wild one  tame me now
 baby
 baby
 it's my dime
 it's alright
 baby
 my model
 it's my dime
 it's alright
 baby
 get it
You're like a twenty-karat diamond (Diamond)
The finer things in life were shining
How 'bout that late night wine and dining? (Dining)
You want that expensive clutch
And I'ma give that five-star experience (Yeah)
Show you the kinda love
That you can only get when you give enough
Get you a fancy yacht any chance I got
When I become a zillionaire
McQueen or Jimmy Choo and I'll get 'em real quick
Get you a fancy yacht any chance I got
When I become a zillionaire (That was perfect)
I'm gonna work it to impress you
Get you that dress and then undress you
See Flo Rida LiveGet tickets as low as $28You might also like
You want that expensive clutch
And I'ma give that five-star experience (Yeah)
Show you the kinda love
That you can only get when you give enough
Get you a fancy yacht any chance I got
When I become a zillionaire
McQueen or Jimmy Choo and I'll get 'em real quick
Get you a fancy yacht (It's me) any chance I got (I got)
I hope you can handle
Living this lavish
If you got a passion for fashion
Engines and platinum
I got the answers to questions
Get you a fancy yacht any chance I got
When I become a zillionaire (I'm rich)
A little bit of you (Ayy)"
