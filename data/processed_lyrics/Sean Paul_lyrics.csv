Hit the gin then hit the drank
Pop a bottle  buy the bar
Before I came through I had to hit the bank
Always toss a bitch or two

Got you pussy niggas spooked
Still hood  now I can buy the hood
My bitch bad  she fuck good
Mob around all through the town
I wish one of you hatin' niggas would
Life of a millionaire
On the way to be a billionaire
All I like is stripper poles
And white hoes in their underwear

Sit and remember all the things that we spoke of
All of the serious reasonings an all di tings we make jokes of

The covenant the righteous have with Jah Jah
