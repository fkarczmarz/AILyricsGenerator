"Can't even tell you about my experience (Montana!)
My stomach's in pain
I hope I don't throw up all over what you told
But it hurts me to know
You like to say that you're right
Did it make you feel bad
When you cheated on your man last night? (Whoop!)
Did I even ever cross your mind?
You like to say that you're right
Did it make you feel bad
When you cheated on your man last night? (Whoop!)
Did I even ever cross your mind?
You like to say that you're ri—

(Montana! Hey)
Bought a hundred chains now the bitches all linger (Linger)
Still ridin' through the strip catchin' licks with my dog
Shorty fell in love with a young rich nigga
Blunt full of smoke and a cup full of liquor
Say what I mean and I mean what I said baby
You like to say that you're right
Did it make you feel bad
When you cheated on your man last night? (Whoop!)
Did I even ever cross your mind?
You like to say that you're right
Did it make you feel bad
When you cheated on your man last night? (Whoop!)

You like to say that you're ri—
I lied to be someone else for you
If I had done something a little bit differently
If you were human
If you were who I'd assumed you were
I thought I did something
But she would do anything to bring me down
And she brought me down
You say that you love me but you act like you don't
Don't take this the wrong way:
You put me in harm's way
And you weren't lying when you said it would sting
Don't take this the wrong way:
You put me in harm's way
Don't take this the wrong way—mhm—mhm—mhm
I thought that I loved you but we weren't in love
We weren't in love
You liked to think we would push through the battle
Ignoring the problems just to hold what we had
Don't take this the wrong way
The whip black and white
My bitch black and white
(On some mixtape shit like)
My 'fit black and white
I'll never decide  I've changed every week
I won't stay in the middle  I'll kill everything
Yeah  I'm stuck in between if I'm wrong or I'm right
I would ask for advice but I'll just do what I like
Can't get over the fact  people living a lie
Just to stay entertained  what a waste of a life
What a waste of a space  what the fuck is your point?
You're a waist with no spine  you're a waste of my time
I smoke 'cause I'm stressed  I try to get high
But it gets me depressed  (Oh) I'm just tryna get by
I'm just drivin' at night  I got no music on
I got no favorite song  it's just me and my thoughts (Aw  man)
I've fallen in love  I've fallen behind
I've fallen for her  more than once  only twice (Aw  man)
I fell in the pool  (Damn) got chlorine in my eyes
And it burned for a minute  but I didn't go blind
This is for my friends who play
In the old cafes and they kick it in the parking lot
(They call me one take Jake  baby)
(Aw  man) I been away from the scene
(Woo) But I mean what I speak  what I feel with a broken heart
(What that? Okay  I got that big fat snake  baby  woo  hold up)
I've been getting money all day  so I can spend it all on us
(Uh  they call me one take Jake  baby)
I've been getting money all night  so I can spend it all on us
(Haha  yeah  I got that big fat snake  baby)

I don't mean to get deep  (Uh) it's just one of those weeks (Aw  man)
Couldn't tell you the day  couldn't tell you the time (Yeah)
Trouble falling asleep  (Yeah) for the past couple nights
Trouble being alone  I've been losing my mind
But I don't want any trouble  it just chooses to find me (Aw  man)

The guests were checking in
The concierge was cold
The water pipes had mold all over them
The room was fit for two
The bed was left in ruins
But no one would let him in
I want you to touch me there
Make me feel like I am breathing
Feel like I am human
Dancing through the night
A vodka and a Sprite
A glimpse of her silhouette
A night that they'd never forget
I want you to touch me there
Make me feel like I am breathing
Feel like I am human
I want you to touch me there

Somebody else might take my place
When I wake up  I'm afraid
Somebody else might take my place
On the fence  all the time
All my friends always lie to me  I know they're thinking
You're too mean  I don't like you
Fuck you  anyway
You make me wanna scream at the top of my lungs
It hurts but  I won't fight you
You suck  anyway
You make me want to die  right when I

 having fun  I remember
 when the story first begun  I remember (I remember)
 holding the things I've done
 I did)
 we all have fun with water guns
 da-da-dum-dum-dum
 we played
 we didn't want to get older)
 I learned a ton  I didn't run
 and I was still testing my luck  oh
 we played
 we didn't want to get older)

 we played
 we didn't want to get older)
 we were young
 having fun  I remember
 I remember
And a box that's hidden under her bed
I was only twenty-two with a pocket full of truth
But I gave her everything that I had
We were born and raised in the Golden State
Mommy's gone and daddy's doing his best
(Yeah)
But her socks were at the end of my bed
Got our names tattooed on each other
Just to prove to each other that we'd do what we said
Only took a few days 'til our minds were made up
And we thought we should try it again
I was only seventeen when we first tried things
Who am I gonna call? (Ooh)
Who's gonna catch me when I— (Ooh)
Who's the one you're sleeping with? (Ooh)

To those of you in which I choose to always be the closest to
There's something that you need to know
Loving me is not a joke
And I'll adopt it all because that's just what a buddy does
If it ever comes off wrong or leaves you with a bitter taste
Just remember you're the tea
Told me to stay away
She told me her man was afraid
Told me I better behave
Baby just came back around
Told me she's leaving this town
Said she needs time to explore
She said I can't love her no more
Thinking about her
She's gone all the time
I think if you found her
That even you would know
So baby packed up all she had
Promised to never come back
She left me alone and without
Skin I could study about
Tiles get colder to touch
And I guess that was never enough

(Told me I better behave)
Thinking about her
She's gone all the time
I think if you found her
That even you would know
Start me up  then you make a stop like
Why you gotta put me in the spotlight?
But you don't even ever hit the spot right
But never riding through
You get me up to let me down
One too many times to count
Why you gotta do that? (Why?)
You're the one who blew that
Make it tough to get it out
You're done but I'm ready now
Why you gotta do that? (Why?)
You're the one who blew that
Every time you come you do
Every time you come you do
Call me up to comfort you and now I'm like
Baby  it's already been a long night
Keep playing it cool but it's time to change the mood
Get to moving or you can move along
Stuck inside of your cage (I'm stuck right now)

Thought you did something you didn't

Sweet and sour motivation
Wish I could keep concentration
I've been getting high
It's keeping me low now
I'm doing it alone now
I think I gotta slow down
And I know I
I gotta take control now

I feel like a ghost now

You know I never know which way to go
I think I need you with me for all-time
When I need new direction for my mind
You listen to my lectures on the phone
You help me find the treasure in the hole
You'll tell me if I'm acting like a fool
I know that you're not something to lose  now
I've got something to confess
I keep you in my pocket to use
You're my only compass
I might get lost without you
Could you tell me where to go?
You're always there to help me when I'm down
I'm lucky you've been keeping me around
You're the star I look for every night
When it's dark  you'll stick right by my side
I've got something to confess
I keep you in my pocket to use (I keep you in my pocket)

And you might have to tell me again
It's crazy what you do for a friend
Nobody does it like you do
I know how much it matters to you
I know that you got daddy issues
And if you were my little girl
I'd do whatever I could do
I'd run away and hide with you
I tried to write your name in the rain
But the rain never came
So I made with the sun
The shade
Always comes at the worst times (Ah)

Half of me has disappeared
You know that your daddy did too
You know what your mama went through
Nobody does it like you do

I'll keep you far away from me like a star
Hard not to fall for you  I gave you all my heart
Tryna find the right time to tell you what you might not like to hear
I can feel the zeitgeist stuck inside the pipeline for some years
I wanna be your lifeline but everybody can't be a millionaire
I'll be in the night sky  shinin' like a light on always there
You're in my DNA  I can't keep away no matter how hard I try
You're runnin' through my veins  something I can't change
That's the same reason why we're
Further apart  the closer that we are
I'll keep you far away from me like a star
Hard not to fall for you  I gave you all my heart
Now I'm in a new place  I can feel the room change when you're here
Had to run and do things  never meant to leave you in the rear
You're always in my brain  and I take the blame
No matter who's wrong or right
I'm on a one-way train headed far away  but you're still on my mind
Further apart  the closer that we are
I'll keep you far away from me like a star
Hard not to fall for you  I gave you all my heart
The closer that we are
I think I found something
I think I found something in my TV screen
I think I found out that I have nothing
That I have nothing in this place for me
They'll take me from my bed
Leave everything that is worth a single cent
And just take me instead
That TV show I saw as I fell asleep
Had me on both my knees
And don't let the police know
Don't tell them anything
Don't tell them anything
I think I can tell
I think I can tell them
Tell them they were made for me
I'm thinking they'll know just about everything
I bet they planned it all out like the shows
Went everywhere I go
Walked in the store right behind me
Stood in line right beside me and followed me to my home
That I would never run
That they could shoot but that's no fun
'Cause then they're killing the stolen son

Don't tell me about the rules and break them

Don't say you love me more
Better not say it
I met her at church
But she could be Satan
You and I are two oceans apart
When I'm too far from you
Don't tell me about the rules and break them
And don't tell me about mistakes
And make the same ones I have made before
Don't say you love me more
Better not say it

She didn't want him to run  he didn't want her to fear
Nobody said it'd be easy  they knew it was rough
But  tough luck
I fell in love today  there aren't any words that you can say
That could ever get my mind to change
She's enough for me  she's in love with me
You're a doll  you are flawless
But I just can't wait for love to destroy us
I just can't wait for love
The only flaw  you are flawless
But I just can't wait for love to destroy us
I just can't wait for love
So  she put his heart in a bag  he wouldn't ask for it back
He didn't want her to cry  she didn't wanna be sad
She said  You better not leave me

I fell in love today  there aren't any words that you can say
That could ever get my mind to change

Tangled between your little flaws
Your flaws  your flaws  your flaws
You're a doll  you are flawless

Something I hate  all for your sake
I'm such a fake  I'm just a doll
I'm a rip-off  and it turns you on
Bought some new clothes
Then I polish my toes
Then I powder my nose
In case you get close (Get too close  baby)
Knock on your door
Then I put on a show
Then I gave you the floor
And you just froze
Every day  you want me to make
Something I hate  all for your sake
I'm such a fake  I'm just a doll
I'm a rip-off  and it turns you on

You won't ever look back
Ooh  just a little bit can make you wonder
You got it in
Hands up  it's a stick up
Nobody's leaving this room for a minute
Everyone's breathing these fumes that are in it
Sick of the people who make the decisions
Put your hands up  it's a stick up
Hopefully God is still down to forgive us
Nobody's breathing  who let the evil in?
What's in the water?
Are you bothered?
What's the problem here?

Ooh  just a little bit can make you wonder
Handcuffed and I thought of you
I made love and I thought of you
My daddy died  I just thought of you
My sister cried and my mama too
I got a place and I thought of you
I tried to decorate and I thought of you
I'm seeing red but I'm singing blue
I never knew what black and white would fade into
I'm begging  I'm even on my knees
I've got a dozen insecurities
But I don't think you should be worried for me
No  I don't think you should be worried for me
Ooh  I know once you come to California
You won't ever look back
Ooh  just a little bit can make you wonder
There's something 'bout the way
Ya got me shaking like a seizure
No mistaking
I would die for your Heaven
I could lie here forever
Every night we're together
If you'd like  I'll do whatever
You really want
You remind me of my mom
You make me feel like God
And I'm watching you fall from above
There's something 'bout you  baby
There's something 'bout the way

You got a heart from Heaven
But you're burning like Hell
When I feel like I'm strangled
You treat me like an angel
Show me all different angles
When you leave  I don't wanna try
And if you stick with me  I'll be fine
'Cause your love's rubbing off on me
Tell me how'd you get so heavenly?
There's something 'bout you  baby
There's nothing like the way you get me high
You got a heart from Heaven
If I made it too hard for you maybe you should’ve changed it
Say it  you should say it
Cause I'd say I was wrong just to make it fill all the spaces
Waiting  always waiting
If I gave you control would you say that we could've saved it?
I hope you find a way to be yourself someday
In weakness or in strength
Change can be amazing
So I pray for the best  I pray for the best for you
I wish you could be honest
I wish you could be honest with me  with me
I wish you could be honest
I wish you could be honest with me  with me

Why’d you fake it?

When you question God himself?
Why would you ask for God's assistance
If you wouldn't take the help?
If you're gone then I need you
If you're gone then how is any of this real?
When I'm on I believe you
How could you tell me that I'm great
Why would you tell me that it's fate
They say the end is coming sooner
But the end's already here
I said today is but a rumor
That we'll laugh at in a year
If you're gone then I need you
If you're gone then how is any of this real?

My mind playin' tricks  tryna' to break my zone
Lost a lot trying to reach the throne
Many nights I ain't make it home
She want me there  it's like I need a clone
I guess that's why I wrote this song
Just hopin' you would call my phone
Money hit my line  I'm on tour like all the time
Girl  you know I'm on my grind
I just need some peace of mind
I hope she hear this shit and press rewind (Why?)
We went our separate ways until next time
It's not a race  it's a marathon
At times  I feel a step beyond
I take it as a lesson learned and then we cross the finish line
Thank God I woke up in the morning
See the sunshine through the blinds
At times  I sit and reminisce on all the things I left behind
Rest in pieces  peace of mind
Someday we will reunite
This is the shit that your baby vibes to
Promise you that I'll make a baby with you
Make a mama of you  ain't no drama with you
My baby brings heat like a mama does too
I'll pay homage to you and college for the babies
I'll even move your mama to the Bahamas and maybe
I'll take you on the open road
And you'll take me where the ocean goes  ooh
I'm getting cheesy on these jungle drums
I sound like Weezy on a million (A milli  a milli)
The money's comin' and I know it but
The money doesn't have control of us
This is the shit  make your mama start crying
Not because she's sad  'cause her baby's alright
That baby's her pride  that baby's her life
And mama would break down if that baby did die

From a...
I'm from a little city with expensive taste
Where the cars don't run till the engine breaks
Wasn't spending pennies on massive things
But invested in mess with this recipe
Couldn't quite see what the future held

Remember what the people said

Let it go

Shouldn't try to fix it if it keeps getting better

Touch my neck and I'll touch yours
She knows what I think about

So let me hold both your hands in the holes of my sweater
And if I may just take your breath away
I don't mind if there's not much to say

To move to a place so far away
The goosebumps start to raise
The minute that my left hand meets your waist
And then I watch your face
These hearts adore

Mama told me not to try

Jump onto new streets  jump onto new streets (Ah)
Jump onto new streets  jump onto new streets
Me  I'm from a different type of left land
Old wild west land
Nose bleeds  palm trees and tumbleweeds rustling
Outside they say it's happy here but it's depressing
Too many pretty faces catching my attention
So I look at them
Remind myself in this smudged glass
That pretty isn't everything  you punk-ass
Always hard to see past the surface when it looks so perfect
But our eyes will disguise dirt on purpose  you listening?
I grew up here under the sun
In grade school  I was the odd one out of the bunch
And I don't mean I was the kid to eat bugs for lunch
I was the one who wasn't coming from where they're coming from (Uh)
I speak poetically and never pride my ignorance
But this California shit is rigorous
They say it's happy here  happiness is figurative
I'm happy 'cause of me  doesn't matter where I'm living
If the sun was God  I'd be covered in faith
If the ocean was the devil  I'd be covered in hate

Mr. Know-it-all had his reign and his fall
At least that's what his brain is telling all
If he said help me kill the president
I'd say he needs medicine
Sick of screaming let us in
The wires got the best of him
All that he invested in goes
Woah-oh-oh-ohh-oh
Woah-oh-oh-ohh-oh

He tells me to be raw
Admits to every little flaw
That never let him sit upon the top
Won't tell me to stop
Thinks that I should be a little cautious

If you can just let me know if it's okay
 what? Cannon's what up!
 it's never good enough
 yeah
 baby
 in every way
 honey
 I knew you wouldn't stay
 ya hang it out on me
 I don't wanna worry 'bout a little hiccup ('Bout a little hiccup)
 baby
 in every way
 honey
 I knew you wouldn't stay
 baby
 honey
 I knew you wouldn't stay
 I do not know where you're running to
 I'm the one for you
 if I'm cruel to you
 I'm a fool for you"
