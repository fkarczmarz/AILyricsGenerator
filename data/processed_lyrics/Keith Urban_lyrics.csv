lyrics
"See you over there starin' at your drink
And
Chances are you're sittin' here in this bar
'Cause he ain't gonna treat you right
Probably not my place but I'm gonna say it anyway
'Cause you look like
You
Blue...
Looks good on the sky
Looks good on that neon buzzin’ on the wall
I’m tellin’ you...
You don’t need that guy
I'm not tryna
Be another just pick you up kinda guy
But I just
I don't understand how another man
Can take your sun and turn it ice cold
Had enough to drink and it's makin' me think
That I just might
Tell you
If I were a painter I wouldn’t change ya

'Cause blue
Looks good on the sky
Looks good on that neon buzzin' on the wall
I’m tellin’ you...
You don’t need that guy
Mmm
It ain't your color baby
Blue
Looks good on the sky
Looks good on that neon buzzin' on the wall
I’m tellin' you
You don’t need that guy
Blue ain't your color
You pray more than you breathe
And you just wanna fall to pieces
Where dreams become walls
And you just need a break
Break on me
Shatter like glass
Come apart in my hands
Break on me
Put your head on my chest
Let me help you forget
When your heart needs to break
Just break on me
There'll be times when someone you know
Becomes someone you knew
But you'd do anything to change it
And words you wanna take back
But you know you can't
When the page just won't turn
And it still hurts
Break on me

Break on me
Shatter like glass

When your heart needs to break
Just break on me
Break on me
You did up your hair  now you're goin' out
You put on that party dress
Even though your heart's a mess
Your friends swung by  you jumped in the car
You walked in here and now here we are
Puttin' the hurtin' on some José
And catchin' up while the band plays
You say you miss the girl you used to be
Bet I can find her if you let me
I can put the smile right back where your smile goes
Dreams back in what you see when your eyes close
I'll be the buzz that you feel when you sip slow
Slow dancе right back in your dirt road
I can put the sun right back in your sunshine
Bring a little lovе back into your late night
Ain't gotta be nothin' more than one more drink
And maybe I can take the blue out of your brown eyes  baby
And that wild side that you learned to tame
She'll roll in like a midnight train
Almost like she never left here

Put the full back in your half empty
And put the two in your step again

What city you in? (Oh)
I don't wanna call you  then I wanna call you
I miss the old you (Oh)
I think of a message to send
My phone is at seven percent
But when I go to try to reach you
I never can get through
I was the problem  self sabotaging
You had no option (Oh)
You had to go  when you had to go
And I couldn't stop it (Oh)
I was not willing to bend
You said it again and again
You need a heart that better fits you
So you changed your world
You changed your hair and the clothes you wear
And your pillow's side
You changed your number and got some friends
That I don't recognize
But I wonder sometimes
Is it too late to try?
If I change
Would you change your mind?

Emotionally stranded  left you abandoned
Took you for granted (Oh)
And I should've listened  showed my commitment
When you said we're drifting (Oh)
If we could live in reverse
I'd go to the part where it hurt
I'd go and fix the little issues
Before they got too big
Is this all your way to try to not remember me? (Oh)
A beautiful disguise  so you're not who you were with me? (Oh)
But I think I know you so well
Enough that I think I could tell
Are you afraid to say you miss me?

Oh  woah
Mm  would you change your mind?
Living someone else's life
I'm turnin' into concrete  harder than these city streets
Where no one even cares if I'm alive
I gotta get it right  mmm
There's a place that I know where they all know me

Coming home (Comin' home)
These sidewalks filled with different faces (Ooh-hoo)
So many places  but there's none like mine
That no trespassing sign
We sat on the tailgate
And watched the planes take off
We thought we had all night
There was no need to rush
That's when those cops
Came pulling up
And I thought
Your daddy's gonna kill me
But if I survive tonight
I wouldn't change one thing
But there was something 'bout the way
The blue lights were shining
Bringing out the freedom in your eyes
I was too busy watching you going wild child
To be worried about going to jail
You were thinking that running for it would make a good story
I was thinking you were crazy as hell
I fell in love in the back of a cop car

And I laughed
He got mad and slammed the door

How does that hit you?

I didn’t feel a thing
But suddenly I was rising higher
And I felt like I just made
The biggest mistake
When I thought about my unborn child
When I thought about my wife
And the answer rang out clear
From somewhere up above
No greater gift has man
Than to lay down his life for love
Could I make that sacrifice
If it came down to it
Maybe you don’t understand
I don’t understand it all myself
But there’s a brother on my left and another on my right
And in his pocket just like mine
He’s got a photograph
And they’re waiting for him back home
It’s weighing on my mind
I’m not trying to be a hero
I don’t wanna die

Cause if it came down to it

She rolls with it
Quick with a snap decision
I'm fine with it
Strong on her strong opinions
I'm weak for it
Mmm
Mmm

She's a maniac in the bed
But a brainiac in her head

She got the stars comin' out of her eyes
She'll wake you to make love in the middle of the night

I'm a man brought back to life
Castor and Pollux sent you to save me
I've returned to my Gemini
Ooh
Spinning around the room
Midnight  where did it go?
All the time  all the friends left waiting
Never made it 'cause we kept making out
In the driveway  who would've thought
In the driveway  that we would get lost
In that dashboard radio static
Makin' our own kind of magic
Oh-oh
Oh-oh
But we're still right here and you already know that
I should leave
Put the car in drive  babe
But your kiss keeps tellin' me to stay

Moving from one to another
But you got me changing my ways
I’m breaking all the habits I’ve made
I could make a habit of you

Staying up till two
‘Cause you’re stuck in my head
It’s a symphony you sing to me
When you call out my name
I don’t know what else to do
But make a habit of you
Habit of you

Cut out the smokes and I stopped staying up all night
I quit checkin’ my phone and I'm savin’ my dimes

Afraid of the wind and the lightning
Sometimes you get a little bit insecure
Sometimes you wonder if you're even good enough
Hiding from the morning when it's too much
But there's so much waiting behind the door
And I know and I know and I know
That you just wanna dance in the light
Don't you know? Don't you know? Don't you know?
You're alive
So just let your horses run
To the limit like never before
Let's be lost and young
Wanna show you what your heart is made for

 for a quarter
 baptized by rock and roll

 baptized by rock and roll
 oh

And hang a disco ball from an old oak tree
Smoke and drink once in a while
Somehow it’d be good for me
I want a cool chick that’ll cook for me
But’ll dance on the bar in her tan bare feet
And do what I want when I want
And she’ll do it with me
I don’t need too much of nothing
I just wanna sing a little chill song
Get my groove on
Pour something strong
Down in my drink
That I don’t need a whole lot of anything
I just want a little bit of everything

Now I don’t need a garage full of cars
But I’ll take a whole box of Cuban cigars
And I’ll smoke ‘em nice and slow
Like they were good for me

But I like to get a little bit of dirt on my hands
A big ole couch in a big ol' room
Still feels lonely when it’s just you

I’m in deep  falling deep into the picture
In my mind of everything we’re going to do
Over at the lake and down by the river
You can feel it start to rise
Want to jump in my car  go wherever you are
Because I need you by my side
With your feet up on the dashboard now
Singing along with the radio  it’s such a beautiful sound
And when you say my name in the middle of the day
I swear I see the stars come out
When you hold my hand in the back of my mind
Just waiting for the sun to go down
The sun to go down
I want to see your brown skin shimmer
In the sun for the first time
I gotta be the one who knows just what to do to you
To get me that smile
One chance of meetin'  you were walkin' by me
On the street and I said Hi
And that was the beginning of my heart spinning
Like these wheels in my head tonight

Hey  yeah
You were holding onto me
Another late night reverie
Seconds felt like years to me
And I guess we should have known
It was too good to go on
But there's something about us that I just refuse to let go
I remember
I remember summer nights
You were like a midnight daydream
Neon lights
We were making waves in the backseat
Everytime I close my eyes
I sink into the pain of the memory
I'm holding on for what it's worth
I guess I love the way it hurts
So good

Like nobody loves you

Maybe lookin' through your camera roll
The tequila's startin' to take a toll
As messed up as me and all alone
And all of your friends have all gone home
And you hatе that the truth is nobody leaves your hеad and your heart
And your bed and your sheets as messed up as me
As messed up as me
When you get mad  you stay that way
And you always say you're doin' okay
But we both know it's probably a lie
And you're fallin' to pieces on the inside

I go with the flow
I used to fight against the tide
But I learned my lesson and now I know
That there's a better way to live this life
You've got to find your song and just sing it
And there's a better way to feel alright
Let it all go and let love take control
I just ride
Coming alive
It feels so good just watching the world going by
Why would I wanna live any other way
Than riding my wave? Yeah
We all got problems
I've had my share of pain
But it made me who I am today
You got to find your wave and just surf it
To heal all the hurt 'cause you know you deserve it

Takin' shots with the night owls

Can't you give me some space 'stead of shouting out  Oh my God?
Oh-oh  ooh-yeah

I go out with some new friends
But it just makes me miss you more  more

The band plays a song you like and you sing along
Raise em up
I'm talkin' 'bout Daddy's old pickup truck
Get those white sails sailing down in Mexico
It's just a whiskey glass if you ain't makin' a toast
Lift your tear-filled eyes up to the sky
Tonight were gonna
Raise 'em up

Go make some noise
Don't ever let 'em tell you who you are

And I moved out of that shoebox apartment
I've been wearing brand new clothes
Different bars and different streets
Different parts of town
A different Friday crowd
There's different songs on the radio
Who am I kidding?
Everything's different now
Everything
But the same heart that loved you's still beating
There's always gonna be a scar

You grabbed my shirt and pulled it over my head
And your fingertips slide up and down my back
Breathin' hard  steamin' up the glass
So I've been sleeping 'til noon in the same bedroom
Where I once held you and it's breaking my heart

And I've been lookin' back and thinking 'bout  the way it was
The way we were  we were reckless  so reckless
When I was with you  baby  I was Superman
Yeah  we were sky high  there was nothing better
When I was with you  grabbin' that live wire
We were Johnny and June in a Ring of Fire
Now you're caught up in my head like a melody
Of the sweetest summer song that we used to sing
When I was with you (When I was with you)
On some starry summer nights  I still wonder where you are
Are you still breakin' all the hearts of all the boys that play guitar?
And just goin' through the motions of emotions
Been slippin' away  slippin' away
Hmm  but even with all that  girl  I'd still trade a few heartbeats
For one more sleepless night  tangled up between your sheets
And I've been lookin' back and thinking 'bout the way it was
The way we were and those hundred mile an hour curves

And the rope by the river hangs silently

I miss you baby
By my name on a fake ID
And still 'bout a hundred away from the day
Your daddy said you could run with me
We were a couple of line steppers
Who just couldn’t wait to step over the line
Never thinkin' we wouldn't last
I was your first and you were mine
And we were leather jackets hangin’ onto a Harley
Two heartbeats in the moonlight
We were both feet hangin' out over the edge
Of the water tower skyline
At least there's a little bit of sweet in the bitter
Though a part of me is always gonna miss her
Mm-hmm
Had it all laid out in our mind

This goes out to the drifters

Lifting their guitars and painting the sky

(Can you hear me?)Can you hear me? (Oh)
All of you lost ones who aren't really lost ones
Keep shining your light (Keep shining)
This goes out to the wildcards
Who's got the wild heart
When I caught you looking my way
I smiled and just knew it
And up until you came along
And no one ever heard my song
Now it's climbing with a bullet
It's nice to have someone so honestly devoted
But when it's said and done girl I hope you know that
Would all be as good as gone without you
Oh Without you yea yea
Along comes a baby girl
And suddenly my little world
And people that I barely knew
They love me because I'm part of you
Man it's tough to figure

But still you and me somehow found each other
Would all be as good as gone without you
Oh Without you yea yea
Without you I'd survive
But I'd have to have the notion
That I could live this life
Just going through the motions
Would all be as good as gone without you
Without you
Without you baby baby baby without you
With the moon shining bright
As headlights on the interstate
I pulled the covers over my head
And tried to catch some sleep
But thoughts of us kept keeping me awake
Ever since you found yourself in someone else's arms
I've been trying my best to get along
But that's OK
Take your space and take your reasons
But you'll think of me
And take your cat and leave my sweater
Cause we have nothing left to weather
In fact I'll feel a whole lot better
I went out driving trying to clear my head
I tried to sweep out all the ruins that my emotions left
I guess I'm feeling just a little tired of this
And all the baggage that seems to still exist
It seems the only blessing I have left to my name
Is not knowing what we could have been
What we should have been
So

Someday I'm going to run across your mind
I'm going to be alright
While you're sleeping with your pride
Wishing I could hold you tight
I'll be over you
And on with my life
And take your cat and leave my sweater
Cause we have nothing left to weather
In fact I'll feel a whole lot better
But you'll think of me
Take your space and all your reasons
But you'll think of me
And take your cat and leave my sweater
Because we have nothing left to weather
In fact I'll feel a whole lot better
And you're going to think of me
Oh yeah
Oooh ooh ooh oh
Think of me
I don't know why it always ends this way
The boardwalk's quiet and the carnival rides
Are as empty as my broken heart tonight
But I close my eyes and one more time
We're spinning around and you're holding on tightly
No Fourth of July has ever burned so brightly
But you promised you'd be back again
And so I wander 'round this town
'til summer comes around
I got a job working at the old park pier
And every summer now for five long years
And I count the days 'til you just might come back
But then I close my eyes and one more time
We're spinning around and you're holding' on tightly
No Fourth of July has ever burned so brightly
But you swore that you'd be back again
And so I'm frozen in this town

Oh and I close my eyes and you and I
Are stuck on a Ferris wheel rocking with the motion
Hand in hand we cried and laughed
And Baby I'll be back again you whispered in my ear
But now the winter wind is the only sound
And everything is closing down
'Til summer comes around yeah
Mmm..."
