lyrics
"On & on & on & on
Wake the fuck up 'cause it's been too long
See  I be that gypsy flippin' life game from the right brain (huh)
Ascension maintained
Rolling through like a burning flame
Like a supernova star
She be the light when they in the dark
Morning
The moon pass the sun
Four constellations start forming
A cross up in the sky
But everybody wanna ask me why
What good do your words do if they can't understand you?
Don't go talkin' that shit Badu  Badu
What good do your words do if they can't understand you?
Don't go talkin' that shit Badu  Badu
Said I'm a Pisces
Zika deka del
Well  well  I'm raising hell
People always tryin' to find the world I'm in
I'm the envy of the women and I rule the men
Two fish  one swimmin' up stream
One swimmin' down livin' in a dream
But when she loves she tends to cling
When incense burns  smoke unfurls
Analog girl in a digital world
The Rasta style flower child
Zip dip dow  zip dip dow
The gold tooth smile
Split them vowels
Bling bloom bling  melanated
I'm 'bout ta give birth to church
But everybody want to ask this Earth
What...

Bridge!
I remember when I went
With Momma to the Washateria
Remember how I felt the day
I first started my period
Remember there in school one day
I learned I was inferior
Water in my cereal
Badu in your stereo
Holla if you hear me though
Remembering is good if you don't
Let it be the fear in you
Wrap ya head with this material (Material)
Cause you did not do your math
My cypher keeps moving like a rolling stone
Mad props to the God JaBorn
Things just ain't the same for singers
Gotta sing on the beats they bring us
But that's all I have  ain't got no mo'
But still the people really wanna to know
What good do your words do if they can't understand you?
Don't go talkin' that shit Badu  Badu
What good do your words do if they can't understand you?
To make you fall  so far from me?
And now  I can't recall
The cause of the fall  selective memory
Then you  you built a wall
A 20 foot wall  so I couldn't see
But if I get off my knees
I might recall  I'm 20 feet tall
My love  what did I do
To make you fall  so far from me?
And now  I can't recall
The cause of the fall  selective memory
Then you  you built a wall
A 20 foot wall  so I couldn't see
But if I get off my knees
Touch a four leaf clover
Maybe we'll get over
Try and love might come your way
Here I am  on a cloud
If you want me take the chance  try love out loud
As I drift through the sky
Shooting cupid's loving arrow you just might try
So don't miss baby  take your time
You've only got one chance  yes
Touch a four leaf clover
Maybe we'll get over
Touch a four leaf clover (If you wanna be with me)
Love my get you over (You better pick the right one)
Touch a four leaf clover
Maybe we'll get over
Try and love might come your way
Like the wind  I am free
Going places  being things I wanna be
To settle down is oh so hard
But I will grant you that one chance
So pick the right card
And don't miss it  take your time
You've only got one chance  ooh wee ooh wee ooh

And I was hangin' out with some of my artsy friends
People coolin' out until the break of dawn

Ooh  hey

Didn't cha know  didn't cha know

Knew the toll but I would not pay

Time to save the world
Where in the world is all the time?

Guess I was born to make mistakes
But I ain't scared to take the weight
So when I stumble off the path
I know my heart will guide me back

Okay  challenge
Leave your phone unlocked and right side up
Walk out the room without throwin' your bitch off balance
It's either on or off  ain't no in between when it's valid
I seem to wanna talk more and more 'bout what really matters
I've seen my aura hop out my torso and hit her backwards
Flip  watchin' you skip down my corridor  fuck a ballad
Don't need shit on the side no more  all entreé  fuck a salad
I often have awesome thoughts of tossin' this softer palate
So when we fall any wall  any stall  any crawl  any pause
Any scar  any tar  any dark will dissolve  kill them all
Build-A-Bear  build them all  build it where it won't fall
Give it all  give it my all  yeah
Don't wear any drawers  any bra  anymore  in it raw  isn't it raw?

While other emotions branch either directly or indirectly from these two emotions
Fear has a long and slow frequency vibration to it
While love has a very rapid and high frequency
Tone rises again as it becomes a whirling noise while flying by

His light was too bright so they turned away
And he stood alone

Where they hit me at?
They didn't hit you
What is this?
They fucking hit me
They hit me in my face
What?
Is there still someone up there?
They don't know their language
They don't know they're God
They take what they're given
Even when it feels odd
They say their grandfathers and grandmothers work hard for nothing
And we still in this ghetto
So they end up in prisons
They end up in blood
They keep us uneducated
Sick and depressed
(They end up in blood)
Doctor I'm addicted now
I'm under arrest
(They end up in blood)
We making mo' money than a motherfucker

With no choices there's no hope for us
