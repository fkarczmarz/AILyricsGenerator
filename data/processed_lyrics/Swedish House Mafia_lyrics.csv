"Ah  uh
Ah  uh
Did you?
Did you?
Did you?
 if I
 will you ride or will you die?
 wanna know
 got to go?
 be alone
 another minute? Uh
 another minute
 another minutе?
 preacher said I'm better off
 will you ride or will you die?
 got to go?
 be alone
 another minute?
 another minute?
 another minute?
 wait another minute)
 another minute?
 another minute
Here's a message that I'm sending out
I've got the answer to all your problems
And tonight I'll be singing it loud
Just surrender yourself to the rhythm
With your hands up in the sky
Feel the energy deep inside your system
And leave this world behind!
Leave the world behind you ...
Leave the world behind you ...
Leave the world behind you ...
And leave this world behind!
Alone
While the dew
Is still on the roses
And the voice I hear
And the voice I hear
And the voice I hear
And the voice I hear

Bitch  I'm up on the guest list with the Swedish House Mafia
You can find me on a table full of vodka and tequila
Surrounded by some bunnies and it ain't fucking Easter
I'll wake up in the morning with a mild case of amnesia
With a girl that like a girl like Lindsay Lo and Queen Latifah
And that's standard procedure from Miami to Ibiza
Yeah

The first strike of the hammer
Made my heart beat faster
The rat-tat to remind me
That there was something behind me
You can hear them
You can hear them banging on the tin
But my love won't be saved
We'll all be staring at the wave
They told me I wasn't anything
Before the bombs started falling
I was a fee for the master
I was a walking disaster
I know you hear it coming
I know you hear the sound
I know you feel it coming
Don't let it get you down
You can hear them
You can hear them banging on the tin
But my love won't be saved
We'll all be staring at the wave
But my love won't be saved
We'll all be staring at the wave
Dim the lights
So you can't see me
Close your mouth
Don't speak  just feel me
Closer we become
Together we will fall  than we're one
This night  this night
We give ourselves one night
Feel the kiss
And smile so softly
We're just friends
But I like you slightly
We won't cross the line
We'll go on proper  takes some time
Just a boy and a girl
Just us two in a world
A little bit of talk  a little bit of pleasure
A little bit of makin' out and than we work it out
A little somokey-smoke  tell me a dirty joke
Up on your roof  up on your roof
And we don't need nobody to have a little party
It's just us two  just us two
And we don't need nobody cause we go ladi dadi

There was a time I used to look into my father's eyes
Those days are gone  now the memory's on the wall
I hear the songs from the places where I was born
Up on the hill across the blue lake
That's where I had my first heartbreak
I still remember how it all changed
My father said
See heaven's got a plan for you
Don't you worry  don't you worry now
Yeah
Don't you worry  don't you worry now
Yeah
Don't you worry  don't you worry now
Yeah
There was a time  I met a girl of a different kind
We ruled the world  I thought I'll never lose her out of sight
We were so young  I think of her now and then
I still hear the songs reminding me of a friend
Up on the hill across the blue lake
That's where I had my first heartbreak
I still remember how it all changed
My father said
See heaven's got a plan for you
Don't you worry  don't you worry now
Yeah
See heaven's got a plan for you
See heaven's got a plan for you
See heaven's got a plan for you
See heaven's got a plan for you
Don't you worry  don't you worry now
Yeah
Yeah
The beating of my heart
The beating of my heart
It was the beating of my heart
How could I resist the chance to fall for you?
The beating of my heart
How could I not feel the way I do for you?
Haunting for you now
It was the beating of my heart
It was the beating of my heart
It was the beating of my heart
How could I resist the chance to fall for you?
The beating of my heart
How could I not feel the way I do for you?
Haunting for you now (In my head  in my head)
Haunting for you now
Haunting for you now
It was the beating of my heart
Sweet disposition
Never too soon
Oh  reckless abandon
Like no one's watching you
So stay there
'Cause I'll be coming over
And while our blood's still young
It's so young  it runs
And won't stop 'til it's over
Won't stop to surrender
Songs of desperation
I played them for you
So stay there
'Cause I'll be coming over
And while our blood's still young
It's so young  it runs
And won't stop 'til it's over
Won't stop to surrender
Won't stop 'til it's over
Won't stop 'til it's over
Won't stop 'til it's over
Won't stop to surrender
I turn the music up  I got my records on
I shut the world outside until the lights come on
Maybe the streets alight  maybe the trees are gone
I feel my heart start beating to my favorite song
Until Monday morning feels another life
I turn the music up  I’m on a roll this time
And heaven is in sight
I turn the music up  I got my records on
From underneath the rubble sing a rebel song
Don’t want to see another generation drop
I’d rather be a comma than a full stop
Maybe I’m in the black  maybe I’m on my knees
Maybe I’m in the gap between the two trapezes
But my heart is beating and my pulses start
Cathedrals in my heart
As we soar walls  every siren is a symphony
And every tear’s a waterfall  is a waterfall
Is a waterfall  oh
Is a waterfall  ooh
Is a waterfall  oh
Is a waterfall  ooh
Is a waterfall  oh
Is a waterfall  ooh
Is a waterfall  oh
Is a waterfall  ooh
So you can hurt  hurt me bad
But still I’ll raise the flag
Is a waterfall  oh
Is a waterfall  ooh
Is a waterfall  oh
Is a waterfall  ooh
Is a waterfall  oh
Is a waterfall  ooh
Is a waterfall  oh
Is a waterfall  ooh
Sometimes I feel like throwing my hands up in the air
I know I can count on you
Sometimes I feel like saying  Lord I just don't care
But you've got the love I need to see me through
Sometimes it seems that the going is just too rough
And things go wrong no matter what I do
Now and then it seems that life is just too much
But  you've got the love I need to see me through
When food is gone you are my daily meal (Oh-oh-oh)
When friends are gone I know my savior's love is real
You know it's real
You got the love
You got the lovin'
You got the love
You got the lovin'
You got the love
You got the love
You got the love
You got the lovin'
You got the love
You got the lovin'
You got the love
You got the love
Into the streets  we're coming down
We never sleep never get tired
Through urban fields and suburban lights
Turn the crowd up now
We'll never back down
Shoot down the skyline
Watch it on primetime
Turn up the love now
Listen up now  turn up the love
Who's gonna save the world tonight?
Who's gonna bring it back to life?
We're gonna make it  you and I
We're gonna save the world tonight
We're far from home  it's for the better
What we dream  it's all that matters
We're on our way  united
Turn the crowd up now
We'll never back down
Shoot down the skyline
Watch it on primetime
Turn up the love now
Listen up now  turn up the love
Who's gonna save the world tonight?
Who's gonna bring it back to life?
We're gonna make it  you and I
We're gonna save the world tonight
Who's gonna save...?
Who's gonna bring...?
We're gonna make it  you and I
Who's gonna save...?
Who's gonna bring...?
We're gonna save the world tonight
Who's gonna save...?
Who's gonna bring...?
