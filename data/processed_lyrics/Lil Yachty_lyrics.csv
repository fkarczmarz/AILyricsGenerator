"Taking pictures with all my ice
But I can't have no wife
I just want you for the night
I know you want this for life
Taking pictures with all my ice
But I can't have no wife
I just want you for the night (just for the night)
I know you want this for life
Fuck you so good you be calling out the Christ (oh my God)
Bottles of the Tech got it laid on ice
We spent four seasons at the Four Seasons twice
You be calling all your homegirls like I'm his wife
I sip dirty Sprite just to get me through the night
But I need you there (I need you there)
Promise that I need you there
Put that on my gang I swear
I just can't put you on front street like you want I know
But baby you is not no hoe
And I put it on my gang I'm not no average joe (average joe)

All in with a pair of twins in a Benz
Just bought a new necklace and it came with heavy winds
She suck me like a push-pop  she love cock
My brothers they been with me from the very start
Recorded in the closet with sock mics
If one fight we all fight  it's fight night

Black and white like a zebra
I don't sell furniture but nigga IKEA
I have an idea  headshot  ID ya
Media wanna see me in jail like Madea
If my career go south I'm going to South Korea
Macaroni sells  I been macking  making macarena
I'm cleaner than the cleanest
It's Byou  nice to meet you
This ain't a cookout but my meat on her grill
I started off like I'm a goonie
When I got in they gave me a toolie
I'm high off these snacks like I'm Scooby
I can't be no average joe
Never fucked an average ho
We lit and you know it's a problem
Grill like I'm eating on pollen
Keep a bitch on my thigh like a pocket
If I fuck her she sucking the gang
Me and my brothers done did everything
Backwood  it's stuffed  look like Oreo
If you know me I know that you owe me
Kay the Yacht keep a K and a forty
Balmains on me like I'm lonely
Fired a banker for twenty
Thumb in her butt while she sippin' the Henny
I know that my gang won't forget me
Bankroll after bankroll I spend
Seven years later and I got the same friends
All in  yeah I'm all in  I'm all in
All in  yeah I'm all in  I'm all in
You a stain  you a lame
Swerving hoes like I got a cane
Old friends call me  say they can't look at Perry the same
Perry growin' up and I got the same gang
100 deep  run up  yeah I'm glad you came
Young nigga with expensive tastes
Matter fact  ask your girl 'fore you go and kiss her face
Damn  who is she  let me check my database
Yeah  Perry here  the other human race
I'm all in  I'm all in  I'm all in
Bitch I'm ballin'  I'm ballin'  I'm ballin'
These bitches callin'  they stalkin'  they stallin'
25 just for a fucking walk in
All in  40 for the walk in
Now I'm flossin'  drop top Slauson
Got a goth bitch  she put me in a coffin
Got a dog bitch  now she leaving paw-prints
Still ridin' sports when I'm sittin' in it's great
Tell my bitch make a play  now I'm frosted like a cake
Chef knife with the steak  now I'm flexing heavyweight
In the six like a date  all my partners livin' great
Bankroll after bankroll I'm stacking
JBan$ keep three phones  I'm trapping
Working with the work  I double up  it's magic
Chopper make a nigga backflip  gymnastics
Bad bitch take off with the pack if you lackin'
Got 100 bloods posted in the back with rachets
Pull off in the Aston  ball like Collin Sexton
26's for my wrist  diamonds dancing like they Prince
Bankroll after bankroll I love to spend  yeah
When I get it back I love to spend it all again  yeah
Ten up on my neck and I spent fifteen for my wrist  yeah
Woah  you just want to come because I'm next  yeah
Woah  you just like that glow that's from my neck  yeah
Woah
Bankroll after bankroll I spend (I spend)
Only love my gang  I don't got no new friends (no new niggas)
Hit your bitch from the back and I watch her bend (dumb bitch)
NAZ for life  nigga  that's 'til the end
I only want to fuck  I can't be your boyfriend (stupid bitch)
I speak rich nigga shit  broke niggas can't comprehend
Ayy  it's Cartiers all over my lens
All hundreds in my bankroll  I don't do no tens
Never Amount To Zero in this bitch  you understand that?
2016 Dream Team  matching Bimmer boys  let's get it
Got love for all my niggas
We all in  we all fam
All in

Same gang  I got the same friends
I promise that I'm all in

Distant connections  a large interval
A black man with mouths to feed
Embracing equality throughout greed (Ha)
