lyrics
"I'm completely lonely  please don't judge me
When your tears are falling  I'll catch them as they fall
I need you to listen to me  please don't leave me
I'm not perfect yet  but I'll keep trying
When your tears are falling  I'll catch them as they fall
'Cause inside  we are really made the same (Oh)
In life  waiting's just a stupid game (Oh)
Lift me up  give me a start
'Cause I've been flying with some broken arms
Lift me up  just a small nudge
And I'll be flying like a thousand doves
A thousand do-o-o-o-o-oves
Oh (Doves)
A thousand do-o-o-o-o-oves
Oh (Doves)
I'd do anything for you to really see me
I am human  invisibly bleeding
When your smile is shaking  I'll catch you as you fall

I cry more than I ever say (Oh)
Each time  your love seems to save the day (Oh)
Lift me up  give me a start
'Cause I've been flying with some broken arms
Lift me up  just a small nudge
And I'll be flying like a thousand doves
A thousand do-o-o-o-o-oves
Oh (Doves)
A thousand do-o-o-o-o-oves
Oh (Doves)
I've been hurting  stuck inside a cage
So hard my heart's been in a rage
If you love me  then just set me free
Set me free
Lift me up  give me a start
'Cause I've been flying with some broken arms
Lift me up  just a small nudge
And I'll be flying like a thousand doves
A thousand do-o-o-o-o-oves (Flying  flying)
Oh (Flying like a thousand doves)
A thousand do-o-o-o-o-oves (Flying  flying)
Oh (Flying like a thousand doves)
Keep repeating self-hating phrases
I have heard enough of these voices
Almost like I have no choice
This is biological stasis
My mood's shifting to manic places
Wish I laughed and kept the good friendships
I can't see me cry
Can't see me cry ever again (Ooh)
I can't see me cry
My biggest enemy is me ever since day one
Keep my dolls inside diamond boxes
Save 'em 'til I know I'm gon' drop this
Front I've built around my oasis
Paradise is in my hands
Holdin' on so tight to this status
Keep myself in beautiful places
Paradise is in my hands

So when I'm all choked up and I can't find the words
When the sun goes down
And the band won't play
I'll always remember us this way
Lovers in the night
Poets tryna write
But all I really know
You're where I wanna go

In all your glamour and cruelty
Just do that thing that you do
And I'll undress you
Keep it tight
Sometimes the simplest move is right
The melody that you choose
Can rescue you
A hybrid can withstand these things
My heart can beat with bricks and strings
My ARTPOP could mean anything
Come to me
With all your subtext and fantasy
Just do that thing that you do
In a perverse hue
Lovers' kites
Are flown on beaches for public sight
The color palette you choose
Could profit you

Two lovers  headed for a dead end
Runnin' through the red lights
Hollerin' over  rubber spinnin'
Big swig  toss another beer can

I can't believe how you slurred at me
With your half wired broken jaw
You popped my heart seams
On my bubble dreams  bubble dreams
I can't believe how you looked at me
With your Johnnie Walker eyes
He's gonna get you and after he's through
There's gonna be no love left to rye
And I know that it's so complicated
But I'm a loser in love  so baby
Raise a glass to mend all the broken hearts
Of all my wrecked up friends
I'll never talk again
You've left me speechless  so speechless
And I'll never love again
You've left me speechless  so speechless
Oh  oh
Oh
Oh  oh
Oh
And after all the drinks and bars that we've been to
Would you give it all up? (Oh) Could I give it all up for you? (Oh)
And after all the boys and the girls that we've been through
Would you give it all up?
That I'll never talk again
And I'll never love again
I'll never write a song
Won't even sing along
I'll never love again (Oh)
So speechless (Ah)
You left me speechless  so speechless
Will you ever talk again?
You've left me speechless  so speechless
Some men may follow me
But you choose death and company
Why you so speechless?
