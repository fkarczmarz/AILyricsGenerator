lyrics
" I can feel your love fading
 it's fading away from me
 your touch has grown cold
 I'm losing you
 it's all over your face
 I can tell I'm losing you
 I can tell when we kiss
 I can feel it in my bones
 my dear
But I refuse to let you go
If I have to beg and plead for your sympathy
I don't mind 'cause you mean that much to me
Now I heard a cryin' man is half a man
With no sense of pride
If it'll keep you by my side
If I have to sleep on your doorstep all night and day
Just to keep you from walkin' away
'Cause I want to keep you any way I can

Now I've got a love so deep in the pit of my heart
And each day it grows more and more
If pleadin' keeps you from walkin' out of that door
 baby  don't you know
 (so)  (so)
 baby  don't you know
 (so)  (so)
 that we met
 baby  don't you know
 (so)  (so)
 baby
 come home  come home
 come home  come home
 come home  come home
 four  ow!
 but you sure can't hide
 the sound of soul
'Cause her pretty face got the best of me
Suddenly  you came into my life
And gave it meaning and pure delight
Now good looks I've learned to do without
'Cause now I know it's love that only counts
'Cause I know that
Beauty's only skin deep
I know that
Beauty's only skin deep
Oh  yeah
Now you speak your words warm and sincere
It lets me know that you love is dear
A pretty face you may not possess
But what I like about you is your tenderness
A pretty face may be some guy's taste
But I'll take lovin' in its place
'Cause I know that
Beauty's only skin deep
And you know that
Beauty's only skin deep
Beauty's only skin deep  oh yeah

My friends ask what do I see in you
But it goes deeper than the eye can view
You have a pleasin' personality
And that's an ever lovin' rare quality
Now show me a girl  a girl that's fine
And I'll choose the one with true lovin' every time
Because I know that
Beauty's only skin deep
And I believe that
Beauty's only skin deep
Oh  yeah
So if you're lookin' for a lover (Oh yeah)
Don't judge a book by its cover (Oh yeah)
She may be fine on the outside (Oh yeah)
Is it right to be left alone
When the one you love is never home?
And I love too hard  my friends sometimes say
But I believe  I believe
That a woman should be loved that way
But it hurts me so inside
To see y'all treat me so unkind
Can I get a witness?
(Can I get a witness?)
Can I get a witness?
(Can I get a witness?)
Somebody  somebody
(Can I get a witness?)
Is it right to be treated so bad
When you've given everything you had?
Even tossin' in my sleep
'Cause I haven't seen my baby all week
Now  you chicks do agree
That this ain't the way love's supposed to be

Up early in the mornin'
With her on my mind
Just to find out all night that I've been cryin'

'Til the very end
But she caused me so much misery

It wasn't very pretty
In the slums of the city
It was a one room shack that slept
Ten other children beside me
We hardly had enough food
Or room to sleep
It was hard times
Needed something to ease
My troubled mind
My father didn't know
The meaning of work
He disrespected Mama
And treated us like dirt
I left home seeking a job
That I never did find
Depressed and downhearted
I took to Cloud Nine
I'm doing fine
I'm doing fine

(Where I was born  everything was dull and dingy)
Job  can't find one
I lived in a place they called the inner city
The streets raised me from a baby
'Cause nobody cares what happens to folks that live in the ghetto)
Thousand of lives wasting away
People living from day to day
This is a challenge just staying alive
'Cause in the ghetto  only the strong survives
Broken down homes  kids strung out
They don't even know what life's all about
Stealin' cars  robbin' bars
Kids dodgin' cars for recreation
Only adds to a mother's frustration
Break-ins  folks comin' home and findin' all their possessions gone
Oh ho

To be a gentleman
Treat her like a lady (Treat her like a lady)

Because you changed my life
It was dull and ordinary
You made it sunny and bright
Now  I was blessed the day I found you
Gonna build my whole world around you
You're everything good  girl
And you're all that matters to me
When my way was dark and troubles were near
Your love provided the light so I could see  girl
Just knowin' your love was near when times were bad
Kept the world from closin' in on me  girl
I was blessed the day I found you
Gonna build my whole world around you
You're everything good  girl

Every dream I dream is about you
Honey I couldn't live without you
