"The perfect days blur together
Waiting outside pearly gates
If I'm still in love in the morning
If I'm still in love in the morning
If I am still in love in the...
 of wood
 back
 back
 back
 back
 back
Hold me down and bring me back up again
Circling vultures always overhead
Force your hand
Every day is life or death
Hold me down and bring me back up again
Now you've changed your name
Do they still ask you twice?
I look on
Red lights flashing for applause
Play your part
Swear you're who you say you are
You hold me down and bring me back up again
I can read it in the whites
And the thing is  I knew it before
I re-open my eyes
And if I didn't know to be afraid
The faces made me sure that I do now
As I sit and wait  as I sit and wait
Oh  no  I'm dying wrong
But I'm still laying here alive
With a black spot on my arm
And so calm  I look inside
And I see the things I always knew
But wasn't sure until now
That if it comes to claim  that if it comes to claim
I won't run
I won't run
I won't run
At Forsyth and Bowery
Flowers and painted forehead
Trying to forget
(Oh) Can't tell if the ceiling's rising
(Oh) Or if the floor's falling out
I remember some nights without sleep
Godlike and cowering
Taller stacks of stones
Is all we'll have to show
(Oh) Can't tell if the ceiling's rising
(Oh) Or if the floor's falling out
At the time I wasn't with you
By that time I didn't care
At the time I wasn't with you
By that time I didn't care

The fall is so much faster
Than you and I could ever climb
My words to catch like I'm trying
To strike a match that's soaking wet
See through skull
See through skin
Leave all the lights on
The color drain from my eyes
Cold cereal and TV
Before I go to sleep
Breathing out hoping to breathe in
I know nothing's wrong but I’m not convinced
Maybe I'll believe it from somebody else
Maybe I'll believe it from somebody else
Breathing out
Hoping to breathe in
Waking up to the sound of your voice
Digitized and destroyed
I was halfway to Calais from Dover
When the word had finally come over
Thought we said never again?
Ooh  my love  I can't believe
The headline crawls across the screen
I couldn't fall asleep
And it's raining on both ends of the phone
You're in the lobby and I'm on my way home
But there's no shelter without you there
Some things are so simple
They're impossible to explain
The Café Amarillo
Stay dry when you're caught in the rain
We're caught in the rain
I don't want to die before I learn to live
Looking for my exits
Still so bad at making plans I plan to keep
How long has it been?

You can't un-pull (Surely not) a trigger

I long for when the sun was in our eyes
Surgeon General warns against
Safe in the knowledge
A short walk back
Punch-line I ruin
But we both laugh
Leaves steeping longer
Knowing glance
Make our appearance
Our minds have gone back home
Brave in her movements
Scared to dance alone
There's a cave made of sheets
Take off all of your clothes and climb
Into a cave of sheets tonight
So I'll share your cigarette
Just to feel it in my fingers
Walk around 'til 3 am
Tell me what I know again
To keep myself from second guessing
All my silver dreams bring me to you
Hold the summer in your hands
'Til the summer turns to sand
We were staring at our ceilings
Thinking of what we'd give to have one more day of sun
One day of sun
Silver dreams bring me to you
Silver dreams bring me to you
Where did it go?
Where did I go?
We couldn't wait to grow old
But I can't fight the feeling anymore
You know I tried
I know you tried
We're still waiting to arrive
I start our day so late in the evening
Nineteen hours from my door to yours
I count the miles and all the while
Waiting for the sun to rise
But how come you can be so sure about everything when
I go to sleep you're waking up?
I start our day so late in the evening

Somehow I could do more now
If we've gotta struggle

We talked on a small screen
A cubism dream
The most beautiful squares I'd ever seen
The canvas was free
A gift good mother gave to me
We joked at how they talked so differently
I will never know what had rot my heart
It just came and went in the dark
I had changed into the certain kind of man
That could break your heart with his own hands
We were to scan our own towns
And make good on what we found
That I could get by on a smile and a wink
Could you even imagine a kiss?

 love is change
Here's the moment you've waited for
Oh  I know we're changing
The roots have split the pavement
The saints of teenage wildlife
Don't leave us dying on the vine
I remember California
Watching smoke come through the floor
Oh  I know we're changing
The roots have split the pavement
And we are coursing through to find
A vein  a fire to light the fire
The saints
(They're lined along the main drag)
Of teenage wildlife
(You turn away to look back)
Don't leave
(And crossing into Eden)
Us dying on the vine
(You wonder if you missed out)
And we
(Turning over stones and)
Are coursing through to find
(All our wriggling history staring back)
A vein
(I breathe out when you breathe in)
A fire to light the fire

Fireworks at the water
You were holy
A styrofoam cup
Held between your teeth
Telling me how you're going to outlive your body
Maybe I know better than to read more than what's written
After everything
Gathering your storm
Talk to fill the space
Do you know where so and so was when they were our age
Then every night you seem to talk me out of everything
After everything
Maybe I know better than to read more than what's there
The hours we talked
You wished we'd stopped
Acting like it's nothing at all

Leaving and arrived
I just wanna be here at the same time
Slouching when you walk
Just like Hillhurst palms
A penny and a lotto ticket to scratch
You win enough to keep you coming back
A cross above the freeway
Holy neon light
Everybody crawling for their lives
You’re watching your reflection
In a TV turned off
How long you gonna pay more than it costs?

It take a moment for
For your eyes to adjust
Step out into the sun
Oh
I wanna start again
Sunset's new babbling man
Holding my sign
Manhattan on the rocks
Red-handed never caught
I sent them to a church for the hymn
I don't know what I'm looking for
What are they looking for?
You ever seen a man's brains?
I have a 4-track mind
Write me a letter on a humming machine
And pull through the ice age  singing a song
I have different areas
I sit around and wait
And I said by God  through a bunch of pines
How will I let you slip through?
Careless or unkind?
Trace the curving of the coastline
The Santa Lucia cliffside
We'll stay here for the night
I remember you said
Everything has its place
Now I lie in our bed
Wondering how to explain
You
When am I gonna lose you?
When am I gonna lose you?
When am I gonna lose you?
When am I gonna lose
Take another one if you need it
Or do you already feel it?
I felt it from the start
Engrave the silhouette of you dancing
A shadow play that we're cast in
On the cabin walls

You were floating to me
In a slow-motion fade
Could I finally see
Between belief and faith?
You
When am I gonna lose you?
When am I gonna lose you?
When am I gonna lose you  you?
When am I gonna lose
I remember you closing the shutters
And laying down by my side
And the light that was still slipping through
It was painting your body in stripes
I remember the trees tumbling down
Like an archangel choir
And the ocean was all we could see
And I knew that I wanted you
I remember you closing the shutters
And laying down by my side
And the light that was still slipping through
It was painting your body in stripes
I remember the trees tumbling down
Like an archangel choir
And the ocean was all we could see
And I knew that I wanted you
When am I gonna lose
When am I gonna lose you
When am I gonna lose you  you
 baby
 I can't stay
 who cares
 it's ok
 who cares
 baby
 it's ok
 who cares
They told me how they fear it  now they're placing it on their tongues
Oh  to see it with my own eyes
Oh  to see it with my own eyes
No food or water for the better part of ten months
Quietly he sat between the folds of a tree trunk
Oh  to see it with my own eyes
Oh  to see it with my own eyes
All the men of faith and men of science had their questions
Could it ever be on earth as it is in heaven?
Oh  to see it with my own eyes
This is nothing like I thought it would look
They say  Who am I to blame?
Who am I to blame?
Spill yourself at her feet
Stamp me out  flickering
Can you remind me which are the ones that sting?
They all look the same to me
Look the same to me
Spill yourself at her feet
Stamp me out  flickering
There's a sun rising
Steady now  comfort me
This will swallow  swallow me alive

Spill yourself at her feet
Stamp me out  flickering
There's a sun rising
But right after you complete your merge
The lane you started in gets going
And while you wait for your luck to change
All you can think of is where you started
You don't like anything on local radio
So you fumble around 'til you land on NPR
And listen to world news
Of a newly opened sunni marketplace
And a cloud covers your car at just the right time
For you to see the dark on your face in the mirror
Your phone goes off with a picture of your mother
And while normally you'd yell and scream
Instructing her to go and find him on her own
But calmly you're exiting
And telling her that you are headed on your way home
She does not know what to say
Just glad you're on your way home
You turn off your phone in a different tone
As you think
It was enough to keep me on
Believe me
And I woke up with my green eyes blue
And all I think about is you
And your fist
Where did your love  where did your love grow cold?
The closer I get  the farther I have to go
To places we don't know
To places we don't know
To places we don't know
To places we don't know
In all this light  all I feel is dark
Had the sun without its' warmth
I'm freezing
Where did your love  where did your love grow cold?
The closer I get  the farther I have to go
To places we don't know
To places we don't know
To places we don't know"
