"About falling in love
I met your parents  they were dying
About falling in love
Girl
You're just a child
A heartbreak
Girl
You're just a child
A heartbreak
I saw your friends at the drive-in
They were falling in love
I met your friends  they were lying
About falling in love
Girl
You're just a child
A heartbreak

Maybe I... I should have something to eat
But food won't take this emptiness away
I'm hungry for you my love
Well I made it through another day
In my cold room
On scraps and pieces left behind
I survive on the memory of you
All of me is all for you
You're all I see
All of me is all for you
You're all I need
Is there a remedy for waiting
For love's victorious return?
Is there a remedy for hating
Every second that I'm without you?
All of me is all for you
You're all I see
All of me is all for you
You're all I need

All this life is all for love

And every street and avenue
Only one will lead me to you
All of me is all for you

All of me is all for you
You're all I need
Are all of the colors I see my love
Every time I see you
I don't know if I'll survive
In this magical land behind your eyes
And there's all these funny little men
They're all asking me to dance and sing
I'm so wasted on you
I'm so wasted on you
I'm so wasted on you
I'm so wasted on you
I don't know just what I'll do
Every time you walk into the room
Oh my head is spinning around
And I can't see clearly right now
Every time you walk into the room
Every time you walk into the room
I'm so wasted on you

And you've changed your mind again
It feels like years
And I can tell how time can bend your ideas
And the boys go on and on and on and on
And the boys go on and on and on and on
And there's gold
Falling from the ceiling of this world
Falling from the heartbeat of this girl
Falling from the things we should have learned
Falling from the things we could have heard
And you've changed your mind again
All the cracks in the walls
Reminds you of things we said
And I could tell you
That I won't hurt you this time
But it's just safer
To keep you in this heart of mine

Falling from the sky that should have burned
Falling from my heart

Any little reason to come around
Your future is in my capable hands
But you have to understand that I don't mean it
All I want to do is run around to your place and
Fix a drink and pretend that we are ok
We can hide in the cover of the storm
You're the lightning and I'll soon be gone
Follow me to the bottle and we'll figure it out
I will leave my troubles by the river
Follow me to the bottle and we'll figure it out
I will leave my troubles by the river
Follow me to the bottle and we'll figure it out
I will leave my troubles by the river
Follow me to the bottle and we'll figure it out
I will leave my troubles by the river
Your house  my house
Running out of reasons to come around
And the part of me that wanted to believe is
Making friends with all of my enemies
All I wanna do is run around to your place and
Fix a drink and forget that this will all change
Pretend that we are ok

An offering to appease the ones we love
An opening to fall into your arms
An offering to appease the ones we love
In the pretty skirt with the
Golden smile that made you feel new
Like when the marching band strolls the street
You know another years come too soon
So you took her hand and she gave a look
That sent you to the moon
And there you spoke the words of a gentleman
Can I have this dance with you?
Can I share this dance with you?
Won't you come on home?
I built us a flying machine
There goes the gal
She took withon to the stars
She don't make no big deal
There she sits with them big old fields of daisies and rusty mills
And when the sun it shines on her hair of gold
She's beautiful

Cold thriller in disguise
Blue shadows stitched to her toes

She wanted to go to a place where we could unwind
Where we could listen to some old dusty records
Just to spin around

I fell into the clouds
My feet weren't touching the ground
We started to float around
I was only trying to wake you up
Sleeping underground
I want my ashes to be spread above the clouds
With booze and songs being spilled from the top of the glass
I guess that much we can agree upon
We can float around

Can I have you?
Caught up on what to say I said you do

I said you do
Through my eyes I can see a shootin' star
Weavin' its way across the sea
Somewhere from mars
It's down the street we would run
To scratch our names in the path
Young and free in the sun
Wheels upon the tar
I said you do
I wish I had a mango tree in my backyard
With you standin' next to me take the picture
'Cause from her lips I heard her say
Can I have you?
Caught up on what to say I said you do
Just a friend of mine

Talking 'bout the lovers that we had  oh
Bag them bones  let's forget all about the others

Look so pretty  girl  even when you're high
It's funny  all the shit we speak when we close our eyes  baby

And the bike you rode to school now it rests
And your story begins
You read your fair share of books
You tied your lace a thousand times
And you saw the good in the worst of the crooks
The sun it burns so I jump right in
I felt the cold sea kiss my skin
I turned around and you were gone
Old friend where you headed for now?
Old friend where you headed for now?
Window frames of old pictures of you
And the tree outside appears on end
And you seen the good in the seam of the crop

Trying to spell your name
So I fold it up and i flick it out
Paper aeroplane
It won't fly the seven seas to you
Cause it didn't leave my room
But it awaits the hands of someone else
The garbage man
Got to say mmm mmm mmm
Got to say mmm mmm mmm
So he opens it up and reads it out to all his friends
Amongst the crowd a heart will break and a heart will mend
He walks on home tired from work
The letter falls from his hand
He reaches out only to catch the sky
Its gone with the wind
Got to say mmm mmm mmm
Got to say mmm mmm mmm

I spilled the ink across the land
Trying to spell your name
Up and down there it goes
Paper aeroplane
It hasn't flown the seven seas to you
But it's on its way
It goes through the hands
Then to someone else
To find you girl
Got to say mmm mmm mmm
Got to say mmm mmm mmm

Fifteen kids in the backyard drinking wine
You tell me stories of the sea
And the ones you left behind
Goodbye to the roses on your street
Goodbye to the paintings on the wall
Goodbye to the children we'll never meet
And the ones we left behind
And the ones we left behind
I could go there but I don't
Rob's in the kitchen making pizza
Somewhere down in Battery Park
I'm singing songs about the future
Wondering where you are
I could call you on the telephone
But do I really want to know?
You're making love now to the lady down the road

Goodbye to my Santa Monica dream
Fifteen kids in the backyard drinking wine
You tell me stories of the sea
And the ones you left behind
Maybe more
Cut through the ropes before you came
I had a dream that you were gone
I'm in the days of throwing rocks
When I saw your picture on a silver coin
Stole a kiss through your golden locks
I had a dream that you were gone
Woke up and you were gone
All the love has gone away
'Cause I didn't have the heart or strength to say
'Cause I'll miss you when you're gone
'Cause I'll miss you when you're gone
'Cause I'll miss you when you're gone
'Cause I'll miss you when you're gone
I'll miss you when you're
Heard the rattle from the chains
This goddamn room it gets so small sometimes
I had a dream that you were gone
Woke up and you were gone
All the love has gone away
'Cause I didn't have the heart or strength to say
'Cause I'll miss you when you're gone

Are you going home?
In the back yard
I'm still holding on
Lots of twisted lights
Don't make me sleep alone
Like dust
It rises up
Stay for the night
Then you're gone
In the moonlight
And I'm a right state
You're a flower girl
You want to play a game
It's so easy to do
When the stars are down
I get the best of you
Stay for the night
Then you're gone
(Don't make me sleep alone)
Stay for the night

Smile in the smoke and find something to say

We talked at the bar
Walked out on the street
You walked in my heart
Wanted to breathe
There's gold in your hair
Just stay where you are
We talked on the phone
We'll meet at the beach
Like Sylvester Stallone
You're slurring your speech
Pass me the drink
Let's not walk too far
Stay where we are
Just stay where you are
Is that what you want?
I'll close up the bar
I'll close up the shop
Let's take what we need
And sit in your car

And I'd change if I could
It's bad and I know it
But I feel like I should
It's so sweet when you tell me
How lovely I am by the night's sky
The birds cannot hear us
And things fall apart
And we're waiting for answers
But where do we start?
And I'm wondering what movie
You'll ask me to see on the weekend
Just stay where you are
Just stay where you are
Just stay where you are
Just stay where you are
Just stay where you are
Just stay where you are
And the people that you love
Well they have nothing lovely
To say
When your days are long
And lonelier than before
When your bed is cold
And the sheep are at your door
I'll take you away
I'll take you away
I'll take you
I'll take you away
I'll take you away
When you're tired of working
Like a slave
And the smell of the coffee bean
Well it just won't go away
Nothing good to say
You just call out my name
And I'll take you away

No mercy with time
No mercy with time
They bound you with the fire
Then push you into the sun
They want the free land to expire
They want everyone to be numb
The worlds drinking from a cup
That no one wants to share
Words from the king
That no one wants to hear
Retrench me because of machines
Kids trading roses for guns
Track marks under the sleeve
Love's thrown away the ring
Not knowing what to say
Mama won't you say?
It's like you're cut by the blade
(Don't be running late)
Come with me and we'll make many storms
He offered me the universe
But inside my heart there's a picture of a girl
Some call love a curse  some call love a thief
She's my home
And she's as much apart for this broken heart
But see broken bones always seem to mend
I'll taste the devil's tears
Drink from his soul but I'll never give up you
I'll taste the devil's tears
Drink from his soul but I'll never give up you
He said  I am the devil  boy
Come with me and we'll break many laws
He offered me eternal life
But inside my heart there's a picture of a girl
Some call love a word  some call love a thief
But she's my home
And she's as much apart for this broken heart

Driving in your car
And the cases that went cold
I want to be wherever you are
And we're sitting in that room
And you spoke in Japanese
Want to please you
You want to please me
Don't take my word for it
Just look at me to know that I love you
Don't take my word for it
Just look at me to know that I do
Look at me to know that it's true
Driving around that town
Where you've been before

Kissing in the grocery store
And there's nowhere else to be
I could live in your old car
With the broken stereo
I want to be wherever

Then you had the nerve to talk about Murphy's Law
Oh  who do you think you are?
Oh  who do you think you are?
Who do you think you are?
Oh  who do you think you are?
All the kids smoking rocks and playing their guitars
Can you see the shadows walk the street?
Can't forget who they are
Do you leave good enough alone? Do you hold onto the chain?
Can you imagine what it is to cross an ocean of blue?
Oh  who do you think you are?
