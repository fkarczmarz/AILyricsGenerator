lyrics
"Alice was the spawn of a public school
With a double barrel name in the back of her brain
And a simple case of Mummy doesn't love me blues
Reality it seems was just a dream
She couldn't get it on with the boys on the scene
But what do you expect from a chick who's just sixteen?
All the young girls love Alice
Come over and see me
Come over and please me
All the young girls love Alice
If I give you my number
Will you promise to call me?
Wait till my husband's away
Poor little darling with a chip out of her heart
It's like acting in a movie when you got the wrong part
Getting your kicks in another girl's bed
You might also like
And who could you call your friends down in SoHo?
One or two middle-aged dykes in a go-go
But what do you expect from a sixteen year old yo-yo?
All the young girls love Alice
Come over and see me
Come over and please me
All the young girls love Alice
If I give you my number
Will you promise to call me?
How much I miss my lady
Amoreena's in a cornfield
Brightening the daybreak
Living like a lusty flower
Running through the grass for hours
Rolling through the hay  oh
Like a puppy  child
And when it rains  the rain falls down
Washing out the cattle town
And she's far away somewhere
In her eiderdown
And she dreams of crystal streams
Of days gone by when we would lean
Laughing  fit to burst upon each other
I can see you sitting  eating
Apples in the evening
Down the bronze of your body
You might also like
Living like a lusty flower
Running through the grass for hours
Rolling through the hay  oh
Like a puppy  child
And when it rains  the rain falls down
Washing out the cattle town
And she's far away somewhere
In her eiderdown
And she dreams of crystal streams
Of days gone by when we would lean
Laughing  fit to burst upon each other
Oh  if only I could nestle
In the cradle of your cabin
My arm's around your shoulder  whoa
The window's wide and open
While the swallow and the sycamore  whoa
Are playing in the valley
Like the king bee misses honey
And when it rains  the rain falls down
Washing out the cattle town
And she's far away somewhere
In her eiderdown
And she dreams of crystal streams
Of days gone by when we would lean
Laughing  fit to burst upon each other
And when it rains  the rain falls down
Washing out the cattle town
And she's far away somewhere
In her eiderdown
And she dreams of crystal streams
Of days gone by when we would lean
How much I miss my lady
Amoreena's in a cornfield
Oh  brightening the daybreak
Living like a lusty flower
Running through the grass for hours
Rolling through the hay  whoa
The spotlight's hitting something
That's been known to change the weather
We'll kill the fatted calf tonight so stick around
You're gonna hear electric music  solid walls of sound
Ooh  but they're so spaced out
B-B-B-Bennie and the Jets
Oh  but they're weird and they're wonderful
She's got electric boots  a mohair suit
You know I read it in a magazine  oh
B-B-B-Bennie and the Jets
Hey kids  plug into the faithless
Maybe they're blinded  but Bennie makes them ageless
We shall survive  let us take ourselves along
Where we fight our parents out in the streets
To find who's right and who's wrong

You haven't walked yet
Your first words have yet to be said
But I swear you'll be blessed
I know you're still just a dream
Your eyes might be green
Or the bluest that I've ever seen
Anyway you'll be blessed
And you  you'll be blessed
You'll have the best
I promise you that
I'll pick a star from the sky
Pull your name from a hat
You'll be blessed
I need you before I'm too old
To have and to hold
To walk with you and watch you grow
And know that you're blessed
Baby's got blue eyes
Blue eyes
Baby's got blue eyes
When the mornin' comes
I'll be far away
And I say
Holdin' back the pain
Baby's got blue eyes
And she's alone again
Blue eyes
Baby's got blue eyes
Watchin' over me
Blue eyes
When I'm by her side
Where I long to be

Distant cousin from down the line
Brand of people who ain't my kind
Holy Moses  I have been removed
Holy Moses  I have been deceived
Now the wind has changed direction  and I'll have to leave
Won't you please excuse my frankness
But it's not my cup of tea
Holy Moses  I have been deceived
I'm going back to the border where my affairs
My affairs ain't abused
I can't take any more bad water
Been poisoned from my head down to my shoes  oh
Holy Moses  I have been deceived
Holy Moses  let us live in peace
Let us strive to find a way to make all hatred cease
There's a man over there  what's his color? I don't care
When the heat of a rolling wind can be turned away
It's enough for this restless warrior just to be with you
And can you feel the love tonight?
It is where we are
It's enough for this wide-eyed wanderer
That we got this far
And can you feel the love tonight?
How it's laid to rest
It's enough to make kings and vagabonds
Believe the very best
There's a time for everyone if they only learn
That the twistin' kaleidoscope moves us all in turn
There's a rhyme and reason to the wild outdoors
When the heart of this star-crossed voyager beats in time with yours
And can you feel the love tonight?
It is where we are
It's enough for this wide-eyed wanderer
That we got this far
And can you feel the love tonight?
How it's laid to rest

May you ever grow in our hearts
You were the grace that placed itself
Where lives were torn apart
You called out to our country
And you whispered to those in pain
Now you belong to heaven
And the stars spell out your name
And it seems to me you lived your life
Like a candle in the wind
Never fading with the sunset
When the rain set in
And your footsteps will always fall here
Along England's greenest hills
Your candle's burned out long before
Your legend ever will
Loveliness we've lost
These empty days without your smile
For our nation's golden child
And even though we try
The truth brings us to tears
All our words cannot express

Goodbye England's rose
May you ever grow in our hearts

Goodbye England's rose
From a country lost without your soul
Who'll miss the wings of your compassion
More than you will ever know

Your candle's burned out long before
Though I never knew you at all
You had the grace to hold yourself
While those around you crawled
They crawled out of the woodwork
And they whispered into your brain
They set you on the treadmill
And they made you change your name
And it seems to me you lived your life
Like a candle in the wind
Never knowing who to cling to
When the rain set in
And I would've liked to know you
But I was just a kid
Your candle burned out long before
Your legend ever did
Loneliness was tough
The toughest role you ever played
Hollywood created a superstar
And pain was the price you paid
Even when you died
Oh  the press still hounded you
All the papers had to say
Was that Marilyn was found in the nude

Goodbye  Norma Jeane
Though I never knew you at all
You had the grace to hold yourself
While those around you crawled
Goodbye  Norma Jeane
From the young man in the twenty-second row
Who sees you as something more than sexual
More than just our Marilyn Monroe
And it seems to me you lived your life
Like a candle in the wind
Never knowing who to cling to
When the rain set in
And I would've liked to know you
But I was just a kid
Your candle burned out long before
Your legend ever did
Your candle burned out long before
Just someone his mother might know
Very clearly a case for corn flakes and classics
Two teas both with sugar please  in the back of an alley
While little Dirt Cowboys turned brown in their saddles
Sweet chocolate biscuits and red rosy apples in summer
For it's hay make and Hey mom
Do the papers say anything good?
Are there chances in life for little Dirt Cowboys?
Should I make my way out of my home in the woods?
Brown Dirt Cowboy  still green and growing
City slick Captain
Fantastic the feedback  the honey the hive could be holding
For there's weak winged young sparrows that starve in the winter
Broken young children on the wheels of the winners
And the '68 summer festival wallflowers are thinning
For cheap easy meals are hardly a home on the range
Too hot for the band with a desperate desire for change
We've thrown in the towel too many times
Out for the count and when we're down
Captain Fantastic and the Brown Dirt Cowboy
From the end of the world to your town

And all this talk of Jesus coming back to see us
Hmm  couldn't fool us
For we were spinning out our lines walking on the wire
Hand in hand went music and the rhyme
The Captain and the Kid stepping in the ring
From here on sonny sonny sonny  it's a long and lonely climb
For cheap easy meals are hardly a home on the range
Too hot for the band with a desperate desire for change
We've thrown in the towel too many times

Me and Susie had so much fun
Holding hands and skimming stones
Had an old gold Chevy and a place of my own
But the biggest kick I ever got
Was doing a thing called the Crocodile Rock
While the other kids were rocking 'round the clock
We were hopping and bopping to the Crocodile Rock
When your feet just can't keep still
When Susie wore her dresses tight
And the Crocodile Rocking was out of sight
La-la-la-la-laa
La-la-la-la-laa
But the years went by and the rock just died
Susie went and left us for some foreign guy
Long nights crying by the record machine
Dreaming of my Chevy and my old blue jeans
But they'll never kill the thrills we've got
Burning up to the Crocodile Rock
Learning fast as the weeks went past
We really thought the Crocodile Rock would last

I took a chance and changed your way of life
But you misread my meanin' when I met you
Closed the door and left me blinded by the light
Don't let the sun go down on me (Don't let the sun)
I'd just allow a fragment of your life (Don't let the sun) to wander free
But losin' everything is like the sun goin' down on me
But see me once and see the way I feel
Don't discard me just because you think I mean you harm

What does it feel like when you're dancing?
I can't really explain it
I haven't got the words
It's a feeling that you can't control
I suppose it's like forgetting  losing who you are
And at the same time something makes you whole
It's like that there's a music playing in your ear
And I'm listening  and I'm listening and then I disappear
And then I feel a change
Like a fire deep inside
Something bursting me wide open impossible to hide
And suddenly I'm flying  flying like a bird
Like electricity  electricity
Sparks inside of me
And I'm free I'm free
It's a bit like being angry
It's a bit like being scared
Confused and all mixed up and mad as hell
It's like when you've been crying
And you're empty and you're full
I don't know what it is  it's hard to tell

Like electricity  electricity
Sparks inside of me

Electricity  sparks inside of me

Everything about this house was born to grow and die
I can't face another day

When are you going to land?
I should have stayed on the farm
I should have listened to my old man
You know you can't hold me forever
I didn't sign up with you
I'm not a present for your friends to open
This boy's too young to be singin' the blues
So goodbye yellow brick road
Where the dogs of society howl
You can't plant me in your penthouse
I'm goin' back to my plough
Back to the howlin' old owl in the woods

So goodbye yellow brick road

Bopping in the country  fishing in a stream
Looking for an answer  trying to find a sign
Until I saw your city lights  honey  I was blind
They said  get back  honky cat
Better get back to the woods
But  I quit those days and my redneck ways
And  oh  change is gonna do me good
You better get back  honky cat
Living in the city ain't where it's at
It's like trying to find gold in a silver mine
It's like trying to drink whisky  oh  from a bottle of wine
Well  I read some books and I read some magazines
About those high-class ladies down in New Orleans
And all the fools back home  well  said I was a fool
They said  oh  Believe in the Lord is the golden rule
They said  get back  honky cat
Better get back to the woods
But I quit those days and my redneck ways

Oh yeah  get back  honky cat
Get back  honky cat
Get back  honky cat  whoo
Oh yeah  redneck ways and
Don't look at it like it's forever
That things can only get better
And while I'm away
Dust out the demons inside
And it won't be long before you and me run
To the place in our hearts where we hide
And I guess that's why they call it the blues
Time on my hands could be time spent with you
Rollin' like thunder under the covers
And I guess that's why they call it the blues
Just stare into space
Picture my face in your hands
Live for each second without hesitation
And never forget I'm your man
Cry in the night if it helps
More than I love life itself

Being part of mankind
There's not a lot to do no more
This race is a waste of time
People rushing everywhere
Swarming around like flies
Think I'll buy a .44
Give 'em all a surprise
I think I'm gonna kill myself
Cause a little suicide
Stick around for a couple of days
What a scandal if I died
Get a little headline news
I'd like to see what the papers say
On the state of teenage blues
A rift in my family
I can't use the car
I gotta be in by ten o'clock
Who do they think they are?
I'd make an exception

A man like me  so irresponsible
A man like me is dead in places
Other men feel liberated
And I can't love  shot full of holes
Don't feel nothing  I just feel cold
Don't feel nothing  just old scars
Toughening up around my heart
But I want love  just a different kind
I want love  won't break me down
Won't brick me up  won't fence me in
I want a love that don't mean a thing
That's the love I want  I want love
I want love on my own terms
After everything I've ever learned
Me  I carry too much baggage
Oh man  I've seen so much traffic

Like a gentle cobweb hanging
Upon a painted tepee
With my warlance and my woman
For he told us that the yellow moon
Would very soon be leaving
This I can't believe I said
I can't believe our Warlord's dead
To the buzzards and the soldiers' guns
Ever since I was young
I've read the writing of the smoke
And breast-fed on the sound of drums
I've learned to hurl the tomahawk
And ride a painted pony wild
To run the gauntlet of the Sioux
To make a chieftain's daughter mine
And now you ask that I should watch
The red man's race be slowly crushed?
What kind of words are these to hear
I can't stay to see you die
Along with my tribe's pride
I go to search for the yellow moon
And the fathers of our sons
Where the red sun sinks in the hills of gold
And the healing waters run
Trampling down the prairie rose
Leaving hoof tracks in the sand
Those who wish to follow me
I welcome with my hands
I heard from passing renegades
Geronimo was dead
He'd been laying down his weapons
When they filled him full of lead
Now there seems no reason why
I should carry on
In this land that once was my land
I can't find a home
It's lonely and it's quiet
And the horse soldiers are coming
And I think it's time I strung my bow
And ceased my senseless running
For soon I'll find the yellow moon
Along with my loved ones
Where the buffaloes graze in clover fields
Without the sound of guns
And the red sun sinks at last
Into the hills of gold
And peace to this young warrior
Down where Lexington cross 47th Street
Oh  she's a big girl  she's standin' six-foot-three
Turnin' tricks for the dudes in the big city
Island girl
What you wantin' with your white man's world?
Island girl
Black boy want you in his island world
He want to take you from your racket boss
He want to save you  but the cause is lost
Island girl  island girl  island girl
Tell me what you wantin' with your white man's world
Well  she's black as coal  but she burn like a fire
And she wrap herself around you like a well-worn tire
You feel her nail scratch your back just like a rake

He calls his child Jesus
'Cause he likes the name
And he sends him to the finest school in town
Spends his days countin'
In a garage by the motorway
He was born a pauper to a pawn on a Christmas day
When the New York Times said God is dead
And the War's begun
Alvin Tostig has a son today
And he shall be Levon
And he shall be a good man
And he shall be Levon
In tradition with the family plan
And he shall be Levon
And he shall be a good man
He shall be Levon
Levon sells cartoon balloons in town
His family business thrives
Jesus blows up balloons all day
Leave Levon far behind
Take a balloon and go sailin'

May well be simple but they're true
Until you give your love
There's nothing more that we can do
Love is the opening door
Love is what we came here for
No one could offer you more
Do you know what I mean?
Have your eyes really seen?
You say it's very hard
To leave behind the life we knew
But there's no other way
And now it's really up to you
Love is the key we must turn
Truth is the flame we must burn
Freedom the lesson we must learn

There's a boat on the reef with a broken back
And I can see it very well
There's a joke and I know it very well
It's one of those that I told you long ago
Once a fool had a good part in the play
If it's so would I still be here today?
It's quite peculiar in a funny sort of way
They think it's very funny everything I say
We'll come again next Thursday afternoon
The in-laws hope they'll see you very soon
But is it in your conscience that you're after
Another glimpse of the madman across the water?
I can see very well
There's a boat on the reef with a broken back
And I can see it very well
There's a joke and I know it very well
It's one of those that I told you long ago

The ground's a long way down but I need more

We'll come again next Thursday afternoon
The in-laws hope they'll see you very soon
But is it in your conscience that you're after
Can you... sense it far away?
Is it old Rudolph the Reindeer?
Is it Santa on his sleigh?
It's heading up to Easington
It's coming down the Tyne
Oh! It's bloody Maggie Thatcher
And Michael Heseltine!
So Merry Christmas Maggie Thatcher
May God's love be with you
We all sing together in one breath
Merry Christmas Maggie Thatcher
We all celebrate today
Cos it's one day closer to your death
They've come to raid your stockings
And to steal your Christmas pud
But don't be too downhearted
It's all for your own good
The economic infrastructure
Must be swept away

All standing in a line

Oh my darling Heseltine
Spanish Harlem are not just pretty words to say
I thought I knew
But now I know that rose trees never grow
In New York City
Until you've seen this trash can dream come true
You stand at the edge while people run you through
And I thank the Lord there's people out there like you

In your little corner of the world?
You could roll around the globe
And never find a warmer soul to know
Oh  I saw you by the wall
Ten of your tin soldiers in a row
With eyes that looked like ice on fire
The human heart  a captive in the snow
Anythin' about my home
I'll never know how good it feels to hold you
Nikita  I need you so
Of any given line in time
Countin' ten tin soldiers in a row
Do you ever dream of me?
And do you ever see the letters that I write?

Nikita  do you count the stars at night?
And if there comes a time
Guns and gates no longer hold you in
And if you're free to make a choice
Just look towards the west and find a friend

When things go wrong
When the scent of her lingers
And temptation's strong
Into the boundary
Of each married man
Sweet deceit comes callin'
And negativity lands
Hardened by you
Just passin' through
And it's no sacrifice
Just a simple word
It's two hearts livin'
In two separate worlds
But it's no sacrifice

After the fact
Sensitivity builds a prison

Ma  tell me when the boys get here
It's seven o'clock and I wanna rock
Wanna get a belly full of beer
My old man's drunker than a barrel full of monkeys
And my old lady  she don't care
My sister looks cute in her braces and boots
A handful of grease in her hair
Oh  don't give us none of your aggravation

Get a little action in
Get about as oiled as a diesel train
Gonna set this dance alight

Let me fly to distant lands
Flowers and forest fountains
Home along the lanes of the skyway
For this dark and lonely room
Projects a shadow cast in gloom
And my eyes are mirrors of the world outside
Thinking of the way that the wind can turn the tide
And these shadows turn from purple into grey
For just a skyline pigeon
Dreaming of the open
Waiting for the day
He can spread his wings
Fly away again

Waiting for the day
He can spread his wings
And fly away again
Towards the things you've left so very far behind
The curtains drawn in the little room downstairs
Sittin' like a princess perched in her electric chair
And it's one more beer  and I don't hear you anymore
We've all gone crazy lately
My friend's out there  rollin' 'round the basement floor (Ooh)
And someone saved my life tonight  sugar bear (sugar bear)
You nearly had me roped and tied
You're a butterfly  and butterflies are free to fly
I never realized the passin' hours of evening showers
A slip noose hangin' in my darkest dreams
I'm strangled by your haunted social scene
Just a pawn out-played by a dominating queen
It's four o'clock in the morning  damn it! Listen to me good
I'm sleepin' with myself tonight
Saved in time  thank God my music's still alive

A spirit born of earth and water
Fire flyin' from your hands
In the instant that you love someone
In the second that the hammer hits
Reality runs up your spine
And the pieces finally fit
And all I ever needed was the one
When stars collide like you and I
No shadows block the sun

Drunken nights in dark hotels
When chances breathe between the silence
Until he walks along the beach
And sees his future in the water

Seamstress for the band
Pretty-eyed  pirate smile
You'll marry a music man
Ballerina  you must've seen her
Dancing in the sand
And now she's in me  always with me
Tiny dancer in my hand
Jesus freaks out in the street
Handing tickets out for God
Turning back  she just laughs
The boulevard is not that bad
Piano man  he makes his stand
In the auditorium
Looking on  she sings the songs
The words she knows  the tune she hums
Lying here with no one near

It looks like rain today
It crackled on the speakers
And trickled down the sleepy subway trains
For heavy eyes could hardly hold us
Aching legs that often told us it's all worth it
We all fall in love sometimes
The full moon's bright
And starlight filled the evening
We wrote it and I played it
Somethin' happened
It's so strange this feelin'
Naïve notions that were childish
Simple tunes that tried to hide it
But when it comes
We all fall in love sometimes
I'm not sure 'cause sometimes we're so blind
Strugglin' through the day
When even your best friend says
Don't you find
We all fall in love sometimes?

It crackled on the speakers
And trickled down the sleepy subway trains
For heavy eyes could hardly hold us
Aching legs that often told us

Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh!
This feelin' inside
I'm not one of those who can easily hide
I'd buy a big house where we both could live
My gift is my song and this one's for you
And you can tell everybody
This is your song
Now that it's done
That I put down in words
How wonderful life is
While you're in the world
I sat on the roof
And kicked off the moss
Well a few of the verses
But the sun's been quite kind
While I wrote this song
It's for people like you that keep it turned on
