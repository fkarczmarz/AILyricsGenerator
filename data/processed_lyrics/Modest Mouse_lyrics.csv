lyrics
"I got this thing that I consider my only art
Of fucking people over
My boss just quit the job
Says he's going out to find blind spots
And he'll do it
The third planet is sure that they're being watched
By an eye in the sky that can't be stopped
When you get to the promised land
You're gonna shake the eye's hand
Your heart felt good
It was drippin' pitch and made of wood
And your hands and knees
Felt cold and wet on the grass beneath
From the cold sunlight that's reflecting off the moon
Reminding you we used to be three and not just two
And that's how the world began
And that's how the world will end

And we were swimming in the water
And it occurred to me that the animals are swimming
Around in the water in the oceans in our bodies
Well the universe is shaped exactly like the earth
If you go straight long enough you'll end up where you were
And the universe is shaped exactly like the earth
If you go straight long enough you'll end up where you were
The universe is shaped exactly like the earth
Your heart felt good
It was drippin' pitch and made of wood
And your hands and knees
Felt cold and wet on the grass beneath
From the cold sunlight that's reflecting off the moon
Reminding you we used to be three and not just two
And that's how the world began
And that's how the world will end
And we were swimming in the water
And it occurred to me that the animals are swimming
Around in the water in the oceans in our bodies
If you go straight long enough you'll end up where you were
And the universe is shaped exactly like the earth
If you go straight long enough you'll end up where you were
The universe is shaped exactly like the earth
Everything that keeps me together is falling apart
I got this thing that I consider my only art
I took a trip down to Mexico
Was I really supposed to know?
How the hell would I know?
There it goes!
I made a mess of myself and the trip on the whole
My father stayed patient with me  why? I don't know
Me and my sister we hung on the phone
Watching the news as they looked for Ansel
Would you really want to know?
How the hell would you know?

On gears around an uncaring sun
It doesn't know what it gave
As the bone moon winds 'round again
Again this allows one sphere's heart to pump
Pumping waves of hearts that come and go
And then come and then
Would you really want to know?
The last time that you'll ever see another soul
And I am doing the best that I can
She said this one mattered and I felt it had a spirit
And I shot the stork 'cause I didn't hear it that way
And it's hard to be a human being
And it's harder as anything else
And I'm lonesome when you're around
And I'm never lonesome when I'm by myself
And I miss you when you're around
And I miss you when you're around
And I miss you when you're around
A nice heart and a white suit and a baby blue sedan
And I am doing the best that I can

Saying  I'd sell off my Savior for a set of new rings
And some sandals with the style of straps
That cling best to the era
So all of the businessers in their unlimited hell
Where they buy and they sell and they sell all their trash
To each other  but they're sick of it all
And they're bankrupt on selling
And all of the angels  they'd sell off your soul
For a set of new wings and anything gold
They remember the people they loved  their old friends
And I've seen through 'em all  seen through 'em all
Seen through most everything
All the people you knew were the actors
All the people you knew were the actors
Well  I'll go to college and I'll learn some big words
And I'll talk real loud  goddamn right I'll be heard
You'll remember the guy that said all those big words
He must've learned in college

And it took a long time 'til I came clean with myself

 I need a scapegoat now

 I need a cold one now

 but the
 I need a scapegoat now
I've bought some things that I'll sort of regret about now
Broke your glasses  but it broke the ice
You said that I was an asshole and I'd paid the price
Broken hearts want broken necks
I've done some things that I want to forget  but I can't
Broke my pace and ran out of time
Sometimes I'm so full of shit that it should be a crime
Broke a promise 'cause my car broke down
Such a classic excuse  it should be bronze by now
Broke up and I'm relieved somehow
It's the end of the discussions that just go round and round

If God takes life  he's an Indian giver
So tell me now why  you'll tell me never

Who would wanna be such a control freak?
Well  who would wanna be

Well  see what you want to see
You should see it all
Well  take what you want from me
You deserve it all
Nine times out of ten

Or just a better way to fall
But one time out of ten
Everything goes perfect for us all

Well  all that icing and all that cake
I can't make it to your wedding
But I'm sure I'll be at your wake
When you get to the point
Make sure that I'm still awake  okay?
I went to bed and didn't see
Why every day turns out to be
A little bit more like Bukowski

 nothing was hurt
 would you promise me this?
 I know that they end
 and it split at the seams
 and I kept it real clean
 if it's running out of thread
 and we moved to the right
 if the fun has to end
 and fads they go
 I love that rock and roll!

He goes to the reservation  drinks and gets mean
And he's gonna start a war

And he hops in his pickup  puts the pedal to the floor

Not the gravity plan

Wind-up anger with the endless view of

We pay for gas to drive around

She was talking with a syllable lisp

You are so hot
I would like to steal your digits
And I'm so hung up on it
I would like to move away from it

I was knocking on your ear's door
But you were always out
Looking towards the future
We were begging for the past
But those never seemed to last
Everyone's unhappy
Everyone's ashamed
At somebody else's page
Quite exactly as we planned
Our ideas held no water
But we used them like a dam
As if we got a new position

Over such and such and such
We made ourselves a pillar
We just used it as a crutch
We were certainly uncertain
But we just built that good Goddamn!
I assume as much for other people
We've listened more to life's end gong than
The sound of life's sweet bells
Was it ever worth it?
Was there all that much to gain?
And we'd already missed the plane
We didn't read the invite
We just danced at our own wake
All our favorites were a-playing
Tiny curtains open and we heard the
Driftin' around on bubbles then
Thinkin' it was us that carried them
When we finally got it figured out
That we had truly missed the boat
As if we got a new position
But not the skills to make a shelf with
