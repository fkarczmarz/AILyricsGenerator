lyrics
"La la la la la
La la la (Yeah)
La la la la la (Yeah)
I wish that I could tell her how I really feel inside
Dreamin' quiet trying to dodge a suit and tie
Who am I? (La la la)

I get high 'cause the lows can be so cold
I might bend a little bit but I don't fold
One time for my mind and two for yours
I got food for your thoughts to soothe your soul
I always did shit the hard way
My nigga  slangin' in the hallway
Burnt CD's and trees like this was Broadway
Some Reggie Miller with more brown hairs than Chewbacca
He tell his pops he need some lunch and he gon' get it right back
And talked about how we gon' smash all the bitches in class
I complimented how I see him out here getting his cash
So how you looking up to me when I look up to you?
Either graduate to weight or selling number two
For what? A hundred bucks or two a week?
Do you think that you would know what to do if you was me?
I felt ashamed to have ever complained
About my lack of gear and thought about how far we done came
From trailer park to a front yard with trees in the sky
I get high 'cause the lows can be so cold
I might bend a little bit but I don't fold
One time for my mind and two for yours
I got food for your thoughts to soothe your soul
We wasn't s'posed to get past 25
Joke's on you motherfucker  we alive
All these niggas popping now is young
Everybody say the music that they make is dumb
I remember I was 18
You gotta give a boy a chance to grow some
Everybody talkin' like they know somethin' these days
Niggas actin' woke  but they broke  umm
I respect the struggle but you all frontin' these days
Man  they barely old enough to drive
To tell them what they should do  who the fuck am I?
I heard one of 'em dissed me  I'm surprised
I ain't trippin'  listen good to my reply
Come here lil' man  let me talk with ya
See if I can paint for you the large picture
Congrats 'cause you made it out your mama house
I hope you make enough to buy your mom a house
I see your watch icy and your whip foreign
I got some good advice  never quit tourin'
'Cause that's the way we eat here in this rap game
I'm fuckin' with your funky lil' rap name
I hear your music and I know that rap's changed
A bunch of folks would say that that's a bad thing
'Cause everything's commercial and it's pop now
Trap drums is the shit that's hot now
See  I've been on a quest for the next wave
But never mind  that was just a segue
I must say  by your songs I'm unimpressed  hey
But I love to see a Black man get paid
And plus  you havin' fun and I respect that
But have you ever thought about your impact?
These white kids love that you don't give a fuck
'Cause that's exactly what's expected when your skin black
They wanna see you dab  they wanna see you pop a pill
They wanna see you tatted from your face to your heels
And somewhere deep down  fuck it  I gotta keep it real
They wanna be black and think your song is how it feels
So when you turn up  you see them turnin' up too
You hit the next city  collect your money when it's due
You gettin' that paper  swimmin' in bitches  I don't blame you
You ain't thinkin' 'bout the people that's lookin' like me and you
True  you got better shit to do
You coulda bought a crib with all that bread that you done blew
I know you think this type of revenue is never endin'
But I wanna take a minute just to tell you that ain't true
One day  them kids that's listening gon' grow up
And get too old for that shit that made you blow up
Now your show's lookin' light cause they don't show up
Which unfortunately means the money slow up
Now you scramblin' and hopin' to get hot again
But you forgot you only popped 'cause you was ridin' trends
Now you old news and you goin' through regrets
'Cause you never bought that house  but you got a Benz
And a bunch of jewels and a bunch of shoes
And a bunch of fake friends  I ain't judgin' you
I'm just tellin' you what's probably gon' happen when you rappin'
'Bout the type of shit you rappin' 'bout
It's a faster route to the bottom
I wish you good luck
I'm hoping for your sake that you ain't dumb as you look
But if it's really true what people sayin'
And you call yourself playin' with my name
Then I really know you fucked  trust
I'll be around forever 'cause my skills is tip-top
To any amateur niggas that wanna get rocked
Just remember what I told you when your shit flop
For your eyes only (For your eyes)
For your eyes only
It seems my dreams faded for far too long
The consequences deadly
Can't visualize myself as nothin' but a criminal
Like I ain't the one who put them Js on her feet
Like I ain't out in the field like that
I might be low for the moment but I will bounce back
To see this is like the farthest thing from heaven
This is hell and I don't mean that hyperbolic
I try to find employment even if it's wipin' toilets
But these felonies be makin' life the hardest
Resistin' the temptation to run up and swipe a wallet
That's why I write this sonnet
If the pressure get too much for me to take and I break
Play this tape for my daughter and let her know my life is on it
(For your eyes) Let her know my life is on it
(For your eyes) For your eyes only

For your eyes only
He got me prayin' that the spiritual is real
So I know how part of you feels
And fiends that smoke rocks
I've seen far too many niggas' hopes rot
I'm writin' this because me and the devil had a dance
Don't know if I ever had a chance
Addicted to pushin' paraphernalia
Innocence disappeared by the age of eight years
So Granny raised me in projects where thugs was hangin'
Blood was stainin' the concrete
Six years later was handed sentence
'Round the same time is when you came in this world
Me and your mama thinkin':
What the fuck we namin' this girl?
Took me two felonies to see the trap this crooked-ass system set for me
And now I fear it's too late for me to ever be
The one that set examples that was never set for me
'Cause karma keeps on catchin' up to me
And if my past becomes the death of me
I hope you understand
For your eyes only
Was it the trigger-happy crackers that the badges give clout?
Niggas don't know how to act in a drought
My views misshaped by new mixtapes
That confirmed the shit I learned in the streets was true
That real niggas don't speak when they beef with you
I pray you find a nigga with goals and point of views
And the cyclical nature of doin' time continues
My worst fear is one day that you come home from school
And see your father face while hearin' 'bout tragedy on news
I got the strangest feelin' your daddy gonna lose his life soon
And sadly if you're listenin' now it must mean it's true
But maybe there's a chance that it's not
And this album remains locked in a hard drive like valuable jewels
And I can teach you this in person like I'm teachin' you to tie your own shoes
I love you and I hope to God I don't lose you
For your eyes only
For your eyes only
But I could feel the sense of panic in his voice
I dealt with the repercussions of my actions
I know you tried to steer me 'way from that shit
In case I never get a chance to speak again
I won't forget the weekends spent sleepin' at your crib
That's the way I wished my family lived
But my granny crib was in the 'jects
I had to interject like:
But I been havin' premonitions
Just call it visions from the other side
I got a feelin' I won't see tomorrow
Like the time I'm livin' on is borrowed
Go play it for my daughter when she ready
Don't you ever scratch or disrespect it
I dedicate these words to you and all the other children
Affected by the mass incarceration in this nation
That sent your pops to prison when he needed education
Sometimes I think that segregation would've done us better
Although I know that means that I would never
Be brought into this world 'cause my daddy was so thrilled
When he found him a white girl to take back to Jonesboro
Not because he used to come through in the Caddy on some vogues
Not because he went from baggin' up them grams to servin' O's
Not because he lived a life of crime and sat behind some bars
Although that was true
Your daddy was a real nigga 'cause he loved you
Turn it up
Uh
Light work like it's PWC
Your third shit was massive and that was your prime
I was trailin' right behind and I just now hit mine
Now I'm front of the line with a comfortable lead
The rap beef ain't realer than the shit I seen in Cumberland
He averagin' one hard verse like every thirty months or somethin'

Cole World your instructor for Pilates class
Your arms might be too short to box with the god
Who live his life without the pressures of a constant facade
Now it's poppin' outside like the top of July
My text flooded with the hunger for a toxic reply
This is merely a warning shot to back niggas down
Back in the town where they whippin' work and traffickin' pounds
My jack jumpin' 'bout a rapper makin' blasphemous sounds
Switchin' sides like the tassel on the cap and the gown
Let's keep it tall  y'all ain't fuckin' with my man
And don't check your watch  you know the time
This shit too easy for me now
Nigga  Cole been goin' plat' since back when CDs was around
Look how everybody clappin' when your thirty-song album do a measly hundred thou'
If I'm bettin' on myself  then I completely double down
If you hated on a nigga  please don't greet me with a pound
I be stayin' out the way  but if the beef do come around
Could put a M right on your head  you Luigi brother now
Trace my steps all in this game  you could see we cover ground
Back and forth from NC to New York when Jeezy had the crown
So many shells left on the ground  it make the Easter Bunny proud
I never sold soft  just creeped where the hustlers crept
As if it never happened  shit we witnessed full of so much sickness

Creepin' on ya  the scent of failure reekin' on ya
Check your genitalia  pussy-niggas bleedin' on yourself
Fuckin' with Cole is bold  but it's impedin' on your health
All yo' niggas eatin' off your wealth
All my niggas feedin' all they selves  and it feels swell
Krispy Kreme dreams  sometime my dawgs wanna kill 12 (Uh)
'Cause they steady harassin'
We seen dilemmas like Nelly and Kelly that end in the deadliest fashion
My young niggas nutty  they blastin'
Bullets be hummin' like Cudi but one of yo' hoodies Spaghetti-O splashin'
All over the driveway  y'all talkin' all sideways
Shots poppin' off  y'all laid down
Cops chalkin' off y'all legs now
My niggas looked up to the sky like we sendin' 'em y'all way (Y'all way)
We sendin' 'em y'all way (Y'all way)
That's what the fuck I'm talkin' 'bout
Y'all see what the fuck goin' on out here (Killa  Harlem)

If you scared to throw it up  get the fuck out the club
Since a youngin' always dreamed of gettin' rich
Fantasize about a white picket fence
Used to want a Pathfinder with some tints
Throw some 20's on that bitch and get it rinsed
That the world's a lot bigger ever since
Picked up the paper
Fuck being timid in the Civic
Politicin' with the pushers and the pimps
That I was trapped in this city
They robbin' niggas on the daily
Can you blame a nigga that ain't never had things?
(What's the value of a thing?) Guess not
Last night they pulled up on my nigga at the light like—

We gon' circle 'round the Ville and hit a lick
One day we gon' graduate and cop a brick
Watch some rollers in a fuckin' Crown Vic
Wanna know a funny thing about this shit?
Even if you let 'em kill your dream
Last night I had a bad dream
That I was trapped in this city
Then I asked is that really such a bad thing?
I look around like—
Guess not
Last night we pulled up on a nigga at the light like
Father forgive me for my childish ways
I look outside and all the clouds are gray
I need your hands to take me miles away
But before you go I've got to warn you now
Whatever goes up surely must come down
 na-da-da-da  da  ah

There are many ways to deal with this pain
Choose wisely
Will I fall? Will I fly?
Heal my soul
Fulfill my high
Of Devil's pie
I know that it's difficult
I blow the residual
And fuckin' yo bitch like its part of my ritual
Pardon the visual
I want it in physical
Without it I'm miserable
Don't wanna fall off so I'm all in my bag
Thankin' God like it's biblical
I know it's gon' solve every problem I have
I balled on the principal

Cole world you should stay off this dick
Took a couple minutes and I sold out Staples
A nigga getting cream like an old ass Laker
But I ain’t coming to talk about all that paper
That’s what they talk about when they ain’t got shit to say
Can’t understand why niggas never got shit to do
Cause on the same day a nigga doing different shit
Spit different flows hit different chicks
Let my Brixton hoes feed me fish and chips
Never stingy with the hoes word to Cliff and Chris
So if I fuck six bitches I got six assists nigga
What’s the plan?
Cole keeps snapping like a Mustard jam
Got a middle finger for Uncle Sam
I done paid so much taxes I can fund Japan
But instead they make a young nigga fund the man
I just cocked back nigga and my gun don’t jam
On a scale from one to ten I’m a hundred grand
It's Cole fuckin’ world nigga
When you and K. Dot shit drop?
Hey
Should this be my last breath I'm blessed 'cause it was purposeful
Never got to church to worship lord but please be merciful
Sucker for women licking they lips and holding these purses
Back when we ran the streets who would think we'd grow to be murderers?
Teachers treated niggas as if they totally worthless

Sometimes you worry 'bout the things he can provide for ya
Whenever you around I seem to come alive for ya
I finally recognize the feelings that's inside for ya
Although I know your man and trust me he would die for ya
These quiet thoughts of you been going on for years now
I saw you in the party  soft lips  soft-spoken
I came to talk to you but homie interfered now
He introduced you as his girl and I was heartbroken
Some people talk about that love at first sight shit
To keep it real I don't know whether I believe it's true
But if it is then tell me if I'm wrong or right if
I fell in love with you before I ever even knew
I catch your eye then look away as if it never happened
At times I feel as though I'm caught up in a strange dream
If eyes could talk then mines would tell ya that I'm feeling you (Feeling you)
Sometimes I swear your eyes be telling me the same thing

 if the shoe fits  who's the king?

 boom  paow  it's like magic
 the crown disintegrates
 the fear lies in my lack of awareness of the other side (The other side  ayy)
 are the same  you and I (Yessir)
 different set of eyes
 but only one God (It's only one God  nigga)
Down to the garden  took a little dip (Oh no)
Apple juice falling from her lips  took a little sip
Lil' sip  took a lil' sip
Ayo  I walk through the valley of the shadow of death
Where niggas hold tech's like they mad at the ref
That's why I keep a cross on my chest  either that or a vest
Do you believe that Eve had Adam in check
And if so  you gotta expect
To sip juice from the forbidden fruit and get loose
Cole is the king  most definite
My little black book thicker than the Old Testament
Niggas pay for head but the pussy sold separate
Same bitch giving brains to the minister
The same reason they call Mr. Cee the finisher
Forbidden fruit  watch for the Adam's apple
Slick with words don't hate me  son
What you eat don't make me shit and who you fuck don't make me cum
Put a price on my head won't make me run
Try to kill me but it can't be done
'Cause my words gon' live forever
You put two and two together Cole here forever

Or Hell  only time gon' tell
How many records do a nigga gotta sell

Or Fader  fuck your magazine hater
When I say that I'm the greatest I ain't talking about later
I'ma drop the album same day as Kanye
Just to show the Boyz the man now like Wanyá
And I don't mean no disrespect  I praise legends
Life's a bitch and her pussy's wet

I wrote this shit to talk about the word addiction
To my niggas --- I hope you listening
All the way in Cali where they ain't got precipi-
And I hate it for my niggas 'cause they ain't got ambition
Blame it on the fact that 12 got jurisdiction
To ride around in neighborhoods that they ain't ever lived in
Blame it on the strain that you feel when daddy missing
Blame it on trap music and the politicians
Or the fact that every black boy wanna be Pippen
But they only got 12 slots on the Pistons
What I'm tryna say is the blame can go deep as seas
Just to blame 'em all I would need like twenty CD's
There's all sorts of trauma from drama that children see
Type of shit that normally would call for therapy
But you know just how it go in our community
Keep that shit inside it don't matter how hard it be
And popping pills due to chronic anxiety
I been saw the problem but stay silent 'cause I ain't Jesus
This ain't no trial if you desire go higher please
But fuck that now I'm older I love you 'cause you my friend
Without the drugs I want you be comfortable in your skin
I know you so I know you still keep a lot of shit in
You running from yourself and you buying product again
I know you say it helps and no I'm not trying to offend
But I know depression and drug addiction don't blend
Reality distorts and then you get lost in the wind
And I done seen the combo take niggas off the deep end
One thing about your demons they bound to catch up one day
I'd rather see you stand up and face them than run away
I understand this message is not the coolest to say
But if you down to try it I know of a better way
Meditate

Nowadays crime pays like a part time job

Monkey on my back and I walk a hundred miles
Guilt make a nigga feel fake when he smile
Love get confused in the mind of a child
'Cause love wouldn't lie like I lie and it's wild
Wanna have my cake and another cake too
Even if the baker don't bake like you
Even when the flavor don't taste like you
So I'm back mobbing with the late night crew
All in your mind with fears that would come true
The back of my mind  the back of my mind was you
Wishing that I could blind myself from view

A little Fayettenam nigga out in Beverly Hills
That's when I ran into this chick I went to college with
Yeah  back when a nigga was on scholarship
That's the least I owed her 'cause see I tried to hit
I boned her in my dorm room and kicked her out of it  huh
And I never called back  how thoughtfulless
Now I'm standing in the streets tryna politic with her
In her mind she calling me a misogynist  nigga
Is to hit and never commit
Not realizing when I hit she never forgets
So every time I ignore the telephone call
Saying I'll hit her back knowing I'm never gon' call  she was hurtin'
Now she's staring dead in my face  she was smirking
You ain't worth shit  nigga
A baby's bein' born  same time a man is murdered
The beginning and end
My plateau  and also what defines my name
Pac was like Jesus  Nas wrote the Bible
Now what you're 'bout to hear's a tale of glory and sin
No I.D. my mentor  now let the story begin
I used to print out Nas raps and tape 'em up on my wall
My niggas thought they was words  but it was pictures I saw
And since I wanted to draw  I used to read 'em in awe
Then he dropped Stillmatic  rocked the cleanest velour
Fast forward  who'da thought that I would meet him on tour
I'm earnin' stripes now  a nigga got Adidas galore
Backstage I shook his hand  let 'em know that he's the man
When he said he was a fan it was too hard to understand
No time to soak up the moment though ‘cause I was in a jam
Hov askin' where's the record that the radio could play and
Jeter under pressure  made the biggest hit of my career
Dion called me when it dropped  soundin' sad but sincere
Told me Nas heard your single and he hate that shit
I can't believe I let Nas down
Damn  my heart sunk to my stomach
I can't believe I let Nas down
I got defensive on the phone
Resentment was in my tone  fuck it
Long live the idols  may they never be your rivals
Pac was like Jesus  Nas wrote the Bible
Now what you're 'bout to hear is a tale of glory and sin
No I.D. my mentor  now let the story begin
I couldn't help but think that maybe I had made a mistake
But while I shot up the charts
You mean tellin' me that I was not up to par when I followed my heart?
You know Jay'll never put your album out without none
They don't know  they just study the charts
I had a feelin' I was killin'  and this music we were spillin' out
Friday Night Lights blew  that was classic number two
Now it seemed as if the Nas comparisons was comin' true
Still no release date from the label  are they insane?
Gucc told me play the game to change the game
But on the way I let Nas down
Damn  I got no one to blame
I'm ashamed  I let Nas down
Long live the idols  may they never be your rivals
Pac was like Jesus  Nas wrote the Bible
Now what you're 'bout to hear is a tale of glory and sin
No I.D. my mentor  now let the story begin
I always believed in the bigger picture
If I could get them niggas to listen outside my core then I can open the door
Reintroduce 'em to honesty  show 'em that they need more
The difference between the pretenders and the Kendrick Lamars
And so  I took the fall
Like the son of the Lord on the cross dyin' for that fake shit you niggas bought
For the past decade
If I should pass  please let this be my last essay
Therefore I write from the heart
Apologies to OG's for sacrificin' my art
But I'm here for a greater purpose  I knew right from the start
I'm just a man of the people  not above but equal
And for the greater good I walk amongst the evil
Just pray along the way that I don't lose myself
This is for the nigga that said that Hip-Hop was dead
I went to Hell to resurrect it  how could you fail to respect it?

And life can't be no fairy tale  no once upon a time

And touch the people how you did like before
I'm tired of livin' with demons 'cause they always invitin' more

To all my niggas out there livin' in debt
And fantasize about a life with no stress
I mean this shit sincerely  and as a nigga who was once in your shoes
Livin' with nothin' to lose  I hope one day you hear me
Long as the people in that motherfucker love you dearly
Always gon' be a whip that's better than the one you got
Always gon' be some clothes that's fresher than the ones you rock

Niggas been countin' me out
I’m countin' my bullets  I'm loadin’ my clips
I'm writin' down names  I'm makin' a list
I'm checkin' it twice and I'm gettin’ ’em hit
The real ones been dyin'  the fake ones is lit
The game is off balance  I’m back on my shit
The Bentley is dirty  my sneakers is dirty
But that's how I like it  you all on my dick
I'm all in my bag  this hard as it get
I do not snort powder  I might take a sip
I might hit the blunt  but I'm liable to trip
I ain’t poppin' no pill  but you do as you wish
I roll with some fiends  I love 'em to death
I got a few mil' but not all of them rich
What good is the bread if my niggas is broke?
What good is first class if my niggas can't sit?
That's my next mission  that's why I can't quit
Just like LeBron  get my niggas more chips
Just put the Rollie right back on my wrist
This watch came from Drizzy  he gave me a gift
Back when the rap game was prayin' I'd diss
They act like two legends cannot coexist
But I'd never beef with a nigga for nothin'
If I smoke a rapper  it's gon' be legit
It won't be for clout  it won't be for fame
It won't be 'cause my shit ain't sellin' the same
It won't be to sell you my latest lil' sneakers
It won't be 'cause some nigga slid in my lane
Everything grows  it's destined to change
I love you lil' niggas  I'm glad that you came
I hope that you scrape every dollar you can
I hope you know money won't erase the pain
To the OGs  I'm thankin' you now
Was watchin' you when you was pavin' the ground
I copied your cadence  I mirrored your style
I studied the greats  I'm the greatest right now
Fuck if you feel me  you ain't got a choice
I ain't do no promo  still made all that noise
This year gon' be different  I set my intentions
I promise to slap all that hate out your voice

Had a long talk with the young nigga Kodak
Reminded me of young niggas from 'Ville
I wish that he had more guidance  for real
Too many niggas in cycle of jail
Spending they birthdays inside of a cell
We coming from a long bloodline of trauma
We hurting our sisters  the babies as well
We killing our brothers  they poisoned the well
Distorted self-image  we set up to fail
I'ma make sure that the real gon' prevail  nigga

Last night  I was gettin' my feet rubbed by the baddest bitch
Then hang the phone up and proceed to lay the wood
I came fast like 9-1-1 in White neighborhoods
Ain't got no shame 'bout it
She think I'm spoiled and I'm rich 'cause I can have any bitch
But then I thought back  back to a better me
Before I was a B-list celebrity
'Fore I started callin' bitches bitches so heavily
Back when you could get a platinum plaque without no melody  you wadn't sweatin' me

I realize deep down you a coward gettin' high off of power
And it made me ashamed that I played the game
Not for mo' money like Damon Wayans
I took a train down memory lane and watched lil Jermaine
Do his thang before he made a name
I guess he can't complain
All the money that be rainin' in
Spend a hundred thou' for the chain again
Think of old-school niggas like Dana Dane
Least he ain't insane
That's new
Maybe that's true
One day that I become you when I become lost
And I become heartless
And numb from all the ménages
Just one bitch don't feel the same no more
And Henny don't really kill the pain no more
'Cause I can't maintain no more
Money can't save your soul

All these dreams  nah mean? I got no time to wait
Love my girl  but I told her straight up  Don't wait up
Stumble home late  I'm drunk  we fucked and made up
Used to living free as a bird  but now I'm laid up
Feelin' like a nigga got handcuffs on
How the fuck did my life become a damn love song?
She ride for a nigga and she stand up for him
But a nigga wan' be a nigga  be a nigga
Ride through the streets with freaks and real niggas
She'll never understand what it's like to be a man
Knowin' when you look inside yourself you see a nigga
And you don't wan' let her down
But you too young for the settle down
And maybe you can thug it out  learn what is love about
When you can't live with her and you can't live without
Aw shit  goddamn  I think the devil got his hands on me
Stripper saying  Baby  won't you throw them bands on me?

Only pure beginnings followed by years of sinning and fake repentance
The preacher say we were made in image of Lord
To which I replied: Are you sure?
Even a murderer? Even a whore?
Even a nigga running through bitches on tour
With a good girl at home folding clothes and shit?
She losin' faith in him and he knows the shit  like  What the fuck is a break?
Don't know how much I can take no more
I give you all I got 'til it ain't no more
No more tears  it's been ten long years
Damn near  I don't know if I can wait no more
And who can blame her  you complain about
Every time you out  you come back she poutin'
Sleeping back to back  this is wack  we 'bout
To go platinum and I'm in the crib acting out
My childhood fantasies of wife and home
But it's a whole lot of actresses I'd like to bone
And despite the rumors you hold out
On account of your guilt and she has got to spend her nights alone
And she ride or die like Eve and 'em
Make home-cooked meals every evenin'
And even in your lowest days
When you're no longer Superman  at least you know you got Lois Lane
But you

Unbelievable  seen evil that not even Knievel know
At age three I knew this world was three below
Listen  even though my ego low  achieved the unachievable
Imagine if my confidence was halfway decent yo
This just in  fucked more bitches than Bieber though
Still I keep it low  got my niggas on the need to know
Basis  my manager back in the days was racist
I was a young boy  passing skates and tucking laces
Old perverted white man who told me  Jermaine
It's all pink on the inside  fuck what color they face is
Wise words from an indecent man
Made me reflect on the times when we was three-fifths of them
In chains and powerless  brave souls reduced to cowardice
Slaving in the baking sun for hours just
To see the master creep into the shack where your lady at
Nine months later got a baby  that's
Not quite what you expected  but you
Refuse to neglect it  'cause you
Know your wifey loves you  thus you refuse to accept it
That’s the type of shit that turned my granny light-skinned
Rich white men rule the nation still
Only difference is we all slaves now  the chains concealed
In our thoughts  if I follow my heart to save myself
Could I run away from fifty-mill like Dave Chappelle?
You know
Runaway  runaway
Runaway  runaway

I wanna cry
And I ain't even tryna fight it
Don't wanna die (Don't wanna die no more)
'Cause now you're here and I just wanna be
Right by your side
I'll dry your eyes
I'll dry your eyes
Every time you go to sleep you look like you in Heaven
Plus the head game is stronger than a few Excedrin
You shine just like the patent leather on my new 11's
I wanna talk about my days as a youth to you
Exposing you to all my demons and the reasons I'm this way
It would take more than some years to get all over all my fears
Preventing me from letting you see all of me perfectly clear
The same wall that's stopping me from letting go and shedding tears
While I'm too scared to expose myself
Better than I know myself
Well how 'bout that?

But if I had a magic wand to make the evil disappear
That means that there would be no Santa Claus no more
To bring you Christmas cheer
'Cause what he represents is really greed
And the need to purchase shit from corporations
That make a killin' because they feed
On the wallets of the poor who be knockin' on they door
Every Black Friday just to get some shit they can't afford
What's that smell? Where's your diaper shit here?
Lay on your back  don't pee right now
Or else I'll have to get you back
One day when you gon' want to get your way
Yeah I'll have fun with that

Tears of joy I think filled up the room

My IQ is average  there's a young lady out there  she way smarter than me
I scrolled through her timeline in these wild times  and I started to read
She mad at these crackers  she mad at these capitalists  mad at these murder police
She mad at my niggas  she mad at our ignorance  she wear her heart on her sleeve
She mad at the celebrities  lowkey I be thinkin' she talkin' 'bout me
Now I ain't no dummy to think I'm above criticism
So when I see something that's valid  I listen
But shit  it's something about the queen tone that's botherin' me
She strike me as somebody blessed enough to grow up in conscious environment
With parents that know 'bout the struggle for liberation and in turn they provide her with
A perspective and awareness of the system and unfairness that afflicts 'em
And the clearest understandin' of what we gotta do to get free
And the frustration that fills her words seems to come from the fact that most people don't see
Just 'cause you woke and I'm not  that shit ain't no reason to talk like you better than me
How you gon' lead  when you attackin' the very same niggas that really do need the shit that you sayin'?
Instead of conveyin' you holier  come help us get up to speed
Shit  it's a reason it took like two hundred years for our ancestors just to get freed
These shackles be lockin' the mental way more than the physical
I look at freedom like trees  can't grow a forest like overnight
Hit the ghetto and slowly start plantin' your seeds
Fuck is the point of you preaching your message to those that already believe what you believe?
I'm on some Fuck a retweet  most people is sheep
You got all the answers but how you gon' reach?
If I could make one more suggestion respectfully
I would say it's more effective to treat people like children
Understandin' the time and love and patience that's needed to grow
This change is inevitable  but ain't none of us seen this before
Therefore  we just gotta learn everything as we go
I struggle with thoughts on the daily
Feel like a slave that somehow done saved enough coins to buy his way up outta slavery
Thinkin' just maybe  in my pursuit to make life so much better for me and my babies
I done betrayed the very same people that look at me like I'm some kind of a hero
Because of the zeros that's next to the commas
But look here  I promise I'm not who you think
Ran into this nigga outside of the store yesterday
He said something that had me like  Wait
But damn  why I feel faker than Snow on tha Bluff?
Well  maybe 'cause deep down I know I ain't doin' enough

I know that vengeance is the Lord's and it's not for me
I know the punishment for you is that you not with me
You place your value on the bitches that you got with me
And now the bitches ask you daily Why you not with me?
I had to cut some people off 'cause they was using me
My heart is big  I want to give too much and usually
I send the bread and don't hear back for like two months now
I had to learn  I never had shit
You never would split  you was hood rich
I couldn't get a dollar from you I remember that
It was blurry for a while but now it's coming back (coming back)
Time will tell who is on my side
(Time will tell just who is on my side)
I mean well but I can't stop my pride
(I mean well but I can't stop my pride)
Gimme drink  gimme smoke
Get me high  let me float
I'm a cloud  comin' down
Put me down  gentle now
Gimme drink  gimme dope
Bottom line  I can't cope

I'm hopin' that she won't notice it's my first time
I'm hopin' that my shit is big enough to fuck wit'
Practice puttin' condoms on—how it go? Right
With a pocket full of rubbers and an erection
That's when my hands start touchin' and her face start blushin'
And a nigga roll over on top and then she
Get my pants unbuckled and her hands start rubbin'
I wanna get somethin' off my mental
Ayy  we've got a good thing
Don’t know if I’ma see you again
But is that a good thing?
I know what's on your brain
You probably hoped it never would end
Like  “Is it the real thing
Or is it just a one-night stand?”
Well then

I wanna see you (Work out for me  work out for me)

She like them boys with the big ol' chains
Ridin' around town in a big ol' Range
I knew her when I rocked big ol' jeans
Now the little nigga doin' big ol' thangs
Would you look at that? I came back for her
Just to give it to ya  like you asked for it
Man  that thing in them jeans too fat for her
Rebounds so I caught her off the backboard
I told her: “Baby girl  come here
Know I run the town even when I ain't from there.”
And I brag hardly  but just to show up at this party
I made what yo' nigga make in one year
Money can’t buy you love  'cause it’s overpriced
Don’t overthink  just hope it's right
I’m only here for the night

 niggas knowin' what it is
 I show 'em what it is
 I do real numbers
 niggas burnin' up the street
 niggas runnin' up the score
 smell the odor in the street
 I told you
 I done seen the highest heights
Which is more important?
Getting or letting go?
Everything come back around full circle
Everybody gotta cry once in a while
But how long will it take 'fore you smile?
This is that come-back-to-life shit
My niggas pick me up and we gon' light the city up as if the sun had the night shift
And paint the town red for my nigga found dead too soon
Yeah
Check out my projects like them workers that Section 8 appoints
And you'll see how I flipped like exclamation points
Enough straps to fill four U-Hauls
More death than World War II caused
Around these parts we pour the brown just to drown these thoughts
I'm startin' to see you niggas don't want it
Gotta know the ropes and the protocol
Or they gon' for sure blow your clothes half off like a promo code
One phone call get you canceled like a homophobe in this PC culture
Address me as the G.O.A.T. like they call Chief Keef Sosa
In my sectional like a fuckin' three-piece sofa
I'm known as the chosen one
When niggas weighin' coke and not the pros and cons

Bodies get hauled off
I brought him 'round close to me before but he
Became addicted to clout and all the hoes we'd meet
I slowly peeped jealousy on his breath whenever he spoke to me
It felt like lettin' a nigga come sleep on your couch and he eatin' up all yo' groceries
Unfortunately we seen the trap
Niggas be on that demon clock resultantly

Off-Season
Let's work  hey
Plottin' my escape  this game rot a nigga's faith
Got a couple M's hidin' in the safe
Imagination turned a Honda into Wraith
I was doin' eighty on the interstate
Tryna make it back before my class started
Country nigga never seen a passport
'Til I popped off and got a bag for it
Now I'm at the Garden sittin' half court
Watchin' Jr. catch it off the backboard
'Ville nigga never seen nothing
'Cept a fucking triple beam jumping
Good dope leave a fiend krumping
Made it out  it gotta mean something
Either you gon' hustle or that nigga Uncle Sam got yo' ass re-enlisting
2-6  murder scene pumping
Better leave it tucked if you ain't dumping
Twelve comin'  we ain't seen nothing
Time change  niggas ain't rumbling no more
Nah  what for? Hungry for more
If you solo these vocals  listen close and you can hear grumbling
Multi' and I'm still munching
Big bag  never fear fumbling
Want smoke? Nigga don't choke
I'm a whole fuckin' nicotine company
Dreamville the Army  not a Navy
How could you ever try to play me?
I never fall out with the bro
Hate when your family turn into foe
We had a penthouse on the road
Interior decorated with the hoes
Just like a multiple-choice getting chose
Scoop up a dime-piece like we homeless
Then we gon' send 'em back pigeon-toed
Out of the concrete was a rose and winters was cold
Had to go over and stand by the stove
We from the Southeast  niggas know
This where the opps creep real slow
Won't vote but they mob deep with the poles
I punch the time sheet  not no more
And now my assigned seat is the throne
