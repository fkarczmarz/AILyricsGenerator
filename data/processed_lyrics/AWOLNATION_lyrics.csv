"All I need  all all I need
All I need  all all I need
All I need  all all I need
All I need  all all I need
It's early in the morning
I'm laughing at the sun
My mirror disappoints me  and
Am I the only one?
All I need  all all I need
All I need  all all I need
All I need  all all I need
Is you smiling at me
All all I need
All I need  all all I need
All I need  all all I need
I think I'm getting closer
But the scenery's the same
Am I a disappointment?
I'll blame it on the pain

All I need  all all I need
Is you smiling at me
All all I need
All I need  all all I need
All I need  all all I need
All I need is you
Is all I need
If you could simply believe
In me  and we would be forever together
All I need  all all I need
All I need  all all I need
All I need  all all I need
Is you smiling at me
All all I need
All I need  all all I need
All I need  all all I need
Is you smiling at me
All I need is you
Is all I need
All I need is you
Is all I need
All I need is you

I've got a bone to pick with happiness
My DNA is open for review
I've got a bone to pick with suffering
Now you see right through
Shoot your arrow through

I got a bone to pick with jealousy

There'll be no strings  I'm worth nothing
When the sad wind from the night's end
Help me pretend that I'm your sin
In the dark space  the touch of your soft face
In front of our fireplace  would you believe me?
If the phone rings  tell him nothing
Well maybe one thing  that hell is coming
'Cause he wasted your time
In a year you'll be mine
No  you don't (don't) fare (fare) well (well)
No  you don't (don't) fare (fare) well (well)
No  you don't (don't) fare (fare) well (well) without me
When I feel love from your answer
I'll take a gander  appreciate your candor
If the glove fits  above the toolbox
You'll hear a pin drop  it's the sound of my thoughts
Now the paint cries  down our cheek it dries
Ooh  the pink sky and backlit white lies
When my eyes sting  when my heart sinks
There will be no strings  we're drinkin' lightning

Aaron! What's up man  it's Ryan
Uhh…how are you  I hope you're good
Uhh…I just wanted to give you a heads-up
It's my birthday this weekend  uhh…
Saturday night I'm gonna have people meet up at a bar
It's (beep) called (beep) around nine o'clock
I know it's far for you
And I fully understand if you can't make it
But I just wanted to throw the information out there
Um...but either way give me a call back  I hope all's good
You ain't sayin' nothin' 'til your mama falls apart
But I'm awake
I walk to the rhythm of the rhythm of your heart
But I'm still bitter at the bullies in the park
But I will wait for you

Already high and sweaty like she been up in the kitchen
Lookin' for some action  tryna build a coalition
Dancin' with a passion  you know the position
Grinding on my troops  tryna rile up my militia
I can't turn her off after I switched on her ignition
She wants to add a friend  and I'm a gifted mathematician
Passion domestic  passion abroad
I have a passion for passions
I come in hot  I turn dragons to ashes
The cover or batten the hatches
I look the world in her eyeballs
I tell 'em my theories  my breakthroughs and the newest of my thoughts
I don't wait for the ovation to conclude  I find applause
