"Da-do  da-do
Ba-do-do
Da-do  da-do
Da-do  da-do
Feel it comin' in
Burnin’ me up like a dinosaur
Walls are closin' in
I need a kick in the teeth  somethin' to give me a reason for
Somethin' that's worth dying for
I think I'm goin' off my medicine
I think I need to feel somethin' again
So push the needle  bring me closer to the edge
You givin’ me  you givin’ me adrenaline

Feel it come again
I wanna drive off a cliff  Thelma Louise it with you tonight
Spit in the face of a giant  I think I might
Think I’m already gone
Follow you into the black  into the eye of the storm
'Cause I'm tired of feelin' so numb
I think I’m goin' off my medicine
I think I need to feel somethin' again
So push the needle  bring me closer to the edge
You givin' me  you givin' me adrenaline

But every time I get ahead of myself  every time I get ahead of myself
Thought I was rock steady  that I didn't need no help
But every time I get ahead of myself  every time I get ahead of myself
Guess I went ahead and jumped the gun again
Some shitty situation that I put you in
And I know we poured champagne
Maybe we was just too quick to celebrate
I thought I was ready  ready for someone else
But every time I get ahead of myself  every time I get ahead of myself
Thought I was rock steady  that I didn't need no help
But every time I get ahead of myself  every time I get ahead of my

And you're a little worse for wear
And it hurts having someone take care of you
Never let you go
Never let you go
Even when the madness has broken you apart
I used to believe
That all the absence of color
But my perspective has changed
Since I drove you away
But baby everybody's gotta move
Everyone's gotta move sometimes
And I won't see it
Even if I know it's there
Never let you go
Never let you go
Even when the madness has broken you apart
But I'll never let you know

And it hurts to see you all over again
Never ever let you go

Keep me in sight when you turn out the lights
When you open your eyes I'll be laying on the ground
Never making a sound
But baby you can still get down
Get down with me
You down with me
Flopping on the floor like a fish outta water
Get down with me
You down with me
Blowing all my money before I even get it
Are you down with me
See behind the doors I'm locking
Drinks keep dropping but you still
Get down with me

Leave her alone
Yea I'm gonna leave her alone
Meet me outside with the doors wide open
Ill leave her alone too

Now everything I thought I knew was wrong

Nowhere left to hide

We was on some you and me shit
We was on some Bonnie and Clyde shit
Ended up Jekyll and Hyde shit
You got me going through a mid-life crisis
Even before I even hit my mid-life crisis
I never thought that we would end up like this

Flags to wave  the city is ours

Only lights is those from a Bimmer
It’s nice to pray in front of Christ the Redeemer
If your guy is bigger than my guy up there
My God bigger than your God down here
Whom shall I fear?

I must be out of my mind
To come back begging for more
But if you stay
If you just stay for the night
Swear that I'm yours
And I'll prove that I'm right
And these flies kept me sleeping
All my fears on their wings
And your grandfather clock is still ticking
But the chime never rings
And how long must I stay
Will I lay by your side
Just to say that I'm yours
And you'll never be mine

Swallowed my soul
Dragging me down
And there's blood on the covers

To each other

We don't need wings
To fly
No strings to hold me now
It's just me and you tonight
We don't need wings
To fly
Meet me at the Thurston Ave bridge
Sit around and watch the rich kids
Wonder how they got what they got
Dad was gone and mom had four jobs
Told me you were sick of living here
All you wanna do is disappear
Watched you as you stared over the edge
Stick-and-poke tattoos on your wrist
We don't care what anybody thinks of us
Living dangerous
Living reckless

Skateboarding under grey clouds
Swore to God that I would make it out
Couple of us went a different route
This town will suffocate ya
Driving ninety-five on 88
Never going back upstate

Mama don't sleep well
She worries ’bout the kids all night
And the kids don't eat well
They worry 'bout they mama so they hustle on the side

The sweat keeps drippin' in the buffalo sunshine
So he drives that car
And I'll be fine to get my feet on solid ground

Takes prescriptions for pain to keep his demons at bay

Feeling like I'm always losing control against
Nobody leaves this game alive
Please  babe  I beg you  don't fuck with me
Fractured my soul in a million pieces
But nobody breaks me a second time
I swear I had no idea
That she would see me so clear
But how could I conquer my fears? No
How can I love you if I can't lose you?
If I can't learn to love again?
How can I love you if I can't rule you?
How can I learn to let you in?
Rule over me

Going from bad to worse
And thrust in the battleground
Come out dressed in furs
Got my head in the clouds
