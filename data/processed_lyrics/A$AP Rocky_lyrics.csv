lyrics
"Tell my A$AP killers  get they pistols ready
Send 'em to the cemetery with obituaries
I've been thinkin' 'bout all the O's in my bank account (What?)
X the hoes in my bed is 'round the same amount (What?)
Ever since this new star fame came about
Or ever since me and Drizzy started hangin' out  huh
Transition to a Lamborghini from a Mustang
Drugs slang in the drug game with the hustling
(I know one thing) Anything is better than that 1 Train
Bag made of Goyard  cheffin' like I'm Boyar—
Dee  probably sellin' D in your local courtyard
Braids like I'm O-Dog  my la familia go hard
Down to my inlaws  they outlaws with no laws
With a toe-tag  get broke off in the projects with a skateboard
Let's play ball in a ballpark with all sharks and a blindfold
That banana clip  straight from the rip
I'll make that shirt say R.I.P.  I'm on some shit
If I'm not the hottest then Hell must have froze over
You thought it was safe then forgot what the code was
I carry traits of a traumatized soldier
Spine right out of place  give me dap like you 'posed to
Darts at your posters  dark nights like this
I metamorph like I'm 'posed to  I might slice my wrist
Or pretend like a vulture and drop off this cliff

Barely even conscious  talkin' to my conscience
Gettin' deeper in these flows like conches
Don't sell rocks  seen the spectrum through the prisms
Somehow bypassed the bias and the -isms
The violence and the killin'  so given
They seen my pigment and thought that was the ign'ance
Unfortunately  I am not that type of niglet
But pass the pot  let me skillet
Just got back to the block from a 6 o'clock with Jigga
And I'm thinkin' 'bout signin' to the Roc
But my niggas on the block still assigned to the rocks
And I swear it hurt me soul
I try to prevail but when I preach I only hurt their sales
Like you're only gon' end up either dead or in jail
But you my nigga  wish you the best for real
When you mention my name amongst other white rappers
Or for that matter any fuckin' rapper  fuck it
Trouble to body-double or couple me to these others
'Cause comparatively speakin'  my reach is beyond the bubble
That they put me in  my vision's beyond the Hubble's
I huddle with Nubians  new beginnin' again
And so? Great! Do I give a flying duck
If I'm applyin' love to my rhymin' plus alignin' us?
Alabama's climbin' up—wait! No  I don't give a
Flying duck nothin' but a buckshot  ch-pow!
Motherfuck your life  pussy blood-clot
Ain't never been no rapper this cold since 2Pac was froze
And thawed out for a spot date at a Coachella show—Yelawolf
Weed a different color like a hoodrat bra and panties
And my flow be overhead like pots and pans in pantries
Antsy 'cause I'm high like Michael Jackson  penny loafers
Bitch pussy smell like a penguin
Wouldn't hit that shit with my worst enemy's penis
Ho  I'm the meanest
Dick so big  it's like from Earth to Venus
That is my synopsis  ostrich's posh shit
Hoes on some goth shit  stop it! You not this!
Cryin' tears of vodka  prima donna at the concert
Adonis smokin' chronic  'bout to vomit gin and tonic
Swiftly  I shift the Bimmer 860
A heavy smoker  so you know I brought the Blake with me
The moon’s reflection off the lake hit me
You should have stayed with me
Now many Asian bitches lay with me
The face is silky like a tablecloth
My shorty gallop in the mornin' on the beach like a Chilean horse
Red roses dropped from boxes very often
Confetti torchin'  drinkin' Henny like I'm Kenny Lofton
Outstandin'  I fixed the game between Georgia Southern and Gramblin'
You see us scramblin'  sellin' Susan Sarandon
The cloud of smoke like the phantom
You see me comin' through in each state
Just so the lord could put the fork inside the cheesecake
Cuffed to my wrist  I've got the briefcase
Big K.R.I.T.  shawty
Spit like my last breath: casket rap  six deep
Why you ask for crack and all you had was scratch?
All I had was rap  when all they had was wack
All I wanted was love and all they had was dap
Fuck them haters and fuck them hoes  a championship win is
Walk the plank or break a bank  I've been in the business of sinkin' ships
Chokin' niggas out with the anchors that they anchor with
Resuscitations cost the label  I'm taxin' if you want a hit
Get the fuck from 'round here  that's just my country ways
Suckin' on your momma's titty  bitchin' while I was choppin' blade
Miss me with that rapper chatter  take that shit up with my bass
I put that on my soul  how could you ever doubt me?
Most rappers hopin' the world end so they won't have to drop another album
B.B. King saw the king in me  so why can't you?
(That wasn't no sample  nigga!)
Muddy water flow  Dixie rebel past
Fuck your Louis flag  poppin' benji tags on your wifey's ass (on your wifey's ass)
That's out of line  but in livin' color?
They tryna front on the gang!
They going to remember my name
Ya dig? (Gang!)
In love with my bitch 'cause she bi
Convincin' my bitch to go blonde
On Yams and that's word to my moms
Margiela Madman with cases I'm still tryna beat
A bunch of shit from a long time ago
Flacko no Dominicano but eat the tostones with plátanos
Dealing with life and its highs and lows
I'm just pimpin' like I'm supposed
Ain't talkin' 'bout spending or buyin' clothes
I'm 'bout my business but I'm alone
I still had the vision when I was broke
Fuckin' on bitches and foreign hoes
Flyin' out womens to boring shows
I pray to God I don't overdose

Let's go
What's this I see? Niggas tryna act like G's
(You ain't got no Flacko in your Serato?)
Mothafucka better blast that shit
Niggas drink quarts of the Clicquot
Bitches sniff raw of the kilos
Flacko makes sales of the perico
Now I got a penthouse and a beach home
Back when I was rockin' least (2 Chainz!)
I was trappin' off at least like three phones
Me and Yams made the plan
Then I paid myself and I gave myself advance
Way before I became myself
I'd like to thank myself because I made myself the man
It's like lately I ain't myself
I'd rather hang myself before I play myself
Frontin' like you did it for the fellas
Get all the bitches jealous when you do that shit
Young niggas know the sky's the limit
All I ever wanna do is chill and get shaded
Nowadays stress overrated
All I ever wanna do is chill and get shaded

See the same thing all up in my bank account
And my YouTube account say the same amount
Money talk and dogs bark
I got a pocket full of stones in my stonewashed
With tiger stripes on it call that bitch a golf cart
I swear niggas better wear riot gear
Kill you and your dog then go put on a shirt that say PETA for life
I get keys on the spot and I keep it on lock
S'what I spent on my watch and I wave it like Ma$e
I eat seafood and steak
See that we strapped up we cap up your brim nigga
How real is this?
I know them Harlem
Niggas gon' be feelin' this

For really real  we chilly chill
Don't sport Chinchilla
My bounty hunter's
A bounty killer  I'm 'bout my skrilla
Gimme the title then gimme the cash
Fold it then bag it then move to the trap
Follow my stash  stealing my swag
Niggas is wickity-wickity-wack
Like Kriss Kross  her lip gloss
Slip-ons get slipped off
My bitch boss  Cristal
We smokin' that  thinkin' we're burnin' the hash
Puff it and pass  makin' it last
Walk in my shoes and then cross in my path
Game was for grabs  makin' 'em crash
Snuck it and snatched it  ain't givin' it back
Fuck the money  fuck the fame

The choir like my reefer and the preacher got my eyes low
Sister Mary Jane to make me sleep from singing high notes
Bloody ink on my pen spelled suicide
Kurt Cobain even died cause you scrutinize

Roof lost on the Wraith  roof lost on the way
Tell the front desk to cut new keys
Reserved in the Mercer for two years  in two suites
Took out the bed like it's fuck sleep
I'll smack a bitch like it's hot hands
Fired the label like fuck brands
Comfortable low nigga  fuck Xans
Comfortable slow  who the fuck ran

Drunk and disrespectful  callin' women bitches
I don't mean no harm but won't you and your friends-es
Meet us in the cut and we can do the business
God my witness that I only wanna kick it
And your girl just said they with us
So we rolling in them Benzes
Won't you pour it up and stop the babysitting
She got drunk as fuck and swallowed all my kids-es
Back to the Mac  tats on her back
Ass so fat  hit that from the back
When it clap from the back  she clappin' it back
She flat on her back and it's back to the trap
Fuck your pack  A$AP where it's at
Fuck nigga act  get clap lay flat
Fuck your dreams  leave a punk nigga dreamin'
Then you sleep  and you won't come back from the nap
And you know them smokin' bitches rolling reefer got me open
Wildin' to the morning with my homies  tell 'em where we goin'
Oh  yeah
Oh  yeah
Oh  wooh!
Niggas pistol-poppin' like it's 1999
Press rewind  back in time
Before rappers droppin' dimes
Trap or die  choppin' pies
With clichés all in they rhymes
Now it's Gucci  Prada and anything designer
They serve you to your flocka
If you disrespect that blocka  blocka
Choppas on eavesdroppers
Fuck these choppas  I'm about it
Grindin' like 2Pac or Biggie Poppa
Car jackin'  pistol-packin'
Mothafuckin' choppers clappin'
Fenders smashin'  windows crashin'
Pants saggin'  fuck your fashion

Maserati  like Atari
With no car keys  push to start it
New Bugatti  two Bugattis
Testarossa  blue Ferrari

This the hardest  supersonic
Systematic  too retarded
New Versace  new apartment
Bigger closet  newer carpet
Hit departments  cooler garments
Set my goal up  new accomplish
Shootin' targets  you the target
Movin' targets  new accomplice
Killed the game and still regardless"
