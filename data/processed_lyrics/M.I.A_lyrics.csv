Chinna girl is a little girl
From a town  that's all ya need to know
Lolita was a maneater
Clocked him like a taximeter
Fuck gold  she was platinum digger
Shakin-ass-making moves on a mover
Visa  then a plane ride to ya
Peace out  she'll kill you like Uma
She skipped away to the shop
She found she didn't have enough
She clocked him looking right at her
And sucked on a lollipop
She skipped away to the shop
She found she didn't have enough
She clocked him looking right at her

Chinna girl grew up to be a big girl
Had her sights set on a bigger world
Dial-a-Bride from Sri Lanka
Found herself a Yorkshire banker
Need a Visa? Got with a geezer
Need some money? Paid him with a-knees up
Year later  started to ease-up
Got her own way  shouted out  See ya!
She skipped away to the shop
She found she didn't have enough
She clocked him looking right at her
And sucked on a lollipop
She skipped away to the shop
She found she didn't have enough
She clocked him looking right at her
And sucked on a lollipop

Talking about you's such a bore
I'd rather talk about moi
Like do you know the cost of AK's up in Africa?
20 dollars ain't shit to you
But that's how much they are
So they're gonna use the shit just to get far
Is gold diamonds helping ya?
Don't you like my ban-dan-na? (bandana)
Got monkey brains and banana
I'll hit you with my antenna
I put soap in my eye
Make it red so I look rawr-rawr-rawr!
So I woke up with my Holy Quran
And found out I like Cadillac
So we're shootin' until the sun is up
Little boys are acting up
And baby mothers are going crazy
And the leaders all around cracking up
Price of livin' in a shanty town just seems very high
But we still like T.I
But we still look fly
Dancin' as we're shootin' up
And lootin' just to get by (Huh?)

Who made me like this!
Was it me and God in co-production?
My Devil's on speed-dial
Every time I take the wrong direction
All I want is one thing and that is what you got
There's 24 hours in a day
8 - work! 8 - sleep!
And 8 for play!
Now I give it all it takes
Now people on the Internet
A new life for the intellect
People judge me so hard cause I don't floss my titties out
I was born out of dirt like I'm porn in a skirt
I put people on the map that never seen a map
I've showed 'em something they've never seen
And hope they make it back!

Get clapped up nigga you can get applauded
Stitch you back up  get you fitted in your garments

When it's really hot  we go to the river and swim
When we're goin' fishin'  we catchin' the bream
When the river's high  we jump off the bridge
And when we get home  we play some didge'
When it's really hot  we go to the river and swim
When we're goin' fishin'  we catchin' the bream
When the river's high  we jump off the bridge
And when we get home  we play some didge'
They call me Wally  this is where I'm at
I wear my NRL baseball cap
Parramatta's my team if you know what I mean
To be the captain  that's my dream
My name is Keith from Wilcannia Street
I walk on stilts to read the beat
When it crawls out  I shake a leg
This is my rhyme and that's what I said

I had to jump town and my money's all spent (all spent)

Listen to the words that come from my lips
Jump off the bridge and I'll play the didge
And when I catch a fish  I put it in the fridge
My name is Buddy  I can't stand still
Wilcannia to Dubbo to Broken Hill
I've been movin' around from town-to-town
And this is how I get down!
Rode the BMX when we walked through the bush
The boys fight to ride it  but I just let 'em push
Keith stole an egg from a lil' cuckoo
Kept it safe in his mouth  while he danced jookoo jookoo
There's only one ocean that got fish left
One day we'll have to be a really good chef
And I don't mean us in the bush making meth
Boys if you catch meth you catch your death
When I said that Keith sneezed and had a chick
Broke the little egg in his mouth in little bits
When it's really hot  we go to the river and swim

Y'all just so metrosexual
This is not my politically correct flow
This is more like letting that TEC blow
This is more like a left when they say right
When the world do you wrong but you play right
This is more like pushing that white rock
When the world try to put you in a tight box
Coming down in the drop with the system crank
'Cause you don't give a fuck what the system think
Y'all comin up M.I.—M.I.—M.I.A
Semi-spray when you in my way
I'mma be who I'm gonna be
I'm just a boy from the hood
What you want from me?
Ugh
