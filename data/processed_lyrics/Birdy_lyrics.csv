"Now the future's sorted out
Watch her moving in elliptical patterns 
Think it's not what you say 
What you say is way too complicated
For a minute though I couldn't tell how to fall out
It's twenty seconds till the last call
Callin' hey hey hey hey hey hey
Lie down you know it's easy
Like we did it through summer long
And I'll be anything you ask and more
It's not a miracle we needed
No I wouldn't let you think so
Past and present 1855-1901
Watch them built up a material tower
Think it's not gonna stay anyway
Think it's overrated
For a minute through I couldn't tell how to fall out

Lie down you know it's easy
Like we did it through summer long
And I'll be anything you ask and more
It's not a miracle we needed
No I wouldn't let you think so
I don’t want you to change around it
In some time this love will end and all will be forgotten
And yeah. someday we will laugh about it
And you say it's alright
And I know that it’s a lie
From the black in your eyes
You don’t have to do this on your own
Like there’s no one that cares about you
You don’t have to act like you're alone
Like the walls are closing in around you
You don’t have to pretend no one knows
Like there’s no one that understands you
I’m not just some face you used to know
I know all about you
And you should know that someone cares about you
I know all about you
And you say that it's alright

Time for learning  why have I not learned a thing?
Words with no meaning have kept me dreaming
But they don't tell me anything
And all you never say is that you love me so
All I'll never know is if you want me  oh
If only I could look into your mind
Maybe then I'd find a sign
Of all I want to hear you say to me  to me
Are you uncertain or just scared to drop your guard?
Have you been broken?
Are you afraid to show your heart?
Life can be unkind  but only sometimes
You're giving up before you start
And all you never say is that you love me so

This is more than we had planned
Choices taken from our hands
My mind is a runaway
And I find it's too hard to breathe
Just say what you want to say
Are you there?
I feel these growing pains
Have made us far too strong
We'll change if you want to change
Are you there?
You could lose yourself and search forever
Looking for the person that you'll never be
We've been trying to compensate
Time to learn from our mistakes
Maybe one day we'll fit back together
I'll pick up the pieces and we'll rearrange
Now we need to follow fate
Now we look the other way
Now we find the strength to stand alone

You think I’m weak ‘cause you can tear me apart with the words that you speak
You think you’re in control
But you don’t understand how much you’re wrong
All you crave is attention and just to be loved
You need to be loved
And I want to be free
When my heart is made from gold
And forgiveness seems too bold
I still find it in my heart
To say I love you
When my heart is made from gold
And the hurt is just too bold
I still find it in my heart
To say I love you
Is there not enough to use your love for me
To get past the things that cause you envy and hate
And the fights that they bring
You say you're looked on as small

Hoping one day you'll make a dream last

You only need the sun when it starts to snow
Only know you love him when you let him go
Staring at the ceiling in the dark
Same old empty feeling in your heart
'Cause love comes slow and it goes so fast
And you see him as you fall asleep
'Cause you loved him too much
But you dived too deep
And you only need the light when it's burning low

It's getting hard to hide this tainted lullaby
I'm talking in my sleep
The sky is falling down
It's getting closer now
It's getting hard to breathe
Your hold has kept my heart in chains
Something in the air's got me feeling you're here again
Watching the clock hand fall asleep on us

Sweet innocence
There is a dusty room
Kept for a friend

And we couldn't see what we were running from

Been a broken machine

On a loop in a dream
Did you think I'd move on?

You can take the things they say
As the bitter truth
But don't throw it all away
On second hand news
'Cause if I just let go
If my heart could choose
I would burn these bridges I've built
And find my way back to you
I'd leave it all behind
I've got nothing to lose
And I know you've heard what you've heard
But it doesn't mean it's true
On second hand news
Crying silent tears in the next-door room
'Cause everybody's here but you
So I wrote you out this message
But I stopped myself from sending it off
If I just let go
If my heart could choose
I would burn these bridges I've built
And find my way back to you
Leave it all behind
I've got nothing to lose
And I know you've heard what you've heard
But it doesn't mean it's true
On second hand news
 aaaaah
 aaaaah
 aaaaah
 aaaaah
And can you hear when I say?
I have never felt this way
Maybe I have said something that was wrong
Can I make it better with the lights turned on?
Maybe I have said something that was wrong
Can I make it better with the lights turned on?
Can I be? Was I there?
It felt so crystal in the air
I still want to drown whenever you leave
Please teach me gently how to breathe
And I'll cross oceans like never before
So you can feel the way I feel it too
And I'll send images back at you
So you can see the way I feel it too
Maybe I have said something that was wrong
Can I make it better with the lights turned on?
Maybe I have said something that was wrong
Storms that steer me out of reach
And you just wait on my defeat
So I built an army underneath
And now they guard me while I sleep
And this worn out frame will carry me
Don't go holding your breath
You know that I'm not done yet
There's still a fight in me left
Don't go shouting out loud
That you're claiming the crown
I'm down but not out
And the bittersweet of every new defeat
Is I'm stronger than before
Maybe on my knees
But I still believe
These broken wings will soar
Untie my silhouette
It's all that is left of a broken heart
Leave all of my regrets
To sink like shipwrecks through oceans dark

Pour a little salt  we were never here
Staring at the sink of blood and crushed veneer
I tell my love to wreck it all
Cut out all the ropes and let me fall
Right in this moment  this order's tall
And I told you to be patient
And I told you to be fine
And I told you to be balanced
And I told you to be kind
And in the morning I'll be with you
But it will be a different kind
'Cause I'll be holding all the tickets
And you'll be owning all the fines
Come on  skinny love  what happened here?
Suckle on the hope in light brassieres
Sullen load is full  so slow on the split

Who will fall far behind?
Come on skinny love
Take it all  take it all
And I don't care anymore
You can lie  all you like
All it's done is make me fight
And shake the truth inside my soul
I'm tired  pretending
Keep my beliefs suspended
Cause underneath
I'm starting to wake from silent sleep
I'm starting to break and I can grieve
I'm starting to see that I know how
I'm starting to heal and find some faith
I'm starting to feel what's out of place
Don't need you to save me  I can't wait
To fall  to fade and start again
Hurricane  hurricane
Take it all  take it all
Spin me 'round and back again

Unlike most you don’t miss a thing
You see the truth
I walk the halls invisibly
I climb the walls  no one sees me
No one but you
You’ve always loved the strange birds
Now I want to fly into your world
I want to be heard
My wounded wings still beating
You’ve always loved the stranger inside…
Me  ugly pretty
Oh little ghost  you see the pain
But together we can make something beautiful
So take my hand and perfectly
We fill the gaps  you and me make three
I was meant for you  and you for me

Said you'd watch over my heart
Your love was so real
Too late to forget how you made me feel
Tell me what I was supposed to believe
And now I can't find how to let you go
You were mine but you've grown so cold
Say it's all in my head
I remember when you said
I'll never let you go
Held me in the dark
Sheltered as you took my heart
Say it's all in my head
Remember when you said
I'll never let you go?
Shelter as you take my heart
Take my heart
Tell me all your love lies again
Cast your shadows
Like how you said you'd catch me but let me go

Said you'd let me be if I wanted you to

When you're losing ground?
Could you keep your head up?
Ooh ooh ooh
Everything you once loved
Like your own blood
Comes crumbling down
Could you keep your head up?
Ooh ooh ooh
Sometimes
The tears we cry
Are more than any heart can take
We hide
Just keep it inside
Small wonder that it starts to break
Many moons will light up our way
As sure as night will follow day
And everything you once loved remains
Could you find a daydream
In the dead of night?
Could you find a daydream

Keep a quiet victory
To a whisper
In an uphill fight
Could you keep your head up?

Took pictures of the stage
