lyrics
"And I wonder if they realized the damage
Who made a lot of money off that shit
And I wonder if it fucked with they conscience
I couldn't stand seeing people fucking theyselves up like that on the shit
And that's where the money came from
They call me Mr. Treat Your Nose
They call me Mr. Treat Your Nose
Gotta watch out for them 5-0 foreigners
Your mother's a goner
I warned you before you supersized my fries with that dollar
The only thing you wanna bunk her was your freedom
You can't afford to get caught up but you in too deep
And the seashore ain't saw ya
But you bought her a new house cause you love her
Growing up you barely had a roof
Now you got a coupe and it doesn't have a roof
I guess you're accustomed what you're used to
Like Susan and Karen be doing your pockets
And running the man and he's losing his fucking mind
And it's all an illusion
Who was alludin' all of this potent?
I am the reason your family is using and shooting up
It's my fault
For killing your aunties and uncles
The hustle and hunger
All I wanted was a cheeseburger
I got a little money in my pocket
They call me Mr. Treat Your Nose
They call me Mr. Treat Your Nose
You get addicted to the flip (I'm sorry)
You feel like it's your duty to be the man in between the man
And make this happen for that person (I'm sorry)
And to do this and do that
Next thing you know you're in too deep
Shoot down the people that look just like them
Dudes is buying guns to take down each other
(Call me  call me  call me) Uh
(Call me  call me  call me) Uh
(Call me  call me  call me)
(Call me) How you doin'?
(Call me) My name is Lonely  nice to meet you
Here's my number
You can reach me  woo!

911  call me some time
(You should call me)
911  call me some time
911 (You should call me  oh)
911 (Call me)
My thirst levels are infinity and beyond
Sippin' on that lemonade  I need a Beyoncé
Can't see straight  these shades are Céline Dion
Sucks you can't gas me up  shout out to Elon
Musk  yeah  I got a sold-out show
Crowd wild out but don't matter 'cause you not front row
I've been lookin' for a keeper  listen to the speaker
If you fit description  hit me on my beeper
At that 911

Where you used to come and get me with the swerve  swerve
These days you gotta find time
Even the nightline
Work line
Dial nine
Five car garage
Full tank of the gas
But that don't mean nothing  nothing
Nothin'  nothin'  without you shotgun in the passenger
I'm the loneliest man alive
But I keep on dancing to throw 'em off
I'm gon' run out of moves 'cause I can't groove to the blues
If you know any DJs  tell 'em to call me at 911...
I can't even lie  I've been lonely as fuck
Old lonely ass nigga
I can't even lie  I've been lonely as fuck
I can't even lie  I've been lonely as fuck
Old weird ass nigga
I can't even lie  I've been
They say the loudest in the room is weak
That's what they assume  but I disagree
I say the loudest in the room
Is prolly the loneliest one in the room (That's me)
Attention seeker  public speaker
Oh my God  that boy there is so fuckin' lonely (Woo)
Writin' songs about these people
Who do not exist  he's such a fuckin' phony (Woo)
One thing I know  is that I wanna
Win so bad  but I'm not Chicago
My heart is low  it's real low  it's so low
You can't lift me up  I'm like Gallardo
From the start it's been real dark
It's been so dark  I guess that you could call me charbroiled  huh (Hahaha)
I'm playin' like Hasbro
I'm really Saari  call me Arto
Crashed the McLaren  bought me a Tesla
I know you sick of me talkin' 'bout cars (Skrrt)
But what the fuck else do you want from me?
That is the only thing keepin' me company
Purchase some things until I'm annoyed
These items is fillin' the void (Void)
Been fillin' it for so long
I don't even know if it's shit I enjoy (Ohh  woo)
Current battle as an adult
My partner is a shadow
I need love  do you got some I could borrow?
Fuck it  I could find some tomorrow
But that never comes (Nah)
Like a vasectomy  what have I done? (Ohh)
I got the talent  the face and the funds
Found myself long ago but I haven't found someone (Who)
Mirror  mirror on the wall (Who)
The loneliest of them all (Me)
Cupid actin' stupid
Do you got another number I could call?
Never had a pet
I never had a pet
There's more fish in the sea
But I never had a goldfish to begin with
I never had a dog
So I've never been good with bitches
'Cause I never threw a ball  fetch
I never had a pet  that's where it stems from  I bet
Treat me like direct deposit (-Posit)
Check in on me sometime (Okay)
Ask me how I'm really doin'
So I never have to press that 911
Ohh!
Ohh Shit!
Fuck!
Ohh!
Shit!
Ohh!

Mom was only twenty when you ain't have any fucks to spare
Also stuck with a beautiful home with a case of stairs
So you not being near fuckin' fire-started my damn career
But sucks you ain't give a fuck and consider a sperm donor now
Fuck is an Okonma? I'm changing my shit to Haley
But if I ever had the chance to ask this nigga
And call him
I hope he answer
I hope you answer

I hope you pick up your phone (Please pick up)
I'd like to talk to you

Suck my fucking dick and swallow this case of nuts
And I ain't sharing green as if I'm facing blunts
Supposed to be gone 'til November but quickly came back in August
I left two months through September to clearly remember all this
I'll call her number
But she won't answer
I hope you answer
I hope you answer
I hope you answer
I hope you pick up your phone
(I'd like to talk to you)
I hope you answer
You claim to hate my fuckin' guts
But say I'm on a island in Thailand and I was wilding
And hope that I could live off saltwater and fuckin' coconuts
Day is getting dark like the area's turning urban
You'll be fuckin' nervous like me inside of a church is
I hope you answer
Just dream

Are we still friends? Can we be friends?
Are we still friends? I've got to kno—

In this cracked crack fag back slab in disguise
Fat sack of knives in the passenger side
I'm not an asshole  I just don't give a fuck a lot
The only time I do is when a bitch is screaming Tyler  stop!
The big bad wolf  to me  you're just a minor fox
Red Riding is getting some of this wolfly odder cock
We the niggas you scared of like bad dentists
Flow is anthemic  dirty like it's plants in it
To have a bitch ready to stab a clit with some glass and shit
Your whole gang'll be diminished  bunch got the Brady's in it
Spit sick shit like my saliva got the rabies in it
Fuck rap  I'll be a landlord so I can rape the tenant's daughter
Leave my house with a new stomach  and a baby in it
Face it  me and Ace is sick like malaria carri—
Why did you do that?

Jim Carrey her to the cemetery to bury her
Listen busters  scarier when I finger fuck her
After I dig her up and then eat her out with a bit of mustard
Took karate  mommy told me Tyler toughen up
Rihanna haircut  somebody tell Chris Brown to fuck me up
Had to teach the bitch manners  now I gotta learn her
I'll beat the fuck out your bitch anonymous  Ike Turner
Over  sloppy seconds is my preference
Except for when I'm feeding on the flesh of a pedestrian
Nessy loch monster stop Will he though? Probably not
Silly hoes lick my balls like FIFA lollipops
Get the certain tingle  eating Häagen-Dazs
With some soccer moms where they like to fucking sit and mingle
Watch an Animal Planet document on the Eagles
In the flyest '06 Supreme beanie  Sigel
I am Legend  a snicker dick in a vanilli chick
Come take a stab at it faggot  I pre-ordered your casket
This is known as a classic  yeah that chapped lips crack shit
Hat is always forest so the bitches call me Gump
But compliment her tits and then its off to hump her
Fuck her in a Hummer while I rape her then I put her in a slumber
It's not a figure of speech when I tell you that I dumped her
Known narcissists  sipping on arsenic
Carved carcasses in the garage  don't park in it
Hard as finding retarded kids at Harvard
It's Wolf Gang barking keep you up like car alarms and shit
Over the edge  yeah I hide in a potato sack
'Cause I'm cold as ice like Anasia when she fucking Traq
I'm the type to put you down to bring myself up
So when I rape a bitch I hold her down and get my best nut
The reincarnation of '98 Eminem
60 Crip and Grizzly and some RMK Denim
Pay attention I'm stabbing your women friends  like a gentleman
Then dipping with the fucking pen to go sin again
White girl  you can ask her what the dick be like
At monster madness doing drive by's on a fucking fixie bike
Oxymoron like buff faggots playing sissy dikes
This the shit that get cripple bitches to hop
Sly's little shop of horrors  now showing
I hate gays  gangbangers and fucking jerkers
Unless it's gay gangbangers  that's fucking jerkers
Odd Future Wolf Gang  Wu-Tang banging in your system
Probably banging in your sister
With my children swimming in her system
Let me say this shit in slow-mo  homo
 I was that guy
 wish that I can own it or lease it or clone it
 your name still my password
 you're my girlfriend
And any other fuck-nigga-ass blog that can't put an 18 year old nigga
Making his own fucking beats  covers  videos and all that shit
Fuck you post-Drake-ass cliche-jerking  LA-Slauson rapping
Fuck-nigga-ass Hypebeast niggas  now back to the album
So  just tell me something about yourself...
This is what the devil plays before he goes to sleep
Some food for thought? This food for death  go 'head and fucking eat
I cut my wrist and play piano 'cause I'm so depressed
Somebody call the pastor  this bastard is so possessed
This meeting just begun  nigga  I'm Satan's son
My mother raised me  a single parent  so it's apparent
That I got love for my mother  none of you other fuckers
Are much important  I'm getting angrier while recording
I'm feeling like the bulls  I've got a gang of wolves

Drunk white girls: the only way I'll get my dick sucked
Suspended from school  coolest nigga without effort
Easy to spot  like black bitches with fake leopard
Soak me up in a tampon  but keep the lamp on
'Cause this album pack enough evil
That you can't fit inside a Jansport
Go to school with this
I go from AP to JC inside a fucking week
Waking up with random girls like Yo  bitch  how the fuck we meet?
I stay with grandma  she always bitching about her carpet
Every time I walk inside the house  she always tend to start shit
No to drugs  I never spark it  I used to be bullied for honor classes
By those that were slow as molasses
Take this shit to school
Raquel treat me like my father  like a fucking stranger
She still don't know I made Sarah to strangle her
Not put her in danger and chop her up in the back of a Wrangler
All because she said no to homecoming  demons running
Inside my heads telling me evil thoughts
I'm the dream catcher but nothing but nightmares are caught  go to sleep
I wear green hats because I'm fortunately lucky
Fuck me  the monster said  somehow the monster's dead
Inside of me  but the thoughts it tells me are still evil
With this state of mind  big moves  Max Keeble
I'm on my grind feeble  my music is either
A fucking sin or too illegal  play this shit in church
I graduated without honors or fucking father
He died (I'm so sorry) No bitch  don't even fucking bother
I wanted a brother  my mother I told her
But instead I got a sister  just like me with her mister nada
So both of our imaginations are creations of the fucking situation
That's having our brains racing like Dayton
Wearing some fucking Heelys
I know you fucking feel me  I want to fucking kill me
But times I'm so serious  you think I'm silly
I'm doing Big Style Willy couldn't touch 11
Seven  what's religion nigga? I am legend
I roll with skaters and musicians with an intuition
I created O.F. cause I feel we're more talented
Than 40 year old rappers talking about Gucci
When they have kids they haven't seen in years
Impressing their peers
With the same problem  the only way to solve them
Is to go to Father's Day convention with a gold revolver
Cause my mother let me do what I want
She wasn't careless  protective she is the bear
The shit is so bare  my diary isn't hid
My father didn't give a fuck  so it's something I inherit
My mom is all I have so it's never meet the parents
When Danielle or Milan decide to fucking share
This confused boy  I wanna hug  oy
I’m bad for your kids to listen to  soy is not the choice
I'm bad milk  drink it
Whoa  umm  it seems you had a lot to say
Uh  who knows I might feel as I'm evaluating
My wrist is all red from the cutter
Dripping cold blood like the winter  the summer
Is never that's equivalent to me and Sarah
Well that's not her fucking name  but I think this shit is clever
My niggas wanna know if I'm fucking  if I'm kissing
But I'm sitting here downing beers simply just wishing
With a tear they try to tell me but I never listen
'Cause I don't give a shit like sitting down pissing
Eighteen  still talking to imaginaries
Hopefully they see the talent I carry just like Jimmy
Losers can never win me  you can never offend me
My goal in life is a Grammy  hopefully mom'll attend the
Ceremony with all my homies  I'm suicidal
This my Zombie Circus  I hope the majors heard this
Fuck a deal  I just want my father's email
So I can tell him how much I fucking hate him in detail
Wow  umm

And said Ayo! Can we get a pic? I said no
So I'm sitting there posing with Travis  Devon
With a fake smile like her titties was drawing it on
So fucking annoyed 'cause I missed Goliath
'Cause some kid said I was there  then they caused a riot (Tyler's here!)
Now I'm surrounded by a 25 hound of fuckers tryna get a photo
All because they noticed the top with the box logo
And them fucking ears  guarantee they didn't even hear Bastard
They bandwagon-jumped me from a pogo
Until I heard Radicals  the last part got to me
See  I used to give a fuck until my cock would bleed
Now I'm the happiest I think I'll ever ever be
My life is just like yours  no father
My momma must have forgot to stop with a popped condom
In school I was the one that was thinking outside boxes
So everybody in them would say that I got problems
So when I heard you say it  I said it back like fuck 'em
You're an inspiration to niggas like me
Not the niggas who just like you 'cause of lyrics and beats
I'm talking 'bout the niggas who don't know where they're going to be
I heard the song Bastard right in the moment of heat
Gun on the edge of my feet  I heard that first piano chord
And it drew me in like predators carrying treats
I mean snare and a kick drum  see my forearm?
I carved OF on it this morning with a glass shard
On my green mini ramp that I built in my backyard (that's weird)
That's hard  that scar from playing air guitar
When I see you play at the Roxy (uhh)
I think about your face and I don't even fucking try to (no homo)
Wish I had a basement meant for me to hide you
We could play Xbox and listen to In Search Of... and eat donuts
Over conversating 'bout what church does
Come up with weird-ass videos with roach bugs
I'm straight edge too  so no drugs on this trip
And Raquel that bitch  you should've killed that bitch
You should've took me instead (uhh  that's weird)
See  if you can't have her then he shouldn't neither
And if I can't have you then she shouldn't either
No one should see you  but me in your t-shirt
I worship you until the fucking wrinkles on my knees hurt (what the fuck)
I know it seems like I'm just slobbing on your knob
But I'm just a fan and I ain't losing my fucking noggin (yeah  you are)
I ain't got a job and I went out and bought Goblin about 5 times
'Cause (Thanks for the support) I love you man (alright)
I like tie-dyed tees or just plain white tees
I like pants that's cut  I like words like fuck
I got your pics on my wall with the mouth cut out
Now paper cuts on my balls because your dick's in my jaw (what the fuck)
And I hit you on Twitter about 10 minutes a day
And now I'm bitter 'cause you don't even reply with a hey (sorry)
And my boys think I'm gay 'cause I play VCR
In my car all alone speakers waking up neighbors...
So I can get on Colossus  line as slow as molasses
And I appreciate the fact that you would suck on my dick
But I'm not gay so it's awkward  now I'm grouchy like Oscar
After spilling some shit on his newest pair of beige Dockers
Yonkers and Yonkers (I love that song) Sick of hearing about Yonkers
I'm grateful that it worked  I attacked and I conquered
Yeah whatever but I had a fucking blast at that concert
I was at the Boston one  I got a t-shirt from Sagan
The one that say Sagan Lockhart and when you came out to Sandwitches
That's when my fucking boy-crush got started

Fallin' outta my pocket  but y'all want to know if I swam to cool down
How much cooler can I get until I run out of fans?
How many fans can I have until they turn on the AC?
If the AC blow up  well then I'm TNT  I'm gone
I'm gone and I'm finished
And I ain't seen my friends in a minute
Guessing nothing lasts forever
Yeah  nothing lasts forever
Nothing sticks together
Sick of sitting in doubt
Please let me figure this out  out

All my friends lost
They couldn't read the signs
I didn't wanna talk and tell 'em my location

Big fan of the beige tan
Had to keep it on the subwoofer
A couple butterflies wanna float

Shit and chatter 'bout the heat

I'm not a fucking role model (I know this)
I'm a 19 year old fucking emotional coaster with pipe dreams
Since Kanye tweeted tellin' people he's bumpin' all of my shit
These motherfuckers think I'm 'sposed to live up to something? Shit
I'm still jackin' off and proceedin' my life careless
But getting more pussy 'cause I tell bitches I'm Wood Harris (as you should)
Philly to Paris  I'm getting these weird stares
At skateparks and airports all in a year  it's weird
Yonkers dropped and left them craniums mindfucked
Now competition missing like that nigga my mom fucked
He still hasn't called me yet (that's not your fault)
But that's a whole fucking different argument  shit  I got over it
And a couple bucks in my pocket  so now I could go buy
A couple Hot Pockets and grandma could stop cooking
Them nasty ass collard greens  pressure's on me like this top hat
Bastard intro  how the fuck I'm gonna top that?
Tyler  you'll top it  you'll top that  you're a very capable individual
Okay  you guys caught me  I'm not a fucking rapist or serial killer  I lied

To have a bunch a critics call my shit a bunch of horrorcore?
Like I didn't make Parade or Inglorious
Cause I'm too scared to tell my friends the way I really fucking feel?
Of course they only listen to lyrics about me pissin' off
In the tombs of Lara Croft  I'm getting pissed off (I bet)
Message boards are on my dick  I need a pissing waiver (here)
Let me bust one in they mouth  I know they full of flavor
Can't they just be happy for me like  a kid with nothing  living out his dreams? Why they got to fucking hate?
I think everyone's happy  everyone's immature  everyone loves you Tyler  you have to believe that.
I don't even skate anymore  I'm too fucking busy  I can barely kickflip now.
Why? Why is that? Do you not have any free time when you're at  home?
What the fuck you mean I'm not talented? You see the shit that I've been doing?
I have  I mean you're a great person.
I mean  I'm not that great of a rapper but as a whole  I'm pretty cool  right?
People excited  thinking shit is so tight (For what?)
Getting co-signs from rappers that I don't even like
What the fuck you want me to do? Start to gobble his mic?
And start Jackson him off until his cack blasting off? (No...)
Fuck that  (Yeah) These niggas ain't fucking with me
Cause I don't listen to the Immortal of Tech-of-the-nique
And all this underground bullshit that's never gon' peak
On the Billboard Top 20 and Jam of the Week
I'd rather listen to Badu and Pusha the T
And some Waka Flocka Flame instead (I love that shit) of that real hip hop
That's bull-of-the-sheet  but they want to critique
Everything that we  Wolf Gang  has ever released
But they don't get it  (They don't  it's not made for them) cause it's not made for them
The nigga that's in the mirror rapping  it's made for him
But they do not have the mindset that's same as him
I'm not weird  you're just a faggot  shame on him
It is  but Tyler  you're going to have to cut down on that faggot word  that's very  that's a bad...
I'm not homophobic.
I mean  I don't think you are but...
Faggot.
Alright  well  since the last time we...
The fuck is a good performance? I get on stage and I have as much fun as I can.
I mean  you  you  it seems like you have fun. But your Twitter posts  just.. I mean  they're really random and it's ADD.
Who doesn't have ADD..? Well  I don't.
I mean  sometimes  you just say really outlandish things and we just want to know  what's the problem for this?
I wish Thebe was here.
Therapy's been sinning and niggas getting offended
They don't want to fuck with me cause I do not fuck with religion

At 47 kids  I don't wanna see my name mentioned

College wasn't working and I wasn't working
So I was at home jerking off until my dick was hurting
But I was determined to be great  so those classes can wait
Cause the four days that I went  I wasn't learning shit (I mean  you...)
Now I'm living dreams that I wanted since eight
And can afford to get my mother something on her birthday
(I mean  you've explained to me that you were in school  but  I mean  I...)
They claim the shit I say is just wrong
Like nobody has those really dark thoughts when alone
I'm just a teenager  who admits he's suicide prone
My life is doing pretty good  so that date is postponed for now
Wow  life's a cute bitch full of estrogen
And when she gives you lemons  nigga  throw 'em at pedestrians
(So  what are you saying  take advantage?
I mean  you've been doing pretty good  I've seen that)
I still live in my grandma's house
Sell out a fucking show in London just to end up on couches
I hate my fucking life  but when I make that announcement
My hero calls my phone  just to put that in doubt then
And then I am confused if I want in or just out
My friends really think I'm playing when I say I need counseling
I sit in grandmother's living room and just pout
And shout loud inside  sometimes I just want to die (No  you don't)
Odd Future came from the bottom
And it's gon' take a couple armed armies tryna stop 'em

Jump off the roof into the mirror
Felt like summer to my December
I know my temperature was set
You finally flew south
At least I had it (Uh)
Instead of never
Or maybe I'm too dramatic
Or maybe it's just a dream that I can't seem to wake up from
I just hope to God she got good taste
Could put you on some shit you never seen
Could play a couple songs that you could dance to
I hope you know she can't compete with me
Or maybe it's just a dream that I can't seem to wake up from
Ayo (My love is gone)
It's poison in that gumbo
Ask me where my love go
That bitch walked outside the front door (My love is gone)
The weatherman told me it wasn't rainin'
My stupid ass brought umbrellas
I got a glimpse of your cloud and felt better
Is drenched in sweat and delusion because I jet to conclusions
Everybody making a choice according to plan and
You started buildin' a bridge and turned it into a fence
Then my buildin' got tore down all because of your new tenant

Thank you for the love
Thank you for the joy
But I don't ever wanna fall in love again
Thank you for the time

And I just handle all my business like a chessboard

So I won't walk around with my head down like I got beat up
Um  you do you  I'll do me  I’ll just chuck the peace up

I wrote a song about you  I want your opinion
Opposite of my heart rate  it slows down at the ending
'Cause the love I got for you has exceeded appearance
The lyrics are—
If you do answer  I'll play it to state facts
Although I already know the response you gon' say back
At that point I'll hang up  disappear and just stay back
And if you don't I'll leave a voicemail with the playback
Hello  no one is available to take your call
Please leave a message after the tone

Can name a sweater  but not a talent or don't know if whether

I was defiant  always said  Fuck shit
Hated the popular ones  now I'm the popular one
Also hated homes too  til I start coppin' me some
See I don't beez in the trap  nigga  I beez in the b's
And I be gassing up my buzz like some bees at a Shell
Fucking sick and getting bigger like I sneezed on Adele
And bitches getting touchy-feely like they reading some Braille
I bust quick like gun-holders with short tempers  and well

These fucking rappers got stylists cause they can't think for themselves
See  they don't have an identity  so they needed some help  but

Look at that Mom who thinks I'm evil  hold that grudge against me
Though I'm the reason that her motherfucking son got to eat
Look at the kid who had the .9 and tried to blow out his mind
But talk is money  I said  Hi  I guess I bought him some time
Look at the ones in the crowd -- that shit is barnacles  huh?
They thought I wasn't fair until I threw a carnival  huh?
But then again  I'm an atheist that just worships Satan
And it's probably why I'm not getting no fucking album placements

And young enough to get the fucking priest to come and flirt with us (Bitch)
You niggas rap about fucking bitches and getting head
Instead  I rap about fucking bitches and gettin' heads
While you niggas stacking bread  I can stack a couple dead
I fuck bitches with no permission and tend to hate shit
Brag about the actions in a rhymin' pattern matter
Then proceed to sat her down when I go splatter in her chatterbox
Torture with the super soaker at the Asian liquor store
This the type of shit that make a Chris Brown want to kick a whore
That make songs about the wet blockers when it rains and pours (Umbrella)
Got a nigga shakin' like the calmest  fucking Haitian (Ha-ha)
After chronic masturbation  askin' where Mary Kate went
I want to be the reasons why all lesbians hate dick (Hate dick)
I make this damn Bullwinkle the red moose
Game of duck-duck-duct tape with a dead goose
She runnin' 'round this motherfucking dungeon  her legs loose (On God)
Until I accidentally get the saw to her head  oops
Honey on that toppin' when I stuff you in my system (La  la)
Rape a pregnant bitch and tell my friends I had a threesome (La  la)
You got a fucking death wish? I'm a genie  it'll get done
Nice to meet you  but it's more pleasant to eat you
With a leaf of salad and some dressin' pourin' out a teacup
Rubber more than the fucking bottom of a sneaker
Jeeper the fucking creeper  get your daughter and keep her
In the jeeps where the Wolf Gang rides around deeper
Take her to Ladera  now she's scared and you're embarrassed
Filled with terror  chop her legs off and tell her to run some errands (Bitch)
Put her eyes in a canteen  take her to the Berrics
Stare at Steve  say it costs ten to fuck Eric
Satan says we're dangerous  we're trading kids for angel dust
And snuff and sniff  and now that Michael Jackson's tryin' to suck our dick
Gave the team a bunch of fucking bees and the Keke Palmer
They will never catch him or catch up
They asked me what it was  I told them fuckers it was ketchup
Nutty like my Chex Mix  she bleedin' from her rectum
This the type of shit that make children break in apartments
When you tell a fucking orphan you don't love them 'til they heart thin (I hate you)
Starve her 'til I carve her then I shove her in the Rover
Where I cut her like a barber with a Parkinson's disorder
Store her in a portable freezer with me to Portland
Catch me with a bunch of fucking Mexicans crossin' the border (Arriba)
I'll be the only wetback who ain't really touched the water
'Cause I'll be too fucking busy tryna flirt with Jesus daughter (Fuck Mary)

I plan on either dying for suicide or my asthma
Being the only bastard in a box logo casket (Casket)

You never wanna meet a motherfucker like me

Let's take it back to them days
Counting sheep on Sadie Hannah's floor
Carpet was my baby mama
80 dollar profit from the coffee I poured
Rent-A-Center calling everyday
In toys I only dreamed that I could afford
Now I roll through Okaga
I ride to California (Yeah)
These frog oval goggles
I'm leanin' out the window
Slick circles float roll
Out this world
(Let's go!)
Shit weighs a ton
Tell these black kids they could be who they are
I never mall grip with my manicured nails
I coconut oil the skin
I keep the top low 'cause the follicles thinnin'
Went from statistic to millionaire
CNN doubted 'cause my skin is dark
Then they forget when I get in my car
These frog oval goggles
I'm leanin' out the window
Simp sun shinin' on me
Slick circles roll float
Out this world
I glow (I glow)
(Let's go!)
Keep it in my branches so my family can eat
You don't know what I keep in the trunk
Ahh
Run it
Run it
Him that ni-gga  I swear
Stand out guy  him don't need no chair
I don't shop at the mall  all y'all just
Dumb mothafucka  I'm a goddamn artist
You can give me some markers and I'll draw you a closet
Nigga fresh to death like he got dressed in a coffin
The boy drips swag like a broken faucet
That cherry be the bomb like he ran in Boston
Won't stop 'til the cops surround him
One nigga jiggy and the other awesome
With his fuckin' face blown off  that's how they found him
It's Young T
Who dat boy? Who him is?

WANG$AP on the bumper sticker  fuck you niggas
Fuck global warming  my neck is so frío
I'm currently lookin' for '95 Leo
My mom say she worried because I'm so ill
I should stay in bed  but got too much bread
To make  she said watch my weight
So I stayed home and start eatin' some meals
That's 0 to 60 in 2 point nueve  I'm gone
Met you on a Saturday  knew it was somethin' soon as you spoke it
Eye fuckin' across the table  don't think anybody noticed
You asked me if I was comin' to city you from
Maybe we should kick it  I was interested  that would be dumb
If I denied long legs  good ears  great taste
Smell good  sense of humor  obvious a good face
And we clicked  we was at each other's hips
I ain't even wanna fuck 'cause your presence was enough
You and I make sense  you stayed back at my telly
We was chattin' 'til mornin'  the vibrations was heavy
I wasn't drownin' or yawnin'  that's when I told you my feelings
You told me you felt the same  but you got homie you dealin' with
Damn  I didn't know  that's a bit unexpected
But I get it  it's whatever  least I can do is respect it
We still gon' kick it and check-in like nothin' could ever stop it
The problem is he my friend  but if I'm honest  I'm really hopin' you drop him
It's morals I really have  it's lines I could never cross
But you got somethin' that make all them good intentions get lost
I try to keep it together  never felt this way
We spent 'bout two weeks together  only skipped one day
I would rather hold your hand than have a cool handshake
But whatever  we still could be friends  it could still be chance

It's  it's like starting a race
It was too late and shit
It's nothin' incriminatin'  but please delete our discussions
You hit me with the look and replied like  Duh  bitch
Don't want your man to think that we creepin' behind his back
Though I haven't seen him in months  shit is rare he never hit back
Anyway  convince him to bring you to me so we could kick it
Right in front of his lenses  nothing here is malicious
You sat by me in that movie  we went outside for them doobies
We walkin' off when we talk  man  that nigga not fuckin' stupid
He see it  he know it's somethin' we frontin' like  Ha-ha-ha
Whenever we Ha-ha-ha  we subtly press his buttons
If I fucked our friendship up for you  I think it's worth it
And plus y'all got depth  I'm just the nigga on the surface  for real
Surface
I said surface  like  'cause they got roots
Like  I'm the new nigga
But you know  they be fuckin'  haha
Yeah  yeah
Didn't see you a couple weeks  think he want you away from me
Know y'all argued 'bout if you mad you met him before you met me
I feel guilty  but not as much as I should
I tried to have that self-control  but not as much as I could
I been down for days  you in my city and I can't see your face
I can't eat knowin' you with him and not at my place
I never been jealous of another man
Especially when I have everything I want at hand
Except you  you
You know  I got every damn car  multiple cribs
He left for some days  I cleared out my sched'  I cleared out my head
We could Tulum  or we could Capri  or die right here
As long as you with me  I'll be at peace  huh
You was supposed to go back home to see your bestie
I told you I can't hit that zone  too busy next week
Seven days with me  your nigga like  Where the fuck you at?
Dirtyin' my bakin' pots  tennis at my mama spot
Chauffeured in the Rolls  the back entrance for them restaurants
Parks playin' chess games  givin' wigs pet names
Manicures  night swims  Jerrod providin' methane
Shoppin' 'til we droppin'  what you coppin'?
See  the price is not a option
It's investments 'cause your smile is the profit to me
I know around him  you gotta act like you not into me
I know your answer  but you gotta keep it honest with me
Said you can't fully be into me 'cause you with him
Then why the fuck when we link it's like he doesn't exist?
They all know that we friends  but we both aware that it's more
Everything I got  if you say the word  then it's yours
The only thing I'm missin' in life  I know you could be it
And everyone around me that care about me can see it
I could fuck a trillion bitches every country I done been in
But with you  it's a feeling 'cause we twinnin' and we matchin'
You stayed in the car when I went on date with that actress
Whole time I'm eatin'  I couldn't wait to get back
In the back of the car with you and talk about who we are
You told me when you with me  it's like heroin
Told me that your confidence went up since we befriended  and
Told me that you didn't wanna hurt him  why we doin' this?
Told me this a awkward situation and you just wanna be through with it
Told me every time you not with him  it started problems  and
Told me every time you not with me  you always ponder
What type of sweater I'm wearin'  what music have I been finding
Girl  you know that I'ma play it whenever  that's what we bonded over
You said you told him the truth and you never lied
Now he lookin' at you with them eyes
We never crossed the line  but he got every right to be a lil' pissed off
He picked you up  y'all got an argument  he got his shit off
My energy like  Get lost  your energy just want peace
I couldn't even tell you his energy 'cause he don't speak
He ain't even call you his bitch
Until he see me make you smile  that nigga threatened as shit
I'm in the wrong  though
I picked you up  your energy off
Your lips really dry  something is off
You ask if I gotta  I ask if you gotta
We trip on our words  nobody is lyin'  hakuna matata
We sat in the car and cried for a hour
My shirt look like a showerhead got it  we called it off
I'll skip the details but that night I seen hell
You was in a room I was payin' for  I took three Ls
No  I didn't sleep well  woke up and my knees fell
Next day I'm drivin' 'round the city with no destination back-up
Water in my eyes kept falling like Niagara
Vill right beside me makin' sure I didn't crash or
Do something heinous 'cause I'm emotionally jabbed up
You checked every box  I thought it was it
Felt like I got led on and pushed off a cliff
No  I'm in the wrong  that was a friend
You in the wrong  gotta remind you 'bout the times that you stepped
Gotta rewind it— aw  fuck
We talkin' 'bout our kinks  real cautious with the links
You don't do that type of shit when you in relationship
And you a hundred with your mate  so don't go actin' like no saint
'Cause it's a two-way street  and shit  you knew what I was on
And while that nigga out and gone  shit  you was loungin' in my home
Shit  I even let you meet my mama and y'all got along
But shit  I'll take my L  though it's not fun
You still got your nigga and still had your fun
Shit  I can't even look at you and think about bad words
That's why I called and said we couldn't end this on bad terms
We straight like a bad perm  we'll always be good friends
And laugh about it on a sandy beach while our back burns  huh
This my perspective  this how I feel
I ain't fabricate nothin'  I kept it real
I told you I love you and always will
And if he ever put his hands on you  promise I'll get him killed  true
On God  I love that girl  f— mhm
I had no ill intentions  though
Shit  everybody got hurt
I got hurt  bruh
It's a shit situation
All the morals and power you have just vanish when a certain energy is nearing
And those feelings got so much gravity and it's out of your control
That made me realize adults don't know what they doin' either
We're all just children
I ain't mean to fuck nobody's shit up  man
I thought I was bulletproof
She proved me wrong  man
I felt two hundred percent with her
It was beautiful
I was able to feel
But it was  it was bad timing
And I'm mad private with this side of my life 'cause people are weirdos  and
I just try to keep anyone I care about in the shadows
Safe from the commentary and spotlight and thoughts
'Cause it's just a story for the people outside of it
Baby
