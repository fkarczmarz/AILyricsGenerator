lyrics
"Maybe this year will be better than the last
I can't remember the last thing that you said as you were leaving
Now the days go by so fast
And it's one more day up in the canyons
And it's one more night in Hollywood
If you think that I could be forgiven
I wish you would
The smell of hospitals in winter
To see the way that light attaches to a girl
And it's one more day up in the canyons
And it's one more night in Hollywood
If you think you might come to California
I think you should
Drove up to Hillside Manor sometime after 2 A.M
And talked a little while about the year
I guess the winter makes you laugh a little slower
Makes you talk a little lower
About the things you could not show her

Maybe this year will be better than the last
I can't remember all the times I tried to tell my myself
To hold on to these moments as they pass
And it's one more day up in the canyons
And it's one more night in Hollywood
It's been so long since I've seen the ocean
 kitten
 baby
 are you happy where you're sleeping?
 I've been watching you for hours
 I dreamt I saw you walking
 two for joy
 and four for boys
 six for gold
 when you open up your wings to speak
 you should be ashamed
 darling
 baby
 darling
 you don't wanna
 darling
 I walk along these hillsides
 I will walk along these hillsides
 I will walk along these hillsides
What's the problem? I don't know
Well  maybe I'm in love (Love)
Think about it
Every time I think about it
Can't stop thinking 'bout it
How much longer will it take to cure this?
Just to cure it  'cause I can't ignore it if it's love (Love)
Makes me wanna turn around and face me
But I don't know nothin' 'bout love  uh
Come on  come on
Turn a little faster
Come on  come on
The world will follow after
Come on  come on
Because everybody's after love
So I said  I'm a snowball runnin'
Runnin' down into the spring that's comin'
All this love meltin' under blue skies
Belting out sunlight  shimmering love
Well  baby  I surrender
To this strawberry ice cream
Never-ever-ender
All this love
Well  I didn't mean to do it
But there's no escaping your love  oh

Come on  come on
Jump a little higher

We're accidentally in love  accidentally in love

Just get yourself inside her love
That I told myself when I needed something good
Now I'm 33 and it isn't me
But I'd think of something better if I could
All my friends and lovers leave me behind
And I'm still looking for a girl
One way or another
I'm just hoping to find a way
To put my feet out in the world
Caught some grief from a falling leaf
As she tumbled down to the dirty ground
Said I should have put her back there if I could
And I'm trying to find me a better way
To get from the things I do to the things I should
All my friends and lovers
They leave me alone
To try to have a little fun
But one way or another
I just wish I had known to go out walking in the sun
And find out if you were the one

And did you want to dance with me?
Would you want to hum a little harder now?
Can you see her waiting there?
Can you see her?
Because I'm almost there
Can you see her
Waiting there for someone like me?
All you want is a beauty queen
But not a superstar
But everybody's dream machine
All you want is a place to lay your head
You go to sleep dreaming how you would
Be a different kind if you thought you could
But you come awake the way you are instead
All my friends and lovers
They shine like the sun
I just turn and walk away
One way or another
I'm not coming undone
I'm just waiting for the day
All my friends
I could have been anyone she'd seen
She waits another week to fall apart
She couldn't make another day
I wish it was anyone but me
I could have been anyone you see
She had something breakable just under her skin
American girls
All weather and noise
Playing the changes for all of the boys
Holding a candle up to my hand
Making me feel so incredible
She comes out of closets every night
And then she locks herself away
Where she could keep everything from me

I waited for an hour last Friday night
She never came around
She took almost everything from me
I'm going through my closets
Trying on her clothes almost every day
I could have been anyone you see
I wish it was anyone but me
There's nothing but pills and ashes under my skin
American girls

Holding a candle up to my hand
Making me feel so incredible
If I made you cry
Please tell me why
'Cause I'll try again if you let me try
American girls
All feathers & cream
I would
Just to get a change of pace
Things are getting worse but I feel a lot better
And that's all that really matters to me
Amy hit the atmosphere
Caught herself a rocket ride out of this gutter
Anytime it rains
She just feels a lot better
And that's all that really matters to me
We've waited so long
For someone to take us back home
It just takes so long
And meanwhile the days go drifting away
And some of us sink like a stone
Waiting for mothers to come
Today was just a day fading into another
And that can't be what a life is for
The only thing she said was she feels a lot better
And that's all that really matters to me

She came from California
Running from daylight into this endless electric twilight
And when she dies a ghost is born
Get up out of your memories
Get out of the sunlight
Get out of that sleeping western town
Got a little bit of running for you now
Got a little way to run
To answer all our hopes and fears
A king is leaving Union Square
Did we leave the light on? (Did we leave the light on?)
Does he need a light on? (Does he need a light on?)
The king is screaming highway songs
Of blood and liеs
Of hope and wrong
Did he leavе a light on? (Did he leave a light on?)
Does he need a light on?
Yesterday when we get older
We'll look back on all the times
He had you putting a face on
Instead of just walking away
So paint your face black and blue again
Wake up new and

The congregation came to stare
To touch her dress
To pull her hair

Did she need a light on? (Does she need a light on?)
Do we need a light on? (Do we need a light on?)
Do we need a light on? (Do we need a light on?)
Do we need a light on?
These daydream nations won't come true
The ghosts you made up ghosted you
The angel learns to live with
Things that make her feel uneasy
And after all the dreaming's done
This is a recording
A ghost of England
Awake in a dream of America
You see him coming out the corner of your eye
You can hear him breathing when he runs
The King of all our hopes and fears
His train departing Union Square
Just moved to somewhere South of here
Did he leave a light on? (Did he leave a light on?)
Her feathers stale with sex and beer
The angel of the pavement cries
Did he leave a light on
For me? (Did he leave a light on?)

I guess there might not be too many
Who would stand beside you now
Where'd you come from?
Where am I going?
Why'd you leave me till I'm only good for...
Waiting for you
All my sins...
I said that I would pay for them if I could
Come back to you
All my innocence is wasted on the dead and dreaming
Every night these silhouettes appear above my head
Little angels of the silences that climb into my bed and whisper
Every time I fall asleep
Every time I dream
Did you come?
Would you lie?

My friend implores me  For one time only
Make an exception I am not worried
Wrap her up in a package of lies
Send her off to a coconut island
I am not worried
I am not overly concerned
With the status of my emotions
But we're always changing
It does not bother me to say
This isn't love
'Cause if you don't wanna talk about it
Then it isn't love
And I guess  I'm gonna have to live with that
But I'm sure there's something in a shade of gray
Or something in between
And I can always change my name
If that's what you mean

And this time  when kindness falls like rain
It washes her away
And Anna begins to change her mind
These seconds when I'm shaking
Leave me shuddering for days  She says
And I'm not ready for this sort of thing
But I'm not gonna break
And I'm not gonna worry about it anymore
I'm not gonna bend and I'm not gonna break
Gonna worry about it anymore
It seems like I should say
As long as this is love
But it's not all that easy  so maybe I should
Snap her up in a butterfly net
And pin her down on a photograph album
I am not worried
'Cause I've done this sort of thing before
But then I start to think about the consequences
'Cause I don't get no sleep in a quiet room
And this time  when kindness falls like rain
It washes me away
And Anna begins to change my mind
Every time she sneezes  I believe it's love
(Rain falls down)
She's talking in her sleep
It's keeping me awake
(Rain comes pouring down)
And Anna begins to toss and turn
And every word is nonsense  but I understand
Her kindness bangs a gong
It's moving me along
And Anna begins to fade away
It's chasing me away  she disappears
Money is the matter that's been on her mind
Time ticks by her  one race at a time
She's trying to be a good girl
And give them what they want
But Margery's dreaming of horses
Looking at a green sky  sun like a red eye
Bright blue horses are the fortune she lives by
She's tired and lonely  scarred and depressed
Her visions of one day go racing the next
She's trying to be a good girl
And give them what they want
But Margery's dreaming of horses
Margie doesn't say anything all the way home
So afraid she'll awake to find she's all alone
Margery's wingspan's all feathers and coke cans
And TV dinners and letters she won't send
And every race night is shot through with sunlight
Trying to hit the big one  one last time tonight

And I lay down in the shadow of St. Mary's in the sky

Waiting for the king
But there ain’t no sign of Elvis in San Francisco

And they give you your very own pair of wings
In August and everything after
I’m after everything
And I got my seven-million dollar home
I got the number of some girl in North Dakota
Who’s always wide awake
So I never have to spend the night alone
I got this nasty little habit
Of peeking down the shirts of all the little girls
As they pass me by
And I know you wonder when it all catches up to me
And they finally bring me down
Do you think I’m gonna cry?
So get your fucking filthy hands off of me
I hope you weren’t expecting me to be crucified
The best that they can do
Is just to hang me from the nearest tree

And Mike's on his bike with the motor running
I told him trains were running all night right then
In the moonlit town after the bridge fell down
There were fires and we lost some power
So we all dressed up for the ramble
And ran those streets long past the witching hour
I saw Dorothy in drag
Taking the Tin Man for a ride
And then Z the Cat said she knew where to go
Then she kissed me without a thought
And said Sometimes memories are all that we got
Let's make some at the show
So there's some leather-wrapped Fender-strapped kid
With a pick-finger twitch
He's got a recipe for radio or rain
I don't know which
In the shadows when the lights are dowsed
The cinder kids flare while they twist and shout
We're the sparks in the dark

We spend all day getting sober
Hiding from daylight
Watching TV
We just look a lot better in the blue light
Well  you know I gotta get out
But I'm stuck so tight
Weighed by the chains that keep me...
Hangin' around this town on the corner
I been bumming around this old town too long
I been hangin' around this town on the corner
I been bumming around this old town for way too long
And this girl listens to the band play
She says  Where have you been?
I've been lying right here on the floor
Well  I got all this time
To be waiting for what is mine
To be hating what I am
After the light has faded

When the weather bothers me
I empty drawers of other summers
Where my shadows used to be
And she is standing by the water
As her smile begins to curl
In this or any other summer
She is something altogether different
Never just an ordinary girl
And in the evenings on Long Island
When the colors start to fade
She wears a silly yellow hat
That someone gave her when she stayed
I didn't think that she returned it
We left New York in a whirl
Time expands and then contracts
When you are spinning in the grips of someone
Who is not an ordinary girl
And when you sleep
You find your mother in the night
But she stays just out of sight
So there isn't any sweetness in the dreaming
And when you wake
The morning covers you with light
And it makes you feel alright
But it's just the same hard candy
You're remembering again

Then you wait for her to call
You put your girl up on a pedestal
Then you wait for her to fall

And I hide it from the world

Are somehow pressed upon a picture
In the face of such an ordinary girl
And when you sleep
You find your mother in the night
But she fades just out of sight
So there isn't any sweetness in the dreaming

The morning showers you with light

This isn't gonna be easy  but I don't need you
Believe me
Yeah  you got a piece of me

Such a life
I'm a comet
All my friends got flowers in their eyes
But I got none this season
All of last year's blooms have gone and died
Time doesn't give a reason
What you need to be forgiven?
Everything that you've ever done wrong
Is the reason that I'm driven straight to you
Waiting here for you
Wanting to tell you
Just the way you do
I thought if I told you
You might want to stay for just another day or two
It's just like answers that come in small packages that go in the mail
Waiting for the trains that just never come
Beginning to believe
In the disappearing nature of the people we have been
We have begun to change
Into the worst kind of people
So unkind

Here at the dying of the day
I wasn't made for this scene
But I was made in this scene

If dreams are like movies
Then memories are films about ghosts
You can never escape
You can only move south down the coast
Walking a tightrope of fortune and fame
I am an acrobat swinging trapezes through circles of flame
If you've never stared off into the distance
Then your life is a shame
And though I'll never forget your face
Sometimes I can't remember my name
And the price of a memory is the memory of the sorrow it brings
And there is always one last light to turn out
And one last bell to ring
And the last one out of the circus has to lock up everything
Or the elephants will get out
And forget to remember what you said
And the ghosts of the tilt-o-whirl will linger inside of your head
And the Ferris wheel junkies will spin there forever instead

A blanket of stars covers me in my bed

It's just a brief interruption of the swirling dust sparkle jet stream
And you're probably not what you seem
But I'd sure like to find out
So why don't you climb down off that movie screen?
When the last king of Hollywood shatters his glass on the floor
And orders another
That's when I know that I have to get out
Because I have been there before
So I gave up my seat at the bar and I head for the door
We drove out to the desert
Just to lie down beneath this bowl of stars
We stand up in the Palace
Like it's the last of the great Pioneertown bars
We shout out these songs against the clang of electric guitars
But you can't get very far
But you can't get very far

Roll a new leaf over
In the middle of the night

Could you drop a line my way?
Get right to the heart of matters
It's the heart that matters more
I think you'd better turn your ticket in
And get your money back at the door
Start threading the needle
Brush past the shuttle that slides through the cold room
Start turning the wool across the wire
Roll the new life over
In the middle of the night
There's an old man threading his toes
Through a bucket of rain
'Cause you're only gonna walk all over me
Get right to the heart of matters
It's the heart that matters more
I think you'd better turn your ticket in
And get your money back at the door
Start running the banner down
Drop past the color
Come up through the summer rain
Start turning the girl into the ground
Roll a new love over
Rolling around in the earth and rain
You know you're only gonna walk all over me

He stares up at the sky and he may wish he knew why
But he can’t go back there no more
The future sounds so crazy
We all heard that song before
Tomorrow's the name we changed from yesterday to blame
When the train just don't stop here anymore
I got starry-eyed on the coaster ride
There’s a photograph on the TV
Black and white and —
Andy says something to you —
She says “I forget myself sometimes too”
Out past the doorways where we are sleeping
The White Queens creep and the tomcats peep
And now I’m not breaking
The train’s just shaking
I never made it here before
There's a Wild Mouse spinning the girls around
Til they can't take it anymore
I used to dream in the dark of Palisades Park
Up over the cliffs and down among the sparks
It’s a long life full of long nights
But it’s not what I was waiting for
Everybody's seen the horses diving down the shore
It's a miracle they don't make them anymore

I don't see Andy all that much these days

Til I can't take it anymore
You can carry that spark from Palisades Park
Down over the cliffs and out into the dark
It’s a long life full of long nights
But it’s not what I was looking for
Everybody dreams of horses flying ‘round the shore
It’s a bad dream we’re not having anymore
Have you seen her?
Have you seen him?
Dressed up in our pirate best
All leathers and feathers and pearls
Andy said “Look at me man!
I am cookin’
These hands could finger up this whole world!”
He said “Come outside
Climb out your bedroom window
Shimmy down the fire escape
And say goodbye”
Come outside
Changing all the time
My leopard spots to polka dots
And say goodbye
Come outside
Maybe we could move to California
Just meet me at the subway
And say goodbye
Come outside
The cops all think we’re crazy
To a girl who’ll never know you
And then say goodbye
I lost her in the sun
I was high as a kite on Lovely & White
I don't know where she's gone
Real love outlives teenage lust
We could get wet and it keeps us warm
Love is like Angel Dust -
Lovely sometimes changes us...sometimes not
Have you been aching with trust or just
Have you been aching to trust or just…?
Have you been waking yourself with lust…?
Have you been making us up or just taking us home?
It's a long wait at a long light
Cars frozen in flight
All the traffic stops to stare
Wearing nothing but air
And a pair of grey paper wings
Andy thinks “I got nothing to wear”
We got nothing new and…
We got nothing to wear…
We got nothing to wear…

 I can't keep myself away from me
And we went from zero to everything all in a day
And then Kennedy took you away
I thought of a short robe that was keeping you warm
And the moments that make up your life 'til you wake up

And she tells you she wanted to kiss you
And you know The worst part of a good day
Is hearing yourself say goodbye to one more possibility day
It goes on and on
I go west but your weather has changed
You’re just scared
I mistake it for strange
When you want me to leave
Then you start to believe I should stay
But I gotta get out of LA
It seems like the short days are over
'Cause you just don't sleep in the daylight so I don't sit up nights
I lie on my back on the top of a hill
And your body is breaking the sky
Cause you're shaking
And the worst part of a good day is knowing it's slipping away
That's one more possibility day that is gone

And still hear a voice in your head when you're lying in bed
And it says that the best part of a bad day is knowing it's okay
The color of everything changes
The sky rearranges its shade and your smile doesn't fade
Into a phone call and one bad decision we made
And the worst part of a good day is the one thing you don't say
And you don't know how but you wish there was some way
So you pull down the shades and you shut off the lights
Because somehow we mixed up Goodbye and Goodnight
And the one thing you won't say is
Everyone knows possibility days are impossible.

So wrong

In a house where regret is a carousel ride
We are spinning and spinning and spinning and now

And there's a girl in a basement coming out of her shell
And there are people who will say that they knew me so well
Yeah but the comet is coming between
Me and the girl who could make it all clean
Out there in the shadow of a modern machine
Walks St. Robinson in his Cadillac dream
Some people are never quite what they seem
Lets just get into my car and drive
Past the shadows that fall down wherever we meet
I'm almost drowning in her sea
She's nearly fallen to her knees
Take the way home
Take the way home that leads back to Sullivan Street
Where all the bodies hang on the air
'Cause I'm gone from there
I'm almost drowning in her sea
She's nearly crawling on her knees
She's down on her knees
Take the way home that leads back to Sullivan Street
Where I'm just another rider burned to the ground
Come tumbling down
I'm almost drowning in her sea
She's nearly crawling on her knees
It's almost everything I need
I'm down on my knees
 we'll watch tomorrow
 o child
 they don't know why
 they don't know why
 she takes a train to Paris
 can you see me?
 can you see me?
 I don't know why
 I don't know why
 I don't know why
I wanted to see you walking backwards
And get the sensation of you coming home
I wanted to see you walking away from me
Without the sensation you're leaving me alone
Time and time again
Time and time again
Time and time again
I can't please myself
I wanted the ocean to cover over me
I wanna sink slowly without getting wet
Maybe someday  I won't be so lonely
And I'll walk on water every chance I get
Time and time again
Time and time again
Time and time again
I can't please myself
So when are you coming home  sweet angel?
You leaving me alone? All alone?
Well  if I'm drowning darling
You'll come down this way on your own

Beneath this graveyard western sky
I'm gonna set fire to this city
And out into the desert we're gonna ride
Time and time again
Time and time again
Time and time again
I can't please myself
I can't please myself
And I can't please nobody else
Time and time again
Time and time again
Time and time again
Yours was just a loser's game
And I decided that I should play
Throw your arms around my neck
I won’t be soon to forget
Throw your arms around my neck
I won’t be soon to forget
Felt the wind’s direction beginning to change
Clouds so softly full of rain
The summer fell and the winter sprang
Now it’s all a feeling I can’t get back again
Throw your arms around my neck
I won’t be soon to forget
Throw your arms around my neck
I won’t be soon to forget
Cloudy thoughts against a clear blue sky
With no sense to try to find my peace of mind
Throw your arms around my neck
I won’t be soon to forget
Throw your arms around my neck
I won’t be soon to forget
Throw your arms around my neck
I won’t be soon to forget
Throw your arms around my neck
I've been to Boston before
Anyway  this change I've been feeling
Doesn't make the rain fall
No big differences these days
Just the same old walkaways
Someday  I'm going to stay
I locked up my bedroom and I walked out into the air
When nothing I needed was left there behind me
I walked out through the shadows of Washington Square
I wandered the highways from Dublin to Berkeley
And I heard the songbirds of Ballyporeen
But I loved like a fountain
And it left me with nothing
Just memories of walking through Washington Square
Now I live in the shadows where light is electric
And time is a number that rests on a wall
And nobody knows me
My friends and my family
Are as far from this city as Washington Square
So cover this warm night in a blanket of starlight
And I’ll follow this freeway out into the air
In case you should wander and wanted to find me"
