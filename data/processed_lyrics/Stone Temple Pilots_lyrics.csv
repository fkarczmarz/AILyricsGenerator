lyrics
"With hot pink purple china glow
His family trees are molded
No longer grows in summer
He holds it closer lets it go
Picks a fruit but keeps it whole
Can't keep the submarining
Can't keep the light from fading
Grab the hate and drown it out
Grab the beat and drum it out
It's so so confusing
Ain't the same for you and me
Cartoons like reality dogs and cats and children
The deepest wound is hidden
Ain't the same for you and me
Comatose commodity
The superheroes dying
All the children crying
Sell more records if i'm dead
Purple flowers once again
Hope it's sooner
Hope it's near corporate records' fiscal year
Have a listen lend an ear
Here's a song now if ya care
We can all just hum along
Words don't matter anymore

Grab the hate and drown it out
Grab the beat and drum it out
It's so so confusing
Adhesive love
Adhesive love
Flying high across the plain
Purple flowers ease the pain
Ain't the songs you're missing
Stitch the womb and wet the bed
With a whisper i'll be dead
Don't let the living die yet!
Grab the hate and drown it out
Grab the beat and drown it out
It's all so confusing
Adhesive love
Never be the same  and with that I said
Never ever ever be this way again
Hold on till the end
(Campfire girls make me feel alright)
Like it's the last hello
Whirlwinds and roller-coasters
Long grass making shapes hello
Disappearing  disappearing floating graves
And never  ever be this way again
And never  ever be this way again
And so I know (Campfire girls make me feel alright)
It's begun again
(Campfire girls make me feel alright)
Never the same  and with that I said
(Campfire girls make me feel alright)
Campfire girls  make me feel alright
Campfire girls  make me feel alright
You can't feel  but you hit me
You can't deal with the way I pray
Why do we all have to look this way
Time  time is not on my side
Because the way I am
Gotta gotta now  got to find the reason why
A woman ain't a man

She waits for me
My love is unusual  it's painted with roses and thorns
With her I'm complete
She lives by the wall and waits by the door
She walks in the sun  to me
She lives by the wall and waits by the door
She walks in the sun  to me
Visions of Mexico seduce me  it goes to my head
So carefully
Memories of candles and incense and all of these things
Remember these
She lives by the wall and waits by the door
She walks in the sun  to me
She lives by the wall and waits by the door

She comforts me when the candles blow out
The cake has grown mold but the memories are sweet
The laughter's all gone  but the memories are mine
The Mexican princess is out of my life

Of a wedding in a shell
It's just a burnin' ancient memory
I never kiss and tell
So turn it up and burn it
There's a hole in your head
There's a hole in your head
Where the birds can't sing along
Does anybody know
How the story really goes?
How the story really goes
Or do we all just hum along
Sell your soul and sign an autograph

Nobody knows
I walked the front-line
Still got far to go
I mixed the water
I drank the water
I broke the breadline
Don't wanna know

Wearing a crown of apathy
I'm standing around
Dressed like a clown
I killed the manchild
I'll fast alone
I had the midwife
Naked and alone
I mixed the water

So the answer gets harder
And the truth's getting farther and farther
And the bottle keeps churning and churning
Wasting time chasing those cows that fly
Churning out all that butterfly sugar-boost
Track the blade as it sweeps downward and onward
Passing time ripping as time kicks by
Pass the umbilical cord down for fly by
