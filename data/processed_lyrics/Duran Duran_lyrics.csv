lyrics
"When everyone surrounds you?
How do you deal?
Do crowds just make you feel lonely?
What do you say
When people come and try to pin you down?
Acquaintances smile
But that's no understanding
You keep falling off the same mountain?
Try to explain it
But nothing really gets them that high
Steal away in the morning
Love's already history to you
It's a habit you're forming
This body's desperate for something new
Just a matter of feeling
These moments of madness are sure to pass
And tears will dry as you're leaving

Emotion's a game
Saved up for a rainy Monday
But you laugh just the same
'Cause it's been pouring on Sunday
Call up your numbers
And never let the zeros bring you down
How does it feel?
Is time too heavy to hold?
Whatever you decide for the moment is Holy
Whenever you slow down to see life is passing by
Steal away in the morning
Love's already history to you
It's a habit you're forming
This body's desperate for something new
Just a matter of feeling
These moments of madness are sure to pass
And tears will dry as you're leaving
You can
Steal away in the morning
Love's already history to you
It's a habit you're forming
This body's desperate for something new
Just a matter of feeling
These moments of madness are sure to pass
And tears will dry as you're leaving
A matter of feeling
A matter of feeling
A matter of feeling
 feel the chill
 but you know the plans I'm making
 could it be the whole Earth opening wide
 a mystery gaping inside
 until we...
 but can we...
Got to tell you  you've got so much I don't wanna lose
If I had to  if I had to pick the best bit  I really could not choose
I want everything
All of what you do
Every night  every day
I want all of you
Give me sacred motivation with your deeper touch
Talking dirty conversation  your look says so much
So much more to this song's meaning I don't have time to say
Hit the high note of my feeling  can't let this fade away
I want everything
All of what you do
Every night  every day
I want all of you
I want everything
All of what you do
Every night  every day
I want all of you
Yeah  we got history
But we got mystery

All she wants is  all she wants is  all she wants is
Hey spend your money on the corner now
Ya know you've gotta save some
For the shoeshine boy
You've been pulling them by the hand inside
Oh  collecting all your toys
If you need a lead to heaven now
Just stick around
You're gonna be there
What do you care?
What do you dare?
What does your Heart say now?
All she wants is  all she wants is  all she wants is
All she wants is  all she wants is  all she wants is
All she wants is  all she wants is  all she wants is
Divine intervention
Couldn't keep the word from leaking out (Out  out...)
With your pleasure in suspension
Not to mention what you hang it around
If you need a lead to heaven again
A place to share in every position
What do you care?
What do you dare?

Just after you've gone
My senses sharpen
But it always takes
So damned long
Before I feel how much
My eyes have darkened
Fear hangs a plane of gun smoke
Drifting in our room
So easy to disturb
With a thought
With a whisper
With a careless memory
With a careless memory
On the table
Signs of love life scattered
And the walls break
We go crashing within
It's not as though
As though you really mattered
Being close
How could I let you go
Without some feeling
Some precious sympathy following?

 I've been waiting for you
 with a home tattoo
 it'll take a little time
 stay wilder than the wind
 playing me déjà vu
 I swear I've heard before
 is it something real
 in a snow filled sky
 stay wilder than the wind
Ashes on the river tide
And I will see you on the other side
Stories like the evening stars are showing up
Whatever fills your cup
In the afterlife
Heathen eyes painted on iron
See everything you leave behind
Upon this blameless sea of nеver mind
With malice broke when nothing really matters anymore

Faces everywhere pulling grins and signs ‘n things

I can't think without one now
Call it treason
‘Cause sometimes people stare
Don't know why this evil bothers me
You can take him if you're fast
So why is he trying to follow me?
Didn't I say if you're holding on
You'd be laughing at the last?
How many reasons do they need?
I get along fine with them friends of mine

Realize I never need to use no one
When it comes down to my soul
Freedom puts my faith in none of the above
There was a time I was so afraid
Of everything people around me said
That I wanted to hide my face in the shadows
There was a time on a bed of nails
I was dreaming a plan up that could not fail
But no power under the sun could pull it together
Can't take this attitude
Got to show now i've got to move on
God knows where I'm going to
Its a lonely burning question
I am I myself alone
Realize i never need to use no-one
Freedom puts my faith in none of the above
If there's a time that we ever see
The nature of life in reality
Then I want to be there
To kick at the answer

Still I can't escape the ghost of you

Somehow I have to find

And sudden silence
Shh
Lies on a stranger's bed
The new day breaks like a speeding train or an old friend
Holding your own in a battered car
When the butterfly escapes the killing jar
Sure eyes awake before the dancing is over
Wise or naked in secret Oktober
Free fall on a windy morning shore
Nothing but a fading track of footsteps
Could prove that you'd ever been there
Spoken on a cotton cloud
Like the sound of gunshot taken by the wind
And lost in distant thunder
Racing on a shining plain

They lay back laughing at naivety's star
Awaken all those whispers
The dusty shadow of a passing favour
I wouldn't say that you were ruthless or right
I couldn't see from so far
Was I chasing after rainbows?
And I wiped away the water from my face
To look through the eyes of a stranger
For rumours in the wake of such a lonely crowd
Trading in my shelter for danger
I'm changing my name just as the sun goes down
In the eyes of a stranger
Can't tell the real from reflection
