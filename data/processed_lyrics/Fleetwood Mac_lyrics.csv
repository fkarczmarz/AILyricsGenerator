lyrics
"The most innocent things
And many of those dreams  pass us by
Keep passing me by
You feel good
I said it's funny that you understood
I knew you would
So I close my eyes softly
'Til I become that part of the wind
That we all long for sometime  yeah
And to those that I love  like a ghost through a fog
Like a charmed hour and a haunted song
And the angel of my dreams
Angel of my dreams
(You said) You feel good
I said it's funny that you understood
I knew you would
When you were good  baby
You were very good

I still look up  when you walk in the room
I've the same wide eyes  now they tell the story
I try not to reach out  when you turn 'round you say hello
And we both pretend
I'm no great pretender
So I close my eyes softly
'Til I become that part of the wind
That we all long for sometime  yeah
And to those that I love  like a ghost through a fog
Like a charmed hour and a haunted song
And the angel  angel of my dreams
Angel of my dreams
I still look up  yeah
I try hard not to look up  yeah
That girl was me  yeah
Track a ghost through the fog  yeah
A charmed hour and a haunted song  yeah
Track a ghost through the fog  baby
Ooh  you try hard
But you'll never catch me  yeah
That girl was me
Ooh  you try hard
But you'll never catch me  yeah
For a pot of gold
Like the kind you find
At the end of the rainbow
I've been dreaming
I thought it was in vain
Ah but now you're here
Can't believe that you're back again
Now I know I can't lose
As long as you follow
I'm going to win
(I'm going to win)
As long as you follow
I've been wandering
Gone away too far
But the road was rough
To get back where you are
And the sun went down
It never seemed to rise
Ah but now you're here
With the light shining in your eyes

You are a beautiful child
And I am a fool once more
You fell in love when I was only ten
The years disappeared
Much has gone by since then
You touch
I have no choice
I have to stay
Sleepless child
There is so little time
Your eyes say yes
But you don't say yes
I wish that you were mine
You say it will be harder in the morning
(I fell into love)
But I'm not a child anymore
You might also likeI'm not a child anymore
I'm tall enough
To reach for the stars
I'm old enough
To love you from afar
But then women usually are
(I'm not a child anymore)
(I'm tall enough to reach for the stars)
I will do as I'm told
(I'm old enough to love you from afar)
Even if I never hold you again
Hold you again
(Hold you again)
Sleepless child
There is so little time
(I will do as I am told)
Your eyes say yes
But you don't say yes
(Even if I never hold you again)
I wish that you were mine
(Hold you again)
I wish that you were mine
(Even if I never hold you again)
Well I wish that you were mine

Looking out for love

I got a black magic woman
She's got me so blind I can't see
But she's a black magic woman
And she's trying to make a Devil out of me
Don't turn your back on me baby
Don't turn your back on me baby
You're messing around with your tricks
Don't turn your back on me baby
Because you might just break up my magic stick
You got your spell on me baby
You got your spell on me baby
You're turning my heart into stone
I can't leave you alone
I want you to love me
It's silver words she told
Wanna be on the road to paradise
I want a lover who don't get old
Do I read a message in your eyes
You want a love to stay another night
I won't be waiting around for you
For every voice you've ever heard
There's a thousand without a word
Give me one more song to go

Drove me through the mountains
Through the crystal-like and clear water fountain
Drove me like a magnet  to the sea

How the faces of love have changed  turning the pages

You know those future games
I turned off all the lights
You were by my side
Will you explain-oh yeah
Real rhyme or reason for those future games
Now you were there last night
And oh were you afraid
Of things we'd come upon
While playing future games
But baby it's alright and so have faith
How many people sit home at night
Wondering if they will be here tonight
Wondering if children will he bring to the light
Wondering if neighbors are thinking the same
All of the wild things tomorrow will tame
Talking of journeys that happen in vain
Well I know I'm not the only one
To ever spend my life sitting playing future games

Heartless challenge
Pick your path and I'll pray
Wake up in the mornin'
See your sunrise  loves to go down
Lousy lovers pick their prey
But they never cry out loud  cry out
Well  did she make you cry?
Make you break down?
Shatter your illusions of love?
And is it over now? Do you know how?
Pick up the pieces and go home
Rock on  ancient queen
Follow those who pale in your shadow
Rulers make bad lovers
You better put your kingdom up for sale  up for sale
Well  did she make you cry?
Make you break down?
Shatter your illusions of love?
Well  is it over now? Do you know how?
Pick up the pieces and go home

Shatter your illusions of love?
And now tell me  is it over now? Do you know how

Back to the floor  that I love
To a room with some lace and paper flowers
Back to the gypsy that I was
To the gypsy that I was
And it all comes down to you
Well you know that it does
Oh  and it lights up the night
And you see your gypsy
You see your gypsy
To the gypsy that remains
Faces freedom with a little fear
I have no fear  I have only love
And if I was a child
And the child was enough
Enough for me to love
Enough to love
She is dancing away from me now
She was just a wish
She was just a wish
And a memory is all that is left for you now

 don't you hand me a line

 you want a percentage
 I'm-a just around the corner
That seems to come down from long ago
Two friends having coffee together
When something flies by their window
It might be out on that lawn
Because there's no explaining
What your imagination can make you see and feel
When your body means nothing (Seems like a dream)
You know you're hypnotized (They got me hypnotized)
Now it's not a meaningless question
To ask if they've been and gone
I remember a talk about North Carolina
In the thick of a forest without a road
And if any man's hand ever made that land
Then I think it would've showed
That's why it seems like a dream (Seems like a dream)
They got me hypnotized (They got me hypnotized)

And he don't need an airplane or some kind of engine

If those stories are right
Because what matters most
Is the feeling you get when you're hypnotized
Seems like a dream (Seems like a dream)
They got you hypnotized (They got me hypnotized)
Your body means nothing (Seems like a dream)
You know you're hypnotized (They got me hypnotized)

'Cause when your body means nothing
Right on walkin' on down the line
I just want you to feel fine
I don't want to know the reasons why love keeps
Right on walkin' on down the line
I just want you to feel fine
Take a listen to your spirit
It's cryin' out loud
Trying to believe
You got me rockin' and a-reeling
I don't want to know the reasons why love keeps

Take a little time
All the years
So many ways to count the tears
I never change
I never will
I'm so afraid the way I feel
Days when the rain and the sun are gone
Black as night
Agony's torn at my heart too long
So afraid
Slip and I fall and I die
I been alone
Always down
No one cared to stay around
I never change
I never will

Days when the rain and the sun are gone

So afraid

And I saw my reflection in the snow-covered hills
'Til the landslide brought me down
Oh  mirror in the sky
What is love?
Can the child within my heart rise above?
Can I sail through the changin' ocean tides?
Can I handle the seasons of my life?
Hmm-hmm  hmm-hmm
Well  I've been afraid of changin'
'Cause I've built my life around you
But time makes you bolder
Even children get older
And I'm getting older too

They say I'm a man of the world
I've flown across every tide
And I've seen lots of pretty girls
I guess I've got everything I need
I wouldn't ask for more
And there's no one I'd rather be
But I just wish that I'd never been born
And I need a good woman
To make me feel like a good man should
I don't say I'm a good man
I could tell you about my life
And keep you amused I'm sure
About all the times I've cried
And how I don't want to be sad anymore
Friday  I got travelin' on my mind
First you love me  and then you fade away
I can't go on believing this way
I got nothing but love for you
Tell me what you really want to do
First you love me  then you get on down the line
But I don't mind
I don't mind  yeah
I'll be there if you want me to
No one else that could ever do
Got to get some peace in my mind
Monday morning  you sure look fine

I know he understands
He said stick by me and I'll be your guiding hand
But don't ask me what I think of you
I might not give the answer that you want me to
And would you know how? Yeah
And I would come running anyway
Over and over
Over and over

What can I do to keep you around?
Over and over

And then again you can be cold as ice
I'm over my head (Over my head)
You can take me anytime you like
I'll be around if you think you might
And hold me tight
Your mood is like a circus wheel
You're changing all the time
Sometimes I can't help but feel
That I'm wasting all of my time

We will never change again the way we are changing
Oh  you'll forget the chill of love but not the strain
Oh  you'll forget the chill of love but not the strain
You will remember but I will die slowly
It's only an overture to something that was best
And don't  don't condescend me
Take your leave

Take your leave of me now
Disappear through the year
I wish you gone and I don't care
Now I know
Well  I was wrong
To live for a dream
If I had my life to live over
I would never dream
And wouldn't you love to love her?
Takes to the sky like a bird in flight
And who will be her lover?
All your life you've never seen
Woman taken by the wind
Would you stay if she promised you heaven?
Will you ever win?
She is like a cat in the dark
And then she is the darkness
She rules her life like a fine skylark
And when the sky is starless¬†

Woman taken by the wind
Would you stay if she promised you heaven?
Will you ever win?

Dreams unwind
Love's a state of mind
Dreams unwind
Stay with me awhile
Said you'd give me light
But you never told me 'bout the fire
Drowning in the sea of love
Where everyone would love to drown
But now it's gone
It doesn't matter what for
When you build your house
Then call me home
And he was just like a great dark wing
Within the wings of a storm
I think I had met my match
He was singing
Ooh the laces
Undoing the laces
But now it's gone

There‚Äôs a heartbeat that never really died
Heartbeat that never really died (Sara)
You know I'm falling  falling  falling at your feet
I'm tingling right from my head to my toes
So help me  help me  help me make the feeling go
'Cause when the loving starts and the lights go down
And there's not another living soul around
You woo me until the sun comes up
And you say that you love me
Have pity  baby  just when I thought it was over
Now you got me running  running  running for cover
I'm begging you for a little sympathy
And if you use me again it'll be the end of me
'Cause when the loving starts and the lights go down

Falling  falling  falling
Falling  falling  falling

That I've never been since
That part of me that was only for you
That kind of romance
That kind of fever dance
That you love because you become someone else in an instant
At least give me time to change your mind
That always seems to heal the wounds
If I can get you to dance
Something in you put a hold on my heart
It's hard to believe now
Here in the place that will never be dark
I remember that place
That certain kind of grace
That you love because you become someone else in an instant
Someone has taken my place
Won't you lay me down in the tall grass
And let me do my stuff?
I know I got nothin' on you
I know there's nothing to do
When times go bad and you can't get enough
Won't you lay me down in the tall grass
And let me do my stuff?

Time cast a spell on you
But you won't forget me
I know I could have loved you
But you would not let me
I'll follow you down
As she walked in the room
Her black robes trailing
Sister of the moon
And a black widow spider makes
More sound than she
And black moons in those eyes of hers
Made more sense to me
Heavy persuasion
It was hard to breathe
She was dark at the top of the stairs
She called to me
And so I followed
As friends often do
I cared not for love nor money
And I think she knew
But still they're the most cruel
Some call her sister of the moon
Some say illusions are her game
They like to wrap her in velvet
For you  the sun will be shining
And I feel that when I'm with you
It's alright  I know it's right
To you  I will give the world
To you  I'll never be cold
'Cause I feel that when I'm with you
It's alright  I know it's right
And the songbirds are singing
Like they know the score
Like never before
And I wish you all the love in the world
But most of all  I wish it from myself
And the songbirds keep singing
Like they know the score
Like never before

Like never before
I feel a little less
As you slowly go away from me
This is only another test
Every night you do not come
Your softness fades away
Did I ever really care that much?
Is there anything left to say?
Every hour of fear I spend
My body tries to cry
Living through each empty night
A deadly calm inside
I haven't felt this way I feel
Since many a year ago
But in those years are the lifetimes past
I did not deal with the road
Though the love has always been
So I search to find an answer there
So I can truly win

Every hour of fear I spend
My body tries to cry
Living through each empty night
A deadly calm inside
I'd like to leave you with something warm
But never have I been a blue calm sea
I have always been a storm
Always been a storm
I have always been a storm
We were frail
I should have known from the first
I'd be the brokenhearted (Storm)
(Storm)
I loved you from the start (Storm)
Save us
Listen to the waves upon the shore
Just as I begin to fade
Then I remember
When the moon was full and bright
I would take you in the darkness
And do the tango in the night
Tango
I keep the dream in my pocket
Never let it fade away
No loneliness in this dream
Then I remember
When the moon was full and bright
I would take you in the darkness
And do the tango in the night
Tango

Don't you come creepin' around
Makin' me do things I don't wanna do
Can't believe that you need my love so bad
Come sneakin' around tryin' to drive me mad
Bustin' in on my dreams
Makin' me see things I don't wanna see
'Cause you're da Green Manalishi with the two prong crown
All my tryin' is up all your bringin' is down
Just takin' my love then slippin' away
And I felt I knew you before
I didn't mean to love you
Didn't think it would work out
But I knew we would be together
And I couldn't wait for more
What can they say?
It's not against the law
I don't hold you down
And maybe that's why you're around
But if I'm the one you love
Think about me
I believe that you really want me
But it's not easy just to give in
So let yourself go
And let love begin (Ooh)
I don't hold you down
And maybe that's why you're around
But if I'm the one you love
Think about me
I don't hold you down
And maybe that's why you're around
But if I'm the one you love
Think about me

Every day  day by day
But more important  night by night
She watched it all come into play
He held her hands  she listened to what he had to say
Thrown down  like a barricade
Maybe now he could prove to her
That he could be good for her
And they should be together
You've shaken your faith in me  no
You've shaken my faith in everything else
A decision no one makes  and now you're going home
Faith is a hard thing to hold on to
Something inside you says I don't have to
You're not like other people  you do what you want to
You're not like other people  you do what you want to
Thrown down  like a barricade
Maybe now he could prove to her
That he could be good for her
And they should be together
You might also like
You say you're sorry
Now you should walk away
But it's so overwhelming
You have nothing left to say
You can sit outside his door and wait
Well  you can dedicate your pain to him
All thrown down  like a barricade
Maybe now he could prove to her
That he could be good for her
And they should be together
About just how much he never really told her
Thrown down
About how difficult it had been to be without her
Why don't you ask him if he's gonna stay?
Why don't you ask him if he's going away?
Why don't you tell me what's going on?
Why don't you tell me who's on the phone?
Why don't you ask him what's going wrong?
Why don't you ask him the latest on his throne?
(Ooga-aga-ooga)
Don't say that you love me (Hiyee)
Just tell me that you want me (Hiyee)
Tusk!
Just say that you want me (Hiyee)
Don't tell me that you‚Äî
Tusk!
(Real savage-like)
Tusk!
Tusk!
Into gentle slumber you can hide
I can't sleep with your warm ways
You made me a woman tonight
Dream until the morning light
I can't sleep with your warm ways
You make me happy with the things you do
Oh  can it be so?
This feeling follows me wherever I go
I never did believe in miracles
But I've a feeling it's time to try
I never did believe in the ways of magic
But I'm beginning to wonder why
I never did believe in miracles
But I've a feeling it's time to try
I never did believe in the ways of magic
But I'm beginning to wonder why
Don't  don't break the spell
It would be different and you know it will
You  you make loving fun
And I don't have to tell you  but you're the only one
