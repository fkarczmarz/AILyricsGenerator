lyrics
"Your arms look a little stronger
Your eyes just as I remember (Ooh)
Your smile's just a little softer
It all came back
'Cause after all these years
I still feel everything when you are near
And you probably will never know
You're still the one I'm after all these years
Couldn't help but overhear you
But does she kiss you like I kissed you?
It all came back

And you probably will never know
'Cause after all these years
I still feel everything when you are near (You are near)
And you probably will never know
You're still the one I'm after all these years
I never told you after all these years
See me like breath in the cold
Sleep with me here in the silence
So just hold me like you won't ever let go
I need to make sure you know
That you are the only one I'll ever love
Lookin' back on my life
You'rе the only good I've ever done (Ever done)
(Anyone) Not anyone
Forever's not enough time to
Love you the way that I want
'Cause every morning I'll find you
I fear the day that I don't

Don't look at me while I'm breaking
After what I'm gonna say
I understand if you hate me
What do I do when I love you and want somebody else?
What do I lose if I don't choose and keep it to myself?
Like when you got something to hide
There's something I gotta confess
I know I said we were friends
Somewhere between now and then
It became more than just a friendship (Mm)

Warnin' me it's a mistake

I said I'd love you for life  but I just sold our house
Couldn't ever imagine even havin' doubts
But not everything works out  no
Now I'm out dancin' with strangers
You could be casually datin'
Damn  it's all changin' so fast
Así e' la vida  sí

But I'm back on my feet

It's been a hell of a year  thank God we made it out
Yeah  we were ridin' a wave and trying not to drown
And on the surface  I held it together
But underneath  I sorta came unwound
Where would I be? You're all that I need
You always hold me down
Well  I've been the breaker and broken
Every mistake turned to moments
Wouldn't take anything back

Are spinnin' round-round-round
I know you got demons from the past
Slowin' you down-down-down
But you don't answer your FaceTime
You never had much of a poker face
It doesn't make you less of a man
You're just human right now
You don't know how many times you've saved me
So why you hidin' from me? It's only makin' it worse
We weren't made to hold back the rain  from the sky
Hate it when you shut me out
Actin' like it's your shit to figure out
Now I'm in my head about what's in your head
It's just trauma turned to armor

It seems the floor's getting colder since I laid on it
And I held hands with the car cause he was late on it
Cause it's 3 AM and it ain't the same
And the sign is clear when the phone don't ring
She said a dream is a wish your heart makes
And he's a sad reality
Cinderella never asked for a prince (no)
If the shoe won't fit then I'll walk barefoot to the moon
If you fall when the clock hits the spot then
Bibbidi-bobbiidi-boo
Instagram that just won't do
Back then I managed the crew
At twelve it's just me in my ripped skinny jeans
But I'm still a damn princess to you

Us twenty first century girls need chivalry too
If you fall when the clock hits the spot then

Once upon a time there was a boy with a face divine
But he couldn't understand how to be a gentleman
And now he's crying alone
If the shoe won't fit then I'll walk barefoot to the moon
If you fall when the clock hits the spot then
If you fall when the clock hits the spot then
Glasses on the sink  they didn't fix you
Lonely pillows in a stranger's bed
Little voices in my head
Secret keeping  stop the bleeding
Lost a little weight because I wasn't eating
All the songs that I can't listen to  to tell the truth
Loving you was sunshine  safe and sound
A steady place to let down my defenses
But loving you had consequences
Hesitation  awkward conversation
Running on low expectation
Every siren that I was ignoring
I'm paying for it
Loving you was sunshine  safe and sound
A steady place to let down my defenses
But loving you had consequences

No  I don't need a jacket

Y saber de tu pasado me knockea
Hasta dormida te imagino con ella
Eso me enferma

Niño hasta en mis sueños tu me haces sufrir

Cuando tú mе besas la depre mе da
Saber que has besado así a otra más
¿Me entiendes? Me duelen hasta los dientes
Yo sigo aferrada a tu pasado

Lola
She's seen the people disagree and disappear
Coulda found us a cure
But she worried about her children
Ninety miles 'til the shore
Nobody breaks the ceiling
Nobody where she's from
Se pone bien bonita como lista pa' un desfile
Le prometieron ser la reina del Caribe
Pero alguien le cambió el guión de cine
Y comenzar de nuevo solo pide
Del bajo mundo ella proviene
Ese es el precio de mi Lola cuando no hay salida
Quiso sacarse el dolor matando a su corazón
Ella soñaba volar pero el avión nunca despegó
Cuanto sufre el paso del tiempo y siempre sola
I'm imagining a world outside unlike the one I'm in
Daydreamin' again of when I'll get a chance
There's a world that understands
Where you don't hear the whispers in the room you're walkin' in
You're gonna know my name
'Round the room
Livin' carefully is something I don't wanna do

'Cause the highs are high but the lows are low
You control me more than you've ever known

And I bend and break like a rubber band

But I always do
Everyone at this party isn't you
Everyone at this party isn't you
(Pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-ra)
Feelin' like a psychofreak-freak-freak
(Pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-ra)
(Pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-ra)
Feelin' like a psychofreak sometimes
House in the hills is a house of cards
Blink and the fairytale falls apart
On my Instagram talkin' 'bout I'm healed
Worryin' if I still got sex appeal
Hopin' that I don't drive off this hill
And I wanna feel you pullin' my hair
And believe the words you say in my ear

Not have to leave this restaurant
Wish I could be like everyone
But I'm not like anyone
Feelin' like a psychofreak sometimes
House in the hills is a house of cards
Blink and the fairytale falls apart
Pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-ra
Pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-ra
Feelin' like a psychofreak-freak-freak
Pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-ra
Pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-ra
Feelin' like a psychofreak-freak-freak
Everybody says they miss the old me
I been on this ride since I was fifteen
Thinkin' out loud
In the bathroom while my friends laugh on the couch
Not have to leave this restaurant
Wish I could be like everyone (Wish I could be)
But I'm not like anyone
Feelin' like a psychofreak sometimes
House in the hills is a house of cards
Blink and the fairytale falls apart
Pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-ra
Pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-ra
Feelin' like a psychofreak-freak-freak (Freak)
Pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-ra
Pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-ra
Feelin' like a psychofreak-freak-freak (Freak)
Pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-ra
Pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-ra
