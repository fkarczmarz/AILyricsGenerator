lyrics
"You got that something  what can I do?
The earth is moving  but I can't feel the ground
Every time you look at me
My heart is jumping  it's easy to see
Loving you means so much more
More than anything I ever felt before
You drive me crazy  I just can't sleep
I'm so excited  I'm in too deep
Baby  thinking of you keeps me up all night
Oh-oh
Tell me you're so into me
That I'm the only one you will see
Tell me I'm not in the blue  oh
That I'm not wasting my feelings on you

Loving you means so much more
More than anything I ever felt before
You drive me crazy  I just can't sleep
I'm so excited  I'm in too deep
Baby  thinking of you keeps me up all night
Crazy  I just can't sleep
I'm so excited  I'm in too deep
Crazy  but it feels alright
Every day and every night
You drive me crazy (You drive me crazy  baby)
I'm so excited  I'm in too deep
Oh  crazy (You make me feel alright)
Baby  thinking of you keeps me up all night (Oh-oh)
You drive me crazy (You drive me crazy  baby)
Yeah  yeah
Baby  thinking of you keeps me up all night
Oh  baby  baby
Oh  baby  baby
How was I supposed to know
That somethin' wasn't right here?
Oh  baby  baby
I shouldn't have let you go
And now you're out of sight  yeah
Show me how you want it to be
Tell me  baby  'cause I need to know now
Oh  because
My loneliness is killin' me (And I)
I must confess  I still believe (Still believe)
When I'm not with you  I lose my mind
Give me a sign
Hit me  baby  one more time
Oh  baby  baby
The reason I breathe is you (Oh yeah)
Boy  you got me blinded
Oh  pretty baby
There's nothing that I wouldn't do
It's not the way I planned it

I must confess that my loneliness is killin' me now
Don't you know I still believe
That you will be here and give me a sign?
Hit me  baby  one more time
My loneliness is killin' me (And I)
I must confess  I still believe (Still believe)
When I'm not with you  I lose my mind
Give me a sign
Hit me  baby  one more time
I must confess that my loneliness (My loneliness is killin' me)
Is killin' me now (I must confess  I still believe)
Don't you know I still believe (When I'm not with you  I lose my mind)
That you will be here and give me a sign?
Not only you and me
Got one-eighty degrees  and I'm caught in between
Peter  Paul  and Mary
Getting down with 3P
Everybody loves me (ooh)

Gotta open up cause it feels much better
When we open up for each other
And I know
When you know somebody
And they know your body
It's so much better

And bare it like it's your first time

But I'm here now

You got my body spinning like a hurricane
And it feels like you got me going insane
We can turn the heat up if you wanna
Turn the lights down low if you wanna

Ah  you gonna have to remove me
'Cause I ain't going nowhere
Please forgive me if I'm coming on too strong
Hate to stare  but you're winning
And they're playing my favorite song
So come here  a little closer
Wanna whisper in your ear
Make it clear  a little question
Wanna know just how you feel
If I said my heart was beating loud
If we could escape the crowd somehow
If I said I want your body now  would you hold it against me?
'Cause you feel like paradise  and I need a vacation tonight
Hey  you might think that I'm crazy
But you know I'm just your type
I might be a little hazy
But you just cannot deny
There's a spark in-between us
When we're dancing on the floor
I want more  wanna see it
So  I'm asking you tonight

And show me how you work it out
Alright
If I said my heart was beating loud
If I said I want your body now  would you hold it against me?
If I said my heart was beating loud
If we could escape the crowd somehow
If I said I want your body now  would you hold it against me?
'Cause you feel like paradise  and I need a vacation tonight
With a bottle of perfume lotion
Where'd you come from talking like that?
Butterfly from the bottom of the ocean
I can't stop this slow motion trip...
Run away with me  no politics
Such a perfect notion
Your gravity has got me
Bowing in devotion
You and me fit a magic trick...
I know the music's good
I know that we'll be good
One look at him and I see
Candy-coated heart shapes
The jewels and furniture can go
But baby  he stays
He plays sitar  three notes so far
I know the music's good (wait  did you get that?)
I know that we'll be good

This feeling I've been dreaming of
I'm ready to reveal it
Let inhibitions come undone
Hope it sets us free
To know each other better
Put your love all over me
Come feel my energy
Give emotions to each other
Put your love all over me
Put your love all over me
Put your love all over

And I need to do what I feel like doing
So let me go and just listen
All you people look at me like I’m a little girl
Well  did you ever think it'd be okay for me to step into this world?
(This feels good)
I know I may come off quiet  I may come off shy
But I feel like talking  feel like dancing when I see this guy
What’s practical? What's logical? What the hell  who cares?
All I know is I’m so happy when you’re dancing there
I’m a slave for you
I cannot hold it  I cannot control it
I’m a slave for you
I won’t deny it  I’m not tryna hide it

I really wanna dance tonight with you (I just can’t help myself)
I really wanna do what you want me to (I just feel I let myself go)
I really wanna dance tonight with you (I wanna see you move)
Baby  don’t you wanna dance up on me? (I just wanna dance next to you)
To another time and place
Leaving behind my name and age

I cannot hold it  I cannot control it

(It's just you and me)
I’m a slave for you (Here we go now)
I cannot hold it  I cannot control it
I’m a slave for you (Here we go)
But now I know
Feels like I'm caught in the middle
That's when I realized
I'm not a girl
Not yet a woman
While I'm in between
I'm not a girl
There is no need to protect me
It's time that I learn to face up to this on my own
I've seen so much more than you know now
So don't tell me to shut my eyes
Not yet a woman
(I'm just trying to find the woman in me)
While I'm in between
I'm not a girl

But if you look at me closely
You will see it in my eyes
This girl will always find her way
While I'm in between
Not yet a woman
(I'm just trying to find the woman in me) Not now
While I'm in between
I'm not a girl
The ones that drive you crazy
Exactly what you're dreaming of
A hundred fifty miles away
Singing out my lungs
Driving fast all through LA
Warming up my tongue
Heart's beating fast
When I'm turning the key
I see you on your back
And I just can't believe
But you can't even face me
Know exactly what you've done

And I can't even sleep

Just love me
I'm not gonna ask for a sip when I'm thirsty
And you don't have to hold my hand when I'm hurting
Won't make you sober me up when I'm turning
You could ask me for a sorry
And a calm before the storm
Ask for pieces of my body
Until all of it was yours
But I'm not gonna ask you for nothing
I'm not gonna ask you for nothing
You might also like
If you think that I'm saying it because I'm high maintenance
Like I'm trying to mask every problem that I'm facing
Well you're wrong cause I don't need nobody when I'm breaking
All I need is your luv and a little bit of patience
You could ask me for a sorry
And a calm before the storm
Ask for pieces of my body
Until all of it was yours
But I'm not gonna ask you for nothing
I'm not gonna ask you for nothing
I'm not gonna ask you for nothing
Just love me
I'm not gonna ask you for nothing
Just love me
But I'm not gonna ask you for nothing
I'm not gonna ask you for nothing
I'm not gonna ask you for nothing
Hindsight  I can see it all so plain
Kamikaze fire come down
Fire come down  fire-fire come down
Collecting the ash from the bridges you burned
Kamikaze fire come down
Fire come down  fire-fire come down
(Ah) It's too late for apologies
(Ah) Nothing you can offer me now
(Ah) I'm looking at you on your knees

I've always wanted what was off limits
Staring at you 'til I'm caught in this
Back and forth like this is all tennis
But we can tell that there are changes coming
Like Penelope in Blow
But I need you and I can take you
All the way and I'm able
Said I need you and I can take you
All the way and I'm able
So follow me and I can make you
My heart's on fire when you're around
Only fools could ever feel this way
Send my message into outer space
Wonder if it's gonna float your way
I can't compete with the stars in the sky
I open the window to clear out my mind
Must be a hole in the atmosphere
Darkness comes and love comes alive
I've been right here dreaming of you
Waiting for my man on the moon

Who do I see? Who do I wanna be today?
Think I've been here before
I've turned some hearts into stone
And I can't hide it no more
My love is a mood ring
You know how to read the touch of my skin

When you're making me glow with your fingers against my thighs

You're dangerous  I'm lovin' it
Too high  can't come down
Losing my head  spinnin' round and round
Do you feel me now?
With a taste of your lips  I'm on a ride

With a taste of a poison paradise
I'm addicted to you
Don't you know that you're toxic?
And I love what you do
