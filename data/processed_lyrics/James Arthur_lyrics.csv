lyrics
"Your name's still on my coffee cup
I miss you
The way you chose the films we watched
If only I had told you that before
Maybe I would never have to miss you
Singing by the kitchen sink
I miss you
Not knowing I was listening
You embody everything that I am not
I wish it was a year ago
I wish that I could hold you close
I wonder if you're making eyes
I wonder if he loves you like
The way you said that only I could do
I wish that I could tell you that I miss you
I miss you
The way you left my car a mess
I miss you
The way you took up half the bed
That empty space
You remind me of the things that I am not

I wish that I could hold you close
The way you said that only I could do
 uh
 I'm steppin' outside under moonlight
 waitin' for you
 everything's alright
 I'm crazy for you
 the fool rushin' in
 I'll fall for you
 it's a long night in a big crowd
 mmm
 everything's alright

 now you've gone and got your hands on me

 tell me what you're gonna do
 the fool rushin' in
 I'll fall for you
I'm alive  this could be it for all we know
I’m a mess  don't know what I would do without you
I could cry  leading you down the same old road
I just never see it coming
Only butterflies until the bullets fly around my head again
Sick of running in a circle  all the stomach pains
I'm tired of medicating the adrenaline
Under this avalanche with you  avalanche with you
I feel the world collapsing down
But after all that I’ve been through  long as I'm with you
Nobody can hurt me now
It's been breaking me  breaking me down to the bone
In this avalanche with you  avalanche with you
Nobody can hurt us now  no
You and I  maybе we'll disappear like ghosts
Intеrtwined  in a couple of years they'll write our stone
Here lies a lucky man who was losing all hope
In real life  and a beautiful soul who never let go

Think of all the tears you've cried
Because of me  because of us
Ash to ash  dust to dust

We won't make it out alive
Hold my hand  I’ll sleep forever

In this avalanche with you  avalanche with you
Back from the dead
Back before demons took control of my head
Back to the start
Back to my heart
Back to the boy who would reach for the stars
You can take the drugs I have that nobody knows
You can take all I've got 'til I'm skin and bone
I can make my bed and I can lie in it cold
But now I'm back with my own story to tell
Back from the edge
Back from the dead
Back before demons took control of my head

Back to the boy who would reach for the stars
Back from the dead
Back from the tears that were too easily shed

But I know time left its scars
You were so caught up in your ways
You came for my cautious heart
Just like a bolt (Ooh-ooh)
From the blue (Ooh-ooh)
No one ever hit me harder than you
'Cause you caught me on my blindside
Right place at the wrong time
And I don't wanna love the ghost of you (Ooh-ooh)
'Cause you caught me on my blindside
You were once in a lifetime
Why do we love the ones that we lose?

You were good at talking back
So quick to use my past
All the questions you never asked
Maybe we drove it a little too fast
We broke apart at the seams
I just wish that we could go back

I was made to feel stupid when I was young
Sometimes I feel nothing at all
Sometimes I want someone to hold
Sometimes I carry on
Just to stumble down once more
But then I faked my way through it with alcohol
I speak the language so fluid
Lost in translation
Sometimes I feel nothing at all
Sometimes I want someone to hold
Sometimes I carry on
Just to stumble down once more
I'm gonna hold you so close
Like a river  I flow to the ocean I know
You pull me close  guiding me home
And I need you to know that we're
And I'm not scared to say those words
I swear to God  I can see
Four kids and no sleep
And when they've grown up
You're still the girl in the club

Only friends never up in my head

Let me begin with an I owe you
Who I owe everything to
Lately  lately my friend
Lately  you think I'm ignoring you
But I've been trying to pull through
I could have been someone
I hurt everyone
Pushed away everyone who got near
Tell me  something that I don't know
I couldn't let you go
Fell on my knees
Turned my face to the rain
That's when you heard my call
Sold me my stubborn soul
Phoenix is rising  it's rising again

Save me  save me again
Save me the way that you did before
Cause no one ever could have loved me more
Give me  give me the strength
Give me the strength when I need it more
Give me the reason that I'm looking for
I could have been someone
I hurt everyone
Pushed away everyone that was near
Tell me  something that I don't know
I couldn't let you go
Fell on my knees
Turned my face to the rain
That's when you heard my call
Sold me my stubborn soul
The phoenix is rising  it's rising again
You took the pain
When my world caved down on me
Now I have someone
Cause you came and you showed me the world
Tell me  something that I don't know
I couldn't let you go (I couldn't let)
Fell on my knees (on my knees)
Turned my face to the rain
That's when you heard my call
Sold me my stubborn soul (you sold me my soul)
Phoenix is rising  it's rising again (phoenix is rising)
Tell me  something that I don't know
I couldn't let you go
Fell on my knees
Turned my face to the rain
That's when you heard my call
Sold me my stubborn soul
Then pour me another drink
I don't even want to think
I'm a slave to my addiction
I'm a hazard to myself
On a fast track to perdition
When I throw up out your window
You should confiscate my key
I will drive you up the fucking wall
Is it too late to believe
I tried so hard to change
But the devil locked my door
I wear these heavy chains around my neck
Like a prisoner
I just want to love
But he won't let me go
Loosen up my chains
Or I'm a condemned prisoner

I was stood there in the spotlight
With this city at my feet
But I was a dead man walking
Nothing ever comes for free
So I moved on down to London
Where I traded in my soul
I could not fill my heart
With all those one night stands and gold
So throw me out your mom's house
I've been living there too long
Well she never liked me anyway
Cause she knows I'm northern scum
I tried so hard to change
But the devil locked my door
I wear these heavy chains around my neck
Like a prisoner
I just wanna love
But he won't let me go
Loosen up my chains
Or I'm a condemned prisoner
I think my minds on the blink
I suffered enough of the heart palps when I think
Discovered it up at the bar 9 drinks in
Course I'm on the brink
Looking at me funny then course I'm gonna swing
Karaoke? Course I wanna sing
Or pour me another drink
It always ends the same
Or I'm a condemned prisoner
I tried so hard to change
But the devil locked my door
I wear these heavy chains around my neck
Like a prisoner
I just wanna love
But he won't let me go
Loosen up my chains
You're careful not to let the smoke inside
I always tell you it's poison
But I know it helps you take the edge off the day
We get a drink before it's closing time
The one on High Street with the blinking sign
All of these memories feel poignant
I won't be there to see the snow melt away
Oh-oh-oh
I gotta make some money
I really feel the distance
And I quite miss home
And I miss you telling me to leave my shoes at the door
'Cause you just swept the floor and the dirt drives you crazy
'Cause it feels like poetry
When the rain falls down on the window
While you're in my arms and we're watching the TV

I don't wanna play it
I don't want to stay 'round here no more
I don't wanna stay here
Like rain on a Monday morning
Like pain that just keeps on going on
Look at all the hate they keep on showing
I don't want to see that
Look at all the stones they keep on throwing
I don't want to feel that
Like Sun that will keep on burning

I was ungrateful  I wasted your time
But I was young and lost  so lost
See  you took this poor boy and changed his whole life
Granted his wishes and dreams overnight
And I saw stars  they shot me down
But I deserved it  they knocked me out
I'm just waking up now  in the tears of the one's I love
It's quiet  I'll bet that everybody thinks I'm done
I need to get up now  I've been down here far too long
Two years I've been lost  now I remember who I was
Who I was  who I was
I am the one who beat me black and blue
No one can hurt all your feelings like you
See  if you're a misfit and feel out of place
Or you don't like how you look  it's okay
'Cause someone will  but you need to love yourself
Don't end up like me  don't end up like me
I'm just waking up now  in the tears of the one's I love
It's quiet  I'll bet that everybody thinks I'm done
I need to get up now  I've been down here for too long
Two years I've been lost  now I remember who I was
Who I was  who I was (I've been down here for too...)
Ooh ooh
Oh oh
And daddy don't like you but daddy and I never speak
Ee ee
Every night when I wake up I need you to get back to sleep
Ee ee
Smells like roses to me
Two young lovers at sea
Tastes so bitter and so sweet
Bang bang bang
Bang bang bang
You could've chose anybody but you chose me
Ee ee
Hiding in bed since cause no one around us agrees
Ee ees
And I feel romantic cause since morning I've been acting wild
Shall we eat all the poison and leave all the questions behind

I pulled you closer to my chest
And you asked me to stay over
I said  I already told ya
I think that you should get some rest
I knew I loved you then  but you'd never know

Begged my friend for your number  I bet you don't remember
That's how we began
I pursued you for a year  I would have waited longer
I knew ultimately it would make the feeling stronger
That first time I kissed you  I could look in the mirror
And like who I was (I liked who I was)
I could never wait for the weekends when you would come over
'Cause that's when I'd see you again
You're all my strength and my weakness
You battle my demons
You're still undefeated
Sometimes I get a little bit jaded

 you live with a break
 babe
 don't ever stop coming
 when nobody holds you
 don't ever stop coming
 don't ever stop coming
 when nobody holds you
 don't ever stop coming"
