"I can't undo what's done
I can't send back the rain
But if I could I would
So when you feel like you can't take another round of being broken
My arms are open
And when you're losing faith and every door around you keeps on closing
My arms are open
I can't uncry your tears
I can't rewind the time
I can't unsay what's said
In your crazy life
My arms are open
My arms are open

So let me do to you
What you've always done for me
And let me be the ground
Underneath your feet
I can't unfeel your pain
I can't undo what's done
I can't send back the rain
But if I could I would
So when you feel like you can't take another round of being broken
My arms are open
My arms are open
(My arms are open)
I will be standing here
I will be by your side
(My arms are open)
You see me loud and clear
With my arms open wide
(My arms are open)
I will be standing here
I will be by your side
(My arms are open)
You feel me loud and clear
With my arms open wide
About a week since the day that you walked
Knowing things would never be the same
With your empty heart and mine full of pain
So explain to me how it came to this
Take it back to the night we kissed
It was Dublin city on a Friday night
We were sitting with our backs against the world
Saying things that we thought but never heard
Where everything we talked about is gone
And the only chance we have of moving on
Is try to take it back before it all went wrong
Before our hearts decide it's time to love again
Let's try to take it back before it all went wrong
There was a time when we stayed up all night
We took the joys alongside the pain
With not much to lose but so much to gain
Are you hearing me? 'Cause I don't wanna miss
Set you adrift on a memory bliss
It was Grafton Street on a rainy night
I was down on one knee and you were mine for life

We were thinking we would never be apart
With your name tattooed across my heart
Where everything we talked about is gone
And the only chance we have of moving on
Is try to take it back before it all went wrong
Before our hearts decide it's time to love again
Let's try to take it back before it all went wrong
If the clouds don't clear
We'll rise above it
We'll rise above it (whoa)
Heaven's gate is so near
Come walk with me through
Just like we used to
Just like we used to
Yeah
Yeah
Let's take it back before it all went wrong
Before the worst (before)
Before we mend (before)
Before our hearts decide it's time to love again
Before too late
Before too long
Let's try to take it back before it all went wrong (all wrong)
Just praying to a God that I don't believe in
'Cause I got time while she got freedom
Her best days will be some of my worst
She finally met a man that's gonna put her first
While I'm wide awake  she's no trouble sleeping
What am I supposed to do when the best part of me was always you?
And what am I supposed to say when I'm all choked up and you're okay?
I'm falling to pieces  yeah
I'm falling to pieces
They say bad things happen for a reason
But no wise words gon' stop the bleeding
'Cause she's moved on while I'm still grieving
And what am I gonna do when the best part of me was always you?
And what am I supposed to say when I'm all choked up and you're okay?
I'm falling to pieces  yeah
I'm falling to pieces  yeah

Oh  you got his heart and my heart and none of the pain
You took your suitcase  I took the blame
Now I'm tryna make sense of what little remains  oh
'Cause you left me with no love and no love to my name

Just prayed to a God that I don't believe in
'Cause I got time while she got freedom

He says he's gonna take a bite from the forbidden fruit
She says never never bite more than you can chew
But this time he's not gonna be another could've been
She said this time that she is built to face anything
This time he's gonna stand for who he is
This time he's hell bent yeah he's heaven bound
This time she's gonna pick herself up no more breaking down
She says if he's looking for love then she don't want to be found
When you shoot across the sky like a broken arrow
It's so hard to keep yourself on the straight and narrow
When you shoot across the sky like a broken arrow
You fall of course
Yeah when you hit the ground
It's hard to get to heaven when your falling hell bound
This time he's gonna make it to the aftermath
This time she's gonna raise her head choose the righteous path
He said one day we will look back and it will make us laugh
No matter what the cause it's better to have loved and lost
Have you ever met a man who never loved at all?
Yeah the higher they are the bigger they fall
You have to choose something cuz you can't have it all
She said even losers get lucky sometimes
He says it's gonna get better like a fine wine
She says it's harder to smell the roses when the sun don't shine
This time he's gonna find another way
This time she's gonna take you to the good ol'days with no... gracing
Only warm embraces with the two little sweet angels with dirty faces

It was February 14  Valentine's Day
The roses came  but they took you away
Tattooed on my arm is a charm to disarm all the harm
Gotta keep myself calm but the truth is you're gone
And I'll never get to show you these songs
Dad  you should see the tours that I'm on
I see you standing there next to Mum
And there are days when I'm losing my faith
Because the man wasn't good  he was great
He'd say  Music was the home for your pain
Take that rage  put it on a page
Take the page to the stage
Blow the roof off the place
I'm tryna make you proud
Do everything you did
I hope you're up there with God

You met a guy named Jack
Gave him the keys to the castle
But he never called you back
You met a guy on vacation
And you were in paradise
Only found out when you got home
He had three kids and a wife
Swiped right on Tinder
Had a little fun on the phone
You made up but he got so drunk

Mascara lines streaming down her face

I can articulate a Shakespeare poem
Even though I didn't know him
I can see where he was going
And where he's coming from
I can even catch his flow and
When I think of you I don't know where this metaphor is going
Cuz there are no words you can understand
Only lovers can
You can ask a professor and a mad man
When it comes to you
No words
Just no words
No words
There ain't no word in this world that describes you

Oh you're going through six degrees of separation
Oh you're going through six degrees of separation
Ooh
I've been clicking through the sites
Read every newspaper
But I'm still not right in the head
I've been drinking till I'm sober
I've been getting real high
Been cutting old wounds
And staying up all night again
'Cause I wanna feel
Something unreal
I wanna feel
Every bone I break
If it's love or hate
I wanna feel
Every time I bruise
If it's win or lose
I wanna feel (Something unreal)

I've been digging up skeletons
I've been turning over rocks
But a million more problems is all that I got in the end
My heart has been rewired
I've been living online
These ideas I believe in Lord

I feel it in my fingertips
I feel it in my bones
The hair is standing on my skin
I know that I am home
Throwing back the curtains
And the truth shall be revealed
Something unreal (Yeah)
Every bone I break
If it's love or hate
I wanna feel (Something unreal)
Every time I bruise

Oh the meanest side of me
They took away the prophet's dream

Now she's stronger than you know

He'll be nothing when he's old
All the kicks and all the blows
He won't ever let it show

All the tears that they cry

As it's fading from my face
Try to speak but nothing's coming
Nothing I could say to make you stay
Gonna stay with friends in London
And that's all I get to know
Just a cigarette gone
I'm driving my car to where I hope you are
Maybe I can talk you down
Maybe I can talk you down
Before this goes over the edge
Gonna use my heart and not my head
And try to open up your eyes
This is relationship suicide
Taking shortcuts through the alleys
While you're racing through my mind
Cops can chase but they won't catch me
Not before I get to speak my mind
If there's still time
Just a cigarette gone
I'm driving my car to where I hope you are
Maybe I can talk you down
Maybe I can talk you down
Before this goes over the edge
Gonna use my heart and not my head
And try to open up your eyes
This is relationship suicide
We're standing on a tiny ledge
Before this goes over the edge

May God strike me down if I tell you lies
I'll stay here forever looking in your eyes
I'll take your hand and I'll hold real tight
We could all be blown to pieces
Because time's a ticking bomb
We could all be dead tomorrow
But our love will carry on
Cause when you know your days are numbered
And you're looking in my eyes
I fell for you and I never got up
I stay here forever till I turn to dust

But the apple doesn't fall too far from the tree

She thought she'd be the one who could change the world
Always tryna pave the way for women in a man's world

The only rattling cages are her own

We're all in tears for a world that's broken
There comes a time where every bird has to fly
It's hard to let your children go leave home
Where'd they go? Who knows
Teach a man to fish and feed a man for life
Instead of reading in a letter that they've gone for something better
I'm sick of looking for those heroes in the sky
To teach us how to fly
