Pull up to the trap at the back door
Ain't tryna see them clothes on no more
Baby just do it for a bankroll
Say she wanna do it for a bankroll
Pull up to the trap at the back door
Ain't tryna see them clothes on no more
Baby just do it for a bankroll
I bet you she'll do it for the bankroll
I bet you she'll do it for the bankroll
Bankroll city pay slow
Everybody on the payroll under control
Every twenty minutes change clothes
Shout out my boy Post only that
Run up in the scene in my tight jean shorts
Looking like a pimp but I got one ho
Try to shut me up and I say hell no
She get looking at me now
And she hit me when in town
She thirsty like she in a drought
Does she want to fuck no doubt
Living life like a king
Hold up bitch I got hundred thousand in my pillow case
You can try me run it with the Nike
But you'll never do it in my pace
My aura so bright but my bars so dark
You would think you in the Sunken Place

Hit a split on the dick for a bankroll

Our fingertips chase the soul of your skin (your skin..)
And all your lips taste like heaven
Brace your hands
I’m in your hands
Brrrrr...
Yes indeedy
So psych the rhyme

Eyes opened wide
And my (?) new ways to rhyme
I'm tellin' it the way I see it
Money is time and I ain't lyin'
Imma need to get a bike  or just
Fuckin' perk up my shine
Look at the girls  they work out fine
Crack it one time
Make sure that's allowed
We'll post some cigs and drink some wine
Rub 'er on 'er ass and tell 'er she fine
Pocketbook slips from under her arm  charm
Never got a dog wog get  it again
That's why she wants to run wit' your friends
Receiving and coming
Could this be the end  the end of leaf and griefin'
I wish you could see them
Receiving and freebin on top runnin' this caobwa
Runinignigng comaalala  new to the me
I used to cut 'em late
Not until you're ready to pay
Rolls up the window before it rolls away
Close my suicides
Hop cap down 'n to the side
I got down till the sun
Women  will still tube run
Today looks very nice
My money rolls real tight like mad booty
Fly as a kite  ooooh

Not knowin' where to go
But I ain't lookin' back
I ain't going back to that
Looking down on the globe
Somehow tryna breathe
Since I made up my mind
For a very long time
Revenge is waiting down the road
I'm steadily moving forward
Even though I don't know where to go
You gotta know that I'm never looking back for ya
'Cause you remind me of the struggle
From where I had to come from under
I used to have to use my muscle
'Cause this life that's very real to me
Is relatable to you
It seemed like such a difficult task
True to mine and true to yours
Tryna relieve the pain that we endured
You lost but I still love you so

Stop messing with my money now
Like a walk in the park
I got love til it runneth out
Cuz being rich is hip as fuck
I got friends I got fun
Got no worries til it all dry up
And I can make it rain
Wash away the pain
Any doubts I might not be enough
Shit I know what you mean
Everybody want it
Not the cash though its freedom
I don't want to worry no more
I just want to ball like the big league
I just want a nice house on the shore
I just want a big house like Gatsby
So catch me if you can
I'm chasing after my dreams
I want to be the man
I want to be the star on the scene
Cuz I don't want to worry no more
I just want to ball like the big league
I just want a nice house on the shore
I just want a big house like Gatsby
So catch me if you can
I'm chasing after my dreams
I want to be the man
I’m gonna be the star on the scene

Ain't got one to pull me up
Feel the panic kicking in
I know I can't stop
Higher I get closer it seems to where I was

Forget the fame and the phony canned applause
I'll keep in dreaming keep on rising high above
