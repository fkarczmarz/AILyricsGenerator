lyrics
"And I been getting caught up 'cause I think too much
To get out of my life
But every now and then I get inside my head
Thinking 'bout the things I could've done instead
You hate me from all that I am
And I'm so very sorry
Everything's staying the same
And I'm so very sorry
I told you I'd change
Now I'm lying in my bed at 11:11
Tryna make a wish  got all of these questions
I can't mess it up  I'll really regret it
Guess I'm relying on this very second
11:11
Man  I been working with the fear of missing out
Wishing I was somewhere till I come around
Caught up in the future  tryna tell right now
But I can't see a thing

Tryna make a wish  got all of these questions
I can't mess it up  I'll really regret it
Guess I'm relying on this very second
Some days I wonder if I'm on the same page
And all these bad choices
Who I can't confront yet
'Cause you know I'll just get in the way
So at 3 am I go to the roof
And I talk back to the moon
And always wonder why
But I'll never change myself
Most days I wonder why they're all so fake
Most days I try to understand it's just a phase
And all these bad choices
Who I can't confront yet
'Cause you know I'll just get in the way

So at 3 am I go to the roof

But I'll never change myself
Talking back with my fav'rite friend
It is tough and hard to tell
 these situations end in a blink
 you've lost the old you
 you'll have me laughing 'til I can't breathe
 can you even see me?
 you would keep them
 I'll come back around
Are running in slow motion?
You ever get that feeling that the door won't budge
No matter how hard you try?
Do you ever stay up all night
'Cause you feel you're not enough?
I think it's 'cause I'm still hung up on you
What have you put me through? My mind ain't got a clue
When you're in the middle of a really bad dream
Then you decide that that's enough
So you try to tell yourself the fears are all gone
But you just cannot wake up
You ever have those days when you're stuck in your head
But you can't explain why?

You will never understand how confusing it was
What have you put me through? My mind ain't got a clue
Then I start to realize you're not there anymore
 probably not
 scared to meet his eyes
 she's swarmed with butterflies
 I'm just breaking inside
 but there's no easy way
 she runs away
 it's impossible to get you off my mind
 I'm just breaking inside
 maybe she'll stay
 she'll look into his eyes
 she'll call him mine
 he'll grab her by the waist
 he'll look into her eyes
 You're my only light
They attend every party  but it's taking them nowhere
Some think it's funny  say they don't even care
But on the inside  they wish they were there
What have we come to now?
We all wanna be like the rest
Can't describe just how
But we're all a beautiful mess
One moment  we're broken and then we're fine
One moment  we're broken and then we're fine
Lost in the puzzle of the teenage mind
Some boys make the trouble and think they're all it
Constantly in company or thrown to the ditch
And some are just there to have a good time
Ignoring every bit of drama and each little lie
Yeah  what have we come to now?
We all wanna be like the rest
Can't describe just how
But we're all a beautiful mess

We are all insane inside
What do you look for in a guy?
And honestly I got no type
But in my head this is what I describe
I want those late nights and long drives
Starin' at your goddamn smile
Makin’ me fall harder than the first time
And playlists with the music
Our parents gotten used to it
I'll steal all your hoodies
We’ll laugh 'til we can't breathe
Makin' me feel stupid when you tease me
Just someone who'll be there when I get home
They say I’m unapproachable
But I'm not the girl who gets emotional
And if I like you then my walls won’t close
So let's just see how this goes

Taking up space 'til I got someone

But shit's kinda getting serious
I think I'm running out of room
Everyone's got someone built custom
To give their darkness to
But loyalty don't come for free
I stay up wondering
What if I broke my legs?
What if I changed my name?
Would you still love me the same?
Or are you just as fake?
Sorry if I got you wrong
Didn't mean to judge you by a cover
I've been burnt so many times
It's hard to turn it off

Still tryna get my brother to like me  mmm
You said that I always seem to land on my feet
But I got problems hangin' like a chain 'round my neck
Tryin' but I'm barely seein' past twenty-three
I thought I had my shit together
I thought that I was gettin' better
Ah
Ah-ah
Old friends  downtown
They didn't like me then and don't like me now

Go out and get messed up  find myself in your bed
Just wanna cut my hair  little black dress  can't forget
Just wanna show you whatever she do  I can do it better
I've been playin' nice little too long  yeah
Drivin' on the high road  and hit a dead end
I'd tell you but we just don't talk
I've been havin' selfish thoughts
I've been workin' hard while you're six drinks in
Tossin' in the dark  feel you under my skin
Once I start  I just can't stop
I've been havin' selfish thoughts
There's no right way to say it
Want you so bad  I hate it

It kinda hurts 'cause it's insane
Yeah  we walk by and it's like
I don't even know you
Like I've never met you
I see our pictures on my phone
And question why we didn't try
But we were just habits
Thought we'd always have it
So to my ex-best friend
I thought I'd know til the end
Sorry I know things aren't going as we planned
To my once ride or die

Stressed out but is always fine
They be asking  but she can't describe
Hate that you've been saying I'm dramatic
Immature because I just don't wanna talk
You ever think that you might be overreacting?
Promise I'm thinking  overthinking quite a lot
They say we're crazy and useless  making stupid excuses
To go make bad decisions when we're hurt
And we're not crazy romantics but we still know what a heart is
And know that when it's cracked it really burns
Oh  we know more than what we tell you
But can't always put into words

But it's been a couple weeks now and I still feel stuck in my lungs
And usually I go out on nights
And not think of you once
But if they start playin' that song
Really thought I'd be done with the hardest part
When I pulled myself out of your arms
Wish I knew that was only the start
And now I'm fallin' apart 'cause
Last night for the very first time
You didn't even try to call
I thought I might die
I couldn't even sleep at all
So I kissed somebody else
Just to see how it felt
But all that was goin' through my brain
Was your hands around my waist

You want the girl with the small waist
And the perfect smile
Someone who's out every weekday
In her dad's new car
You tell me I shouldn't stress out
Say  It's not that hard
But I just got a feeling
This will leave an ugly scar
If you say  She's nothing to worry about
Then why'd you close your eyes when you said it out loud?
Stupid boy making me so sad
Didn't think you could change this fast
She's got everything that I don't have
How could I ever compete with that?
I know you'll go and change your mind

She's got everything that I don't havе
And she's all I wanna be  all I wanna be so bad  so bad

Who knows who I'll be tomorrow?
But I hope that you still like her the same
We might end up strangers somehow
You should get to know me today
I've been falling fast and you don't seem to move
But is it worse for me if I tell the truth?
And are you just a poison that I shouldn't use?
Wish I could say to you
What I can't say to you
We could take it slower
Wait until we're older
But I might be somebody
You might not even know her
I'm going through changes
It's a rollercoaster
But I might be somebody

Mmm
Hate that I'm always gonna have a side to me
That's still in awe when you're mad at me
You can't do it wrong in my eyes
I hate it that you gotta break somethin'
To realize we're at rock bottom
But kill me again 'cause the high's twice as high
Wish this bullshit would end
But we're back here again
When I take off my makeup
We're best friends and enemies
I know I sound so dumb

When you're the thing that I'm runnin' from

Why'd you have to hit her up like that?

You told me to never let you go
So I didn't

You now think I'm overrated
Don't you?
Don't you? Don't you?
And now my heart will be so broken
As it's like we've never spoken
It's so new
We're now like strangers
You blame it on the fact that
We're just stupid teenagers

I will never know
Is cut and thrown away
Petals fall and you don't call
For days and days and days
You say  you say it's not my fault
