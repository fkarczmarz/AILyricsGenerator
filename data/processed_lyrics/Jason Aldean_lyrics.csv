"Ain't nobody hanging around
Another grey September day
Was I crazy to think she'd stay
If that sun would have just hung up in that sky
If those blue water waves
Could've stayed at our feet on the beach
Instead of going out with the tide
If that wind was a friend
She might have stayed forever and never ever left these arms
I brace myself against the cold
And let her memory take hold
Stirring that old fire up
As if I don't miss her enough
If that sun would have just hung up in that sky
If those blue water waves
Could've stayed at our feet on the beach
Instead of going out with the tide
If that wind was a friend
She might have stayed forever and never ever left these arms
Just a little more summertime

She might have stayed forever and never ever left these arms
Packs a lunch and a Thermos full of coffee
It's another day in the dusty haze
Those burnin' rays are wearin' down his body
The diesel's worth the price of gold
It's the cheapest grain he's ever sold
But he's still holdin' on
He just takes the tractor another round
And pulls the plow across the ground
And sends up another prayer
Please don't let my dreams run dry
That hail storm back in '83
Sure did take a toll on his family
But he stayed strong and carried on
Just like his dad and granddad did before him
On his knees every night
'Cause that's all he's ever known

And pulls the plow across the ground
And sends up another prayer
Please don't let my dreams run dry
And he takes the tractor another round (Another round)
Please don't let my dreams run dry
 you know those rumors get to flyin' in a town this size
 I didn't feel a thing when you threw that ring and slammed the door
 I ain't wonderin' where you been or who you been with
 baby
But I broke out these old boots again
Gonna jump in that old truck
Head down to the bar and hang out with an old friend
Been a while since I fired up a cigarette
And got drunk on some draft beer
Well where I’m going tonight
There’s a good chance you won’t want me back here
I tried to be what you were looking for
But I can’t do that anymore
I'm better at being who I am
Better at letting my rebel run
And nothing about me worth a damn
If I can’t be my old man’s son
Your world and mine are worlds apart
Being something that ain't never had a chance
I’m better at being who I am
I wasn’t ever gonna change
I don’t know who in the hell I thought I was kiddin’
For a little while there it seemed like the sex would make it all alright but it didn’t
This ain’t my side of the tracks
I got good at forgetting that

I’m better at being back on my side of town
Back down to earth
A blue jean boy and a flannel shirt
I’m just not what you deserve
I'm better at being who I am
Better at being where I'm from
Ain't nothing about me is worth a damn
If I can’t be my old man’s son
Your world and mine are worlds apart
Being something I ain't never had a chance
Sittin' in the drive but she wouldn't get out
The dogs were all barkin' and a-waggin' around
She had on a new dress and she'd curled her hair
She was lookin' too good not to go somewhere
We can go to the show or we can stay right here
And I can take you for a ride on my big green tractor
We can go slow or make it go faster
Down through the woods and out to the pasture
Climb up in my lap and drive if you want to
I'll take you for a ride on my big green tractor
Sit up on the hill and watch the sun go down
When the fireflies are dancin' and the moon comes out
We can turn on the lights and head back to the house

Burnin' out like a cigarette
Drinking down that memory 'til there's nothin' left
I could go on and on
Why you're gone
I could blame it on the whiskey
I wouldn't blame you if you didn't even miss me
Should've never let you go
Should've never watched you go
I could blame it on a good high
Let it take the blame for why you told me goodbye
Instead of missin' you and missin' all those good times
Should've never let you go
Should've never watched you go
I could say I never knew
I could drink around the truth
But I can't blame it on you (Do you still think about me too?)

You stuck in my head girl writing the lines
Couldn't sing this song without you if I tried
Let's light it up like it's our last night
We're just hanging around
Burnin' it down
Sippin' on some cold Jack Daniel's
Jammin' to some old Alabama with you baby
Laying right here naked in my bed
I'm just doing my thing
You love it when I sing
Say it makes you feel like an angel
We about to get a little tangled up right about now
So girl let's keep burnin' it down
Girl when you want it
You know that I'm on it
You know that I love lovin' up on you

She got a knock-out love and a goodbye kiss
Got that thirty-thirty smoke rolling off of her lips
Lose my breath  knock me dead every time I'm with her
Yeah  she's a cowboy killer
She make a night wild and restless  run it off the tracks

Shake off the where you came from dust
Grab your guitar  walk down the street
Sign says Nashville  Tennessee
But I have found
It's a crazy town full of neon dreams
Everybody plays  everybody sings
Hollywood with a touch of twang
To be a star you got to bang-bang-bang
Bend those strings 'til the Hank comes out
Make all the drunk girls scream and shout
In this crazy town
You pay your dues and you play for free
And you pray for a honky tonk destiny
You cut your teeth in the smokey bars
And live off the tips from a pickle jar
'Til you find a cool new sound
And you smile when the record man shoots you down

Laid back swervin' like I'm George Jones
Smoke rollin' out the window
An ice cold beer sittin' in the console
Memory lane up in the headlights
It's got me reminiscin' on the good times
I'm turnin' off a real life drive and that's right
I'm hittin' easy street on mud tires
Back in the day Potts farm was the place to go
Load the truck up hit the dirt road
Jump the barbwire spread the word
Light the bonfire then call the girls
King in the can and the Marlboro man
Jack and Jim were a few good men
When we learned how to kiss and cuss and fight too
Better watch out for the boys in blue
And all this small town he said she said
Ain't it funny how rumors spread
Like I know something y'all don't know
Man that talk is gettin' old

Whiskey's supposed to drown the memory
I've gone from one to one too many

Is how your memory drowns the whiskey

All the folks down in Lynchburg  Tennessee
From New York to Los Angeles
Kinda making small talk killing time
Flirting with the flight attendants
Just a bunch of square cornfields and wheat farms
Miles and miles of back roads and highways
Connecting little towns with funny names
Who'd want to live down there in the middle of nowhere?
They've never drove through Indiana
Met the men who plowed that earth
Or caught a harvest moon in Kansas
They'd understand why God made
Those flyover states
I bet that mile long Santa Fe freight train engineer's seen it all
Just like that flatbed cowboy stacking US steel on a 3-day haul
Roads and rails under their feet

Like an angel through my Chevy stereo
I know sometimes I can be crazy
But I can see it in your eyes
I'm the only guy that's driving you wild  so wild
Call it what you wanna but you know I wanna call you my lady
All this on and off and on again
And I wish you would make up your mind
'Cause it's time
And I'm tired of playing these games
Yeah you say that it's over
And then you tell me come over
It's like fire  and then it's like rain
Yeah we're hot and we're colder
You get me drunk and then sober
Tell me it's on if you want it to be
If you're moving on  then I think you should leave
I'm tired of playing these games  so I won't
Baby  love me or don't
I could keep your little red dress that you left on the floor  girl
Hang it in the closet 'cause I know you're gonna want it next time  next time
You can come here and kiss me or walk out the door
I can hold you for good girl  or not anymore

Cleaned up clean cut and clean shaved
I got the cover off the '68
I fire it up and let them horses sing
A little pretty thing
A little tan-legged Georgia dream
She’s a rocking them holey jeans
Baby what you got going on Saturday?
You know words got it there’s gonna be a party
Out of town about half a mile
Four wheel drives and big mud tires
Muscadine wine
Oh baby you can find me
In the back of a jacked up tailgate
Sitting round watching all these pretty things
Get down in that Georgia clay
And I’ll find peace
At the bottom of a real tall cold drink
I'm chilling to some Skynyrd and some old Hank
Let's get this thing started
It’s my kinda party
If you wanna drink
Go baby just do your thing
Give up your keys
Hell why drive when you can stay with me?
And then after while we’ll sneak away from the bonfire
Walk by the moonlight and down to the riverside
Gotcha sipping on some moonshine
Baby if you're in the mood you can settle for a one night rodeo
You can be my tan-legged Juliet
I’ll be your Redneck Romeo

Slide over  we slip out to the outskirts of town
I got a blanket and a fifth of Comfort
A little something to knock off the edge
It's supposed to get a little cool tonight
Looks like I'm gonna have to hold you tight  yeah
About a mile off Old Mill Road
In that spot nobody knows
We park the truck and we take off runnin'
Got a moon and a billion stars
The sound of steel and old boxcars
The thought of you's drivin' me insane
Yeah  I hope it's gonna be a long one
And if we're lucky  it's moving slow
I wouldn't mind if it lasted all night

I'm outta here
I stuck my middle finger up in the sky
Flipped off that Y'all come back sign
Looked in the mirror one last time
And watched it disappear
It ain't nothin' but a rearview town
Broken hearts and rusted plows
Roots ripped right up out of the ground
Never thought I'd ever leave it
It ain't nothin' what it used to be
Population minus me
On the other side of that dust cloud
Ain't nothin' but a rearview town
Too much of her to run into

Slide your pretty little self on over
Put your pretty pink toes on the dash
Lean the seat back
Sweet tan little thing with nothin' to do

 tequila to forget

Where we drag raced our pick-ups and Mustangs
And weathered all the sun and rain
And to this day up on that overpass
There ain't no doubt
We let the world know we were here with everything we did
I still got the scar
From swinging out a little too far

And everybody else was just like us
Soaking in the rain  baking in the sun
Don't quit 'til the job gets done

Is you don't get nothing that you don't earn
