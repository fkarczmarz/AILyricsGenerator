"Blinded by science  where do I belong?
What's in the future  has it just begun?
Blinded by science  I'm on the run
I worry about the world that we live in
I'm worried by all the confusion
I wonder about the lies I've been reading
I wonder where this madness is leading
Is this a road going nowhere?
Or is someone leading us somewhere?
I can't believe we're here for no reason
There must be something we can believe in
Blinded by science  I'm on the run
I'm not an appliance  so don't turn me on
What's in the future  has it just begun?
Blinded by science  I'm on the run
What's in the future  has it just begun?
Blinded by science  I'm on the run

Another sleepless night
Three cups of coffee  but I can't clear my head
From what went down last night
I know we both have our own little ways
But somehow we keep it together
You hear me talk  but you don't hear what I say
I guess it don't even matter
Blue morning  can't you see what your love has done to me?
I've always listened to your point of view  my ways I tried to mend
And I've always been a patient man  but my patience has reached its end
You tell me you're leaving  you tell me goodbye
You say you might send a letter
Well honey don't telephone  cause I won't be alone
I need someone to make me feel better
Blue morning  blue morning 
I locked myself away
I can't remember the last time
I saw the light of day
Don't wanna face life
Feel I've been betrayed
I want you to tell me
Where our love went astray
So can't you wait one more minute
Why can't you wait one more day?
Let's get it straight
'Cause it's a big mistake
You better think about it
I don't wanna break it up
Why do we have to break it up?
I only wanna make it up tonight
You say you've thought about it
But you sound so cold
You make it look like our love
Can be bought or sold
You won't listen
You say it's way too late
That something is missing
And now you just can't wait

So don't say break it up (Break it up)
I wanna hear you say we'll make it up (Make it up)
Why can't we make it up tonight? (Make it up tonight)
Make it up tonight
And I ask myself
What's wrong with me?
How could I be so blind?
I know she tried to give me everything
I still couldn't see
Now as I watch our love slip away
Don't break it up (Break it up)
Take a little time and make it up (Make it up)
I only wanna make it up tonight
I don't wanna break it up
You're willing to sacrifice our love
You never take advice
I know
You're as cold as ice

You want paradise

'Cause I'm a dirty white boy

Never had a hold on you
And don't tell me where you'd rather be
You won't believe what you won't see
The only one you'll lose is me
You never think about what we've got
Maybe our breakup is long overdue
Don't make it harder than you need to
You're old enough to hear the truth
I'd do anything to make you stay
I'd be a fool to let you get away

I wanna stick around 'till I can't see straight
Fill my eyes with that double vision
No disguise for that double vision
My double vision gets the best of me
Never do more than I  I really need
My mind is racing  but my body's in the lead
Tonight's the night  I'm gonna push it to the limit
I live all of my years in a single minute
Fill my eyes with that double vision
No disguise for that double vision
Oh-ooh (oh) oh-oh  double vision
(Oh) I need double vision
(Oh  double vision) oh-oh my my double vision
They don't even want to know the reason why
They've given up on finding someone new
Now you say you've got a broken heart
You ought to know this side of love can leave you torn apart
Dry your eyes because your heart's gonna mend
And maybe tonight you'll fall in love again
To be down on love
Now love seems so far away
Your skies are so cloudy
And the tears come like falling rain
Face up to it and don't pretend
And maybe tonight you'll fall in love again
Just once in a life you'll realize

But how long do I have to pay?
You know you belong here beside me
I'm a fool for you anyway
Because I'm a fool for you anyway
Well I cried for you so long
My river of tears ran dry
And I tried to be so strong

Time for my mind to go wandering
Off on a journey  through space and time
In search of a face I can never find
So I close my eyes and look inside
I can't forget
The night that I saw her we never met
She felt so close to me as I reached for her hand
She drifted away like the desert sand
It was her and she was gone
I wish she'd come back tonight
Like a star shining bright
I don't know where she's from
She's like a girl on the moon
A girl on the moon
She's like a girl on the moon
A girl on the moon
Yeah it's night  once again
And that same old feeling is setting in
It all seems so familiar but I hope this time
That the girl on the moon will soon be mine
All mine  tonight
Am I asking too much

Should I even know where she's from

A connection I have finally found
With just a single kiss
Knowing you're the only one

It's all that matters now
I'd give my life for love
I'd give my heart away

Because if he catches you messin'

Headknocker
He's got an old fender strat
Plays behind his back
He's a backseat mauler
A barroom brawler
I think he's going to blacken your eye
If that don't teach you a lesson
Might show you his Smith & Wesson
She be
But you fail to see
Ooh what she went through for you
And her heart just broke in two
Behind you right or wrong
And now it's over and her heart turns to stone
She cries a little as her heart turns to stone
She's that kind of woman
She'll do fine on her own
What you thought was a game
A game you were winning
Wouldn't go your way
Now you've lost what you had
And your back to the beginning

Bought a beat up six string in a secondhand store
Didn't know how to play it  but he knew for sure
That one guitar felt good in his hands
Didn't take long to understand
Just one guitar  slung way down low
Was a one way ticket  only one way to go
So he started rocking
He is never going to stop
Got to keep on rocking
Someday he's going to make it to the top
And be a juke box hero  got stars in his eyes
He's a juke box hero
In a town without a name  in a heavy downpour
Thought he passed his own shadow  by the backstage door
Like a trip through the past  to that day in the rain
And that one guitar made his whole life change

A day like any other day
I left a small town
For the Apple in decay
It was my destiny
It's what we needed to do
They were telling me
I'm telling you
I was inside looking outside
The millions of faces
But still I'm alone
Paying a penance
I was longing for home
I'm looking out for the two of us
I hope we'll be here when they're through with us

I take a walk down to the corner
I meet those bad girls hanging around
Never doing what they oughta
I get caught up in the action
Gotta find the main attraction now
Gotta get some satisfaction
You better take me to heart of that night life
Looking for some night life
Need a little night life
Living in the daylight just don't agree with me
Stealing through the night like a wolf on the prowl

At the green light you rev it on the red line
Been waiting all week to get my wheels on the street
Get my hands on the wheel  slide down in the seat
She's wearing new colors and running pretty good
I got four hundred horses tucked under the hood
But there's no need to panic  it's under control
We're aerodynamic and ready to roll
Rev on the red line
You're on your own
Rev on the red line
Just let it go
Running all night on Lake Avenue
It's a piece of cake if you know what to do
You've got to lose a few 'til the stakes get high
When the odds are right  you just blow by
And make no mistake  there's women who just wait
For the man and machine with the best time

Until the heavenly gates
Were sighted at last
Take me to the stars

Northern lights flashed by
And then they were gone
And as old stars would die
So the new ones were born
And ever on I sailed
Celestial ways
And in the light of my years
Shone the rest of my days

She make me feel like a stranger...in my own house
I come stumbling in at a quarter to three
To the sound of my own dog growling at me
I'm scared to move or turn on a light
You've got me creeping around in the dark
Like a thief in the night
I've got no excuse  I should have known

I guess I'll take a look upstairs  in the danger zone
I wonder what I'm doing here
When I never feel at home
I'm a stranger in my own house

But I'm still locked out

But now I stand alone with my pride
And dream that you're still by my side

But it's not the end of my world
Just a slight change of plans
That was yesterday
But today life goes on
No more hiding in yesterday
