lyrics
"I wanna play this for you when you're feeling used and tired
I wanna make the best so you want more
Just let me in your arms
Just let me in your arms
I'll be the magic you won't ever see (Ever see)
You can always rely on me to help you do what you want to do
I wanna be the best you've ever known
Just let me in your arms
Just let me in your arms
I'll be your lighthouse when you're lost at sea (Lost at sea)
You can always come to me
I wanna be the place you call your home (Call your home)
Just let me in your arms
Just let me in your arms

(When you need me) I will never let you come apart

You never thought about us
And I was just dreaming
It took a night of insane
To feel the need for your touch
And I could never explain
How I was just dreaming
Never guess what came after
I fell
Automatically in love
When the wind goes the other way
We were automatically in love (In love)
Just a girl undercover and a boy with the getaway
We were automatically in love (In love)

It's not the fear that you trust
It's not the voice in your head
We got the chemical rush
And now we're just dreaming
And we could wait for the proof
A little time to adjust
But every morning with you
I wake up just dreaming
Never guess what came after
I fell
Automatically in love
When the wind goes the other way
We were automatically in love (In love)
Just a girl undercover and a boy with the getaway
We were automatically in love (In love)
Automatically in love
When the wind goes the other way
We were automatically in love (In love)
Just a girl undercover and a boy with the getaway
We were automatically in love (In love)

We go back to my place
Take my makeup off
Show you my best disguise
You believe in my heart
You believe in my kind
Every time you ask me
And I won't say you're the reason I was on my knees
I'm at peace in the dark
When I know that you're near
Hear the breath of your heart
Singing me a lullaby
All those traveling years
'Til we said our goodbye

This is getting kinda out of control
Out of control
Slow down now
This is getting kinda out of my hands

Making out like it's the end of the world

My heart needed a holiday
I bet we can make things slide into Monday
I've been living with no regrets
Love was just a night at best
One more night with you always turns to two
I can't help it 'cause it feels right when it feels right
'Cause it feels like I've never loved

Nothing I want to say

Like I'm slowly gettin' closer to you

Paralyzed in motion
Lost in wintertime

So we could be together forever
'Cause where were you for me
You come to me in dreams at night
You come to me in dreams at night
I don't want to work it out
I'm not goin' to work it out
I don't want to work it out
So we could be together forever
'Cause where were you for me
When I needed (Hey)
When I needed you
Hey (Hey)
Hey
Hey (Hey)
When I needed
You used to be the first thing on my mind
I know I'm just a friend to you
That I will never get to call you mine
I didn't mean to say what I said
But I can't get you out of my head
And I want you to miss me when I'm not around you
I know that you’re in town
I'm not the type of girl for you
And I'm not going to pretend
That I'm the type of girl you call more than a friend
And I'd break all the rules for you
Break my heart and start again
I'm not the type of girl you call more than a friend
I bet she acts so perfectly
You probably eat up every word she says
And if you ever think of me
I bet I'm just a flicker in your head

I'm not the type of girl for you
And I'm not going to pretend
That I'm the type of girl you call more than a friend
And I'd break all the rules for you
Break my heart and start again
I'm not the type of girl you call more than a friend
I'll make time for you (Time for you)
I'll make time for you (Time for you)
I didn't mean to say what I said
