"Sunday clothes don't fool me
When you were making moonlight
The mall cops in Mobile
This is borrowed stone
I'd help you let your hair down
The sun left every evening
Good grass was dying
Tenderness to you was only talk about a bruise
Or walking into water after dark
Your papa saw me coming
Blood knows when it's worth it
Jesus left a best friend
Mine says forget her
Mobile had your moonlight
But the line cook had candy
You let him blow your candle a bit
Ring a bell that's broken
That sound is loud inside us

Tenderness to you was only talk about a bruise
Or walking into water after dark
Love can last a lifetime
This is Alabama
Now you're making music
For beautiful people by the sea
Tenderness to you was only talk about a bruise
I was alone 'til I found myself
Grew up to be a man more or less
All in good time
All in good time  I drifted away
I ran my mouth 'til I'd nothing to say
You broke my heart  then I was okay
All in good time
All in good time  I trusted my eyes
Treated my losses like clouds in the sky
Finally picked on someone my size
All in good time
All in good time  I followed my nose
Learned where to bleed when a night comes to blows
Tried on your love  then I folded those clothes
All in good time
Throw your bread to falling birds
Buried friends and wasted words
Something wants to eat us all
Alive

All in good time  my angel came back
Made us some money  but that didn't last
We wouldn't cry  but we couldn't laugh
All in good time
All in good time  we fell like a star
We closed our eyes and we opened our arms
Ran off the road in our own stolen car
All in good time
All in good time and that's what it was
Mistook that cash in the mattress for love
Dropped all our weapons and shrank from the blood
All in good time
All in good time  we'd nothing to prove
We took the bait 'til we lost a tooth
No one believed it  but we told the truth
All in good time
All in good time  our plan went to shit
I told my future by reading your lips
You wore my ring until it didn't fit
All in good time
All in good time  we suffered enough
We met our muscle when push came to shove
Swept all that broken glass under the rug
All in good time
Dancing 'til we both collapse
Wishing we could hide our tracks
Something wants to eat us all
Alive
All in good time  we'll remember when
Say our goodbyes and our hellos again
Huff and we'll puff until they let us in
All in good time
All in good time  we'll land on our feet
Your mother will sigh and my soldier will sleep
We'll swim in the ocean  fishes set free
All in good time
We'll swim the ocean
On either side of the garden wall
We laugh all night to keep the embers glowing
Some are leaping free from their moving cars
Stacking stones 'round their broken hearts
Waving down any wind that might come blowing
Mice move out when the field is cut
Serpents curl when the sun comes up
Songbirds only end up where they're going
Some get rain and some get snow
Some want love and some want gold
I just want to see you in the morning
Dogs lay down in the evening heat
Fish do worse when they leave the sea
Songbirds only end up where they're going
In this autumn town where the lights can change
Some get mercy and some get blame
Some get lost when they feel the river flowing

It's all holy smoke and the flame dies fast
We hold our hats while the days fly past
Cold wind comes and we wave but it keeps going
All come back or they all come close
Songbirds only end up where they're going
Some get hard and some go home
Some want flesh and some want bone
I just want to see you in the morning
There's a kid outside the church kickin' a can
When the cedar branches twist  she turns her collar to the wind
The weather can close the world within its hand
And my mother says Rebecca is as stubborn as they come
They both call to me with words I never knew
There's a bug inside the thimble  there's a band-aid on her thumb
And a pony in the river turning blue
They say  Time may give you more than your poor bones could ever take
My Rebecca says she never wants a boy
To be barefoot on the driveway as they wave and ride away
Then to run inside and curse the open door
I once gave to my Rebecca a belated promise ring
And she sold it to the waitress on a train
I may find her by the phone but with a fashion magazine
She may kiss me when her girlfriends leave again
They say  Time may give you more than your poor bones could ever take
I think I could never love another girl
To be free atop a tree stump and to look the other way
While she shines my mother's imitation pearls

Sunday evenin' my Rebecca's lost a book she never read
And the moon already fell into the sea
Saw the statues of our fathers in the courthouse flower bed
Now they blend with all the lightnin'-tattered trees
They say  Time may give you more than your poor bones could ever take
My Rebecca said she knew I'd want a boy
A dollar for my boardwalk red balloon to float away
She would earn a pocketful to buy me more
Du-dun dun dun dun dun dun
Watching the windows close?
I've not seen you lately
Or places we used to go
I've a picture of you
On our favorite day by the seaside
There's a bird stealing bread
That I brought out from under my nose
Does his company make
Light of a rainy day?
How I've missed you lately
And the way you would speak
And all that we wouldn't say
Do his hands in your hair
Feel a lot like a thing you believe in?
Or a bit like a bird stealing bread
Out from under your nose?
Do you carry the words
Around like a key or change?
I've been thinking lately
Of a night on the stoop
And all that we wouldn't say

In the evening
Will you fly like a bird stealing bread
When we were moving through the door
You would make me get so angry
Then I'd stay there on my own
Some call it talking blues (talking blues)
Some call it bitter truth
Some call it getting even in a song
I kept reading hidden meanings
You would rage how I was wrong
Till I let you drag me down
Some get a garden heart
Some get a riverside
Some get a house that lets the years go by

There's a message in my eyes
You better love yourself 'cause I've tried
Some call it talking blues (talking blues)
Some call it bitter truth
With bullets and pages of trade magazines
Close to a car that flipped on the turn
When God left the ground to circle the world
A girl with a bird she found in the snow
Then flew up her gown and that's how she knows
That God made her eyes for crying at birth
Then left the ground to circle the Earth
A boy with a coin he crammed in his jeans
Then making a wish he tossed in the sea
Walked to a town that all of us burn
Any rain softly kisses us on the face
Any wind means we're running
We can sleep and see 'em coming
Where we drift and call it dreaming
We can weep and call it singing
Where we break when our hearts are strong enough
We can bow 'cause our music's warmer than blood
Where we see enough to follow
We can hear when we are hollow
Where we keep the light we're given
We can lose and call it living
Where the sun isn't only sinking fast
Every night knows how long it's supposed to last
Where the time of our lives is all we have
For all the love you've left behind
You can have mine
Say it's here where our pieces fall in place
We can fear 'cause the feeling's fine to betray
Where our water isn't hidden
We can burn and be forgiven
Where our hands hurt from healing
We can laugh without a reason

You were braidin' your gray hair
It had grown so long
Since I'd been gone
The cross around their necks
But our sons were overseas
And we all know 'bout the hive and the honeybees
Almost home with an olive branch and a dove
You were beating on a Persian rug
With your Bible and your wedding band
Both hidden on the TV stand
When a cruel wind blew every city father fell
Off the county carousel
While the dogs were eating snow
All our sons had sunk in a trunk of Noah's clothes
Almost home and got lost on our new street
While your grievin' girls all died in their sleep
So the dogs all went unfed
A great dream of bones all piled on the bed

Give me your hand
And take what you will tonight
I'll give it as fast
And high as the flame will rise
Cinder and smoke
Some whispers around the trees
The juniper bends
As if you were listening
Give me your hand
Your mother is drunk
As all the firemen shake
A photo from father's arms
Cinder and smoke
You asked me to pray for rain
With ash in your mouth
 killers let go

My lover came to me and we'd lay?
Until now
Will you say to them when I'm gone

 blame me for the rocks
 garden wall of Eden
 we were born to fuck each other
 tiny baby tears
 blame me
 you will never make me learn
You're a poem of mystery
You're the prayer inside me
Spoken words like moonlight
You're the voice that I like
Needlework and seedlings
In the way you're walking
To me from the timbers
A bird's wing on the window
Sometimes I'll hear when she's sleeping
Her fever dream  a language on her face
I want your flowers like babies want God's love
Or maybe  as sure as tomorrow will come
With grace in all she offers
Sometimes I'd like just to ask her what honest words
She can't afford to say  like
I want your flowers like babies want God's love
 I cut my long baby hair
 flightless bird?
 weeping
 American mouth?
 those fishing lures
 flightless bird?
 bleeding
 American mouth?
Diving too deep for coins
All of your street light eyes
Wide on my plastic toys
Then when the cops closed the fair
I cut my long baby hair
Stole me a dog-eared map
And called for you everywhere
Have I found you? Flightless bird
Or lost you? American mouth
Big pill looming
Now I'm a fat house cat
Nursing my sore blunt tongue
Watching the warm poison rats
Curl through the wide fence cracks
Pissing on magazine photos
Those fishing lures
Thrown in the cold and clean
Blood of Christ mountain stream

Bring you coffee to taste  crossword puzzles to ponder
And I hope you're well and you know that I love you
Though I write so seldom and call every blue moon
There's some  there's some tall Georgia boy
Searchin' out a freckled girl with style
Wait till tomorrow
Someday soon  when we hail from Atlanta
We won't need some Christmas to spend time together
And I hope you're well and you sleep every evenin'
Never lyin' awake for you're dreamin' of children
There's some tall Georgia boy
Searchin' out a freckled girl with style
I will be free and shining like before
When the wind wraps me like the reaper's hand
I will swing free until they cut me down
When the sea takes me like my mother's arms
I will breathe free as any word of God
Your fingers over my face
Blind eyed Samson driven to the temple
And night birds digging until dawn
Freedom hangs like heaven over everyone
Ain't nobody knows what the newborn holds
But his mama says he'll walk on water
And wander back home
Wander back home
Well past all those eyes across the avenue
Fish heads running from rain
You know I'll do anything you want me to
Lamp oil lovers may say
Freedom hangs like heaven over everyone
Ain't nobody knows what the newborn holds
But his papa's going to hide shaking gristle
And shaking like bone
Shaking like bone
Hoof marks hacked up all I had to offer you
Looked all over this place
Lost your portrait lately when the winter blew
In like Herod and them
Freedom hangs like heaven over everyone
Ain't nobody knows what the newborn holds
But a dollar says he'll lick that devil
And do it alone
Do it alone
And one is laid on the floor
And one is changing the locks on the doors
And I've been buying their time on my knees
And I've been selling them blankets to bleed on
Around the house by the sea
The scent of roses and raspberry leaves
And there is smoke in my clothes
Too much time with just smoke in my nose
And I've been making the meaning they lack
And I've been burning that book they come back to
There is a house by the sea
And an ocean between it and me
And like the shape of a wave
The jealous sisters will sing on my grave
And I've been living to run where they led
And I've been dying to rise from their bed
And I've been sparing my neck from their chain
And they've been changing the sound of my name
And I've been swimming to them in my sleep
And even the last of their blue-eyed babies know
That the burning man is the color of the end of day
And how every tongue that gets bit always has another word to say
Cain bought a blade from some witch at the window  Abel bought a bag of weed
And even the last of their brown-eyed babies see
That the cartoon king has a tattoo of a bleeding heart
There ain't a penthouse Christian wants the pain of the scab but they all want the scar
How every mouth sings of what it's without so we all sing of love
And how it ain't one dog who's good at fucking and denying who he's thinking of
Cain heard a cat tumble limp off the rooftop  Abel heard his papa pray
And even the last of the black-eyed babies say
That every saint has a chair you can borrow and a church to sell
That the wind blows cold across the back of the master and the kitchen help
There's a big pile of innocent bones still holding up the garden wall
And it was always the broken hand we learned to lean on after all (oh oh oh oh)
How God knows if Christ came back he would find us in a poker game
And hold like the breeze
Half as tight as both eyes closed
Who's seen Jezebel?
She went walking where the cedars line the road
Her blouse on the ground
We'll love you more and wholly
Only
Who's seen Jezebel?
She was born to be the woman we could blame
Make me a beast half as brave
I'd be the same
Who's seen Jezebel?
She was gone before I ever got to say
Lay here my love
Who's seen Jezebel?
Will the mountain last as long as I can wait
Wait like the dawn
How it aches to meet the day

She was certainly the spark for all I've done
The window was wide
She could see the dogs come running
We'll love you more and wholly
There's itty-bitty boy tuggin' hard at your hand
That you've been bringin' me joy
And I only lie when you don't want the truth
I'm only frightened 'cause you finally gave me somethin' to lose
And it's as loud as a thunderclap and you hear it too
But you've been bringin' me joy
Deep inside the heart of this crazy mess
I'm only calm when I get lost within your wilderness
That you've been bringin' me joy
When all the bluebirds dyin' but they're singin' the blues
It's a heartfelt silly sort of bumblin' tune
But how you're bringin' me joy
The rusty gears of morning
We gladly run in circles
But the shape we meant to make is gone
And love is a tired symphony
You hum when you're awake
And love is a crying baby
Mama warned you not to shake
And love's the best sensation
Hiding in the lion's mane
And the thorn bush in your path
That burns a scented oil
That I'll drip into your bath
The water's there to warm you
And the earth is warmer
When you laugh
And love is the scene I render
When you catch me wide awake
And love is a dream you enter
Though I shake and shake and shake you
And love's the best endeavor
 I'll love you only
 I'll love you that way
From a war that must be won in the name of truth
With our soldiers so brave  your freedom we will save
With our rifles and grenades and some help from God
And I want to see my family
My wife and child waitin' for me
I've got to go home
I've been so alone  you see
You just can't believe the joy I did receive
When I finally got my leave and I was goin' home
Oh  I flew through the sky and my convictions could not lie
For my country I would die and I will see it soon
And I want to see my family
My wife and child waitin' for me
I've got to go home

Birds are leaving over autumn's ending
One of us will die inside these arms
Eyes wide open
Naked as we came
One will spread our ashes 'round the yard
She says  If I leave before you  darling
Don't you waste me in the ground
I lay smiling like our sleeping children
One of us will die inside these arms
Eyes wide open
Naked as we came
God  there's a hangman that wants to come 'round
How we rise when we're born
Like the ravens in the corn
On their wings  on our knees
Crawling careless from the sea
God  give us love in the time that we have
God  give us love in the time that we have
God  there are guns growing out of our bones
God  every road takes us farther from home
All these men that you made
How we wither in the shade
Of your trees  on your wings
We are carried to the sea
God  give us love in the time that we have
In a frozen copse of trees
A bone cold and older than our bodies
Slowly floating in the sea
Every morning there were planes
The shiny blades of pagan angels in our father's skies
Every evening I would watch her hold the pillow
I was still a beggar shaking out my stolen coat
Among the angry cemetery leaves
When they caught the king beneath the borrowed car
Love was a father's flag and sung like a shank
In a cake on our leather boots
A beautiful feather floating down
To where the birds had shit on empty chapel pews
Every morning we found one more machine
To mock our ever waning patience at the well
Every evening she'd descend the mountain stealing socks
And singing something good where all the horses fell
Like a snake within the wilted garden wall
I'd hint to her every possibility
While with his gun the pagan angel rose to say
Like some passing afternoon
Summer warmed the open window of her honeymoon
And she chose a yard to burn
But the ground remembers her
There are things that drift away
Like our endless numbered days
Autumn blew the quilt right off the perfect bed she made
And she's chosen to believe
In the hymns her mother sings
Sunday pulls its children from their piles of fallen leaves
There are sailing ships that pass
All our bodies in the grass
Springtime calls her children 'til she lets them go at last
And she's chosen where to be
Though she's lost her wedding ring
Somewhere near her misplaced jar of Bougainvillea seeds
There are things we can't recall
Blind as night that finds us all
But my hands remember hers
Rolling 'round the shaded ferns

There are names across the sea
Only now I do believe
But she'll mend his tattered clothes
And they'll kiss as if they know
Pitching glass at the cornfield crows and folding clothes
Grandma's gun and the black bear claw that took her dog
And we'll undress beside the ashes of the fire
Both our tender bellies wound in baling wire
All the more a pair of underwater pearls
Than the oak tree and its resurrection fern
In our days we will say what our ghosts will say
We gave the world what it saw fit and what'd we get?
In the timid shade of the autumn leaves and the buzzard's wing
And we'll undress beside the ashes of the fire
Our tender bellies all wound around in baling wire
All the more a pair of underwater pearls
Wide as the ring of a bell
Gone all star white
Small as a wish in a well
Woke like a tree full of bees
Buried in Christmas bows
And a blanket of weeds
Papa died Sunday and I understood
Papa died while my girl
Lady Edith was born
Both heads fell like
Eyes on a crack in the door
Slept on an acre of bones
Slept through Christmas
Slept like a bucket of snow
Papa died Sunday and I understood
Lost in the tall trees I knew well
Stray light finds its way to all of us
Let the hands of the wrong prophets heal me all they should
Let the wine of the poison Jesuses taste good
And all those trees lay down
If you were a bird and fell into my arms
If I wrote your song in stone
If I wore your wings back home
Would the dreams in the backwater drown us far from harm?

I could wear your wings back home
That the freckles in our eyes are mirror images
And when we kiss they're perfectly aligned
And I have to speculate
That God himself did make us into corresponding shapes
Like puzzle pieces from the clay
But it's thoughts like this that catch my troubled head when you're away
When I am missing you to death
When you are out there on the road
For several weeks of shows and when you scan the radio
I hope this song will guide you home
They will see us waving from such great heights
But everything looks perfect from far away
I tried my best to leave
This all on your machine but the persistent beat it
Sounded thin upon listenin'
And that frankly will not fly

And this is guiding you home

Wedding coat  I was waiting there for you
You raised your glass and the scars fell off my heart

There are clouds keeping quiet every night
By the end  we hold something too high to ever come back down
By the end  there's a song we will sing meant for someone else
By the end  we leave somewhere too long to ever wander back
By the end  we give someone too much to ever close their hand
Summer clouds doing good for gold and gray
Tell me where all this love fits in the world
Your brothers left here shaved and crazy
We’ve learned to hide our bottles in the well
Down and down
Once again
Down and down
Gone again

By the rosebush laughing
With bruises on my chin  the time when
We counted every black car passing
Your house beneath the hill
And up until someone caught us in the kitchen
A vision too removed to mention
But please  remember me fondly
I heard from someone you're still pretty
And then they went on to say
That the pearly gates had some eloquent graffiti
Like We'll meet again and Fuck the man
And Tell my mother not to worry
And angels with their great handshakes
Were always done in such a hurry
And please  remember me that Halloween
Making fools of all the neighbors
Our faces painted white
By midnight  we'd forgotten one another
And when the morning came I was ashamed
Only now it seems so silly
That season left the world and then returned
And now you're lit up by the city

So please  remember me mistakenly
In the window of the tallest tower
Calling passers-by but much too high
To see the empty road at happy hour
Gleam and resonate  just like the gates
Around the holy kingdom
With words like Lost and found and Don't look down
And Someone save temptation
And please  remember me as in the dream
We had as rug-burned babies
Among the fallen trees and fast asleep
Beside the lions and the ladies
That called you what you like and even might
Give a gift for your behavior
A fleeting chance to see a trapeze
Swinger high as any savior
And how it lost me all I wanted
Those dogs that love the rain and chasing trains
The colored birds above their running
In circles around the well and where it spells
On the wall behind St. Peter
Who the hell can see forever?
And please  remember me seldomly
In the car behind the carnival
My hand between your knees  you turned from me
And said  The trapeze act was wonderful
But never meant to last  the clown that passed
Saw me just come up with anger
When it filled with circus dogs  the parking lot
Had an element of danger
So please  remember me finally
And all my uphill clawing
My dear  but if I make the pearly gates
I'll do my best to make a drawing
Of God and Lucifer  a boy and girl
An angel kissing on a sinner
A monkey and a man  a marching band
Someone gets to be the fire  someone is the leaves
And someone's walking in the morning light and calling to it cold
Everybody moves beneath the truest stars they know
Jesus and his trophy wives
Are praying for the suicides and the orphans
Save us all from what we want
Beautiful and beaten back to life
Someone has the door to heaven  someone has the lock
Someone has to be the dove when someone is the hawk
And someone's talking to the miles around and hearing them for good
Everybody's branches falling harder than they should
And I know Jesus and his trophy wives
Are praying for the broken to be noticed
Save us all from what we want
Beautiful and beaten back to life
Back to life
The church bell isn't kidding when it cries for you
Nobody looks away when the sun goes down
Thomas County Road takes you where it will
Someone's singing on the far side of other hills
There's nowhere safe to bury all the time I've killed
Nobody looks away when the sun goes down
There's a couple ways to cross Thomas County Line
And I never seem to see around my brother's wife
Nobody looks away when the sun goes down
Thomas County Law's got a crooked tooth
There ain't a mother with a heart less than black and blue
Every dreamer falls asleep in their dancing shoes
Nobody looks away when the sun goes down
Caught up in circles  confusion is nothing new
Flashback  warm nights almost left behind
Suitcase of memories  time after
Sometimes you picture me  I'm walking too far ahead
You're calling to me  I can't hear what you've said
The second hand unwinds
If you're lost  you can look and you will find me
Time after time
Time after time
After my picture fades and darkness has turned to gray
Watching through windows  you're wondering if I'm OK
Secrets stolen from deep inside
The drum beats out of time
If you're lost  you can look and you will find me
Time after time
Time after time
If you're lost  you can look and you will find me

When we were seventeen?
And the mare in the pasture
Pitch black and baring its teeth
I recall the sun in our faces
Stuck and leaning on graces
And being strangers to change
The radio and the bones we found frozen
And all the thorns and the roses
Beneath your windowpane
Now I'm asleep in a car
I mean the world to a potty-mouth girl
And a pretty pair of blue-eyed birds
But I wonder to who
And what it is you're saying today
Now I'm asleep in a car
I mean the world to a potty-mouth girl
And a pretty pair of blue-eyed birds
But I wonder to who
And what it is you're saying today
The tree by the river
When we were seventeen?
The dark canyon road  I was coy in the half moon
Happy just to be with you
See every kiss in the window across the street
I'm in the shade of the dogwood tree
Not the one where you told your name to me
If I could be over you when the sky starts fallin'
Would you be happy under me?
If I could be under you if the Earth was burnin'
Could you be trusted over me?
Spoke to a mother whose baby drowned
Gave me advice or a rumor she once heard
Gave her an ear from the corn we grew
If I could be over you when the sky starts fallin'
Would you be smothered under me?
If I could be under you if the Earth was burnin'
Would you be cryin' over me?

I could hear kids in the yard next door
Cats in the brush when the calendar fell down
Poetry tempered with tragedy
Tempted and pulled when you cry upon my sleeve
If I could be over you when the sky starts fallin'
Would you be happy under me?
If I could be under you if the Earth was burnin'
I killed the last snake that lived in the creek bed
Mother don't worry
I've got some money I saved for the weekend
With that girl who was with me?
When I breathed through your body?
So may the sunrise bring hope
Where it once was forgotten
Sons are like birds
Flying upwards over the mountain
From the bruise of a floor of this prison
All of the fear of the Lord I was given
Mother forget me
Now that the creek drank the cradle you sang to
Mother forgive me
I sold your car for the shoes that I gave you

So may the sunrise bring hope
Where it once was forgotten
Sons could be birds
Taken broken up to the mountain
I've got a coat and some friends on the corner
She's got a garden we're planting together
That the dog had her pups in the pantry?
Blood on the floor and the fleas on their paws
And you cried 'til the morning
So may the sunrise bring hope
Where it once was forgotten
Sons are like birds
 high as heaven
 door was so small
 little babies
 dreamt of that sound
 want me like time
 blooming fruit trees
 lips were still dry
 talking too loud
 closing her eyes
 join me in song
 only their clothes
 take me back home
 saw an ocean
 spoke for us all
 then it was gone
 radio on
Rolling around in the weeds
Finding ourselves broken
Looking for light on the floor
Let's become the lovers we want
Banging our heads in the fog
Flowers will close and open
Life going by like we care
One day it's whatever we made (Whatever we made)
From pieces off the side of a road (Whatever we made)
Marked on our map of what hurts
And what hurts worse
Let's become the lovers we need
Who knew we'd be needing so much
We keep finding ourselves broken
Tossed in the yard with the bones
And let's forget whatever we know
Laying down in our own horizon
Letting that water hit home

She'll wring out her colored hair like a butterfly beaten in a summer rainfall
And then roll on the kitchen floor of some fucker with a pocketful of foreign change
The song of the shepherd's dog
Whoever got that brave?
Wolves in the middle of town and the chapel bell ringing through the windblown trees
She'll wave to the butcher's boy with the parking lot music everybody believes
And then dive like a dying bird at any dude with a dollar at the penny arcade
The song of the shepherd's dog
The waiter and the check or the rooster on a rooftop waitin' for day
And you know what he's going to say
Wolves at the end of the bed and a postcard hidden in her winter clothes
She'll weep in the back of a truck to the traitors only trying to find her bullet hole
And then run down a canopy road to some mother and a baby with a cross to bear
The song of the shepherd's dog
A little brown flea in the bottle of oil for your wooly wild hair
 two shirtsleeves
 hundred more
 wristwatch time
 lemonade
 cigarette
 hundred more
 sword in hand
 broken leg
 hornet nest
 hundred more
 bloodshot eye"
