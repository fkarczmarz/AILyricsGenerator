"The bandana wrapped 'round your head
Ain't nobody triller than me
Ain't nobody triller than Scott
Sundays in the city movin' slow
Thirty-thirty-thirty-five hundred for the coat
Only-only-only real niggas keep you float (Keep you float)
Only trill niggas I know

Gave my niggas all gold chains to remind me of it (Yeah!)

One time for the trill bitches that'll let me touch it (Score!)
(Sundays in the city movin' slow)
(Only trill niggas I know)

Good Lord  I see my good fortune in all these horses

We find ourselves consumed and utterly mesmerized
With a story of a young rebel against the system
Refusing to conform or comply to the ways of authority
He chose the mood of Fuck this shit
At that moment  the one known as Jacques turned to Scott
Chose to jump off his mama porch leading the stampede of lost souls
In the middle of their metamorphosis  not quite through with their journey
Ain't made it to wherever the fuck they gon' be in life
No monogamy  ménage with me
Pornography surrounding me
You get high with me  you come down with me
That's all I need in my fantasy
Give you some of me  you want all of me
And get high with me and come down with me

The story of the bastard was never told
The soul of a bastard was never sold
Will he survive  or will he fold up?
Living like a bronco  lifestyle wild and untamed
Sits at the top  a long list of no named
Misfits can't wait to get a chance to say Fuck you
To the ones who said Fuck you
'Til you doing yo' thing  codeine and cocaine cartels
Who leads the charge of this young mob?
Niggas in the bushes in the farms  might gotta rake up a nigga
I'm way too antsy 'cause my ambition's too frantic
I might need to move to Atlantis 'cause my mind too outlandish
It's the rodeo  time to get started
Houston nigga goin' James Harden
They was wildin' on us niggas in the projects
Wonder why a nigga went cold-hearted
They wanna put my soul up on an auction
But I'ma make 'em take the fall like August
And they gon' vote me right in on my caucus
And I'ma show these niggas how to get lawless
Why your hands out  asking could you hold one?
Who do I owe? Nigga  no one
They bigging you up but you low down
Animated acting frozen
I got porno pics  wish I can post them

But I'm way too young to be the old him

Pray for who lost they fate and died too young
Pray for the ones I hate  the ones I love
Pray for my liver when I'm off in this club
I pray that the demons go away  they hauntin' us
Man  I can't take no more of this lifestyle we been living
Man  I can't take no more of the white powers in position
Gotta grab up J-Will  gotta scoop up J-Rich
Told Chase we ain't going back  you know we gotta hitch
Intoxicated  animated  got me feeling kinda lit
Contemplating fornicating  might as well fuck up some shit
They looking at me way too crazy  got me feeling communist
But I'm just trying to save the throne  pray for BONES  pray for Stix (Just ask the lonely)

Now I'm thinking 'bout this new girl  and she doing pop (Oh-oh)
Wanna know my dick longer than a Pringle box

Tired of seein' these black kids on the face of FOX (Oh-oh)
And fuck CNN  they don't wanna see us win (Say it loud)
I'ma take you from the first to the ninetieth floor
You always told me what I plant  that shit gotta grow (Just ask the lonely)
And anything I detonate  that shit gotta blow
Pray for y'all
No  oh  oh (Woah)
We don't wanna save you on the cover of a carton (We don't wanna save no more)
Underrated is an understatement
They tryna test greatness  a nigga tryna get paid
These niggas fiends watching all of my moves
'Cause the music like crack  got me cooking all day
I'm right here  you know where I stay
And if you don't  then ask your girl  she probably know the way
She like my show lights  she wanna be wifey
She know that if she got me then she gon' be good for life
So I pull out for the climax  faster than a hi-hat
Sorry  baby  I don't play
And if I did  you know my kids would be ballin'
And my daughter gon' never meet a nigga like me
My niggas pull up in that Rolls-Royce
Like they sell that coke  boy  shout out to the Coke Boys
They never pray for us  nobody pray for us
