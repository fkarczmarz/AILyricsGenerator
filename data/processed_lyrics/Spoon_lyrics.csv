lyrics
"I'll be in the back room  drinking my half of the beer
And if you and me's so right
Why's it the same thing every night?
It's just a matter of time
It's almost measurable
Imagination ain't kind on us tonight
You're at your best when you got the guns turned a hundred eighty degrees
And finding out if it adds all up right
We go through all the same lines or sell out to appease
But go to sleep in a bed of lies
I made my own more than once or twice
And now time is my time
Time is my own
And I feel so alive  yet feel so alone
'Cause you know you're the one and that that hasn't changed
Since you were nineteen and still in school waiting on a light
Take care of me tonight
As I walk into Dorian's
Can you see it in my eyes?
My boots are on the mend
And they ain't walking home
Street tar in summer will do a job on your soul
Street tar in summer will do a job on your soul
Ooh
Jenny's watching cover shy
My head's feeling light
I believed that someone'd
Take care of me tonight
Oh just getting out of there
What's going to get me out of this?
I spent the night in the map room
I humanize the vacuum
I believed that someone'd
Take care of me tonight
Oh and as I'm lookin' out at you
On the mend
Now they could lead me home
Street tar in summer
Will play a trick on your soul

Get the stars out your eyes
Come and bring them to me
I been down so long
It's just that
I been down so long
I gotta give me my mine when I can
Can I sit next to you?
Can you sit next to me?
I walk to Memphis alone
'Cause you'd do it for me
All of the kicks from the sticks
All the kicks that we knew
All the kicks from the sticks
All the hits that we took
All the stitches we got

Some day I'm gonna get right (You oughta)

No one's holding me back
Gonna walk a tightrope
Gonna get kicks every night
No one's holding me back
No one's changing my mind
Get the stars out your eyes
Come and sit next to me
Under Tennessee skies
Down on South Front Street
Oh oh oh
I been down so long
Been down but now I gotta get lifted up
Same place where we used to go
And the words get stuck on the tip of my tongue
Do I have to talk you into it?
Do we have to make sense of it?
When I've known you such a long long time
And we never had to act polite
I wanna whisper down the tube
All the words you would never use
Do I have to talk you into it?
Jimmy digs in his long dark coat
Comes up with a tender throat
And he hides it away in Bronson Park
So he can't get to it after dark
Do I have to talk you into it?
Do we have to make sense of it?
They say I better seal you up in wax
So that you're never gonna bite me back
And I can feel it when I'm away
I got to get back tomorrow if not today
To try to talk you into it
Knock knock

All kinds of words you would never use
I was half out of a bag (Oh yeah)
You laughed when I looked back
I thought I'd given up
Now I didn't feel so bad
And then a shock went through me
And then I walked right back (Uh)
Do you want to get understood? (Oh yeah)
Do you run when it's just getting good?
Someone get Popsicles
Someone do something 'bout this heat
'Cause it's late in October
And tar's still melting in the streets
You tiptoe for ages and lose yourself
Do you feel it black and blue?
We don't know why he go so far
And keep on marching along
Beating his drum
Thugs and sticks and bats and balls
For nuclear dicks with dialect drawls
They come from a parking lot town
Where nothing lives in the Sun
Don't make me a target
Don't make me a target
When you reach back in his mind
Feels like he's breaking the law
There's something back there he got
That nobody knows
He never claimed to say what he says
He smells like the inside of closets upstairs
The kind where nobody goes
Don't make me a target
Don't make me a target
Don't make me a target
Don't make me a target

 can you record the talkback
The last one's still stinging
Back of my mind
I feel that phone ringing
And there is no way back from this
Everything hits at once
What we needs is just what we wants
I go to sleep but think that you're next to me
I go to sleep and think you're next to me
Don't make a move
Out in the car
Can feel it calling me
But I can still change my mind tonight
I got to change my mind somehow
I go to sleep alone but think that you're next to me
Everything hits at once
In traffic we become on the way back home
Part of something bigger than just on our own

Somehow this place tastes just like an attack
A hundred-yard-stare of a kiss
They told me stop scouting the field
They told me have a look in commercial appeal
And start getting that hair cut sharp
Sometimes I think that I'll find a love
One that's gonna change my heart
I'll find it in commercial appeal
And then this heartache'll get chased away
I was part-time at the Tasty Prawn
That and moving furniture and cutting lawns
Just holding out for some fate

I come back and I find you never changed
Then I think all the years from your love
I've been dispossessed
Aw ha  from your love
My first caress

Found a way to make a certain change
Coconut milk  coconut water

And planning for the apocalypse

Said I'm gonna get it right one of these days

Bringing about the apocalypse

So I'm gonna stop riding the brakes
But that's all good
It don't get to me none until I go back
Now when I show up
It's gonna hit me good
It's gonna blow my mind

You told me by the neon sign
And then your New York kiss
I knew your New York kiss
Now it's another place

I look past
And I know that it won't get to me at all
Until I go there

Burn so bright (would know if you were here)

The sleep fled from my eyes
Give a thought to the one that you know

If you were here (It felt good to me)
Would you calm me down (Can't see I'm losing it)

Your pipe and slippers set out for you
I know you think that it ain't too far
Felt the need to get up for it
Get free from the middleman
You got no time for the messenger
Got no regard for the thing that you don't understand
You got no fear of the underdog
That's why you will not survive
I want to forget how convention fits
But can I get out from under it?
It can't all be wedding cake
It can't all be boiled away
I try but I can't let go of it
'Cause you don't talk to the water boy
And there's so much you could learn but you don't want to know
You will not back up an inch ever
That's why you will not survive
Yeah!
