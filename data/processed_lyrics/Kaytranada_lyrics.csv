Situations will arise
In our lives
But you got to be smart about it
Celebrations with the guys
I sacrificed
Cause I knew you could not sleep without it
Meanwhile I...
I loved you
You were my girl
You see I...
Thought the world of you
But you're still leavin' baby
You don't have to call
It's okay girl
Cause I'ma be alright tonight
You don't have to call
It's okay girl
Cause I'ma be alright tonight
Aw girl
Your face is sayin' why
Tears in eyes
Should've been more smart about it
Should've cherished me
And again
No story can end without it
Meanwhile I...
I loved you
You were my girl
You see I...
Thought the world of you
But you're still leavin' baby
You don't have to call
It's okay girl
Cause I'ma be alright tonight
You don't have to call
It's okay girl
Cause I'ma be alright tonight

Oh why do I feel the way I do?
Oh why do I feel the way I do?

Oh why do I feel the way I do?
When all I can think about is you
Maybe silly for me to feel
This way about you and her
Cause I know she's been such a good friend
I know she has helped you through
Talkin' late on the phone
Every night you've been callin'
Private moments alone
Could your heart soon be fallin'?
And I know she's a friend
But I can't shake the feeling
That I could be losing your heart
I think I'm jealous of your girlfriend
I think I'm jealous of your girlfriend
She shares a special part of you
You said that she's one who helped you see
How deep you're in love with me
And intentions were not to get in between
But I see possibilities
And you say that you feel
I'm the best thing in your life
And I know it's real
And I see it in your eyes
There's no reason for me
To even feel this way
I know you just enjoy her company
I think I'm jealous of your girlfriend
I think I'm jealous of your girlfriend
She shares a special part of you
I think I'm jealous of your girlfriend
I think I'm jealous of your girlfriend
She shares a special part of you

La-la la la
So long I've been tryin'
To win your love supplyin'
It's been quite a fight
What do you get by holdin'?
Especially when you're open
Holders end up folding
There's a house party that's goin' on tonight
And I'm only invitin' you
There'll be so much we can do
Love has got you changin'
And nothin' is the same and
You was perfect aimin'
And boy his aim is right
Security is the feelin'
Yes you feel this feelin'
That it will tonight
There's a house party that's goin' on tonight
And I'm only invitin' you
There'll be so much we can do
La-la la la
There's a house party that's goin' on tonight
And I'm only invitin' you
There'll be so much we can do
There's a house party that's goin' on tonight
And I'm only invitin' you
There'll be so much we can do
'Til the light
Make it so the party never ends
I'll be yours
You'll be mine
We can make it so the party never ever ends
Cause I'm in love
Baby I wanna make it so the party never ends
We can make it so the party never endsSBTRKT - The Light (Remix)
And I always leave my curtains wide open
And I’m drinking cold coffee
And the cd in my car still plays in me
Tell me am I the only one
Tell me am I the only one
Tell me am I the only one
Tell me am I the only one
It brings me back to you
Brings me back to you

As my leg swells up
Fuck! I bumped my head on em'
You gon' have to knock it off now
Can't wonder if I never seen it comin'
Why my eyes keep lookin' at you?
Tell me when and I'ma run it straight through
The fuck is you talkin' 'bout? I love my chocolate
I thought you knew!
Say I'm kickin' new flavor in ya ears
She wants to come near
See I get too faded when you're near
I'm brown and you're clear
You gon' have to knock it off now
I'ma have to walk you home
When I get home
You gon' have to run it
Runners on your mark
No false start
Ooh I feel it in my chest
I can't even catch my breath
Pour it all along your flesh
Pour it all along your flesh
Keep on counting the ti-i-ime
Been waitin' for so long
Don't let me slip away
Just right before the snow
I'll disappear
Just hold me close so I won't slip away
Am I good enough?
I don't know if I am
Is that good enough?
I don't know
Ooh I feel it in my chest
I can't even catch my breath
Pour it all along your flesh
Pour it all along your flesh
Keep on chasing the si-i-igns
I can make angels out of haze
I can turn water to wine
Yeah! Mmm
Come learn with the bodmon
Switch lanes in the  smoke mad blunts
See you eyein'
What's good to your friend? I'm spyin'
 good and I stop
Ain't no legs up in that
Gettin' wavy 
Goddamn girl
What is you doin'? Your  for later?
Know I'm sayin'? You know
Yeah
Cause you look too fine to be lonely
Can I make you mine? My one and only
I could change your mind with a couple moments
With a couple moments
With a couple moments
With a couple moments
With a couple moments
And a couple more switches
I know what you've been on
You've been sleepin' alone
Know what you need the most
That's someone like me around
I know what you've been on
You've been sleepin' alone
Know what you need the most
That's someone like me around
Baby I want you
Right here with me
Baby I need you
Why can't you see?
Baby I want you
Right here with me
Baby I need you
Why can't you see?
You don't know your time is something that I need to have
Breaking all the rules because I've got to have you bad
You became the reason for the season in my life
Cause
The clock keeps ticking
The sun keeps tickin
I wonder what you're thinkin' from across the room
Could this be the moment that I tell you
You're the only reason that I made it here tonight
This could be the only place I take you on this ride
Would you see me looking? I'm a heartbeat cooking
I'm the secret to this recipe
You don't know your time is something that I need to have
Breaking all the rules because I've got to have you bad
You became the reason for the season in my life
Cause
Now I'll be right with them
My head won't quit it
Said I predict the future and it's very clear
The girl's got a rhythm
Her legs move with 'em
Could you listen? Let me tell you something very clear
You're the only reason that I made it here tonight
Would you see me looking? I'm a heartbeat cooking
I'm the secret to this recipe
You don't know your time is something that I need to have
Breaking all the rules because I've got to have you bad
You became the reason for the season in my life
CauseJanet Jackson - No Sleeep (Remix)
A vision rolling round in my head
But I don't really talk about it
I’m loving what you’re doing to me
And I don't wanna do without it
But I guess I’ll have to wait until that day comes
When I get to be together with you
48 hours in love
It oughta be a weekend marathon
Cause I'ma be the queen of insomnia
Stay wide awake
For every moment we spend together
Cause every second you're away
Feels like forever
When I get to be together with you
When I get to be together with you
Show me how much you are missing me
I'll read between the lines
And I sure hope it rains
Yeah
But where's my ten percent?
You keep on takin' from me
I wonder where you went
You keep on takin' from me
But where's my ten percent?
You keep on takin' from me
Why you tryna lie for them?
Pretending who you are
You're trying way too hard
Ego is not your friend
I only speak the truth
But why you tryna lie for them?
I don't check for these other bitches
You can ask God 'cause that's my witness
You just don't have a clue who to be
I don't check for these other bitches
You can ask God 'cause that's my witness

Gotta give to get  anything
Never an easy bet  nothing is guaranteed
But you can't regret  everything
All we do is run around
And lose our focus  we're all unfocused
(That's all we do  That's all we do)
Just forget about the ones
That we are closest to  closest to
So I  I'm not gonna lead you on
Cause I know it ain't worth it  it ain't worth it
Said I  I don't wanna lead you on
But nobody's perfect  nobody's perfect
It's easy to play dead  no feelings
Fall into my bed  make a scene
Is this what you call sex? It's new to me
Is that what you call wet? I guess we'll see
All we do is run around
And lose our focus  we're all unfocused

I ain't slept in like  forty-eight
I'm back!
I'm here and y'all know they've been waitin' for me
Easy come and easy go  that's why I work 'til midnight
I'm out of town  shorty very dirty on the turnpike
The lawyer said don't smoke
I'm buyin' Nike stock when I see these checks
Motivated by niggas because it's bigger than me
I know that  I might go back to my old shit
Watch your mouth  why you tryna talk like you know somethin'?
My competition is myself  therefore I ain't worried 'bout no one
Not a soul  pot of gold
Lookin' like a stain  niggas'll wet your mug
Leave you behind yourself  you're playin' catch up
Boy  is that your blood?
'Cause I done blew inside my mind since I first wrote a rhyme
They're imposters  steak and lobster
Surf my turf  better wear your chopper
Next to Oprah at the opera  okay

Evolution bе useless

Momma need food
Why do I do the things that I do on your momma’s blouse?
And Daddy ain’t 'round enough
Watching my baby grow up alone in her momma’s house
You’re too busy writing these rhymes
I never lie in the rhymes
I rhyming harder and harder whilst flipping niggas for dimes
And she finer than my exes
Still be here tonight and hope to make it to heaven

And my momma became a reverend
And my momma's house a sanctuary
Be a better father stop calling my women bitches
