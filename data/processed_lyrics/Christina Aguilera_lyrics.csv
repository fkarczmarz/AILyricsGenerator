Told the others (Others)  my lovers (Lovers)
Both past and present tense (Alright)
That every time I see you  everything starts making sense
(Do your thang  honey)
Ain't no other man can stand up next to you
Ain't no other man on the planet does what you do (What you do)

I've opened up  unsure I can trust
My heart and I  we're buried in dust
Free me  free us
You're all I need  when I'm holding you tight
If you walk away  I will suffer tonight
I found a man I can trust
And boy  I believe in us
I am terrified to love for the first time
Can't you see that I'm bound in chains?
I finally found my way
I am bound to you
I am bound to you
So much  so young  I faced on my own
Walls I built up  became my home
I'm strong and I'm sure there's a fire in us
Sweet love  so pure
I catch my breath  we're just one beating heart
And I brace myself
Please  don't tear this apart

Come this far just to fall  fall  oh-oh-oh

And boy  I believe in us
I am terrified to love for the first time
Can't you see that I'm bound in chains?
And finally found my way
I am bound to you

My rings are by Webster  it makes their heads twirl

Breakfast Polo Lounge  then poolside for sure
The Chateau for cocktails  the Courtyard at nine
Dan Tana's for dinner  the Helen's divine

This is a Shark Tale exclusive
Y'all small tuna fish  I'm one big catch (Here we go again)
Y'all small tuna fish  I'm one big catch
You might not ever get rich  ha (Come on)
Let me tell you it's better than digging a ditch (Uh)
There ain't no telling who you might meet
A movie star or maybe a common thief (Yeah)
At the car wash  sing it with me now

Come summer the work gets kind of hard (Come on)
Let me tell you it's always cool  cool
And the boss don't mind sometimes if you're acting like a fool
Work and work  well those cars never stop coming
Work and work my fingers to the bone
Hey  get your car washed today
Fill up and you don't have to pay
Hey  get your car washed today
Fill it up  right away
Work at the car wash
Sharks in the water make they jaws lock
When I swim through the grim I'm too hot
Shark slayer  bow down player
'Cause this right here will be your worst nightmare (Nightmare)
Turn this up and bang it all up in the surface
Work and work  nine to five I gotta keep that fat stack coming
Work and work  no matter how big this shark is
Alright  keep running
Work and work  washing cars ain't no place to be a superstar man
At the car wash  ahhhh
Working at the car wash  yeah
Now keep it coming
You may not ever get rich  but ah
Didn't know it then but now it couldn't be clearer
That I remember being filled with such wonder
Before learning that the world could be harsher
Who you love or the color of your skin
Or the place that you were born and grew up in
Shouldn't decide how you will be treated
'Cause we're all the same when everybody's breathing
Waiting for a change to set us free
Waiting for the day when you can be you and I can be me
Waiting for hope to come around
Waiting for the day when hate is lost and love is found
For all the brave and the souls who went before us
Let 'em know who we are and our choices
And one day we won't have to sing this chorus
Waiting for a change to set us free
Waiting for the day when you can be you and I can be me
Waiting for hope to come around
Waiting for the day when hate is lost and love is found

On a Tuesday when you mentioned that she called you
It wasn't necessary
You run your mouth when it's unnecessary
Maybe I'm too sensitive
And I find the truth scary
But we know what we have together is real special
Can we pause for a moment before this commotion takes over?
Sometimes we can't kick the habit of being dramatic
It's almost becoming a sickness

Let's pause for a moment before this commotion takes over
Sometimes we can't kick the habit of being dramatic
It's almost becoming a sickness

Christina  you nasty (Yeah)

'Cause no one told me
But you deserve to know
That in this world  you are not beholden
You do not owe them
Your body and your soul
All the youth in the world will not save you from growing older
And all the truth in a girl is too precious to be stolen from her
It's just the way it is
And maybe it's never gonna change
But I got a mind to show my strength
And I got a right to speak my mind
And I'm gonna pay for this
They're gonna burn me at the stake
But I got a fire in my veins
I wasn't made to fall in line
Show some skin  make him want you
'Cause God forbid you
Know your own way home
Ask yourself why it matters
Who it flatters
You're more than flesh and bones

After all you put me through
You'd think I'd despise you (Ooh)
'Cause you made me that much stronger
Thinkin' that you were true
Time is up 'cause I've had enough
You were there by my side
Always down for the ride
But your joy ride just came down in flames
After all of the stealing and cheating
You probably think that I hold resentment for you
'Cause if it wasn't for all that you tried to do
I wouldn't know just how capable
I am to pull through

Never saw it coming
All of your backstabbing
Just so you could cash in on a good thing
Before I realized your game
I heard you're goin' 'round
Playin' the victim now
But don't even begin feeling I'm the one to blame
'Cause you dug your own grave
After all of the fights and the lies
Guess you're wanting to hold me
'Cause if it wasn't for all of your torture
I wouldn't know how to be this way now and never back down
Makes me that much stronger
Makes me work a little bit harder
It makes me that much wiser
So thanks for making me a fighter
Made me learn a little bit faster
Made my skin a little bit thicker
Makes me that much smarter
So thanks for making me a fighter
How could this man I thought I knew
Could only see the good in you
Pretended not to see the truth
Through living in denial

Oh-ooh  whoa-oh (Come on  come on  uh)
I feel like I've been locked up tight
For a century of lonely nights
Waiting for someone to release me
You're lickin' your lips and blowin' kisses my way
But that don't mean I'm gonna give it away
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
(My body's sayin'  Let's go)
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

A guy what takes his time  I'll go for any time
I'm a fast movin' gal who likes 'em slow  oh
Got no use for fancy driving  wanna see a guy arriving in low
I'd be satisfied  electrified to know a guy what takes his time
A hurry-up affair  I always give the air
Wouldn't give any rushing gent a smile
I would go for any single who would condescend to linger awhile
What a lullaby would be supplied to have a guy what takes his time  oh
A guy what takes his time  I'd go for any time
A hasty job really spoils a master's touch
I don't like a big commotion  I'm a demon for slow motion or such
Why should I deny that I would die to know a guy who takes his time?
There isn't any fun in getting something done
If you're rushed when you have to make the grade
I can spot an amateur  appreciate a connoisseur in trade  oh-oh
Who would qualify  no alibi  to be the guy who takes his time

My heart is a haunted house
Once you're in you ain't gettin' out
It's the trap you've been waitin' for
No escapin' the way you feel
It's like a dream but you hope it's real
M-m-m-m-m-my heart is a haunted (haunted house)
Watch your step when you walk to me
Careful where your heart treads

For a love to keep me safe and warm
I turn to you
For the strength to be strong
For the will to carry on

'Til I'm breathless  I'm helpless  can't keep my cool
Steals my heart when he takes my hand
And we dance to the rhythm of the band
I feel his fingertips grip my hips
And I slip as we dip into a state of bliss
Mama used to warn me to beware those Latin lovers
She said  I gave my heart too soon
And that's how I became your mother
I said  Ay mama  you seem to forget I'm not in love yet
Sweet talk don't win me over
But I realize  big brown eyes can hypnotize when he says
I am full blood boricua
Reads the tattoo on his arm (Oh)
He tells me  Mami  I need ya
And my heartbeat pumps so strong (Oh)
Getting lost in el ritmo
He whispers  Te quiero  te quiero
I begin to give in with no hesitation
Can't help my infatuation
It's pure infatuation (Hey)

Getting lost in el ritmo
He whispers  Te quiero  te quiero
I begin to give in with no hesitation
Can't help my infatuation
It's pure infatuation
Caught between my mama's words and what I feel inside
I'm wanting to explore his world  but part of me wants to hide
Should I risk it? Can't resist it
This has caught me by surprise
Should I let him take me to Puerto Rico?
I can't hold back no more

Say that you adore me (You adore me)

Once upon a time there was a girl
In her early years she had to learn
How to grow up living in a war that she called home
Never knew just where to turn for shelter from the storm
Hurt me to see the pain across my mother's face
Every time my father's fist would put her in her place
Hoping it would be over soon
And I still remember how you kept me so afraid
Strength is my mother for all the love she gave
And I'm OK
I often wonder why I carry all this guilt
When it's you that helped me put up all these walls I've built
Shadows stir at night through a crack in the door

And I'm OK

All for my family
Reason I'm breathing
Everythingâ€…toâ€…lose
Should I askâ€…myself in the water
What a warriorâ€…would do?
Tell me underneath my armor
Losing is easy
Winning takes bravery
I am a tigerâ€™s fool
Out in the open
No one to save me
The kindest of whispers are cruel
Should I ask myself in the water
What a warrior would do?
Tell me underneath my armor

Must I pretend that I'm someone else for all time?
When will my reflection show who I am inside?
There's a heart that must be free to fly

Why must we all conceal what we think  how we feel?

We've lost it all  the love is gone
She has won  now it's no fun
We've lost it all  the love is gone
And we had magic and this is tragic
You couldn't keep your hands to yourself
I feel like our world's been infected
And somehow  you left me neglected
We've found our lives been changed
Babe  you lost me
We lost ourselves  the love has died
And though we tried  you can't deny
We're left as shells  we lost the fight
And we had magic and this is tragic
You couldn't keep your hands to yourself  oh

How can I ever trust you again?

We've found our lives been changed

I came here tonight
To get shâ€” out of my mind
I'm gonna take what I find
So open the box
And I won't tell you to stop
I don't need to know where you've been
All I need to know is you in
No need for talkin'
So don't even tell me your name
All I need to know is whose place
And let's get walkin' (Ah-ah)
All I wanna do is love your body
All I wanna do is love your body
