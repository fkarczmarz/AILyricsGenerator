lyrics
"'Til his feet became bloody and tired
Her hologram photo stayed near to him
Buried deep in the pits of his heart
The lock of grey hair that she gave to him
Stayed clutched in his fist through the night
One by one
It's your time
Lead them both back to one
The sun has come
May your light lead them both back to one
Indivisible sum
Here's the book now the saga's begun
He wonders if she is the one
(You're the one)
She wonders if he is the one
(You're the one)
Gunshots in hallways unknown
Sat a chained 57821
Sir Greendown told his dear Cindi
Fight like Achilles in Troy
I will show you the ways that I love you
I saved you so you'd save the world
'Cause you're the only one

One by one
It's your time
Lead us all back to one
The sun has come
May your light lead us all back to one
Indivisible sum
Here's the book now the saga's begun
I wonder if I am the one
(You're the one)
I wonder if I am the one
(You're the one)
Anthony Greendown your Cindi Mayweather will always be waiting for you
(You're the one)
Just as sure as the sunlight keeps beaming on your eyes I shall always be waiting for you
Hate all around you  don't have to face it on your own
We will win this fight  let all souls be brave
We'll find a way to heaven  we'll find a way
Hands go up  men go down
Try my luck  stand my ground
Die in church  live in jail
Say her name  twice in hell
Uncle Sam kissed a man
Jim Crow Jesus rose again
I like my woman in the kitchen
I teach my children superstitions
I keep my two guns on my blue nightstand
A pretty young thang  she can wash my clothes
But she'll never ever wear my pants
I pledge allegiance to the flag
Learned the words from my mom and dad
Cross my heart and I hope to die
With a big old piece of American pie

Fallen angels  sing and clap your hands
Don't try to take my country  I will defend my land
I'm American
I'm American
I'm American
Seventy-nine cent to your dollar
All that bullshit from white-collars
You see my color before my vision
Sometimes I wonder if you were blind
Would it help you make a better decision?
I pledge allegiance to the flag
Learned the words from my mom and dad
Cross my heart and I hope to die
With a big old piece of American pie
Fallen angels  sing and clap your hands
(Please sign your name on the dotted line)
Don't try to take my country
I will defend my land
I'm American
I'm American
I'm American
Let me help you in here
Until women can get equal pay for equal work
This is not my America
Until same-gender loving people can be who they are
This is not my America
Until black people can come home from a police stop without being shot in the head
This is not my America  huh
Until poor whites can get a shot at being successful
This is not my America
I can't hear nobody talkin' to me
Fallen angels  sing and clap your hands
(Please sign your name on the dotted line)
Don't try to take my country
I will defend my land
I'm American (Love me  baby)
(Fallen angels)
Until Latinos and Latinas don't have to run from walls
This is not my America
But I tell you today that the devil is a liar
Because it's gon' be my America before it's all over
Your tender eyes fill mine with roses
I drink your wine
And never will my heart dry inside
Or be denied
Walking like a lonely fool in Prague
Singing a love song and the words I wrote
I wrote for two
Gentle as a lullaby at night
I hear you humming private melodies
You're near
Give us the eyes to guide us most when
We have no light to see throughout all our darkest days
And troubled ways
(Meet me at the door by the garden)
(Meet me at the door by the garden)
(Meet me at the door by the garden)
(I'll be waiting there)

Donde el amor no existe (Where there is no love)
Dame en su reino refugio (Give me refuge in your kingdom)
De la oscuridad peligrosa (From the dangerous darkness)
Busco la llamanda amorosa (I'll search for the call of love)
Like a lonely matador at night
Fighting in the darkness for the light
I won't stop until I hear the call of love
You have made a home in my memory
There you will abide for forever
And I will keep you warm in the night
(Like a lonely matador at night)
(Fighting in the darkness for the light)
In the face of an awful danger
He risks his life to save her
Lowly manger
Arms of strangers
To me
Allude me
Pursue me
Truly
I hear echoes of your laughter in the corners of my mind
While I memorize each detail of your intricate design
In your hair there is a symphony
They tell stories of a Neon Valley Street
Where we first met
Now somewhere time pursues us
As we love in Technicolor
But I dwell in silence on your words
Which move me like none other
This time I shall be unafraid
And violence will not move me
This time we will relax
This time we will stay in our movie
I see beyond tomorrow
This life of strife and sorrow
My freedom calls and I must go
I must go
I must go
You can take my heart
'Cause I ain't gonna need it on the run
I've been trying to work it out
But my words fall right apart  baby
I'll leave oh  don't you know
I can't deal with the hurt anymore
Oh baby  don't leave
Baby  don't you know  I can't live without your love
No  I can't sleep
Baby  don't you know  I can't live without your love
I can't eat (oh  no)
Baby  don't you know  I can't live without your love
I can't breathe
Baby  don't you know  I can't live without your love
Autumn  autumn's coming round
And summer's not the same
It's like winter without your smile
I spent some time just thinking to myself
I picked up one of your photos and I put it right back on the shelf

They say love is patient  love is kind
Love ain't never did a thing to mine
Love ain't weak  love is strong
Love be telling my heart don't go
They say love is patient  love is kind
Love ain't never did a thing to mine
Love ain't weak  greater than pride
I can't live without your love
I can't be a day without your smile
You're the one for me but all the while
I just think that we should give all our love
Give love  love  love  love
I can't be a day without your smile
You're the one for me but all the while
I just think that we should give all our love
But being alone's the only way to be
When you step outside
You spend life fighting for your sanity
This is a cold war
You better know what you're fighting for
This is a cold war
Do you know what you're fighting for?
If you want to be free
Below the ground is the only place to be
Cause in this life
You spend time running from depravity
This is a cold war
Do you know what you're fighting for?

Tommy says the children are clouding my head
When everything is wrong I dance inside my mind
That's when I come alive like a schizo running wild
That's when I come alive now let's go wild
We're kicking at your window and keeping you up
And if you come to find me I'll color you red
We're dancing in the dungeon every Monday night
That's when we come alive like a schizo running wild
That's when I come alive now let's go wild
You want to see me crazy taking my meds
And wipe away the noises you think I'm a mess
You better leave the town I'm coming for you
Call the Tommy up and tell him come help you out
I'm getting wild on you you better go and call the law

Handcuffed in a 'bando

Police like a Rambo
You livin' life while I'm walkin' 'round moppin' shit
All I wanted was to break the rules like you
All I wanted was someone to love me too
Black Waldo dancin' with the thick brows
We was both runnin' naked at the luau
'Member when they told you I was too black for ya?
And now my black poppin' like a bra-strap on ya
But all I really ever felt was stressed out

Water  wisdom  tightrope  vision
(Oh these dreams are forever)
Insight  stronghold  heartless  ice cold
(If you leave now or never)
Mystery  mastery (mastery)  solar (solar)  battery
Some will pull the gun because they want to be stars
Snatching up your life into the blink of an eye
And if you see your cloning on a street walking by
Keep a running for your life cause only one will survive
(Oh these dreams are forever)
War is in the street and it's an eye for an eye
Run on for your life or you can dance you can die
(If you leave now or never)
She's praying in the sand like she's the last samurai
It's a stick up stick up and a pick up pick up
Telling lies and telling lies will put your face on fire
Run and tell your friends to never dream  never win
Ghettos keep a crying out to streets full of zombies
Kids are killing kids and then the kids join the army
Rising and a waking  yes sir here comes the sun
March into the war and with the kick of the drum
The wiser simians have got the bombs and the guns
So you might as well keep dancing if you're not gonna run

(Forever  forever  forever  forever)
A long long way to find the one
We'll keep on dancing till she comes
These dreams are forever
Oh these dreams are forever
(Forever  forever  forever  forever)
And if you wanna wake the sun
Just keep on marching to the drums
These dreams are forever
Oh these dreams are forever
Now I'm not saying it's better to bailar
You can pull the trigger or you can build you an ark
My words are rather kind you keep them held in contempt
Looking for a nine and then a droid you can tempt
Zombie  zombie  zombie  where do dreams come from?
A little bird is chirping and she's singing a song
She's shaking em and waking em and giving em mas
As the clock tick tocks and the bodies drop
I'm gonna lay myself so far way down right in your chops
Modern day example of the wolf vs flock
Freedom necessary and it's by any means
Frozen they were stolen all the kings and queens
Sudanese and Congolese who put the roll in the rock
From here to Sudan  Metropolis to Iraq
It's a minute to the dawn and yet the sun ain't back
It's still a war in all the streets and yes freaks will dance or die
(Forever  forever  forever  forever)
A long long way to find the one
We'll keep on dancing till she comes
These dreams are forever
Oh these dreams are forever
(Forever  forever  forever  forever)
And if you wanna wake the sun
Just keep on marching to the drums
These dreams are forever
Oh these dreams are forever
Angel  blossom  gunshot  dodging
Dream  bright  beat  light
Breathe  live  help  give
Focus  trance  wake up  dance!
I'm praying for the man sitting without much time
May he understand the clock will never rewind
Wisen him and sharpen him and give him a motto
Hate no more  said he must hate no more
You see the daylight comes into the kingdom
But the kingdom's full of ignorant men
Just keep rebelling away  you gotta dream it away
Because the weatherman you seein' ain't creating the weather
This man wants to see a jubilation
And that man wants us in emancipation
And then there is the man who wants a stronger nation
But you see we really got to and I think that we ought to
Protect the mind from degradation
Sow in the seeds of education
They run from us  are we that dangerous?
There's a war in all the streets and yes the freaks must dance or die!
(Forever  forever  forever  forever)
A long long way to find the one
We'll keep on dancing till she comes
These dreams are forever
Oh these dreams are forever
(Forever  forever  forever  forever)
And if you wanna wake the sun
Just keep on marching to the drums
These dreams are forever
If you look closer  you'll recognize
I'm not that special  I'm broke inside
Crashin' slowly  the bugs are in me
Dirty computer  breakin' down
Pickin' my face up off the ground
I'll love you in this space and time
'Cause baby  all I'll ever be
Is your dirty computer
Dirty computer
Searchin' for someone to fix my drive
Text message God up in the sky
Oh  can't You see that it's only me?

 Jamanati still jammin'

 made out like a bandit
 pan right for the angle
 we gave you birth
 we gave you Earth
 don't make it worse
 what's it worth?
 then fled to Paris
 spoke truth to power?
 paint the city pink
 just in case the world end
 down dog
 let the vagina have a monologue
 I fold 'em like origami
 baby? This a tsunami
 would anybody doubt it?

Wake you up like sunrise on the backs of your thighs
I'm gonna pray you this prayer
That I keep in my mind as a lovely reminder
Even though you tell me you love me
I'm afraid that you just love my disguise
Taste my fears and light your candle to my raging fire
Of broken desire
But don't judge me
I know I got issues  but they drown when I kiss you
Don't judge me
Baptize me in your ocean  recognize my devotion
The water's perfectly blue
Let's reintroduce ourselves from a free point of view
If I'm gon' sin  it's with you

Even though you tell me you love me

Even though you say that you love me

Right there
If I kissed you  would you think I was lonely?

Come  let me kiss you right there
You say that love me (You tell me you love me)
As she sits alone and drinks her wine
Every man just wants to pass her by
In hopes that he can catch her eye
That glow thatâs in her eye
Gives you visions in your mind
Sheâs from another space and time
Thatâs when youâll know youâre hypnotized
Her intoxicating will not be denied
And when you touch her glove
She then becomes your drug
You fall so deep in love with the girl
Sheâs got Dorothy Dandridge eyes
Sheâs got Dorothy Dandridge eyes
Like a rare Picasso or Monet
The kind of beauty studied every day
Every woman wants her grace and style
But no one can replicate her smile
That glow thatâs in her eyes
Gives you visions in your mind
Sheâs from another space and time
Thatâs when youâll know youâre hypnotized
And her intoxicating will not be denied

(She's got Dorothy's eyes)
The purple glow of distant stars
The blue shine of black metal
Red rose petals falling slowly through the sunny air
Electric lady  you're a star
You got a classic kind of crazy
But you know just who you are
You got the look the Gods agree they wanna see
All the birds and the bees
Dancing with the freaks in the trees
And watch the water turn to wine
Out in space and out your mind
Ooh  shock me one good time
Electric Lady  get way down
Cause tonight we gon' do what we want to
Electric Lady  get way down

Gloss on her lips

Once you see her face  her eyes  you'll remember
And she'll have you falling harder than a Sunday in September
Whether in Savannah  K-Kansas or in Atlanta
She'll walk in any room  have you raising up your antennas
She can fly you straight to the moon or to the ghettos
Wearing tennis shoes or in flats or in stilettos
Illuminating all that she touches  eye on the sparrow
A modern day Joan of her Arc or Mia Farrow
Classy  sassy  put you in a razzle-dazzy
Her magnetic energy will have you coming home like Lassie
Electro-  sophisti-  funky  lady
We the kind of girls who ain't afraid to get down
Electric ladies go on and scream out loud
Electric Lady  get way down
Cause tonight we gon' do what we want to

You melt my wings and call it fun
I-I should run
Faster and faster I should run
Faster and faster from your arms
Faster and faster I should run
Faster and faster from your arms

We say a woman came to change the face of each and every room
When I was just a baby my momma dropped out of school
It was only second semester the baby due
The daddy he was gone off to college he couldnât wait
Only just a teen with dreams to be on TV
And living with a mom and my grandma who used to feed me
We would move around in the city place to place
The landlord come for the rent face to face
Her eyes too heavy from working nights as a janitor
Sheâd keep it to herself and nobody could understand her
But even when she thought that she couldnât she carried on
She couldnât imagine both of her daughters here all alone
Before the tuxedos and black and white every day
I used to watch my momma get down on her knees and pray
Sheâs the reason that Iâm even writing this song

I wanna
Give it to you
I am sharper than a razor
Eyes made of lasers
Bolder than the truth
They want me locked up in the system
'Cause I'm on a mission
Blame it on my youth
Too long  I've been out here on my own
Now I'm 'bout to bring it home
Like a rolling stone
I ain't never been afraid to die
Look a man in the eye
I come to give you what you love
Itâs time to give you what you love
Iâma give you what you love
Giving you what you love
I am sharper than a switchblade
First and last of what God made and that's the truth
But man  keep on tryin' to hold me back
While another chicken head come home to roost
Too strong  try to do me wrong
And the last one standin' will order and command you to dance
Oh  dance
Run tell your preacher and your teacher

Two dimes walked up in the buildin'
Tall and concealin'  wearin' fancy things
Chopped up with a knife  hammered like a screw
When they walked in the room we didn't know what to do
One looked at me and I looked back
She said  Can you tell me where the party's at? (Tell me where the party at)
She followed me back to the lobby
Yeah  she was lookin' at me for some undercover love
Wearin' fancy things
Oh  we didnât know what to do
Baby  ooh
Baby  ooh
Baby  ohh
Bombs on the floor
Smoke in the mirror
Girls get their hair done
In electric jungles
Drunk man comes
Stopping the limo
He said he got a gun
But we keep on jamming on
Here come the sirens
Only to dance
With the little girls on the corner
There's a war in the streets
Nobody speaks
And now a boy laying on the ground
Now what the hell
Hell you talking 'bout?

A land called foolish pride
Where the man is always right
He hates to talk but loves to fight
Is that all right?
On real cold days
He loans us lots of hate
But he says that we must pay
To take it all away
Is that okay?
But I'm asking you will you stay with me
In this land where we are free
And I know its rough and you've had enough
But one day we'll be happy
And when I look into the future
I see danger in its eyes
Hearts of hatred rule the land
While love is left aside
Killing plagues the citizens
While music slowly dies

And nobody questions why
Cause they're too scared to stop the man
But I'm asking you will you stay with me
In this land where we are free
And I know its rough and you've had enough
But one day we'll be happy
Cause when I look into the future
I see danger in its eyes
Babies die before they're born
And no one ever smiles

Keep back kid now corporate thug
Get away now they tryna steal your soul
And when the world just treats you wrong

No need to pack a bag
Who put your life in the danger zone?
You running dropping like a rolling stone
No time to pack a bag
You just can't stop your hurt from hanging on
The old man dies and then a baby's born
And when the world just treats you wrong
Just come with us and we'll take you home
(Smells like love to me)
Where all the lonely droids and lovers have their wildest dreams
The golden door of our emotions opens here
We're all virgins to the joys of loving without fear
Come sweet love
Take my hand
Follow me
Just let me be
Come sweet love
Just take my hand
Follow me
Let us be
Yeah...
I remember one of the regulars

Confusion is a walrus
Yet thereâs still so much left for us to learn
I hear the riot community approaching
It's falling from my window
And in the corners of my mind
I hope that I'll get to see you again
La da di da di da di da di my friend
I hear the colors in the flowers
Just like the candle snuffed at dawn
La da die da die da die da die
Suffering in sinking sand
All the hurt
So much hurt

We got the drums so tight
Baby  here comes your freedom song
Too strong  we movin' on
Baby  this melody will show you another way
Been 'droids for far too long
Come home and sing yo' song
But you gotta testify  because the booty don't lie
Yeah  yeah  let's flip it
I don't think they understand what I'm trying to say
Are we a lost generation of our people?
Add us to equations but they'll never make us equal
She who writes the movie owns the script and the sequel
So why ain't the stealing of my rights made illegal?
They keep us underground workin' hard for the greedy
But when it's time pay they turn around and call us needy

Gimme back my pyramid  I'm trying to free Kansas City
Mixing masterminds like your name Bernie Grundman
Well I'ma keep leadin' like a young Harriet Tubman
You can take my wings but I'm still gonna fly
And even when you edit me the booty don't lie
Yeah  I'ma keep sangin'  I'ma keep writin' songs
I'm tired of Marvin askin' me What's Going On?
March through the streets 'cause I'm willin' and I'm able
Categorize me  I defy every label

We rising up now  you gotta deal you gotta cope
Will you be electric sheep? Electric ladies  will you sleep?
My soul is looking for a word from God
I'm packing my space suit
And I'm taking my shit and moving to the moon
Where there no rules
Have you heard the news?
You've got the right to choose
I tried and heard the pride
But the way the stars look into my eyes tonight
To get lost in your thoughts
Is a very very complex thought
And the things that you thought are surprising
It's the way you believe
That becomes the very thing you see
Take a ride in the sky
It's just calling
But all your friends are gone
And the trees will burn while the comets play on
I wanna fly
Fly to the stars
Sally won't you
I know you love me but I'm still goin' (x3)
I got to make my peace
I got to move on
Have you heard the news?
You got the right to choose
There's some amazing news
You got the right to choose
Real love
I wanna feel the real love
Wanna know what it really means to be in love
Sometimes I just wanna get away
A rarely painted masterpiece
A place few people go or ever know
An underwater rocket love
Exactly what I'm searching for
If you're brave enough to go
Tell me so...
Say you'll go to nirvana
Will you leave Samsara?
In the words of Dhammapada
Who will lead? Who will follow?
Our love will sail in this ark
The world could end outside our window
Let's find forever
And write our name in fire on each other's hearts
Love is not a fantasy
A haiku written in Japanese
A word too often used but not believed
Witness the interaction of
Time erodes the shore but not our love

I live my life on a TV screen

Babies with babies  and their tears keep burning

Are we really living  or just walking dead now?

The way we live  the way we die
What a tragedy  I'm so terrified
Daydreamers please wake up
We can't sleep no more

Let's leave in an hour
Meet me at the tower
Ride your horse
Here the dolphins walk like men
Here the cyborgs have a plan
Sir Greendown
Let's leave in an hour
Meet me at the tower
While the dogs lap around the can
No life jacket on their backs
Daughters sharpen their knives and they hunt for food
Others watch their children grow
Mothers going to work and they shake the hands
Of a corporate tycoon's ghost
What if I lose?
Is what I think to myself
I'm fine in my shell
I'm a gift and a curse to the wilderness
When the leaves only turn to brown (Ah-ah)
The birds fly high and they wink at all
Of the grandmothers on the ground (Ah-ah)
The rain pours down in the village dens
My cousins fetch for lunch (Ah-ah)
While I sit in my room writing letters to
My church and things and such (Ah-ah)

And when you tip it on the scene
'Cause they can't tip on the scene

You gotta keep your balance or you fall into the gap
Daddy Fat Sax will fold you and your MacBook

Sorta like a thong in an ass crack

I tip on alligators
And little rattlesnakers
But I'm another flavor
Something like a terminator
Ain't no equivocating
I fight for what I believe
Why you talkin' 'bout it?
J-j-just talkin' 'bout it
Some callin' me a sinner
Some callin' me a winner
I'm callin' you to dinner

You can rock or you can leave

I wish the tears would roll back in my eyes
Will I rise?
If loving you means fighting till the end
And if tomorrow shall come to me
I'll count your every kiss as a victory
'Cause to be victorious
You must find glory in the little things
To be victorious
You must find glory in the little things
Surrounded by the schemes and senseless lies
To win you'll have to lose all the things you know
Trying to light the fire deep inside
Father take all the fears and sorrow from my life
Cause when the rain falls
My seed will grow
I'll be further to my dreams tomorrow

 âround Autumn time
 I feel the sun
 come back to me
 the way you clapped your hands
 but love finally won
 I've been denied
 a time alone
 locked in your arms
 stays haunting on me
 thought we owned the sun
 our plan to run
 and your utter nonsense
 but it felt so fun
 alright (Itâs alright! Itâs alright!)
 France (We taught poets how to dance)
Then we all just walk off in the rain
Even angels fight
And our wings just keep getting in the way
Babe I can't wait
Our loveâs so strong
So deep in my heart
Yeah I've been feeling it all day long
Baby donât wait
Loveâs too strong
What an Experience (can you feel it feel it feel it?)
Put your hand over my heart
The world's just made to fade
And all the parties some day blow away
Itâs funny how they come back with a song
Yeah baby I can't wait
This love is too strong
I can feel it all over
Oh baby I

Love's too strong

I wander off into a land
There's a world inside
Where dreamers meet each other
Once you go it's hard to come back
Let me paint your canvas as you dance
Dance in the trees
Paint mysteries
The magnificent droid plays there
Your magic mind
Makes love to mine
Take me back to Wondaland
I gotta get back to Wondaland
Take me back to Wondaland
She thinks she left her underpants

The music floats you gently on your toes
Don't you freak and hide
Don't resist
The fairygods will have a fit
We should dance
