lyrics
" ooh no
 there's none too steep
 there's no crime
 don't be blind
 ooh (Ooh)
 clear your head
 it's yours to keep
 ooh
 there's no crime
 and intertwine
 don't be blind
 there's no crime
 and intertwine
 don't be blind
Hadn’t seen the light so long
Thought I lost my fight
Couldn’t find my way back home
And I found the light stepping out of me
I was bound  and tied
Waiting for daylight and I…
Bang my head against the wall
Though I feel light headed  now I know I will not fall
I will rise above it all
Found what I was searching for
Though I feel light headed
I should have failed  and nailed the floor
Instead I rose above it all
Bang my head against the wall
(Bang my head against the wall)
(Bang my head against the wall)
(Bang my head against the wall)
(Bang my head against the wall)

(ZooVier  1738)
It’s so hard to live your life when you gave it up  baby
For the fans and the cameras
Different places  adventures
And the stress that it brings  start to wonder if it’s worth it
I live life like it’s perfect
My children are smiling and that makes me happy
Cause how I was living  I swear it had me
Bouncing my head off the wall
I came too far up  I cannot fall
Having fun  I don’t know about y'all
It’s ZooVier from ZooGang  I’m the boss
For my kids  give my life with no thought
Bang your head against the wall
You will rise above it all
You’ll find what you’re searching for
And you may feel light headed
You think you’re gonna hit the floor
Instead you rise above it all
Bang your head against the wall
(Bang my head against the wall)
(Bang my head against the wall)

Hadn't seen the light so long
Thought I lost my fight
Couldn't find my way back home
And I felt the light stepping out of me
I was bound  and tired
Bang my head against the wall
Though I felt light headed  now I know I will not fall
I will rise above it all
Found what I was searching for
Though I felt light headed
I should have failed  and nailed the floor
Instead I rose above it all
Bang my head against the wall
Instead I rose above it all
Bang my head against the wall
When you think of giving up  just know
You might think you're dying but you won't
And you feel the light stepping out of you
But when you think of giving up  don't

We don't stray from anyone
'Cause you and I know better
They don't know we have eyes like mirrors
We don't need any armor
'Cause we got spirit and that's enough
So let 'em say whatever

And I run  I run through the battle

We'll find a way  we'll find a way to keep the cold night

The hunger satisfied

We'll never know  we'll never know what stands behind the door
But I got a feeling it's a feeling that's worth dying for
Just close your eyes and hold your breath because it feels right
We'll keep it moving till we make it to the other side
And let's enjoy the ride
We're burning up

Leggo
Ella no es fácil de alcanzar
Llega la noche y ella sabe conmigo cómo se debe comportar
Todos la miran como baila
Y me envidian porque quieren mi lugar
Mira no más como se mueve
Hay gente mirando y se atreve
Quiere esas cosas que no se deben y que me rebele
Me la estoy jugando para que te quedes
Tú manipulándome con tus poderes
Esa actitud está matándome
Yo sé que algo me inventaré
Para que te quedes

I wonder if it shows
Head underwater  now I can't breathe
It never felt so good
'Cause I can feel it comin' over me
I wouldn't stop it if I could
When love takes over  yeah
You know you can't deny
When love takes over  yeah
'Cause somethin' is here tonight
Give me a reason  I gotta know
Do you feel it too?
Can't you see me here on overload?
Lookin' out for you to hold my hand
It feels like I could fall
Now love me right like I know you can
We could lose it all

Raindrops on my window pane
Streetlights  street life
Hot blood burning in my veins
History won't drag me down
It's buried six feet underground
I've got no use for yesterday
I'm gonna live  I'm gonna love right now
And if tomorrow never comes
I'm gonna stay forever young
These lungs of mine were made to scream and shout
It seems like trouble's on the way
I'm gonna live  I'm gonna love right now
It's singing oh  oh oh oh
I've got no use for yesterday

I gotta get right and get it moving
White lies left me snowblind

It's singing oh  oh oh oh"
