lyrics
"Tried to turn my friends into friends of the past
But you didn't even care about me like that
Ain’t goodbye but it's good riddance
You got fifteen minutes
Hope you enjoy your fifteen minutes
I'm not innocent
I know I'm a headache but I'm working on it
It should be an honor
I even had the time to bother
But this is where the sand in the hourglass ends
Ain't goodbye but it's good riddance
You got fifteen minutes
Hope you enjoy your fifteen minutes

Crying in Malibu
Ain't goodbye but it’s good riddance (Good riddance)
You got fifteen minutes
Hope you enjoy your fifteen minutes
Just five years a bleeder  student and a teacher
Far from innocent  what the fuck's consent?
Numbers told you not to  but that didn't stop you
Finally twenty-nine
Funny  just like you were at the time
Thought it was a teenage dream  just a fantasy
But was it yours or was it mine?
Seventeen  twenty-nine
Oh-oh-oh  oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Seventeen  twenty-nine
Had me in your grip  went beautifully with
All my daddy issues and this shit continues
I see you're quite the collector
Yeah  you're twelve years her elder
Maybe now it doesn't matter
But I know fucking better
Now I know fucking better 'cause I'm

Seventeen would never cross my mind
Thought it was a teenage dream  a fantasy
But it was yours  it wasn't mine
Seventeen  twenty-nine
I tried to talk to my piano
I tried to talk to my guitar
Talked to my imagination
Confided into alcohol
I tried and tried and tried some more
Told secrets 'til my voice was sore
Tired of empty conversation
'Cause no one hears me anymore
A hundred million stories
And a hundred million songs
I feel stupid when I sing
Nobody's listening to me
Nobody's listening
I talk to shooting stars
But they always get it wrong
I feel stupid when I pray
So  why am I praying anyway?
If nobody's listening
Anyone  please send me anyone
Lord  is there anyone?
I need someone  oh
Anyone  please send me anyone
Lord  is there anyone?
I need someone

Nobody's listening
I talk to shooting stars
But they always get it wrong
I feel stupid when I pray

Lord  is there anyone?
I need someone  oh
Anyone  please send me anyone
I need someone
A hundred million stories
And a hundred million songs
I feel stupid when I sing
Nobody's listening to me
If I had it my way  I would turn you out
And if my body had a say  I would come again
Scared of what I might say  'cause I'm at the edge
And our eyes are crossing paths across the room
There's only one thing left for us to do
You can touch me with slow hands
Dreamland  take me there 'cause I want your sex
If my body had a say  I wouldn't turn away
Just what I want to
If I had it my way  I would take the lead
And if I had it my way  I would take you deep
If my body had a say  I'd get it off my chest
Show you all the red lace underneath this dress
And our eyes are crossing paths across the room (Ooh)

It's driving me crazy  crazy
You're taking me to new places
And I pretend I'm not anxious  but oh
You're driving me crazy  crazy
I was walking down this broken road
I was stranded  I was all alone
Always played it safe when it came to love
Until you came and picked me up
I've been waitin' all night  lookin' for your headlights
I know that we're strangers  but I'll leave it all for you
Go anywhere you wanna go

Can’t hold it back anymore
Let it go  let it go
Turn my back and slam the door
The snow glows white on the mountain tonight
Not a footprint to be seen
A kingdom of isolation
And it looks like I'm the queen
The wind is howling like the swirling storm inside
Couldn’t keep it in  Heaven knows I tried
Don’t let them in  don’t let them see
Be the good girl you always have to be
Well  now they know
Let it go  let it go

The cold never bothered me anyway
Standing frozen in the life I’ve chosen

Buried in the snow

He felt just like you
His arms  his lips
His promises were just as smooth
His grip  it fit  though I admit that
Only you could make me feel the way you do
Though  you know love is blind
And he just caught my eye
You know me and honestly I'm better without ya
Don't you got me checkin' on my phone by the hour
Baby  I'm hopin' and prayin'
My knees weak  I'm shakin'
'Cause you know that I always needed savin'
Now I'm fuckin' lonely 'cause you didn't want me
Tryin' to show me  that you didn't own me
But all you do is leave me fuckin' lonely
Knees on the concrete  cut up and bleedin'
For no goddamn reason
But all you do is leave me fuckin' lonely
Leave me fuckin' lonely
Leave me fuckin' lonely
Leave me fuckin' lonely

Bitch  can't even say I miss you back over the fuckin' text
Every time you slept over my pad  you over fuckin' slept
Toni Braxton told me breathe again  don't hold no fuckin' breath
Gave your ass directions to my heart and your ass busted left
Climbin' up the money tree  the tree without the lover's nest
'Cause lovebirds are some busy bees
You fuck around  get stung again
And you didn't leave your underwear
'Cause she didn't arrive in no underwear
I can't see the forest from the tree  the water from the sea
And I was startin' to believe  but it's a forest full of dreams
I smoke bars full of weed and call it what I see
And when you leave  I hope you know you bring
This forest to his leaves
I'm fuckin' lonely  yeah
Lonely
Leave me fuckin' lonely
Leave me fuckin' lonely
I was livin' as a prisoner inside my own mind
And there was a time
Where the cat and mouse tried to make me Barbie-sized
And I obliged
Pulled leather over my eyes in a hundred-degree heat
People out here gettin' fired for chocolate in the backseat (It's a true story)
People always hung around who only want it skin-deep
And now I'm sayin' no more melon cakеs on birthdays
No more barricades in doorways
Finally get to do things my way
You could find mе starvin' for attention most days
Finally get to do things my way
No more melon cake
There was a time

Tears in our eyes from holding too tight
Waiting till the demons come

That makеs you so selective
I'm not afraid of natural disastеrs
But I'm so scared if I undress that you won't love me after

And I've been to hell and back
But this isn't that
'Cause when you say nothing
It's much worse than things I've overcome and
This hurts harder than my time in heaven
You don't think I see
The way
You don't look at me
The way you don't look at me
The way you don't look at me
Yeah  I've been to hell and back
But this isn't that
As a matter of fact
As a matter of fact
'Cause when you say nothing (Ahh)
It's much worse than things I've overcome and (Ahh)
This hurts harder than my time in heaven (Ahh)
You don't think I see (Ahh)
The way
So afraid to tell the world what I've got to say
To let you know
I'm exactly where I'm supposed to be now
Gonna let the light shine on me
Now I've found who I am
There's no way to hold it in
No more hiding who I wanna be
This is me
Do you know what it's like to feel so in the dark?
To dream about a life where you're the shining star?
Even though it seems like it's too far away
I'm exactly where I'm supposed to be now
Gonna let the light shine on me
Now I've found who I am
There's no way to hold it in
No more hiding who I wanna be
This is me

You're the voice I hear inside my head
The reason that I'm singin'
You're the missing piece I need
The song inside of me
I'm exactly where I'm supposed to be now
Gonna let the light shine on me
Now I've found who I am (Yeah)
There's no way to hold it in
This is me
You're the missing piece I need
The song inside of me
You're the voice I hear inside my head
The reason that I'm singin'
Now I've found who I am
There's no way to hold it in
No more hiding who I wanna be
I gotta get this off my chest to let it go
I need to take back the light inside you stole
All the pain and the truth
I wear like a battle wound
I was broken and bruised
'Cause all the pain and the truth
I wear like a battle wound
I'm not broken or bruised

There's a part of me I can't get back
A little girl grew up too fast
Now I'm taking back my life today
Nothing left that you can say
'Cause you were never gonna take the blame anyway
The hell was I doing in the past?
Now that I've learned all about you
A love just like ours wouldn't last
I won't fall for your games
So don't hate me when I say
That you don't do it for me anymore
Money won't pay for your problems
You gotta fix them yourself
Vices and pity won't solve 'em
Stop feeling bad for yourself
I won't fall for your games
So don't hate me when I say
That you don't do it for me anymore

I'm sorry for honesty
I'm sorry for honesty
I'm well aware I lie to you when I lie with you
You don't do it for me anymore
You don't do it for me anymore"
