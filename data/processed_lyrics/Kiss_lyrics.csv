lyrics
"It must have been a bitch while I was gone
You mind if I sit down for a while?
You'll reacquaint yourself with my style
It must have been a bitch while I was gone
All this time you put up a fear
For a hundred thousand years
I'm sorry to have taken so long
It must have been a bitch while I was gone
All this time you put up a fear
For a hundred thousand years
I think I'm going out of my head
I'm sorry to have taken so long
It must have been a bitch while I was gone
It's on a piece of plastic film
And I been growing funny flowers
Outside of my little window sill
But don't you know I'm a 2 000 man
And my kids  they just don't understand me at all
You know  my wife still respects me
Even though I really misuse her
I am having an affair
With a random computer
But don't you know I'm a 2 000 man
And my kids  they just don't understand me at all
Oh daddy  proud of your planet
Oh mommy  proud of your sun
Oh daddy  proud of your planet
Oh mommy  proud of your sun
You might also likeOh daddy  your brain's still flashing
Like they did when you were young
Or did they come down crashing
Seein' all the things you'd done
Spacing out and having fun
Oh daddy  proud of your planet
Oh mommy  proud of your sun
Oh daddy  proud of your planet
Oh mommy  proud of your sun
Oh daddy  your brain's still flashing
Like they did when you were young
Or did they come down crashing
Seein' all the things you'd done
Spacing out and having fun
But don't you know I'm a 2 000 man
And my kids  they just don't understand me at all
But don't you know I'm a 2 000 man
And my kids  they just don't understand me at all
Understand me
U-understand me
U-understand me  now understand me
But don't you know I'm a 2 000 man
And my kids  they just don't understand me at all
But don't you know I'm a 2 000 man
And my kids  they just don't understand me at all
I'm a 2 000 man
I'm a 2 000 man
I'm a 2 000 man
But I can't come home right now
Me and the boys are playing
And we just can't find the sound
Just a few more hours
And I'll be right home to you
I think I hear them calling
You say you feel so empty
That our house just ain't a home
And I'm always somewhere else
And you're always there alone
Just a few more hours
And I'll be right home to you
I think I hear them calling

Alright
I need some fuel to build a fire
You know it'll always win
Cold gin time again
You know it's the only thing

Around the corner at the liquor store
To get me back on my feet again

Here's a little song for everybody out there

They try to tell us we don't belong
These are my people and this is my crowd
They say they can break you again and again

And they try to tell us that we don't belong
Yeah
And nobody's gonna change me
Running from the day
Hiding from tomorrow
Nothing left to say
Victims of the moment
Future deep in doubt
Living in a whisper
Till we start to shout
(Ooh) We're creatures of the night (Ah)
(Ooh) We're creatures of the night (Ah)
Breathing in the madness
Spitting out the lies
Searching for an answer
Keep your alibis
Don't know where we're going
Just know where we've been
Remember when the clock strikes twelve
The losers always win

Ready for the fight
Howling in the shadows

I'm a Capricorn and she's a Cancer
She saw my picture in a music magazine
When she met me  said she'd get me
Touched her hips and told me that she'd let me
'Cause I just can't wait
Lady  won't you take me down on my knees
You can do what you please
C'mon and love me
I'm a man  I'm no baby
And you're looking every inch a lady
You're good looking  and you're looking like you should be good
You were distant  now you're nearer
I can feel your face inside the mirror
'Cause I just can't wait
Lady  won't you take me down to my knees
You can do what you please

President Ford says that he's disappointed
With Congress's performance
Was reported dead at the scene of
A head-on collision on Grand Avenue this morning
He was reportedly driving on the wrong side of the boulevard When he struck a delivery truck
And was catapulted through the windshield of his car
The driver of the truck is reported to be uninjured
The identities of both men are being withheld by local police
County legislatures today are expected to rally
To the aid of striking longshoremen
In hopes of ending the nine-month deadlock...
..Roll all night and party every day
I wanna rock and roll all night
And party every day...
I feel uptight on a Saturday night
I got to
Get up!

Loves to keep me burning

Calls me Sugar Daddy
She knows she's-a got me by the balls - ow!
I didn't mean to break your heart
And find you waiting up by the light of day
There's a lot I want to tell you
But I don't know where to start
And I don't know what I'd do if you walked away
I just got lost along the way
But every time I look at you
And every time I hold you
Because you're everything to me

There's no denying when I look in your eyes  girl  I'm out of my head over you
I lived so long believin' all love is blind
But everything about you is tellin' me this time
It's forever  this time I know  and there's no doubt in my mind
I hear the echo of a promise I made
When you're strong  you can stand on your own
Those words grow distant as I look at your face
No  I don't want to go it alone
I never thought I'd lay my heart on the line
But everything about you is telling me this time
It's forever  this time I know  and there's no doubt in my mind

Out of time  no more waiting for you
Now the hurting is through and a new day starts
And I feel a change in my life
I sailed into dark and endless nights
And made it alive
Everybody's got a reason to live  baby
Everybody's got a dream and a hunger inside
Everybody's got a reason to live
But it can't be your love
Out of touch with myself for so long

And she asked me if I wanted to dance
She looked kinda nice
And so I said I might take a chance
When we danced  she held me tight
And when I walked her home that night
All the stars were shining bright
And then she kissed me
Each time I saw her I couldn't wait to see her again
I wanted to let her know that she was more than a friend
She said that she loved me too  and then she kissed me
She kissed me in a way that I'd never been kissed before
She kissed me in a way that I wanna be kissed forevermore
I knew that she was mine  so I gave her all the loving I had
And one day  she took me home to meet her ma and her dad
Then I asked her to be my bride and always be right by my side

I have seen you eat your own
I'm the cycle of pain
Of a thousand year old reign
I'm suicide and salvation
The omen to nations
That you worship on all fours
I'm the infection and famine
That's knocking at your door
That's why you're feeling so
Unholy
Unholy
I am the incubus
I lay the egg in you
The worm that burrows
Through your brain
But you are the beast
That calls me by my name
You send your children to war
To serve bastards and whores

You created me
On the day that you were born

Set the demons free and watch them fly
Strike down the one who leads me
I'm gonna take his place
Gonna vindicate the human race
Take the reins of power and seize them
Draw the battle lines
Armageddon's just a matter of time
Tear down the voice of reason
Let the arrows fly
