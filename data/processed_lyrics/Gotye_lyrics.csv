lyrics
"(hello there)
Music from the bass perspective
This is a journey into sound
A journey which along the way will bring to you
And a new experience - stereophonic sound
(and now ladies and gentlemen  our feature act tonight)
(Stop!)
That was the harpsichord
Now-a-days  most homes seem to prefer
The television or radio  to the harpsichord
But you still hear the piano  all the time
A flute couldn't do that
These are some of the difficulties
With being in this position and talking to you
And just wanting really deeply to relate to you
And touch you - not physically - but with vibration
(ha ha ha ha)
You might also likeNever heard metal sound like that before
The drummer is the heartbeat
Everything comes from him
It's just like a heart pumping blood
To the rest of the body
He is the heartbeat of a band  a group
He is the heartbeat
I think around midpoint in my career
I started to experiment with sounds
And then it became very important to
Get a distinctive sound
Get a distinctive sound
Get a distinctive sound
Maybe if I spend more time practicing
Eventually I can get it together
Um - here's some more music
All right! Here we go!
Now were going to use a little power kicks
Like I showed you before
We're going to chuck-em real good
A-minor to F
Just like all the heavy metal guys use  okay
Lets get some of that smoke just like on MTV
Yeah! all right!
Music - all right
Yeah! all right!
Would you say that again
Yeah! all right!
Let's play a note
Yeah! all right!
Here's some more music
Yeah! all right!
Get a distinctive sound
Get a distinctive sound
Get a distinctive sound
Get a distinctive sound
We've covered a lot of ground  haven't we?
If there's a part of our story you don't understand
Why don't you turn this record over
And start playing over again
Over again
Mammy's hero
B.F.P.O
Mammy's hero
Our little army boy
Is coming home from B.F.P.O
Wave a bunch of purple flowers
To decorate a mammy's hero
Mourning in the aerodrome
Four men in uniform
To carry home my little soldier
What could he do?
Should have been a rock star
But he didn't have the money for a guitar
What could he do?
Should have been a politician
But he never had a proper education
What could he do?
Should have been a father
But he never even made it to his twenties

Tears o'er a tin box
Like a chicken with a fox
He couldn't win the war with ego
Give the kid the pick of pips
And give him all your stripes and ribbons
Now he's sitting in his hole
He might as well have buttons and bows
What could he do?
Should have been a rock star
But he didn't have the money for a guitar
What could he do?
Should have been a politician
But he never had a antoher education
What could he do?
Should have been a father
But he never even made it to his twenties
Mammy's hero

Consume you
Colours are brighter
The world can excite you
When you're under its spell
You can tell
All too well
That without it life would be hell
And time is passing you by
It marks no moment of your life
When you submit yourself to be numb
The fear disappears
And everything seems clear
When the emptiness is upon you
It fills you up like a balloon
And you float
High up over the real world
And think of when
You were a little girl again
What could you do?
Nothing is sure but uncertainty
You might also likeYou can feel the hunger inside you
But the longing will no longer guide you onwards
Sinking into the floorboards
Where the rats eat at your will
And do it until
Your belly aches
And your soul will not be still
Wrench yourself from your demons
For far too long you've believed them
When they told you you were weak
Take a step in the tunnel
With the light 'round the bend
In the end
You can start to make amends
So much you could do!
All will be well

Still you can't say no
Ever playing upon your mind
But you won't say why
(So shut up!)
Unless you're ready to leave it
(Or make up your mind)
But you need it so much
(Do you really believe in it?)
Yes I do
From time to time
In the end
You dig yourself the hole you're in
When you don't know what you want

What's your name?
Don't worry
Don't be afraid
We won't hurt you
Hey
Lost your way?
Don't worry
Just do as we say
And we won't hurt you
It's hard
The world can lead you so astray
It gets harder
It's hard just to keep the faith
Do you need a reminder
Of the love that we gave you?
Don't worry
You're walking away
But we'll always be watching you
(We'll always be watching you)
Ready for the disconnect
Putting on a brave face  trying not to listen
To the voices in the back of my head
But it's alright now (It's a distant memory  baby)
Alright now (You know you should just let it go)
Some feelings have a habit of persisting
Even though you wouldn't let it show
Wearing me out (All this)
Hanging around (It just starts)
Getting me down ('Til I'm just)
Looking for an easy way out
Brain-dead from boredom  I'm led to distractions
Scratching the surface of life
Nothing really happens  but it's easy to keep busy
When you tell yourself you're traveling right
But it's alright now (Was it really worth it  baby?)
Alright now (Is it just a waste of time?)
Keep on second guessing
Use my memory like a weapon on everything I try

With our eyes wide open  we—
So this is the end of the story
Everything we had  everything we did
Is buried in dust  and this dust is all that's left of us
But only a few ever worried
While the signs were clear  they had no idea
You just get use to livin' in fear
Or give up  when you can't even picture your future
We walk the plank with our eyes wide open
We walk the plank with our eyes wide open  we—
Some people offered up answers (Answers)
We made out we like we heard they were only words
They didn't add up  to a change in the way we were living
And the saddest thing  is all of it could've been avoided
But it was like to stop consuming  is to stop being human
And why'd I make a change if you won't

And the daylight's almost gone
Seems there's something I should know
Well I ought to leave but
The raining never stops
And I've no particular place to go
Just when I think I'm winning
When I've broken every door
The ghost of my life
Go wilder than before
Just when thought I could not be stopped
When my chance came to be king
The ghost of my life
Now wilder than the wind
Well I'm feeling nervous
Now I find myself alone
And the simple life's no longer there
Once I was so sure
Now the doubt inside my mind
Comes and goes but it leads me nowhere

The ghost of my life
Cuts me up to see you sad
And I wish that I could undo what I've done
Give back the faith in me you had
Oh yeah
Oh yeah
You know I love you more than anyone
But I get a little wrapped up in myself
But you know I never want to do you wrong
Bring into question what we have
Oh yeah
I know I let you down

But you're giving me a chance

Твердил себе  что ты прям для меня
Но так скучна компания твоя
И это все была любовь  и боль я помню
Можешь как наркотикОм увлечься своею грустью
Как отставка есть в конце
Всегда в конце
И вот когда в нас смысл найти нельзя
Ты говоришь  что мы теперь - друзья
Но как могла ты вычеркнуть меня?
Все стряслось не с нами
И не нужна теперь любовь твоя 
Но чужаком меня считаешь ты
А это - так грубо
Зачем так нужно было низко пасть:
Друзей просить своих забрать вещички
И сменить свой номер
Я полагал  что не нуждаюсь в... но
Ты теперь лишь кто-то  кого я знал
Ты теперь лишь кто-то  кого я знал
Ты теперь лишь кто-то  кого я знал
Но заставлял поверить  что виновна я одна
Но не хочу я больше жить не в прок
Всегда читать твои слова меж строк
Но ты сказал - могу идти
И я бы не ловила на твоем месте кого-то  кого ты знал
Но как могла ты вычеркнуть меня?
Все стряслось не с нами
И не нужна теперь любовь твоя
Но чужаком меня считаешь ты
А это - так грубо
Зачем так нужно было низко пасть:
Друзей просить своих забрать вещички
И сменить свой номер
Я полагал  что не нуждаюсь в... но
Ты теперь лишь кто-то  кого я знал
Кто-то

Кого  что я знал
And let me peer inside
Let me in where only your thoughts have been
Let me occupy your mind as you do mine
You have lost too much love
You just threw away the key to your heart
Don't get burned 'cause nothing gets through
That much more difficult for me
To make you see
Love ain't fair
Your heart's a mess
You won't admit to it

Too much love
(It's not enough)
You just threw away the key
To your heart
You don't get burned
('Cause nothing gets through)
It makes it easier
(Easier on you)
But that much more difficult for me
To make you see

Love ain't safe
You won't get hurt if you stay chaste
So you can wait
And as daylight fades
The slow wind sings gently to the rolling waves
I touch your face
And we leave conscious thought for the freedom of this drug-like daze
And I heard you say (Let's lose ourselves)
Let's lose ourselves out here always
Lost in this haze
This prison of pleasures from which we want no escape
Cos here in this place
Our night's filled with passion and so are our days
I heard the moon say
When it's clear as the rain
Here in this place
(Let's lose ourselves) Here in this place
See the clouds begin to form
Feel that cold wind start to blow
I didn't know what to do
I was just stumbling around  around
Thinking things could not improve
I couldn't look on the bright side
Of anything at all
That's when you gave me a call
Now I feel better  better
Better than before
I feel better  better
Better  now I'm not down anymore
And there were times I was sure  so sure
I couldn't turn it around
I couldn't care any more
About the good things I found
That's when you gave me a reason
To make me smile again
Only have to see you and then
I feel better  better
Better than before
I feel better  better
Now I'm not down anymore
I feel better  better
Better than before
I feel better  better
Now I'm not down anymore

Life sometimes seems to get the best of you
Like everything just brings you down
Just when you think there's nothing you can do
A friendly face will bring you around
And you'll feel better
You'll feel better  you'll feel better
Better than before
You'll feel better  much better
No  you won't be down anymore
I can't keep it in
I'm falling all over myself
And I could jump out of my skin
Wanna break the door down
Just to greet the day
'Cause there ain't nothing that's more certain
To keep my blues away
And I say
And I say
And it can settle the sadness
And the voices in my head
When I'm in the glow of the warmth you throw
I can put all that to bed
And I won't get by if you take that light away

And when you're smiling on me (smiling on me)
That is all I need

And life's complexities
It may be only a moment
But the world just falls away
And I forget myself and everything else
That depressed me yesterday
And I can sing
If only I could always be just as I am right here (in your light)
And I won't get by if you take that light away (in your light)
If only I could always feel (in your light) just as I do right now (in your light)
And I won't get by (in your light) if you take that light away (light away)
If only I could always be just as I am right here
And I won't get by if you take that light away

Ooh  whoa
If you always tryin' to get to the top
You don't get to the bottom of nothin'
Then you gone before you know it  you'd better stop (Stop)
Learn a little givin' and lovin'
It's been done before (Ooh)
'Cause if it's good  then you should share it round (Ooh)
What's the use of keeping all the good things that you've found (Whoa)
To yourself?
Learn a little  learn a little
Learn a little givin'
Learn a little  learn a little
Learn a little givin' and lovin'
You don't gotta keep no other man down
For you to get up  there's no need to worry
Just don't give away your self-respect
'Cause if it's all you got left
The rest don't really matter now anyway  honey

'Cause I won't wait for you
So don't expect me to
If you won't love me now
Then we'll be nothing after
So you had better stay
Lest I take my love away
You don't want to lose me
But you loathe to refuse me
And I know that you'll always choose me
Over anybody else
If you won't leave me now
You won't see me later
Leave me on my own
I need to be alone now
And though you want me now
You can wait 'till after
'Cause patience is a virtue my love
The question is 'do you have enough'?
You don't want to lose me
But you loathe to refuse me
And I know that you'll always choose me
And I'm reaching towards it  drifting backwards
Drawing the curtains  windows inside my head
To pick you up
And take you out
It won't be long
'Til those blues are gone
The city's waiting
Beckoning for us
It leads us on
Let it lead us on
It's the perfect night
To just drive on by
Let the dashboard underscore
Everything we've seen
While the world plays for our pleasure
On our windshield silver screen
And I don't know just where we're going
And I don't care where we've been
But we just coast on through
There's no place I'd rather be
No place I'd rather be
Such a quiet joy
Knowing that I'm your pick-up fix
And you're my favourite boy
You might also likeYou're feeling tired
And I'm bleary-eyed
And the highway lines
Pass by in two/four double-time
And we don't even recognise
A single name on the street signs
Nothing else is calling us
But all we've left behind
Is like a hell-hound on our trail
And a burden on our mind
'Coz we know
We gotta go home
Such a quiet joy
Driving anywhere
Knowing that you are there
But you don't call
You don't call me no more
And I waited all day
You know you'll always
He had a suitcase full of lies
That he sold me
I sensed no danger
When I was there right by his side
He said I compelled him to confide
So he told me
Take this car
And drive downstate
And take off the license plate
And wait for me
I could have argued
But he said for my trouble I could keep
Half the money in the bag on the back seat
And he said he thought I looked trustworthy
And I must admit that the thrill of it all got the better of me
So I drove down the highway with great speed
The police
You might also likeThey pull me over to the side of the road
I try to tell them I was only doing what I was told
They cuff my hands and say
Then I know without even checking the bag
That there's no money inside it
But when they read my rights
I know that it's no use
Saying I'm not lying
Please listen to me
(Let me go)
I am not guilty
That handsome stranger tricked me
Why did he have to hand-pick me?
He told me to take this car
And drive downstate
And take off the license plate
And wait there for him
But of course they don't believe me
So from there they drive me back to the station
And after I've been booked they began a three-day interrogation
But somehow I stayed patient and calm
They did me no harm
But the bag was the key to this mystery
He bought it the very same day that he
Robbed that bank upstate and then picked me
To be his fall guy patsy
Five years later
When I'd almost forgotten that nightmarish day
I was struck by the handsome features of a stranger across the way
Take this car
And drive downstate
And take off the license plate
 baby  don't leave me out here on my own
 don't desert me in here  it's so dark
 darlin'  don't you know I can't stand to part
 but I'll stay
 my angel just don't go away
 don't leave me out here in the cold
 no  please don't leave me out here on my own
 don't leave me out here in the cold
 no  please don't leave me out here on my own

 no  please don't leave me out here on my own

 no  please don't leave me out here on my own
 no  please don't leave me out here
But said that you just couldn't stay
Now I can't get you out of my head
So many signs float by
But only you are signified
And I just can't get you out of my head
I can't get it right
I can't get you out of my mind
No I just can't get it right
I just can't get you out of my mind
Lately I'm concerned
These dark obsessions make me toss and turn
And I can't be unwound
Now you're not around
Dreams of you are all that hold me down
Ba-da ba-dup buh
I can't get it right
I can't get you out of my mind
No I can't get it right

Things are falling into place
But so much time goes to waste
Tiny pieces come to me every day
Still I wait
Things are falling into place
But so much time goes to waste
I stretch and shift
These parts won't fit
I can chop and change all I like
Rearranging this won't make it right
Tiny pieces come to me every day
Still I wait
Things are falling into place
But so much time goes to waste

In the mornings  I was anxious
It was better just to stay in bed
Didn't want to fail myself again
Running through all the options and the endings
Were rolling out in front of me
But I couldn't choose a thread to begin
(Oh-oh-oh-oh)
And I could not love
'Cause I could not love myself (Oh-oh-oh-oh)
Never good enough  no
That was all I'd tell myself (Oh-oh-oh-oh)
And I was not well (Oh-oh-oh-oh)
But I could not help myself (Oh-oh-oh-oh)
I was giving up on living (Oh-oh-oh-oh)

But it's too good to throw it all away
Anyone would do the same
You've got 'em going
And you're careful not to show it
Sometimes you even fool yourself a bit
It's like magic
But it's always been a smoke and mirrors game

What is it that you've done to make the grade?
And should you do the same?
(Is that too easy?)
Are you only trying to please them?
Will they see then
You're desperate to deliver
Anything that could give you
A sense of reassurance
When you look in the mirror
Such highs and lows
You put on quite a show
All these highs and lows
And you're never really sure what you do it for
And do you even want to know?
You put on quite a show

You put on quite a show

And you're never really sure what you do it for
Well do you even want to know?
Like when you said you felt so happy you could die
Told myself that you were right for me
But felt so lonely in your company
But that was love and it's an ache I still remember
You can get addicted to a certain kind of sadness
So when we found that we could not make sense
Well you said that we would still be friends
But I'll admit that I was glad it was over
But you didn't have to cut me off
Make out like it never happened and that we were nothing
And I don't even need your love
But you treat me like a stranger and that feels so rough
No you didn't have to stoop so low
Have your friends collect your records and then change your number
I guess that I don't need that though
Now you're just somebody that I used to know
Now you're just somebody that I used to know
Now you're just somebody that I used to know

We threw out the television
Model D-575 has custom flute presets
And Harmony-Plus in addition
Now for an arm and a leg
We get three half-dozen beats to choose from
So now we can pretend
There's an orchestra in the lounge room
I put the Genie Bass on
So my left hand can play the choir
With 16ft Diapason
And Lowrey's patented Orchestral Symphonizer
Banjo's great on repeat
The wife can't help tapping her feet

She gets the better of me
She gets the better of me
I don't wanna let her
Sometimes you know I wish we'd never met
She gets the better of me
She can wither my anger
She can better my temper
And I don't want to love her
But she knows that I could never love another
You know it does
She gets the better of me
The better she gets the less she lets me go
The better she can control
And I don't want to let her see
She gets the better of me
Don't be so uptight
I'll make you feel alright
If you just let me in
I'll fix everything

She gets the better of me
She gets the better of me
She gets the better of me

And you've been getting by without me
But I've been spending all my time
With a girl that I remember
Who'll never leave or need to grow
'Cause when you left you left your memory
Now it's the only thing I know
When the past gives me no comfort
And though the future is the cost
The way I'm choosing to remember
I'll forever be the man I never was
But the memory remains the same
And I think that living with your memory
Is slowly driving me insane
You are perfect but you're empty
And it gets so lonely in my mind
'Cause your image in my memory's
The only shred of you that's left behind
You were real but then you left me
And that's the part I can't accept
So I'll keep on living with your memory
Because it's all that I've got left
The end of the journey's in sight
You've traveled so far love
Now all of the stars are aligned
Leaving your life's no easy ride
All the grief you gave
All the love you made
All your yesterdays
Everything you were
Will fade
This is the only way (This is the only way)
Calm down now baby
The end of the journey's in sight
You've traveled so far love
Now all of the stars are aligned
All the things you thought you came here for
Everything you thought you knew for sure
Everything is true
All the things you thought you had to say
Everyone you left along the way
So you gather how nothing matters now
That your time is through

Come crawlin' back again
So you wanna make it good
You say you need to be understood
You should know
That there can't be no understandin'
When all you got's demandin'
Well you've shown me you can stay
Well away from me
And you do so happily
So I thought that you would know
Just where you can go
I won't be here when
You do it again
So you say this time this thing will last
So why you wanna do it all so fast
I think you're tryin' to relive the past

Do you ever wonder why you want her?
Does it even matter you can't have her?
Even if you tried to it wouldn't satisfy you
Trying to possess her can only depress you
Do you ever wonder why you want her?
Does it even matter you could never have her?
Even if you tried to it would never satisfy you
You'll only want her stronger
And I truly believed that I could
But now I'm worn out"
