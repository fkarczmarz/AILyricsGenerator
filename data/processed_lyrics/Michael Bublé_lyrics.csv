lyrics
"There is just one thing I need
I don't care about the presents
Underneath the Christmas tree
I just want you for my own
More than you could ever know
Make my wish come true
You know that all I want for Christmas
Is you...
I won't ask for much this Christmas
I won't even wish for snow
Underneath the mistletoe
There's no sense in hanging stockings
There upon the fireplace
'Cause Santa he won't make me happy
With a toy on Christmas Day
I just want you here tonight
Holding on to me so tight
You know that all I want for Christmas
Is you...

And all the lights are shining
So brightly everywhere
And the sound of children's
Laughter fills the air
And everyone is singing
I can hear those sleigh bells ringing
Santa won't you bring me the one I really love
Won't you please bring my baby to me...
I don't want a lot for Christmas
This is all I'm asking for
Standing right outside my door
Oh I just want you for my own
More that you could ever know
Make my wish come true
You know that all I want for Christmas
Is you...
Maria Gratia plena
Dominus tecum
Benedicta tu in mulieribus
Et benedictus
Et benedictus fructus ventris
Ventris tui Jesus
Ave Maria
Nunc et in hora mortis
In hora mortis nostrae
(Christmas) I'm watching it fall
(Christmas) Lots of people around
(Christmas) The church bells in town
(Christmas) All ringing in song
(Christmas) Full of happy sounds
They're singing Deck The Halls
But it's not like Christmas at all
I remember when you were here
And all the fun we had last year
(Christmas) Pretty lights on the tree
(Christmas) I'm watching them shine
(Christmas) You should be here with me
They're singing Deck The Halls
But it's not like Christmas at all
I remember when you were here
And all the fun we had last year

Oh babe
You know I need you
I gotta have you
I gotta have you
I said na na na na na
Let me tell you all the reasons why
Think you're one of a kind
Here's to you
The one that always pulls us through
Always do what you got to do
You're one of a kind
Thank God you're mine
You're an angel dressed in armor
You're the fair in every fight
You're my life and my safe harbor
Where the sun sets every night
And if my love is blind
I don't want to see the light
It's your beauty that betrays you
Your smile gives you away
Cause you're made of strength and mercy
And my soul is yours to save
I know this much is true
When my world was dark and blue
I know the only one who rescued me was you

Close your eyes
Let me tell you all the reasons why
You're never going to have to cry
Because you're one of a kind
The one that always pulls us through
Because you're one of a kind
When your love pours down on me
I know I'm finally free
So I tell you gratefully
Every single beat in my heart is yours to keep
So close your eyes
Because you're one of a kind
You're the one that always pulls us through
Cause you're one of a kind
You're the reason why I'm breathing
With a little look my way
You're the reason that I'm feeling
As children sleep with one eye open
Well now there's more than toys at stake
The twinkling of the lights
The scent of candles fill the household
'Ol Saint Nick has taken flight
Each year I ask for many different things
But now I know what my heart wants you to bring
So please just fall in love with me this Christmas
There's nothing else that I will need this Christmas
Won't be wrapped under a tree
I want something that lasts forever
So kiss me on this cold December night
A tree that smells of pine
A house that's filled with joy and laughter
The mistletoe says stand in line
Loneliness is what I've captured

I'll wear you like a Christmas sweater
I want something to last forever
So kiss me on this cold December Night
Call it the season of giving
Call it the season of giving
You cried the whole night through
Cry me a river
I cried a river over you
And now you say you're sorry
For being so untrue
'Cause I cried a river over you
You drove me
Nearly out of my head
Remember
I remember all that you said
You told me love was too plebeian
Told me you were through with me
And now you say you love me

Baby  don't pretend that you don't know it's true
'Cause you can see it when I look at you
And in this crazy life  and through these crazy times

Romeo loved Juliet
When he put his arms around her
Thou givest fever when we kisseth
Fever with thy flaming youth
Fever I'm afire
Captain Smith and Pocahontas
Had a very mad affair
When her Daddy tried to kill him
He gives me fever with his kisses
Fever when he holds me tight
Now you've listened to my story
Here's the point I have made:
Chicks were born to give you fever
Be it Fahrenheit or Centigrade
They give you fever when you kiss them
Fever if you live and learn
Fever till you sizzle
What a lovely way to burn
What a lovely way to burn
What a lovely way to burn
It seems like yesterday
You opened up your eyes
And I recognized your face
You know that you're the one that we've been waiting for
We're gonna keep you safe
First time I held you in my arms
I knew I'd love you all the way
I tuck you in at night
Another day has passed
Every week goes by a little faster than the last
It wasn't so long ago
We walked together and you held my hand
And now you're getting too big to want to
But I hope you'll always understand
That I'm always gonna lift you up
And I'm never gonna let you down
No matter what you do
I'm forever proud of you
I love you forever now

With candy canes and silver lanes aglow
It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Toys in every store
But the prettiest sight to see is the holly that will be
On your own front door
A pair of hop-a-long boots and a pistol that shoots
Is the wish of Barney and Ben
Dolls that will talk and will go for a walk
Is the hope of Janice and Jen
And Mom and Dad can hardly wait for school to start again
It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Everywhere you go
It's the sturdy kind that doesn't mind the snow
It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
And the thing that will make them ring is the carol that you sing
Right within your heart
It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Toys in every store

She talks like an angel talks
And her hair has a kind of curl
She's wise like an angel's wise
With eyes like an angel's eyes
And a smile like a kind of pearl
A pretty little face
That face just knocks me off of my feet
Pretty little feet
She's really sweet enough to eat
And she looks like an angel looks
And my mind's in a kind of whirl
Hmm-hmm that pretty little face
That face just knocks me off of my feet
Pretty little feet
She's really sweet enough to eat
She looks like an angel looks
And my mind's in a kind of whirl

My mamma taught me how to share
But I'll be selfish and I don't care
'cause I want you  I need you all for me
And I don't want anybody lovin' my baby
And I don't want anybody thinkin' just maybe
And I know  when you got a lovely lady
It might drive the boys crazy
When she's lookin' so fine  wooooaaahh

I miss seeing that smile
It's been such a long time
And although I don't have you
I know now that I need to
Somehow make you mine
'Cause I know he can't hold you like I can
Someday maybe when we're old and gray
We could be in love once more
'Til then I won't give my love away
I remember that love song
I sang every word wrong
And I'll admit that I miss you
But only if you do
'Cause you know that I'm shy
'Cause I know she can't love you like I can

To spend an evening with me
And if we go someplace to dance  I know that there's a chance
You won't be leaving with me
And afterwards we drop into a quiet little place
And have a drink or two
And then I go and spoil it all  by saying something stupid
Like I love you
I can see it in your eyes  that you despise the same old lies
You heard the night before
And though its just a line to you  for me its true
It never seemed so right before
I practice every day to find some clever lines to say
To make the meaning come through
But then I think I'll wait until the evening gets late
And I'm alone with you
The time is right your perfume fills my head  the stars get red
And oh the nights so blue

And your cheeks so soft
There is nothing for me but to love you

Tearing my fears apart

Or I'll never fall in love
In a restless world
Like this is
Love has ended before it's begun
And too many moonlight kisses
Seem to cool in the warmth of the sun
When I give my heart
It will be completely
Or I'll never give my heart

Is when I fall in love
With you

Gone away is the bluebird
Here to stay is a new bird
He sings a love song
As we stroll along
Walking in a winter wonderland
In the meadow we can build a snowman
We'll pretend that he is Parson Brown
He'll say Are you married?
We'll say No man
But you can do the job
When you're in town
Later on  we'll conspire
As we dream by the fire
To face unafraid
The plans that we've made

Will it say that you will be by my side to see me through
