Made a promise to my mama that I'll bless her
I could sell snow to a ski slope
And these eyes is iconic
But what's a God without a little OD? Just a G
Swear these bitches done lost it lately
It won't hold me down no more

Couldn't tell me nuttin' (I ain't sayin' nuttin')
When I first made a hundred grand
Made a hundred grand (Let me get some money)
Back then they used to call me little
But now I'm ridin' somethin' clean in a coat made of armadillo
Tryna make it complicated when this shit is simple (Simple)
I made a mill' before I paid a bill (Okay)
Just a young ma'fucker with a plan (With a plan)
Thought I was the man
Back when I first made a hundred grand
When I first made a hundred grand
When I first made a hundred grand
Couldn't tell me nuttin' (I ain't sayin' nuttin')
When I first made a hundred grand
Made a hundred grand (Let me get some money)
(Time flies) Let me get some money
I just need some shoes and my nails (Try to catch it)
And then can we stop at Chipotle?

Well
I don't need to lie no more
She don't cry no more
I ain't askin' Why? no more
It ain't 2009 no more
Now every day I wake up and breathe
I don't have it all but that's alright with me
Send you back home with a light that's beamin'
The whole team 'bout to figure it out
Have a ball with a dribble and bounce
Isn't it funny? We can make a lot of money
Buy a lot of things just to feel a lot of ugly
I was yea high and muddy
Lookin' for what was lookin' for me

It's like I never felt alive before
I struck the fuck out and then I came back swingin'
Big enough to bury my soul
You don't ever gotta worry
Even when it's 7:30 and the time is runnin' low
When your heart get cold
See what's behind all them unturned stones
And I'm a pro when it come to my job
But really I'm just tryna start believin' in God
Now when it gets hard
Because I don't need to lie no more
She don't cry no more

 always dressed in somethin' fresh
 big butt and nice chest
 they heard I used to rock Guess
 I'm in a vortex
 think I need more reps
 now the boy board jets
 tell them that I got now
 the same ones that tell ya No
 find me with a smile
 only laughin' like a child
 then it ain't about me
 I'll be in another zone
 I'll be down for the war
 find me with a smile
 only laughin' like a child
It's a blue world alone

Stumblin' around  you've been guessin' your direction
Next step  you can't see at all
Who am I to blame? Who am I to blame though?
Trust me  I've tried
I just end up right at the start of the line
Drawin' circles
Mmm
Well  I drink my whiskey and you sip your wine
Do not be afraid  do not be afraid
You're feelin' sorry  I'm feelin' fine
Don't you put any more stress on yourself  it's one day at a time
It's gettin' pretty late  gettin' pretty late
Damn  and I find
It goes around like the hands that keep countin' the time
 they're more like strangers
 this feel like livin'
 but now I'm swimmin'
 but it look like rain
 not livin' forever
 they're more like strangers
Oh-oh (Hehehe)
Oh
The Divine Feminine
Am I supposed to? Okay
Love
This sun don't shine when I'm alone
I lose my mind and I lose control
I see your eyes look through my soul
I felt the highs and they feel like you
And you too divine to just be mine
You remind me of the color blue

Remember when you went away to college?
Hours on the phone we end up talkin'
Feelings that we have are so alarmin'
You was there before the fancy cars and
You was there when I was just a starvin' artist
When the car was havin' trouble startin'
I tried to hit it while you was gettin' dressed
I swear to God I'ma freak out if it go straight to voice mail
That's the only way I'm tryna end the night
I know I make your mind go crazy
All I ever known is the color gray
Your loving ways bring me sunshine
I found an angel so divine (So divine)
Heaven probably not the same without you (Not the same)
I can't keep on losin' you
Over complications
Gone too soon  wait!
We was just hangin'
I can't seem to hold onto
Dang
The people that know me best
The key that I won't forget  too soon
I can't keep on losin' you
I can't keep on losin' you
Yeah
Yeah  yeah
How many mistakes do it take 'til you leave
And I'm left with my hand on my face  all red
In the face  lookin' at you like wait!
(I can't keep on losin' you) Don't run away so fast
Know my heart like gold  but it break like glass
Know my shit get old and I act so young
So when I get home  I'ma give you some
Make you feel like woo when I hit that drum
Get home late and you don't trust me  baby
Way too drunk  you don't know what I'm sayin'
You can drive my car  don't drive me crazy
Complicated  got you frustrated
Every single night  I keep you waitin'
You say you don't care  that's what you sayin'?
We both know that's some bullshit
Tryna get through to you because

Well
Play your games like they my ticket to an Ivy League school
Won't get Hall of Fame dick from a minor league dude
I just eat pussy  other people need food (Hahaha)
Only got a little time and I ain't tryna spend it
Arguin' about who ain't givin' who attention
Startin' up the engine  need to reboot
I just eat pussy  other people need food
And I use every bone in my body
Keep on holdin' on to your trust
I know you don't want nuttin' to do with me
But just one more time  let's make love
Summer's soft sweetness
Call late drunk  you hang up
It's complicated  keepin' me up late
Can't concentrate  you're always on my brain
If it's love  then why the fuck it come with pain?
I just think that's some bullshit
This week she like him  next week they fightin'
Need protection  all your dresses bulletproof
You're safe with me  girl
I can't keep on losin' you
Where the hell you goin'?

Rap diablo
Yeah  yeah
It's the rap diablo  macho when I drop flows
The bar gets raised up  it's me and Petey Pablo
Colder than gazpacho  colder than the mono
Rappin' head honcho  rockin' shows like I was Bono
I go play a couple keys on the piano
The industry a lie  all the promises were hollow
Follow me  I could show you where we be's at
How'd I get my G-pass? None of your fuckin' beeswax
These raps bring a joint together like a kneecap
Fuck the little eight ball  show me where the ki's at
The time continuum  Mortal Kombat finish 'em
Tryna find a balance  reachin' from my equilibrium
Fake superhero like the Mystery Men  I ain't savin' nothin'
I'm gettin' faded 'til the angels come  and skippin' all the famous functions
How do the famous function? The A-list can't be trusted
I strong-arm 'em like I play the trumpet
The bottom barrel of society
I tell my bitch if she don't love me  then just lie to me
I'm finer than the winery
Take it from the rich  this is piracy (Piracy)
Finally  I don't even need my fuckin' eyes to see
Come and die with me

Okay  my mind is Yoda  I'm on Ayatollah
These other rappers just a diet soda
I find Jehovah in the darkest places  empty as apartment basements
This a marathon  gentlemen  go 'head and start the races
Save the coffin spaces
You'll come up missin'  tell your bitch that you been trippin'  now you on vacation
Rappin' like it's automated  lights I keep 'em on like Vegas
Lava makin'  so hot I'm turnin' hog to bacon
Only God can save him  I heard the monsters made him
I ain't a star  I'm way farther with the constellations
Contemplatin' suicide like it's a DVD
You can see me bleed  I be with the freaks and geeks
Gordon Bombay in these streets  ballin' like I'm Pistol Pete
Been a beast  every word I spit rewritin' history
Look at what you did to me  look at what you did to me
Run into the underworld with guns and set the sinners free
No bitches in my circle  I'm the show  you the commercial
I been poppin' like a kernel  readin' Justin Bieber's journal
Treat you like a urinal
'Cause everybody got dead homies
On the dead homies
Said everybody got dead homies

I can calm you down
So watch her do the Macarena  somewhere out by Pasadena
Love a drug that everybody here just tryna get a taste of
You a waste of the space that you take up
Livin'  this time around I'm not kiddin'
I had an intuition 'bout these women and suspicion
Got me lookin' at shit different  how a man in my position
Can't start slippin' down these slopes 'cause it's all just (Downhill from there)
As a kid I didn't learn that  but (Now I'm aware)
When you a youngin'  you just tryna live your life and have some fun
In a world where you have yet to see how evil it's become
It's hard to have a dream when you deep inside of one
And I know you hate them spirits  so I keep 'em in my lungs
I'm a Beatle to these young kids
But sometimes  I be feelin' like a needle to these young kids
You had the world  you 'bout to leave it to these young kids
And we gon' show you what the love is
Stay high
Go for what you know
Let it in your mental
And don't ever let it go
It won't stop!
You can't fight the feeling
Feeling
You can't fight the feeling  no

So there ain't too many times it's me  myself and Irene
Homie  can't you see I'm chillin'? Please don't fuck up my chi
Waste a bunch of money  kinda stinks of satisfaction
Fell asleep at Hollywood  woke up in Manhattan
Ballin' like I'm Jordan  but I'm fresh as Mars Blackmon
A penny for your thoughts  a dollar for your dreams
A price on a idea  we never can agree
They tell you what to know  but it's better to believe
So why you tryna act like what you never gonna be?
Just continue livin' life  'cause enough of 'em don't
You spent your days countin' every single penny made
Better start now  'cause we comin' for you anyways
Stay high
Go for what you know (Yeah)
Let it in your mental (Macadelic)

It ain't never gon' stop  'cause

You can't fight the feeling
Feeling
You can't fight the feeling  no
Hours upon days just to find power shit to say
But you won't hear it even if your ears was pierced with Beats by Dre  I mean
The sun is slowly fallin'  we all surely should die eventually
So what's your calling? Oh  you left your phone behind?
Jesus Christ is right near us  and Devil said you owe ten percent
My focus  stare at elopin' on boats that float in the open of oceans
That coast the line on the margins I rhyme  you chokin' or soakin' up game
I'm hopin' you picked the second one  shame
The emotion of jealousy that you're holdin'  you're tellin' me
That you're golden but really cubic zirconia  let me see
I'll break you down like a pound of fire  whenever
Your tactics are mighty clever but even if you're Mayweather you
You can't fight the feeling
Feeling
You can't fight the feeling  no
It won't stop!
You can't fight the feeling

Missiles in my repertoire  I'd say I'm pretty regular

My pool-house studio is covered up with pencil marks
And every day  it's full of jokers like a deck of cards (Hahaha)
Swear I'm so lonely  there's horns on my dome piece (Dome piece)
But I'm not the devil  I'm a motherfuckin' minotaur
Oh my God  look at how upset you are
'Cause we out here winnin'  brought my dogs from out the reservoir (Hoo!)
And I'ma let 'em bark  before you ready  my set will start
We forgot our roots before and trust me  things  they fell apart
Wash myself with acid  it's because I got a denim heart
My conscience so weak  I need to split it up in seven parts (Okay)
Revis brought me out to Cali for the first time
Went to Amar'e's party  took tequila shots with Kevin Hart (Ah)

Thank God that I made it (Made it)  ask Q where Dave is (Where is he?)
He'll probably tell you that he rollin' midnights out in Vegas (Seven midnights!)
Me? I'm in my spaceship  my face is so complacent
Wear a suit to cash a check  we goin' to the banquet (Ching)
And Jimmy got the burner (Bow) but he don't wanna murder (Nah)
And ClockWork is somewhere out in Sweden speaking Danish like
Hi Sven (Goddamn) isn't this your language?
That man must be a alien  I really can't explain it
Shit  it's just a little cocaine sniff *Snorts*
But the lines longer than parades is (Ah)  yeah
I think it's time to give me all your praises (Praises)
So I can get this money and give all the homies raises (Raises)
My life is on these words  this is my affidavit (Wow)
And if you want a legal battle  send your ass to David (That's my lawyer)
Um  I'm half-man  half-amazin'
Probably half-God  but that don't fit my calculations (Don't make no sense)

Kinda hope that no one save it  we only grow from anguish

When I was in first grade  I wished to be Puerto Rican
My mom took me to a barbershop to get some cornrows

Since I was a little one  moms had to put me on the Ritalin
Made a swisher run  crack the 40 then I lit a blunt
Told Chuck I had a couple raps  so we kicked the drums
All the best rappers are usually dead
But I'm the poison that left a widow Juliet
In the studio with candles lit and Buddha heads
Comin' up with all the coldest shit  take your Sudafed
Contagious  speakin' while sedated
God shit  make 'em want to add a couple pages to the Bible
I ain't got nothin' left in my will

Took a break just to kill the game half-assed
Set some rat traps  went and took a cat nap
Woke up  threw the dead bodies in the trash bags
