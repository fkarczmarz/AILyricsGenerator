"Did I really drown
10 lines leading to the seashore
Water's gonna lead the dogs my way
10 wives tearin' up my leisure
Pressin' little mouths gonna talk my way
Gonna talk my way
Uh huh
Out of my mind
Out of my mind
Stolen my wife
Stolen my knife
Gonna take her into my life
Into my life
3 nails pounded in the front door
Start a few fires and end my stay
Well even the urges in the backporch
Crusted little mouths gonna talk my way
Gonna talk my way
Uh huh!

 I found it at the mortuary
 want some
 well even though were on the run
 want some
Blacktop rolling under God
Now we're dancing close
One to one as our bodies lock
On our way home
And all the pain flows
Opened up
Opened up
In the mercy of his means
Time held me green and dying
Though I sang in my chains like the sea
And all the pain flows
Flows
