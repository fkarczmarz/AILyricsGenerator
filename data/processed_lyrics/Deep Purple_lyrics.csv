"What's the mystery  my son?
Gypsy Dan Caravan
Won Tun Wan with your Chinese fan
Murder and rape with your power
The tenth revolution in far away days
It's come to this
A gypsy's kiss
All your power's gonna fade in the haze
Ya who' Jumme gae bile ya heed
Senorita said
I'll drag yer lungs out through yer nose
Space truckers  free and high
Teamsters get ya by and by
That should keep you on your toes
They got a gun at your head
But you ain't necessarily playing their game
They can't resist
A gypsy's kiss
All that's needed to drive them insane

Crazy Horse  Geronimo
I'll smoke a piece with you
We got rock and roll
And there's nothing they can do
Hear the small voice of truth
Above the shouting despair of the crowd
What do you wish?
A gypsy's kiss
The way your purse your lips
Throw your stuff into a suitcase
Put your hands upon your hips
I'm unmoved by your evil glare
The way you toss your head
You make stupid accusations
By which time I've lost the thread
Sometimes I wonder how it is you get
To piss me off this much
I may be heavy-handed
And I lack the tender touch
You moan and groan about me staying out
And drinking with the guys
How 'bout I bring 'em home?
Try that one on for size
There's something awfully wrong with this deal  babe
Any fool could see it's true
Can't you understand how I feel  babe?
You've got me
But all I got is you

I guess I just don't have it in me
To keep you satisfied
To be honest with you  babe
I'm only in it for the ride
And you may never bring yourself
To take me as I am
But in case you haven't noticed
Through my open window
Then I start to remember
The girl that brought me joy
Now the night wind softly blows
Sadness to tomorrow
Bringing tears to eyes so tired
Eyes I thought could cry no more
If the day would only come
Then you might just appear
Even though you'd soon be gone
When I reached out my hand
If I could see you
If only I could see you
To see if you are laughing or crying
When the night winds softly blow
In my dark and whispering room
Memories still bring me
A numbness to my feelings
Take my hand and brush my brow
In the warm and fevered dark
Heart was madly beating
My crazy thoughts are worrying
When the night winds softly blow

To see if you are laughing or crying
Throwing up a brick
No one came I threw one more
That really did the trick
Your daddy came and banged my head
He said what kind of man
Is this that's hanging 'round my girl
And threw me in the cab
You're a farmer's daughter
You're a farmer's daughter
Why do I always get
The kinda girl I didn't oughta get
I won't get no more eggs and water
Now I've laid the farmer's daughter
Imagine I was a full-grown man
And I could talk just right
Could I came and see you here
And do this every night
Wham! The door comes crashing down
Your daddy's face all pale
Says come with me you hairy bum
I'll put you in my jail

Woman I should like some peace
And daddy hold your tongue
I think you're gonna die of fright
When I tell you what I've done
I can hear your tales and lies
You say I'm dumb and scraggy
But man this dumb and scraggy is
Your daughter's baby's daddy
She's a lucky daughter
Such a lucky daughter
Why did I always get
The kinda girl I didn't wanna get
Now I've got what I always fought for
Cos I've married a rich man's daughter
Ha
Even though the sun may shine
And world looks in the shade
As it slowly comes away
And the valley's filled with pain
And you can't tell if I cry
As I look up to
Maybe once in a while
I'll forget and I'll smile
But then the feeling comes again
Of an April without end
Of an April lonely as it come

When I just can't feel the sun
And the springtime is the season of the night
Break the calm before the fall
Bad news travels at the speed of flight
Good news not at all
And here we are again
Playing endless games of war
Birds of prey
Without a word of warning
We dive in to attack
Vengeful and self-righteous
We turn the blue sky black
And a wretched few escape
They'll be forever looking back
At our sacrifice

Hey  Johnny's Band

Wrote themselves a cool forty-five

Your tears are lost in falling rain
And if you hear me talking on the wind

To make records with a mobile
We didn't have much time
But Frank Zappa and the Mothers
Were at the best place around
But some stupid with a flare gun
Burned the place to the ground
Smoke on the water
And fire in the sky
Smoke on the water
They burned down the gambling house
It died with an awful sound
Funky Claude was running in and out
Pulling kids out the ground

Waiting for the day
When I'd take your hand and sing you songs
Then maybe you would say
Come lay with me and love me

But I feel I'm growing older
And the songs that I have sung
Echo in the distance
Like the sound of a windmill going around
I guess I'll always be a soldier of fortune
I wandered without you
But those days I thought my eyes had seen you standing near
Though blindness is confusing
It shows that you're not here
Now I feel I'm growing older
And the songs that I have sung
Echo in the distance
Like the sound of a windmill going around
I guess I'll always be a soldier of fortune

The message says
You left a number
And I tried to call
But they wrote it down
In a perfect Spanish scrawl
In a perfect Spanish scrawl
Yet again
I'm missing you
King size bed
(in a) hotel someplace
I hear your name
I see your face
I see your face
(The) back street dolls
And the side door johnnies
The wide eyed boys with their bags full of money
Back in the alley
Going bang to the wall
Tied to the tail
Of a midnight crawl
Heaven wouldn't be
So high I know
If the times gone by
Hadn't been so low
The best laid plans
Come apart at the seams
And shatter all my dreams

Close my eyes
It's times like this
My head goes down
And the only thing I know
Is the name of this town
Is the name of this town
Yet again
I'm missing you
Won't be long
I'm coming home
Until that distant time
I'll be moving on
I'll be moving on

We always had a ball on Mars
We meet with all the groovy people
We rocked the Milky Way so far
We danced around with Borealis
We're space truckin' 'round the stars
Let's go space truckin'
Space truckin'
Remember when we did the moonshot
And Pony Trekker led the way?
We moved through the Canaveral moonstop
And everynaut would dance and sway
Got music in our solar system
We're space truckin' 'round the stars

When she was rocking in the house of blue light
Tutti Frutti was oh so rooty  rocking to the east and west
Lucille was oh so real when she didn't do her daddy's will
'Cause I'm a speed king  you gotta hear me singing
Saturday night and I just got paid
Going to fool about isn't going to save
People gonna rock  people gonna roll
Going to have a party to save my soul
Hard-headed woman and a soft-hearted man
They've been causing trouble since it all began
Take a little rice  take a little beans
Gonna rock and roll down in New Orleans

Driving like rain
Stormbringer dance
On the thunder again
Dark cloud gathering
Breaking the day
No point running
Because it's coming your way
Ride the rainbow
Crack the sky
Stormbringer coming
Time to die
Got to keep running
Stormbringer coming
He's got nothing you need
He's going to make you bleed
And you know he's gonna get you
Rainbow shaker
On a stallion twister
Bareback rider
On the eye of the sky
Stormbringer coming down
Meaning to stay
Thunder and lightning
Heading your way

A strange kind of woman
The kind that gets written down in history
Her name was Nancy
Her face was nothing fancy
She left a trail of happiness and misery
I loved her
Everybody loved her
She loved everyone and gave them good return
I tried to take her
I even tried to break her
I spent my money as I took my turn
She looked like a raver
But I could never please her
I couldn't get her
I spent my money as I took my turn
She finally said she loved me
I wed her in a hurry
No more callers and I glowed with pride
I'm dreaming
I feel like screaming
I won my woman just before she died
Who do you think you are?
Superstar
Who do you think you are?
Superstar
Superstar
Who do we think we are?
In your crystal ball
I'm asking you what can I do
My back's against the wall
And I can't hold on much longer
So I've come to you my friend
For now my life seems at an end
I came to see you once before
One hundred years ago
You took my hand and broke the spell
That should have let me go
But my years have gone so slowly
So I'm here again my friend
For now my life is at an end
Because I stand in front of you
But you drive me all the time
Put the evil in my mind
Used to sing and say my prayers
Live my life without a care
Now I have become a fool
Because I listened to the mule
How can I change when my mind is a friend of a Lucifer hid in the ground
Just another slave for the mule
Or the kiss of death from Judas in the night
And it felt so far beyond the blue horizon
Tempting me with transports of delight
And then the devil took my hand and said
Come along with me
Reaching out for something in the sky
But I could not control that trembling feeling
Everything I want is slipping by
Something you should see (Come along with me)
(Come along with me)

I never knew what happened to my nightmare
Everything went dark that August day
And the eclipse was on the other side of somewhere
But I was on the upside of afraid
And then an angel took my hand and said
 I heard it said
 you do your best
 as far as I can see
 and throw my bones?
 what I'm holding in my hand
 as far as I can see
 and throw my bones?
 it's another day
 I'm here on solid ground
 or closing down
 as far as I can see
 and throw my bones?
Never to be seen again
Saying farewell to daylight
From henceforth I shall rot in a stinking bed of wet straw
Right from the ashes of life I learned to behave
Sucking my milk from the venomous tit of the state
That's clearly designed to suppress every thought of escape
Don't want no pity for me in this filthy cell
See you in Hell

Don't want no pity for me in this filthy cell
I'll see you in hell
After centuries of living with nothing but my convictions
Broken fingers clawing through the walls of my incarceration
Escaping the clutches of eternal damnation
When the angels come to stay
And all the silent whispers
Will be blown away
Lying in the corner
A pair of high heel shoes
Hanging on the wall
Gold and silver for the blues
One too many wasted sunsets
One too many for the road
And after dark the door is always open
Hoping someone else will show
Someone is waiting
Behind an unlocked door
Grey circles overhead
Empties on the floor
The cracks in the walls
Have grown too long
The slow hand is dragging on
Afraid to meet the dawn
One too many wasted sunsets
One too many for the road
And after dark the door is always open
I'm not expecting people anymore
Hear me grieving  lying on the floor
Whether I'm drunk or dead  I really ain't too sure
I'm a blind man  I'm a blind man
And my world is pale
When a blind man cries
Lord  you know there ain't a sadder tale
Had a friend once  in a room
Had a good time but it ended much too soon
In a cold month  in that room
We found a reason for the things we had to do
I'm a blind man  I'm a blind man
Now my room is cold
When a blind man cries
 smiling everyone
 she is a whole new tradition
 she makes me feel like a river
 she turns me on like a fire
 far away
 far away
 far away"
