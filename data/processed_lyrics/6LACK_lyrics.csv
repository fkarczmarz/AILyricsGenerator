lyrics
"I'm just like  I don't want this shit for myself and I don't ever want niggas to try to pull me into that
'Cause I've been told a couple times like  Hey  do this shit  man  do that—
And I'm like  man  I don't want  I don't want that for me  manAnd if I keep tellin' y'all I don't want that shit for me and y'all keep  you know  tryna nudge and push
I understand y'all got your vision and y'all got your formula but that shit don't work for me  man
I'm not gonna conform  like  I'm not settling for that shit
'Cause if I do it once and it pop  I'ma have to keep doing that shit over and over again
You can't build no fanbase like that
You  you become  you become  you become a fuckin' song instead of a person
That shit— I'm not  I'm not tryna be that man
Mmm  migraines from overthinking  I'm tryna let go
Let go of my past  man  that shit been tryna creep up  up
Contemplatin' on if I'm really as strong as I thought  bitch  I might be
Quick to pull me down but as much as I've seen  I can't fall  it's unlikely
Damn  shit get a little twisted up
I put my troubles in a dirty then I mix it up
I'm bouta change my number like I haven't switched enough
This is home and you ain't Zone 6 enough
Gone  I'm from East Atlanta Zone
If you ain't from it take your ass home
I let my heart talk  keep my mental strong
Speak the whole truth 'til my money long

I want people to know what I stand for
I want people to be personal and know  This is 6LACK  this is what he believe in
What we need to talk about
Get gone  get gone  yeah  yeah
Got the past whispering in my ear
He flaw  she flaw  what's wrong?
I got troubles and they won't leave me alone
It seems like everybody got something to say
Everybody got a look they tryna get off of their face
Everybody got an opinion and I don't want one
Trying to tell me a better way to do some shit that you ain't ever done
Sips drink in the booth
Black down to my shoes
Kick shit with my troops
Kicking shit  Ryu
You not with the shit  why you?
Front for those who don't matter
When they not thinking about you
If I learned anything it would probably be to listen more than I talk
And don't brag about what I got  just multiply what I brought
I never dwell on a loss  never give a nigga sauce
He might run off with it all  he might run off with it all
He might run off with it all  he might run off with it all
Get gone get gone  yeah  yeah
Got the past whispering in my ear

I got troubles and they won't leave me alone
Part II: EA6
Like I'm more of myself than I've ever been
Which is something that you really gotta come to face with sometimes
'cause
I thought I was  you know  fully myself 24/7
But nope  like right now is how I'm supposed to feel all the time
It's how I'm supposed to be all the time
It's how I'm supposed to think all the time
Now I know going out of this  I know leaving this
That will follow me
It doesn't  you know  end with this  you know
I gotta take it and I  I live with it every day
I see the people around me and I feel so much
I wanna put it in words
Try and figure out where to go with it but I just feel so much
I know they don't even feel as much as I feel
But that's alright  that's alright
We have two different purposes
Clearly my purpose is some shit that's way fucking bigger than me
Then it gets completely quiet when I'm at the beach
I know I'm one person but I kinda feel like this ripple effect is gonna impact a lot of people
I feel God talking and when he talks everything else is silent
Summer 2011  almost lost my faith in God
Same time I never prayed so hard
Took control of my life so I wouldn't have to take no job
Press play I couldn't take no pause
I'm from east Atlanta 6  they don't play that shit
In East Atlanta six you better make that lick
Or they be at your front door with that gun doe
Know them niggas Nick Cannon with the fucking drum roll
East side 'til a nigga die
Beast mode 'til a nigga cry
Sensei make a nigga fly
Shit hard but you gotta try
If I can do it  you can do it too  time to be a better guy
I found the answer ridin' down Candler
I'm late for court 'cause traffic on Moreland
I'm trying to preach to y'all what's important
So hard for me to ignore ignorance
I don't know why I feel it's my place
I know you see the pain in my face
I call the shots and move at my pace
But I understand it's all a big race
I understand you want that big face
They offering and hey
It's hard for me to say
That I wouldn't bite the bait they threw me
Be cautious where you play
It's darkness in the A
Be cautious where you play  it's darkness in the A
Be cautious where you play  it's darkness in the A
Be cautious where you play  it's darkness in the A
A-Town stomp on the old me
Used to ride through the hood with the slow creep
People gon' love what they don't need
I remember what the OG's told me
You better shine bright when the lights down
Less talk  more show  nigga  pipe down
'Cause words ain't shit but your thoughts out loud
And thoughts are the opposite of showin' niggas how
Be cautious where you play  there's darkness in the A
Be cautious where you play  there's darkness in the A
Be cautious where you play  there's darkness in the A
Takin' out the trash on yo’ ass
I get rid of bad friends like a dump truck
Everything I been through is everything I am
What the fuck you think this is? Think I lucked up?
I sacrifice most of my time so my daughter can take vacations in bumfuck
Wanna talk? Better run your funds up
It's mister turn-the-Tabernacle-to-a-movie
I grew up eatin' hot wings and bumpin' Gucci
We hit the mall and we ball all day
And you might take a L just for runnin' out your face

Ridin' through Atlanta on a off-day
Hopin' that nobody double-cross me
Ann's Snack Bar where the food real good
Just started  but over bein' the nice friend
Say you need someone you can confide in
Let's confide in the middle of the night then
You can smoke all my weed
But this ain't what you had with that other nigga
Trip up  I send you back to that other nigga
Somethin' in the sky  what is that? Is it you?
Lookin' like a star  I'ma blast through the roof
Actin' like a teacher  you gon' ask when it's due
Make me wanna write a letter  spillin' all my feelings
I know you know wе both need a little more healin'
Thinkin' 'bout makin' good lovе to my friend
Mm  get in

(Oh-oh)
Tell me  what am I to do without my best friend?
Look how I stepped up ever since you stepped in
And every lesson is a blessin' in disguise
Back when I split my last dime between me and you
When the love was just pure and not speakable
Rent free inside my mind  you the only tenant
You're my best friend  dot at the end of my sentence
You're everything I wanted  are you my good karma?
If a nigga wanna fuck with me  he gon' fuck with all of me
I ain't going for none of that bullshit
You know what I'm saying? I ain't got time for that
My time is money  nigga
Don't waste my time  nigga!
I am not like these niggas  I be penicillin in the cut (Woo)
That mean I'm chillin' in the cut (Woo)
Made a million in the cut (Wool)
I'm Balenciaga challenge
Tryna find my balance
Offset with the bag
My melodies came from everything I came from
Been talking to God  everything I got came from him
Ain't no fatigue in my blood
It's just a lot of weed in my blood
Had to finish
Keep running your mouth like Akademiks
It's a everyday struggle
But I still remain humble
We can compare and all that
But you know that ain't all that  yeah

Different day  but I'm in the same boat

Can we turn it around before we crash?

Know that it's bad  but it'll be fine
That's just how it is  shout out to slime
It's a big war goin' on outside

Monday startin' to feel like Friday
Blendin' up the days in a week
Nothin' like I was when I met you
Back when I belonged to the streets
That pussy is uh  elite
Plus the rain is gone  I can finally see
I been thinkin' 'bout gettin' on one knee
Turn a solo to a feat and make your heart skip a beat
Can't you see that I've been hostile for weeks?
Don't you know you change the patterns of my sleep?
They gon' say it's defeat  I'ma say it's a win
I'ma love you for free  they gon' think it's pretend
They don't know that you were there when I had more ideas than I had dollars
Now I say I'm proud with Chane'-'nes and Pradas
I look around  the pool is all dried up

'Cause I would hate to do the same thing twice
I had to learn bein' stubborn was a vice
I had to pick apart the trauma in my life
Wouldn't confide in my moms or my pops
So when you knocked  I did the Home Alone thing and hit the lights
I know you mad  the other night we had a fight
I tried to fix it  but the pain was still ripe
If I know anything  it's how to reignite
Satisfy your appetite  and that should come as no surprise
I take that back  I know it's gon' be a delight
I'm at that age where nothin' can just suffice
Dazed and I'm under pressure
Embracin' the highs and lows

You using sex to try to distract
Me from the fact you don't deserve to be where you at
It's sad to say I had to leave my girl back home
She tripping  I don't think that I could love her no more
She popping up at parties tryna look the other way
Girl you can't ignore me if your friends say Hey

Poor decision making for the kid
And all because you left us for a second
Now I'm tryna figure out the lesson

To be rapping like these people understanding this shit
It's demanding and shit  but I stand for these kids

You dial 9-1-1  I pull up in a Porsche
Word is I'm carrying the torch
And I ain't wanna share  so beware if you reach you get scorched
Ever since I jumped off the porch
I knew that I would grow to be the boy
The boy then grew to be the man
Learned how to kill a hook  Peter Pan
I'm tryna make the end stand out
But I'm so fucking outstanding
I'm so fucking outlandish and a opp can't win

Can't have nobody else getting away

Outta my cave  I come (Come)
Pray for the day and run (Run)

So I'm findin' any reason to detach
Guess I gotta get some healin' from the past
Life a ride and ain't nobody got a map (Yeah)
I'm just tryna kick my feet up on the dash
Outta my cave  I come (Come)
Pray for the day and run (Run)

I'm changing (Changing)
So outta my cave  I come
Man  I just met all my demons

My ego been callin' my phone
It's gon' take me all night long

I ain't never need no help
I will love you when you're old
And you lose the words you spoke
Time will never wait on us
But it never can age our love
Say you'll always be my greatest fan
Sing your favorite words just like a band
Down to walk the walk until the end
All that I
All that I wanna do
Put it on the line
Hoping we go out at the same time (Same time)
'Cause life without my love is a slant rhyme (Slant rhyme)
That mean it works out but it ain't quite (Ain't quite)
I'm just thankful that I could find you (Find you)
Seems like I was always behind you (Behind you)
I ain't worried 'bout no Alzheimer's (Alzheimer)

I'm thinking 'bout a Yamaha
To get away from all the cameras
It hit me right between the eyes (Hit me right between the eyes)
It's funny when they switch and pick a side
But it seems like they all know what I'm supposed to do so
Let's switch bodies for a day
You could me be and I could be you
Juggle the pile of shit that's bound to come through
You can have it since it's automatic
Now switch (switch)
Tell me how it feels (feels)
To be somebody else (else)
Now switch (switch)
It wasn't what you thought it was (was)

Only 'cause I hit a switch on her

Been too busy focused on the next plan
Nigga told me I was one-track minded
You won't get that far
Wastin' your breath on somebody else
You won't get that far
Wastin' your breath on somebody else
How far would I get
If I was sittin' here thinkin' about all the shit
That niggas fix their mouth to say?

And don't you ever hit my phone talkin' 'bout no competition
'Cause I'm too busy focused on my own shit

Tryna keep myself from going under
I've been listening to Young Thugger
'Cause all that other shit makes me think about
All the things I don't wanna think about
 it feel like them shits really can
 so I write a song
 yeah

 now that bitch listen to Future
 I could say she was my shooter
 I'm the one that's doing the shooting
 wasn't tryna use it
 she told me prove it
 it's like I looped it
 but you (But you)
 yeah
 but I gotta nice verse that I'm tryna get out
'Cause lately it feel like them shits really can
I'm prayin' I don't wake up all alone
But that ain't equal to me righting wrongs
Stuck between a rock and a hard place
And I might have to figure this out the hard way
We may not end on the best terms
Maybe we should love and we should learn
I don't wanna fight or be at war
Gotta want the same things
Gotta want the same things
So if you ever fall
You know that I'll be there
Correct me if I'm wrong
You said you never wanna share
But know I'm stuck between
What I love and who I love and
You tell me leave you alone but you don't need that
So why you wanna love me so bad?
Why you wanna love me so bad?
Haven't you heard about my miserable past
I swear no matter what I touch it breaks
I got the worst luck with love
Worst luck with love
Or maybe I ain't working enough
Hurting enough
I swear I got the worst luck with love
The worst luck with love
Or maybe I ain't working enough
Why?
Why?
