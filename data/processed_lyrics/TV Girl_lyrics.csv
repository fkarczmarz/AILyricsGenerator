lyrics
"Have you heard the latest craze?
Put your hands in your pockets
And look the other way
Remember those times when you were laughing
And naked on my couch?
Pretend it never happened
Politely smile as we turn around
And do the act like you never met me
Do the act like you never met me
Do the act like you never met me
And slowly walk away
The hidden kisses
The clumsy conspiratory glance
But I don't really mind it  though
I always like the way you danced
It's so easy to do
So much simpler than the one we did before
Just point out your toe
At someone you know
And pretend that they're not

And do the act like you never met me
Do the act like you never met me
And do the act like you never met me
And slowly walk away
Slide to the left
Now slide to the right
Now tell me once again
How I was a really great guy
And dip to right
Now shimmy to the left
It's 3 o'clock in the morning
Don't answer my texts
Take a step back and
Take a couple more
Now one more sorry look
Before you walk out that door
Arch your back
When you spend the night with him
Bounce around a while
Never talk to me again
That's how you do the
Act like you never met me
So do the act like you never met me
Do the act like you never met me
 there was nobody home
 you don't need excuses to dress like a girl
 drugs and deceit
 7 days til Sunday
 7 days til Sunday
What if you're floating away but you get too high and you can't come back down?
And ooh
Most of us just won't make it
Most of us just gotta fake it
But ninety is close and
Ninety nine is almost true
It just won't do
It just won't do
What if your man steps out and you're stuck with the junk and they're working on the clamp down?
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Most of us just won't make it
Most of us just gotta take it
Someone right the wrongs or
Someone sing a song to kill my blues
Just won't do
Just won't do
I'd like to have your problems too
I'd treat love like an act of charity
Now I watch as your eyes turn blue
As you floated across the room
And move from moment to moment of clarity
You should know what to do
And maybe you do
You should know what to do
Well let's skip to your room
You should know what to do
When they were looking at you
They weren't really looking at you
They were looking all the way through you
I think that I'm a bit like you
Maybe more than you even knew and
If I could I would stick to you
Like glitter sticking into glue and
I would watch as your eyes turn blue
As we sat in our separate rooms
I swear her voice would too
If I could only find out who's

Wondering where Anjela's gone
She didn't even drive here
She couldn't have gotten very far
What does it matter anyways?
I didn't like her anyways
I only let her crawl into my arms
I wasn't trying to lead anyone on
I was only trying to stay warm
Oh Anjela
Can't stand the cold
And it's not summer anymore
I haven't seen the last of her
There was euphemisms and arrangements
There was alleged transgressions
So nevermind
She buried her face in the pillow

I haven't seen the last of her

But that's not something you can teach
What seemed so blue in the sunlight
By the night was a pale green
And I tried to hold her
But it didn't really last long
And she's getting older
I guess she's gotta cut her blue hair off
She asked me if she was pretty
There's really no way of winning
If in their eyes you'll always be a dumb blonde
And she cried over nothing
So there was nothing I could do to stop
Her from cutting
Her beautiful blue hair off
It looked like cotton candy
And just as quick to get licked away
Last I heard she was living
With a boy who acts his age

And I guess I'll just miss her
Even though she isn't even really gone
But things are just different
Boy now who smokes cigarettes out that window
My girl Liddy used to always smoke
Cigarettes when she couldn't sleep
She'd disappear for an hour and a half
But I could still smell it on her raggedy tee
And I could taste it on her lips when we kissed
Poor little Liddy used to always quit
But she never really quit
She'd just say she did

Cigarettes when she couldn't sleep

The light from the billboard always shines
But it changed twelve times since you went away

Reverberated down the hall
Into the ears of a stoic roommate
Who put her headphones on
But in the space between the songs
(That's where she paid the most attention)
Beneath the crack on the door
(The candle flickered and got extinguished)
The reassuring hum of the freeway
As she drifted off to sleep
And it was five o'clock in the morning
You had no good reason to leave
Ooh baby I'll come when you call (I'll come when you call)
I'll come when you call (I'll come when you call)
I'll come when you call (I'll come when you call)
I'll come but that's all (I'll come when you call)

She was singing Warren Zevon

And if it seems so peaceful now

And if you're ever left to wonder
Why anything goes right
Thank the god of bad decisions

Playing piano and staring out your window
In the middle of the night
From your house on the hill
I was hoping
Hoping that you wouldn’t forget me
But I know you will

Henrietta: Sit with me for a while. Talk to me. Where did you go  when you went from me long ago? You always go away! And there's always the sound of you going away. And why do I come here? And remember. Remember what? Remember what?
She was sexy she was sweet
Running barefoot in the street
Sipping wine out of a flask
Drinking vodka by the glass
Yeah she used to knock 'em back
As fast as they would line them up
Still sexy but she's sad
And the headache's coming on
Only dancing out of habit
She doesn't recognize the song
How can the nights be getting long
When time feels like it's speeding up
She used to crush the pill right between her fingers
It used to kill the feeling but now the feeling lingers
And she did the drugs for fun
But now she does them just to stay up
Just to stay up

Incognito at the bar
She could tell he was a star
By the way he wore his baseball cap
Slung low across his eyes
While beauties live and die
These playboys stay forever young
Which handsome stylish rake
Puts his hands around her waist
As she stumbles up the stairs
In a state of perfect grace?
They would hold her just to hold her
But now it's 'cause she can't stand up
Running for the pleasure
Wearing down the flesh
And she has to go to sleep now
When she used to go to bed
Eyes closed because she felt it
But now it's 'cause she can't wake up
She can't wake up

Henrietta: Stop it. You're making fun of me. Stop it. I'll kill you.
Henrietta: No one will ever know. No one will ever know.
Man 2: What?
She never really did
And everything you said
Fell like spit into her drink
And while you were sleeping
She was lying there awake
Just wondering how long it would take
Till she could get back to her place
And find some other cloud
To drift on
Face it babe
Boys were made to fly away
No matter what they say
They’ll lie right to your face
And while they were flying
You were standing on a chair
Just wondering how you could get up there
And bed an angel in mid-air
Then drag it to the ground
And drift on
And drift down

I may forgive but I won't admit
That any hope it was sunken yet
Beauty faded or flowers dead
Maybe the sun was aligned but the moon was wrong
And stars don't lie but they do reflect
They do neglect sometimes to tell the whole truth  baby
There ain't no check within your mailbox
So don't go changing with the times

So take comfort
Cruel comfort
Before you start to wonder

Wait 'til those arms belong to me and I'm not
Saying that you love me
I'm not saying any

And how your neighbor came in to yell at you
When the party got too loud
And when I snuck into your living room
And I wished that you would follow
At first you didn't but then you did
And it was already tomorrow
And you told me how you had an uncle
Who played the villain in those movies
And how he died and then you cried
You apologized profusely
I was nervous that this was good as I could ever feel
And I was right
I confess to thinking sex was my salvation
Really they just start with the letter S
You'll forgive me for thinking heaven was her bedroom
It's as close as I would ever get
As close as I would ever get
And I'll always remember picking up
My favorite records from your apartment
Kissing you before you left me for New York
Or just the daughter of a rich man?
In this land of constant sunshine
I thought you'd never have to work
New York City's cold and when you love someone

With someone else in an ideal situation
Without a shred of good intentions between you
Much less a decent explanation
I couldn't tell you why she summoned me
Sometimes you get lucky
And they think that you were someone else
I can't remember what she said
Was she trying to tell me something
Or talking to herself?
Go upstairs don't close the door
Why don't you give her what she's asking for?
Spill the drink onto the bed
That's just between her and her friend
But it made it hard to sleep
'Til her head felt even worse
And I hope that she felt miserable
When it was time to go to work
Her and her friend
Just did it as revenge
So any excess pain you feel
Isn't any consequence
But don't feel bad
'Cause you didn't stand a chance
You can make a hasty exit
That's how they handle it in France
Little consolation
Even if you always knew it
So any nasty things I say
Are purely therapeutic

You wander into the bedroom
You're drunk  we've done this before
You stumble over like 3 seconds later
And kick your boots on to the floor
I can hardly see your eyes
You forgot to put your hair up
I can see you've learned some tricks
From those boys over in Europe
But still  it kinda makes me glad
To see how quick we fall into those old rhythms and patterns
If you want it  you got it
You only want it when you're drunk
My friends say you're obnoxious
You're not so bad when we're alone
Morning comes
I know how the next part goes
One last dance
Then you delete me off your phone
In the hallway
Your eyes stay on the ground
Doesn't bother me because when the weekend rolls around

They lie right to your face in this town
But what did you expect?
She wishes that she could have seen what they saw
That left them so unimpressed
So she gave it a try
She started to cry
Or did they just let the sirens ring
As the bombs were falling?
And all of these boys would just do like you say so
And if you tried to leave the room
They would grab your ankles

Added up to nothing

As they watched you looking back
Just skip the mass  you can keep the faith
You can sleep for days on a golden lawn
You can swear to God for just one second
How you could see heaven through this smog
And you would tell how you transcended in the back seat of a car

His baby left
She’s going back to school again
And learning fifty ways to kill the conversation
'Cause if you can’t be good
You drink in the name of art
And as the sun sets on Sunset again
The stars come out so it don’t get dark
On the king of Echo Park
(The King of Echo Park)
Now she’s playing pool
At the Little Joy
Just a little drunk
She sees her little boy

In the very same clothes
As the night before
Except you'd never know
And all the girls he’s bagged
They just can’t stay mad
They just wave their hands at no ordinary jerk
But who’s afraid of a little cliché
As he sipped iced tea in the palm tree shade
And as he looked around and everything was right
But as he closed his eyes he dreamt he was in New York

Writing thinly veiled fiction for the soul
And feeling like a liar
And thinking about the songs that you sing
And how you sang with such conviction
I almost forgot they weren’t for me
And I know you’re from another planet
And you’re crazy as a loon
But it’s too cold down here on Earth
To go up on the roof
But I’ll feel a little less alone
When I’m sitting in my room
Writing songs about you
Well I’ve been lying in this bed
Trying once again to find my muse
But if we’re only gonna die
Or worse get middle aged
Then what’s the use?

As sluts turn to mothers
And the legendary lovers
Get sick of one another
As dreams turn to daydreams
And punks learn to behave
Don’t worry about me babe
'Cause I’ll never change
I'll never change
How many platitudes can you say
In the time that it takes for beauty to fade
Sedentary fireworks going bad
Like pouring out a bottle of gin on a drowning man
Shiny new fighter jets getting strafed on the deck
For every insolent B-boy who tripped and landed on his neck
Untameable stallions that got turned into glue
But don’t worry about me babe
'Cause I worry about you
Yes I do
Static on a page
Foregone conclusions
Just the faces aren't the same

She isn't what she seems
Words got blurted out
And fell like spit into my drink
But if that's how it's got to go down
Then I'm gonna stay till you kick me out
And I know what feels good and what's not allowed
And there's plenty of heartache to go around
The part that's so confusing
It could happen like you say it should
Right down to the phrasing
Still it wouldn't do you any good
Back in the apartment
Dressed up like a stage
Unfamiliar actors saying lines to a different play
But if she didn't want me then
Why'd she climb into my bed?
And I know some things you sing
You'd never say out loud
And there's plenty of heartache to go around

Sometimes he holds her hand too tight
'Cause he'll never leave
But will he ever pull her hair like she likes?
Maddie Klein and her fabulous loving machine
And that's just the way that it's got to be
And who really cares about a little rust
If Maddie Klein's got herself a little boy she can trust?
Sometimes she misses the flesh and bone

I wonder what she's tellin' me now
I don't really know why I talk to her
I guess 'cause she has big fat eyes
Swallows awkward silences so you don't even have to try
She's always looking 'cross the room
At someone who just came inside

How the hell'd she get to be the way that she is?
How could anyone ever say they really loved her?

Are you really as mentally as dead as you seem?
I wanna rip you apart at the seams
Just to know what's inside but I'm afraid of what I'll see

She used to date someone in the band
She drinks until she can hardly stand
Some sucker holds her hand
While she throws up in the van

She never leaves the house
She doesn't even get dressed
My girlfriend always leaves a mess
She says she's gonna clean
But she always forgets
My girlfriend is there when I get home
Watching movies on TV
Or talking on the phone
No one wants to be alone
My girlfriend is so unimpressed
By everything I say
You can see it in her face
There's been some big mistake
And buy her flowers just in case
And I don't mind it when she goes out with her friends
They drop her off drunk
And I take her up to bed
She says 'I'm sorry' and I kiss her on the head
And everything is fine
Until the morning comes again

I remember when we were in high school
I took her to the dance
We snuck out to the bleachers
And I thought that I might take a chance
But it never does any long-term good
To go thinking about the past
God damn this wandering mind of mine
That can't be happy with what it has
But I'm not mad
And sometimes we still laugh
And when she's just getting up
And the sun hits her right
She doesn't even look half bad
My girlfriend gets so depressed
She never leaves the house
She doesn't even get dressed
My girlfriend is so unimpressed
By everything I say
No one knew if her face was black and blue when she hit the water
But it was when they dragged her out
They had come to see what the fuss was all about
And every cop in town was her audience that night
And everyone kind of felt like movie stars and they went home so impressed

We wanna talk about sex but we're not allowed
You're wasting your tongue with lame excuses and lies
So how should I begin this?
I guess it started when you were with him
And how he never even took you out to dance
But did he fuck with any rhythm?
But now he's playing with your head
But did he ever make you cum?
Did he ever make you cry?
Do the wires in your mind get sewn together?
Rubbed and severed by the heat
You don't know how long I could stare into your picture
And wish that it was me
I guess it's different 'cause you love him

And swear we were only being honest
Do you like these little sonnets?
'Cause I wrote them just for you
But how quickly they turn sour
So be careful who you screw

To certain defeat
They were younger than me
Guns poke through the trees
Death on a whim
They were aiming at him
And when the bullets came he didn't duck
He wrapped her pantyhose around his neck
And he could feel their magic working
Keeping him from harm
Away to some place mystical and warm
His lucky charm
He got caught
No cover at all
He'd breathe in her scent
Not even a scratch
He didn't die
When he stepped on a mine
They were violet and soft
It didn't go off

I know you're stranded in the forest if you don't
Abandoned if you do
So don't go sleeping with the enemy
If my imagination is getting ahead of me
Then let it be known that I can't make it alone
So get down and stay perfectly still
Bite down on your cyanide pill
There's things that you swore you'd never do
But you will with the enemy
Don't go sleeping with the enemy
Then everybody gets to be a hero
Do you know that there's a war?
Don't go sleeping with the enemy
Don't forget that we were comrades till the end
They only wanna make love but this is war
And the good guys always win
So don't kick while we're dragging you home
Quietly reciting your loyalty oath
Knife at your throat

'Cause everyone that you meet just wants to screw you

That was just the part she had to play
Don't call me stupid! Don't call me a fraud!
Hollywood's full of pretty hip guys. You know what can happen to a pretty girl all alone there?
I dreamt that I saved every stupid actress in LA
And every aging waitress who gave it up
And had to change back her name
They floated out of every coke-fueled party
Every overpriced café
But that was just some dream I had
And when I woke up nothing changed
Even though she don't have grace like Greta Garbo
Even though she don't have eyes like Clara Bow
That leather glove could pluck you from the huddled mass tomorrow
And toss you through a gilded puff of smoke
Don't call me stupid! Don't call me a fraud!
I dreamt that I was every stupid actress in LA
I dreamt it that you meant it when you said that
You would come and see my play
You sat there and you watched me
And you thought it was pretty good for a pretty face
From its perch up there in the Hollywood Hills
Give me your crazy and your desperate and your beautiful but inspired
And to me there's nothing sad about a dream
She screamed as she swan dove from a pearly-white H
Not you and me babe we keep ours through the day
You thought it was sad?

Spread the pieces on the floor

And you can't come in
Valerie
Standing on the balcony
And if you look you could see into her mind
But you can't come in
See TV Girl LiveGet tickets as low as $63You might also like
And if you never knew nobody
Then how'd you ever know that you were lonely
She'd known someone who had
And if that's the case then what's the point in knowing
She stood there in the open
For everyone to see
Too proud to ask for anybody's help
She had this revelation
The sheer amount of work that it would take
To be like everybody else
But she didn't want them anyways
She's no damsel in distress
She just sipped her daiquiri
And wished she wasn't easily convinced
But who were you fooling anyways?
You should have guessed
You should have known
It doesn't matter what they say
Some people like to be alone
Valerie
She doesn't know how to be like every other girl
She's alone in her little world
And you can't come in
Valerie
Standing on the balcony
And if you look you could see into her mind
But you can't come in
You can't come in
You can't come in
You can't come in
You can't come in
You can't come in
You can't come in
You can't come in"
