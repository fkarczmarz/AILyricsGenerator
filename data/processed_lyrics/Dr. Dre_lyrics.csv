lyrics
"Huh? (Hey Dre  why you trippin'  why you trippin'?)
Fuck that  nigga  what's up with all that shit you was talkin'  nigga? (I ain't say nothing  why you trippin'?)
You're a motherfuckin' liar  nigga  that was you (Nah  that wasn't me)
That was you  nigga (That wasn't me)  hey
Hey  hey  check this out  motherfucker
What's wrong  nigga? (It wasn't)
You can't talk with a gun in your mouth? (Nah  it wasn't me  Dre)
You can't talk with a gun in your mouth? (It wasn't me)
Listen up  nigga  you know Lucifer? (Nah)
Well  you're about to meet him  motherfucker
Who's the man with the master plan?
A nigga with a motherfuckin' gun
Forty-four reasons come to mind
Why a motherfuckin' brother is hard to find
He been walkin' on the streets and fuckin' with mine
Stupid punk can't fuck with a mastermind
See  I never take a step on a Compton block
Or L.A. without the AK ready to pop
'Cause them punk motherfuckers in black and white
Ain't the only motherfuckers I gots to fight
I think it's better to be tellin' the facts than cuffed up
And jacked and fucked up
What you niggas looking at? You going
Goddamn  'cause it's the city
And for you to survive  a nigga gotta be a gangsta
And I'm a nigga you can't remove
Took out a lot of motherfuckers for tryin' to prove
To they homies that they can hang by dealin' with me
But once again in the end they D-E-A-D
I never did time on a murder yet
'Cause I relax  sit back  do a job and jet
Yo  I know you understand my flow
So here we go  and Death Row
Come let a motherfucker know
You might also like
Who's the man with the master plan?
A nigga with a motherfuckin' gun
Who's the man with the master plan?
A nigga with a motherfuckin' gun
D-R-E  a motherfucker who's known for carryin' gats
And kick raps that make snaps  adapts to
Any environment that I'm located at
If you see me on the solo move believe that I'm strapped
Four-four  tray-eight or AK-47
'Cause slowly but surely send you on a stairway to heaven
Just put my finger on the trigger and pull back
And lay a punk motherfucker flat
As he wonder what popped before he got popped
I told you I was Dre and you know it don't stop
Now I know you understand my flow
So here we go  and Death Row
Come let a motherfucker know
Who's the man with the master plan?
A nigga with a motherfuckin' gun
Who's the man with the master plan?
A nigga with a motherfuckin' gun
Who's the man with the master plan?
A nigga with a motherfuckin' gun
Who's the man with the master plan?
A nigga with a motherfuckin' gun
I breaks 'em off  I breaks 'em off  yeah
I breaks 'em off  I breaks 'em off  yeah
I breaks 'em off  but I ain't speaking about between the thighs
I'm talking about cocking a gauge in between your eyes
It'll make you drop to your knees 'cause you realize
That a gat'll make any nigga civilized
Old buster-ass nigga talking bullshit
Don't know that I'm the wrong nigga to fuck with
Get lit or hit up by the doctor
A nigga that breaks 'em off properly
Real G  so don't doubt it
I'm the one who's doin' it while these other niggas talk about it
And if motherfuckers come at me wrong
I straight put my forty-four Desert Eagle to his motherfuckin' dome
And show him why they call me the notorious one
The name is Dre Eastwood when I'm packing a gun
You don't believe me  well step up and give it a try
And if you die  you's a buster  'cause real niggas don't die
But some still don't hear me  though
You're too near me not to hear me  nigga  yo
So now you know
Who's the man with the master plan?
A nigga with a motherfuckin' gun
Who's the man with the master plan?
A nigga with a motherfuckin' gun
Who's the man with the master plan?
A nigga with a motherfuckin' gun
Who's the man with the master plan?
Question is - can I get some? Know what I'm saying?
When I yank you by the fuckin' arm
Don't be looking at a nigga crazy
Let me break it down for y'all
It was just one of those days
When I wanted to catch sunrays
It`s fun to gitt blunted on a Sunday afternoon
Zoom-zoom like the Commodores
Round up four good-to-go girls
I be postin all-world in the ride
Sipping 151 done gave me too much pride to back down
Soon as we get to The Beach I'mma put my fuckin mack down
It's time to put Bronson on the map now
I'mma have to ack-wild

(Aight? And a give a nig' some ackrite)
I'm the type of nigga playa-haters don't like
Snatchin' up your honey for some late night hype
And snobby-ass bitches get slapped out of spite
For those that don't know big words: I'm FUCKIN FADED
Our first spot was cool till some gangsters made it hot
Now we plot and pose
Getting swarmed by those type of niggas
With no game but brown-nose
So I impose only like pros can
Bling! Gold chain gleam
You're very eligible for my summer league team.
Maybe too extreme cause the sister got steamed
Then Miss Thing tried to scream on my brethren
(And a give a nig' some ackrite)
I'm the type of nigga playa-haters don't like
Snatchin' up your honey for some late night hype
And snobby-ass bitches get slapped out of spite
Good Samaritans save that ho from getting slapped up
My homies crack up at the scene I made
Yo my actions ain't serene when a nigga's on fade
If it wasn't for the one-time brigade
I woulda sprayed at the hooker tramp
As cops parade I'm afraid it's time to break camp
Try to swing an ep tonight so I don't have to keep in touch
Keep it on hush without the tippin`
Macking interrupted by some niggas set-tripping
If you can figure out a way to wrestle that fear to push you from behind rather than to stand in front of you  that's very powerful
I always felt that I had to work harder than the next guy  just to do as well as the next guy
And to do better than the next guy  I had to just kill
You know  I just go in
Uh  sittin' 'bout a hundred stories up  like what the fuck?
And I'm just lookin' at it all (I want it all!)
I'll be right here in Los Angeles
Lookin' like a villain layin' low
Nothin' I can do but pack it all up
Goin' up but shit  I feel the love
Spotlight on me and I'm feelin' so rare tonight  huh
Actin' a fool and feelin' alive
I'm fuckin' flawless like I live in a vault
Only type of livin' I know
(Only type of living I  only type of living I)
Yeah  see  if it was you you would've killed yourself by now
(Only type of living I  only type of living I know)
Yeah  it takes a special kind of motherfucker to live like this
(Only type of living I  only type of living I know)
And they ask me how I do it  motherfucker  just take a look around

Best believe I'm in the buildin'  ha
Yeah! Comin' live and direct! (Uh)
And I know you feelin' some type of way about it but  uh  watch your mouth
I dare your ass to say somethin'! I thought it was all good (Hey!)
But now you motherfuckers crossed the line and kinda pissin' me off
All the fans and all the fame and though I gave everything
To this game they still complain
Now what the fuck do y'all expect me to do? There's just so much fuckin' pressure!
There's so much pressure and it's all in a day's work
Aaaaaah  work
My whole life all I ever thought about is grindin'
Even though my surroundings only showed me crime and violence
That was back when a rapper needed guns way more than a stylist
And that was back when I felt like rappers was true motherfuckin' riders
Or even back in the day when I was a fuckin' youngster  man
Born and raised in the belly of the beast (Motherfuckin' Hub City)
I had a dream that we was at peace but I was so wrong  so wrong
Y'all too wrapped up in the bullshit and bias
Now reality TV is talking 'bout pulpits and choirs
Some of these hoes give less than a fuck when they runnin' their life story by us
It's the worst when I'm in a hotel  like a Hilton  sick and tired
And some of these housewives way too fuckin' desperate  these bitches thinkin' fame first
I can't knock the hustle  shit  it's all in a day's work!
But that's that shit with potential to make the game worse
Shit  it's just somethin' about that Hollywood curse  they just thirsty
Hard times  I double my grind
Fuck the part-time  huh  stay ready for war
I'm on the front line  I'm gettin' the feelin' like it's all mine
It's becoming the only feeling I know
(Only type of livin' I) Only type of livin' I know
(Only type of livin' I) Only type of livin' I know
(Only type of livin' I) Only type of livin' I know
(Only type of livin' I know)
Gonna go to work
We gotta work
We gotta work
Let's get back to work
On the grind  back to work
Let's work
Rich as fuck  but guess what? I'm back to work (Yeah  I'm back to work)
So many people that I love  they want my time but I got to work (I'm sorry  I'm back to work)
If you really wanna do it like this  shit  you better get back to work (I'm workin'!)
Back to work  right back to work (Huh  right back to work)
I be stompin' down-down-down-down-down demons
Rollin' up trees in the belly of the beast
Where the people disagree
The upper class eat  middle don't exist
The bottom of the beat  glad I got my sticks
Are you jumpin' on a fad  layin' in a ditch?
I be stompin' down demons  stompin' down quick  come on
And please don't come around these parts
And tell me that we all a bunch of animals
The only time they wanna turn the cameras on
Is when we're fuckin' shit up  come on
Bullets still ringin'  blood on the cement
Black folks grievin'  headlines readin'
Tryna pay it no mind  you just livin' your life
Everyone is a witness  everyone got opinions
Got a son of my own  look him right in his eyes
I ain't livin' in fear  but I'm holdin' him tight
Got a son of my own  look him right in his eyes
I ain't livin' in fear  but I'm holdin' him tight

Damn  why the fuck are they after me? Maybe 'cause I'm a bastard?
Or maybe 'cause of the way my hair grow naturally?
Still tryna figure out why the fuck I'm full of rage
I think I noticed this bullshit right around the fifth grade
Paraphernalia in my locker right next to the switchblade
Nothin' but pussy on my mind and some plans of gettin' paid
But I'm a product of the system  raised on government aid
And I knew just how to react when it was time for that raid
Just a young black man from Compton  wonderin'  'who could save us?'
And could barely read the sentences the justice system gave us
So many rental cars with bricks  I think they probably funded Avis
Some of us was imbalanced but some us used our talents  shit
Not all of us criminals but cops be yellin'  Stay back  nigga!
We need a little bit of payback (Payback!)
Don't treat me like an animal 'cause all this shit is flammable
Don't fuck around 'cause when it's done  it's done
Fuck you!
And the old folks tell me it's been goin' on since back in the day
But that don't make it okay
And them white folks tell me all the lootin' and the shootin's insane
But you don't know our pain
And please don't come around these parts
And tell me that we all a bunch of animals
The only time they wanna turn the cameras on
Is when we fuckin' shit up  come on
And please don't come around these parts
And tell me that we're all a bunch of animals
The only time they wanna turn the cameras on
Is when we're fuckin' shit up  come on
These old sneakers  faded blue jeans  no tricks  no gimmicks
I be stomping down-down-down-down-down demons
Rollin' up trees in the belly of the beast
Where the people disagree
The upper class eat  middle don't exist
The bottom of the beat  glad I got my sticks
Are you jumpin' on a fad  laying in a ditch?
I be stompin' down demons  stompin' down quick  come on
And the old folks tell me it's been goin' on since back in the day
But that don't make it okay
And them white folks tell me all the lootin' and the shootin's insane
But you don't know our pain
And please don't come around these parts
And tell me that we all a bunch of animals
The only time they wanna turn the cameras on

And please don't come around these parts
And tell me that we're all a bunch of animals
The only time they wanna turn the cameras on
Is when we're fuckin' shit up  come on
Yeah! This is DJ motherfuckin' Premier!
And I'm Dr. Dre (Dr. Dre)

Everyday it's the same thing  L.A. ain't changed
Niggas still playa hating  but Dre ain't changed
I'm just a lot smarter now
Cause these niggas is banging ten times harder now
Niggas bringing they ass up in the wrong part of town
Better turn their car around
Rolling the window down (Hey can we talk it out?)
(Nah  get the fuck out!)
Johnny got a shotgun
And he ain't even strong enough to cock one
Fuck trying to job hunt
Niggas got AK's
Niggas is way crazier than Dre was back in his N.W.A. days
Niggas spray strays and shoot without looking
Niggas walk by and blast  without leaving a footprint
I think the attitudes are twice as worst
It takes half the time to get your whole life reversed
Always trying to play Rambo with they ammo
Make a nigga wanna stay in family mode

Late nights is full of lead that whistles as it goes by
Murder arrives  anytime
Bullets take flight when the fo'-five ignites
With you in the site of youngsters with automatics
Busting on shit to lay everything down even tourists to non-affiliates
These days  gun play is official with green lights on every block
Though the sign tells you too it's not best to stop
On every corner  Cali niggas are dumping
You'll be shaking your soul loose from the box at the coroner's
Making death not so foreign to ya
Niggas got Rugers and M14's with enough ammo to leave
An armored truck Swiss cheese
I've learned to stay away from house parties
I've seen too many go and end up absent without leave
Ain't no warm welcomings
My eyes have witnessed the bend in on
Nights that don't sleep  and fireworks until dawn
Everywhere I go  all I ever seem to hear is

Now tell me  what the fuck is this man?
Niggas doing brothers in worse than the Klan
Can't even stand
In front of your building and chill without yielding
Twelve year old children that kill  blood spilling
Thugs be illing  unnecessary slugs filling the sky
Usually drilling the one that wasn't willing to die
Yes sir  in the Killing Field I got my life preserver
And I'll do my time for murder
These niggas got the nerve to question me
'Bout the colors that I got on?
I see that red dot on your knot
'Bout to get your whole crew shot on
A Soldier of Fortune  I'm the wrong man to plot on
Took him out on the spot before he even got on my hit list
Peep this
I cock back  you bow down
Bust round  bloody the ground
Retaliation sounds like this
Everywhere I go  all I ever seem to hear is

These niggas don't know what the fuck is goin' on
Let me holler at these niggas for a minute
Straight off the streets of chaos and no pity

Can't never leave the crib without a murder wea-pon
And most of these fools ain't shit but cutthroats
Now peep game on what Six-Deuce told me...
And these punk-ass hoes is lookin' for dough
Attention all personnel:
A bitch nigga
Every since you was mad doggin' me with that bitch in yo' car
Must we break you down to estrogen most hated specimens
A bitch nigga
Bitches ain't shit but hoes and tricks
Gets the fuck out after you're done
Then I hops in my coupe to make a quick run
Bitches ain't shit but hoes and tricks
Gets the fuck out after you're done
Then I hops in my coupe to make a quick run
I used to know a bitch named Eric Wright
We used to roll around and fuck the hoes at night
Tighter than a motherfucker with the gangster beats
The shit got deep and it was on
Number one song after number one song
Long as my motherfuckin' pockets was fat
I didn't give a fuck where the bitch was at
Suckin' on his dick just to get a buck or two
And the few ends she got didn't mean nothin'
Now she's suin' 'cause shit that she be doin' ain't shit
So now she takin' me to court
It's real conversation for your ass
So recognize and pass to Daz

Now as I'm rollin' with my nigga Dre and Eastwood
We flip-flop and serve hoes like flapjacks
This is what you look for in a ho who got cash flow
You run up in them hoes and grab the cash and get your dash on
While you're chillin' with your homies and shit
And how my niggas kick the anthem like this (Biatch)
Bitches ain't shit but hoes and tricks
Gets the fuck out after you're done
Then I hops in my coupe to make a quick run
To the store to get me a 4-0
So I head down the streets to Long Beach
To lick me from my head to my feet
But I'm from Tha Pound and we don't love them hoes
How could you trust a ho? (Why?) 'Cause a ho's a trick
I don't love them tricks (Why?) 'cause a trick's a bitch
And my dick's constantly in her mouth
Turnin' them trick-ass hoes the fuck out now
I once had a bitch named Mandy May
Used to be all in them guts like every day
The homies used to tell me that she wasn't no good
So I figured niggas wouldn't trip with mine
Guess what? Got gaffled by one-time
I'm back to the motherfuckin' county jail
My nigga D.O.C. and my homie Dr. Dre
Your girl was trickin' while you was draped in your county blues
I ain't been out a second
And already gotta do some motherfuckin' chin-checkin'
Move up the blocks as we groove up the block
(Bitches ain't shit) I un-cock my shit
Bitches ain't shit but hoes and tricks
Gets the fuck out after you're done
Then I hops in my coupe to make a quick run
Bitches ain't shit but hoes and tricks
Lick on these nuts and suck the dick
Gets the fuck out after you're done
Then I hops in my coupe to make a quick run
Bitches ain't shit
I don't give a fuck about a bitch (Bitches ain't shit)
But I'll let her know that she can't fade this
'Cause I'm doin' my own thing (Bitches ain't shit)
Down with the swang (Sing to these hoes)
I'm hangin' with Death Row like it ain't no thang
'Cause I'm a bitch that's real
Motherfuckers need to step back
And now I gotta do some—
I gotta do some shit that's clean (Bitches ain't shit)
But they can't hang with my type of swang
I ain't tryna say I suck every ding-a-lang
But just the juicy ones with the tip of the tongue
And then they're sprung and with their nuts hung
 motherfucker?

Not from Kris Kross but they call me Mac Daddy
Had he not known about the city I'm from
Here I come  stompin' in my khaki suit

On top of things as they swing towards my ding-a-ling
But could you raise up off his nuts?

What is going on in Compton? I don't understand it.
I heard you talking about respect  I gave you niggas the utmost
All you niggas the utmost
Would you look over Picasso's shoulder
And tell him 'bout his brush strokes?
Them opinions  I don't trust those
I apologize  the city made a nigga so cutthroat
Every hood love me  but it started on one coast
Could've stopped in '86 but I knew that you would want more
I'm on the throne in a place some niggas won't go
(Don't get it fucked up!) Been away from home
But I ain't been gone that long
(All they wanna know is: where you from? Where you from?
Psst! This is about where I'm from
I think it's time to take these niggas to the deep water

Go fuck around and drown in the specifics

These niggas won't let up until they all wet up
(Don't get it fucked up!) Naw  nigga!
Now everybody wanna visit tryna re-up that prescription
That's my nigga  watercolors couldn't even paint the picture
If they don't get the picture  fuck them
Yeah  drugs by the dozen
You might just wanna go and check the children
(You might just wanna check your fuckin' children)
I'm the one that got they ear
I just wanna make it clear: My influence run deep like the ocean
(Don't get it fucked up!) Been away from home
But I ain't been gone that long
(All they wanna know is: where you from? Where you from?
Feels like you're drowning  don't you?
About a hundred miles down in that ocean
It's over  shoulda never jumped in
If you can't swim (If you can't swim  if you can't swim)
Oh my God  where's a lifeguard when you need one?
Motherfucker know I started from the bottom  vodka baby bottle
Mixin' that with Similac  my momma knew I had a problem
Wasn't thinking 'bout no rapping  I was juuging for a dollar
Putting quarter pieces in the black Caprice and make it holla
Keep the decency and make them TNT my product
I'm a C-O-M-P-T-O-innovator  energizer
Inner city bullet flyin' 'til that bitch on auto pilot
Ah  shit! I don't give a fuck about your whereabouts
All I care about is wearing out your area
And airing out your upper body
When I catch ya walking out your parents' house
(Don't get it fucked up!) Homie got fucked up
Tryna park his tour bus  not knowing what's what
Or who's who  living in the L.A. County zoo

With a Walkman on  when I caught a guy
Gave me an awkward eye ('Chu lookin' at?)
And strangled him up in the parking lot with his Karl Kani

Right next to a humongous truck in a two-car garage
Hoppin' out with two broken legs tryna walk it off
I'ma kill you and them loud-ass motherfuckin' barkin' dogs
And when the cops came through
Me and Dre stood next to a burnt-down house
With a can full of gas and a hand full of matches
And still weren't found out (Right here!)

Still always into something  heart still in Compton
The comp can't oppose  dope Cali platinum classicals
Introduced you to my Doggs  that don't love hoes
And Firm Fiascoes—assholes
Fucked you up with my last video  tuxed up
Doing a tango
And cash  always in my grasp
Came up in the game wearin' khakis not kangols  stranglin' hoes
When asked about it in most interviews I just laugh
Now I vacate with hoes with a gang of ass
One feedin' me mangoes  the other lightin' my hash
Rap tabloids write Dre's light in the ass (What?)
Came home uptight  ready to mash
Like a gas pedal  get on that '64 Chevy level
AK-47 heavy metal
Who say Dre ain't ghetto? Just whistle like a tea kettle
I throw three at you  tell me if you see devils
'Cause we rebels over here  I smell chronic in the air

Ambulance  violent uproars
Trash niggas taken out like chores

B on some hardcore  pornographic
Toting Austrian firearms that's made out of plastic
In these drastic surroundings  it be sounding like Lebanon

Get out your car son  that's how I came to bougie niggas

Hey  I'ma tell you right now
Wake up  jumped out my bed
I'm in a two man cell with my homie Lil 1/2 Dead
Murder was the case that they gave me
I'm only eighteen  so I'm a young buck
But that's the life of a G  I guess
Eses way deep  shanked two in the chest
Best run 'cause brothers is droppin' quicker
Bouncin' off the walls  throwing them dunks
Gettin' that rep as a young hog
It ain't nothin' like the street life
You better be strapped with your shank  'cause ain't no fist fight
So I guess I gots to handle mine
Since I did the crime  I gots to do my time

Them say me grow up to be nothin'
Look at me now and tell me what you see
I am what I am  it's only me
Little ghetto boy
Playin' in the ghetto street
What you gonna do when you grow up
And have to face responsibility?
Now I'm holdin' a dub  sittin' on swoll
I'm back up on my feet with my mind on the money
That I'll be makin' soon as I touch the streets
Things done changed on this side
But it ain't no thang to me
'Cause now I'm what they call a loced-assed OG
The lil' homies from the hood with grip
Are the ones I get with 'cause I'm down to set trip
Didn't know he had a twenty-two
Straight sittin' behind his back
I grabbed his pockets and then I heard six caps
I fell to the ground with blood on my hands
I didn't understand
How a nigga so young could bust a cap
I used to be the same way back
I guess that's what I get (For what?)
For tryin' to jack the lil' homies for they grip
Me learn many things from what me see from the street
The outcome of what I've come to be
Little ghetto boy
Playin' in the ghetto street
What you gonna do when you grow up
And have to face responsibility?
Somethin' for the real OGs to get with
No needing bein' calm if you pack right
And earnin' just enough to keep your sack right
Late nights  I wonder what they gettin' for?
Early mornin' on the corners  what they hittin' for?
Seven young G's put they serve down
In a G ride  east side's where they swerve now
Not thinkin' about what's really goin' on
I spent four years in the county with nothin' but convicts around me
But now I'm back at the Pound
And we expose ways for the youth to survive
Some think it's wrong but we tend to think it's right
So make all them ends you can make
So ain't no need for your mama to trip
'Cause you's a hustlin'-ass youngster  clockin' your grip
Now me finally grown as you can see  still an OG
For life and always remain to be
A little ghetto boy
Playin' in the ghetto street
What you gonna do when you grow up
So I kept it real and I stayed alive with no compromise
And I fantasize about the baddest bitch and what between her thighs
Then I woke up and realized this is my motherfuckin' real life
You know where the fuck I'm from
From that muthafuckin' legendary
From the city where them niggas load clips in fast
And get stabbed at homeroom should've skipped that class
Shit will never change on the West Side
Jack your shit  take your car for a test drive (Ah shit)
Gangbangin' out the window hollering let's ride
Gotta keep a tec by the bedside
These niggas don't know my life
All this pain and what I sacrificed
And all my niggas that lost their life
You never die  you never die
I'm in that motherfuckin' one for a minute now
All y'all lil' niggas need to simmer down
Shut the fuck up  I'm the one that's killing now
Take a look who on top of the pinnacle

If you get a trade  better fuck with him
I keep it gangsta  y'all testin' my patience
Got me feelin' so anxious  I be lookin' so facetious
Feel like running a caper
Spent my birthday in Dubai
Skyrise surprise and I'm dressed like a spy
Black tux  on you fucks
I hang that 6-2 sideways
Cube gave me the pistol
(I couldn't give a fuck) Literally
Cashed out just livin' to me
Blast it like a Kennedy beat
Wanna get rid of 'em? Send them to me
While I'm just over here cozy holdin' these double D's
She book smart with pornographic abilities
I got that shit!
These motherfuckers still talking? Fuck 'em!
That's why they bring X and the guillotine out
To stop these bitch niggas from runnin' their mouth

I'm ready to die  I can't control this fuckin' anger
Ah shit  somebody better fuckin' stop me
Cause I'm a loose cannon that can't stand myself
I'm bad for my own health
You niggas really think I give a fuck about somebody else
(Fuck 'em!)
I swear to God  I'mma lose it
Baby  baby! What the fuck are you doing? Put the gun down! Really? Are you doin' this shit to me again?

Now I'ma kick up dust as I begin to bust
Or get slapped with the swiftness

Knockin' 'em out their socks and 'cause Robin is rockin'
Breakin' 'em down to the slab
Takin' 'em down on their ass

Deadly as Jason on Friday the 13th

Black soldier here to teach and mold ya
Maniac with a gat

Don't let me find out the bitch in you
Don't let me find out the snitch in you
Fame and fortune is not your forte
Fuck the world now  I'm done with foreplay
Doctor's orders: go fuck yourself
Take two of these in the mornin'  overdose and kill yourself
Doctor's orders
Listen  this is my evaluation
This shit oversaturated  y'all can get evacuated
Kids sippin' Actavis and they ain't even activated
Married to the Internet  stuck in place  salivatin'
Ain't nobody graduatin'
Don't nobody love this shit the way I love it
That's why I gotta hate it
Everybody out for fame  that ain't no exaggeration
Damn  I'm gettin' aggravated
Fuck  I'm gettin' agitated
Teachers so underpaid in these fuckin' schools
The police got our name in all they databases
Girls be thirteen actin' twenty-two
Niggas be forty-four actin' half they ages
Somebody tell me  what the fuck is goin' on?
These niggas in tight shit  I'm in the fuckin' Matrix
It's lookin' like a sign of the revelation
'Bout time of the return of the fuckin' greatest
I got all these patients  man
How come they ain't patient with me?
They just think I want the money
Why? When I can't take it with me
Y'all don't do it for the love  for the love not

But when you look in the mirror your credibility’s gone now
I'd rather be hated on for who I am
Than to be loved for who I'm not  that's word to Doc
Fame and fortune is not your forte
Fuck the world now  I'm done with foreplay
Doctor's orders: go fuck yourself
Take two of these in the mornin'  overdose and kill yourself
In the beginning a few of the people who had a problem I was this good scoffed  I just shook off
Prob'ly reminded you of the first time you saw Tiger Woods golf
Never thought about how much my race and nationality meant
But based on how I ascended
See how plain it was now  they want me to jet
But no one really gave a fuck about my descent  'til I took off
Mistook me because I looked soft
But I stood tall  I just followed the Doctor's orders
So I rose and grew balls  told these hoes to screw off
Decided opposing you is what I'm ‘posed to do  all's
I did was say what I'm feeling when the vocal booth calls
And had you on pins and needles when I spoke to you all
You felt my pain  it's almost like I poked voodoo dolls
And I hope my spirit haunts the studios when I'm gone
My picture jumps off a poster and just floats through the halls
And fuckin' goes through the walls like the ghost of Lou Rawls
Karma's headed for Armageddon
The drama setter  I'm going in  already got an arm and head in
Whoever said words are just words ain't heard me word 'em
I give a fuck if my image even ends up taking a personal hit
Whoever I hurt or whatever bridges I burned in this bitch
And whatever bitches feel like they didn't deserve what they get
And whatever consequences come with every verse
It's worth it  so Doc  turn the beat on
Whose turn is it to get murdered on it?
And here's to all the years I spent toein' a line to overtime
As sure as a mole is blind
In my mind I'm still underground as a groundhog
And I'ma go for mine  like a whole furrow just tryna dig up some gold and diamonds and coal to find
No signs of slowin'  these lines are my 9's
I just load up the most rhymes and open fire with a closed mind
All I needed was someone to co-sign
Been a Doctor's assault rifle
With the sniper scope for this whole time
Pain in the ass  you'll get shot in the ass with a paint gun
Ain't no one safe from  non-believers there ain't none
I even make the bitches I rape cum
I'm waitin' on someone to say somethin'
Dre  make the bass pump!
And let the tape run for old time's sake!
I spit it straight through  this is take one
The moment you're waitin' for has come  but the—
Fame and fortune is not your forte
Fuck the world now  I'm done with foreplay
Doctor's orders: go fuck yourself
Take two of these in the mornin'  overdose and kill yourself
Doctor's orders  Doctor's orders
 with the howlin' wind
 frozen in sin
 swift silent and deadly
 I know your every movement
 wasn't flattering enough
 as a Farmer John pig

Ready to make an entrance so back on up
'Cause you know we're 'bout to rip shit up
Give me the microphone first  so I can bust like a bubble
Compton and Long Beach together  now you know you in trouble
Ain't nothin' but a G thang  baby
Two loced out niggas goin' crazy
Death Row is the label that pays me
Unfadeable so please don't try to fade this (Hell yeah)
But  um  back to the lecture at hand
Perfection is perfected  so I'ma let 'em understand
From a young G's perspective
And before me dig out a bitch  I have to find a contraceptive
You never know  she could be earnin' her man and learnin' her man
And at the same time burnin' her man
Now  you know I ain't with that shit  Lieutenant
Ain't no pussy good enough to get burnt while I'm up in it (Yeah)
And that's realer than Real-Deal Holyfield
And now you hookers and hoes know how I feel
Well  if it's good enough to get broke off a proper chunk
I'll take a small piece of some of that funky stuff

With a producer who can rap and control the micstro
At the same time with the dope rhyme that I kick
You know and I know  I flow some old funky shit
To add to my collection  the selection
Symbolizes dope  take a toke  but don't choke

Gotta give 'em what they want (What's that  G?)
We gotta break 'em off somethin' (Hell yeah)
And it's gotta be bumpin' (City of Compton)
Is where it takes place  so when asked  your attention
Mobbin' like a motherfucker but I ain't lynchin'
Droppin' the funky shit that's makin' the sucker niggas mumble
When I'm on the mic  it's like a cookie  they all crumble
Try to get close and your ass'll get smacked
My motherfuckin' homie Doggy Dogg has got my back
Never let me slip  'cause if I slip  then I'm slippin'
But if I got my nina  then you know I'm straight trippin'
And I'ma continue to put the rap down  put the mack down
And if you bitches talk shit  I have to put the smack down
Yeah  and you don't stop
I told you I'm just like a clock when I tick and I tock
But I'm never off  always on to the break of dawn
C-O-M-P-T-O-N and the city they call Long Beach

Dre and Snoop gettin' chronics in the 'Lac (In the 'Lac)
South Central out to the West Side (West Side)
With my jeans on and my team's strong
Get my drink on and my smoke on
(West West y'all)
Yeah  L.A. niggas
L.A. niggas rule the world  nigga
Y'all niggas gotta recognize  you know what I’m sayin’?
Niggas don't wanna peep game  you know what I’m sayin’?
But this shit come all the way back around here
My nigga Dre  droppin' heat rocks on y'all bitch-ass
You know what I’m sayin’? You gotta recognize
Recognize this  peep game
Now in my younger days  I used to sport a rag
Backpack full of cans  plus a four-four mag
G'd up from the feet up
Blue'd up from the shoe up  how I grew up
Loc'n  smokin' and drinkin' til we threw up ('til we threw up)
Ditching my class  just to fuck yo' school up
But don't sleep  young niggas quick to shoot you
Now there's another motherfucker with no future
But Time Bomb much smoother when I maneuver  dope like Cuba
Got 'em jumpin'  Disciples to the Hoover

I'm coming Straight Outta Compton with a loose cannon
Smoke big green  call it Bruce Banner
Watch your manners  at last  another blast from the top notch
From way back with the pop rocks  I pop lock witcha
Picture this: Dr. Dre twisting wit' Tha Liks
And Hittman bought a fix
Don't trip  it's a Time Bomb in this bitch
Wait a minute  it's on  I tell it like a true mackadelic
Weed and cocaine sold separate  check it
From sundown to sunup  clown and run up
The Aftermath'll be two in your gut  nigga what?
Requirements for survival each day in L.A.!
It don't stop  we still mash in hot pursuit from the cops
Analyze why we act this way in L.A.!
They call me Hitt 'cause I spit like gats do
Cock me back
Bust caps for my Macz Crew  at Fairfax
We used to wear Air Max shoes  that's true
But I grew up where niggas jack you  harass you
Blast you for that set you claim (where you from?)
Mash on you for your Turkish chain  C.K. B.K
Blue'd up or flame  I ran wit a gang
I helped niggas get jacked for they Dana Danes
My pants hang below my waistline
I look humble  wanna rumble? (yeah  yeah)
I bang though  like Vince Carter from the baseline
Don't waste my time
Fuck a scrap in killa Cali  AKs and 9s
One-times  sunshines and fine-ass bitches
I was raised in the hood called WHAT-THE-DIF'
Where the brothers in the hood refused to go Hollywood
Slugs for the fuck of it
Anybody hatin' on us can suck a dick
It's AvireX-to-the-Z
Fuckin' with me might get you banned from TV
What? So neither do I  I'm bad for your health
Like puttin' a pistol up to your face and blastin' yourself
Five in the mornin'  burglars at my do'
Glock forty-five in my dresser drawer
Let 'em come in -  BOW  he see the thunder roll
Roll with niggas who buy fifths by the fo'
And brews by the case
Slap you in the face with the bass Dr. Dre laced
Likwit Kings with Sedans and gold rings
Haters scope the style  but can't find no openings
Requirements for survival each day in L.A.!
It don't stop  we still mash in hot pursuit from the cops
Analyze why we act this way in L.A.!
In L.A

It's still Dre Day nigga  AK nigga
Though I've grown a lot  can't keep it home a lot
'Cause when I frequent the spots that I'm known to rock
You hear the bass from the truck when I'm on the block
Ladies they pay homage  but haters say Dre fell off
How? Nigga  my last album was The Chronic (Nigga)
They wanna know if he still got it
They say rap's changed  they wanna know how I feel about it
(If you ain't up on thangs)
Dr. Dre is the name  I'm ahead of my game
Still puffin' my leaves  still fuck with the beats
Still not lovin' police (Huh-uh)
Still rock my khakis with a cuff and a crease (For sho')
Still got love for the streets  reppin' 213 (For life)

Kept my ear to the streets  signed Eminem
He's triple platinum  doin' fifty a week
Still  I stay close to the heat
And even when I was close to defeat  I rose to my feet
My life's like a soundtrack I wrote to the beat
Treat rap like Cali weed: I smoke 'til I'm 'sleep
Wake up in the A.M.  compose a beat
I bring the fire 'til you're soakin' in your seat
It's not a fluke  it's been tried  I'm the truth
Since Turn Out the Lights from the World Class Wreckin Cru

Right back up in your mothafuckin' ass
9-5 plus four pennies  add that shit up
D.R.E. right back up on top of thangs
Smoke some wit' your Dogg
Some of that real sticky-icky-icky
Ooh wee! Put it in the air!
Well  you's a fool  D-R
And all who agree are more than three 'cause they're we  haha
Yes  yo  I'm in the house now for sure
Because I wanna talk about the hearts of men
Who knows what evil lurks within them?
But let's take a travel down the blindside
And see what we find on this path called
Stranded on death row  so duck when I swing my shit
I get rugged like Rawhead Rex with fat tracks that fits
The gangster type  what I recite's kinda lethal
Niggas know the flow that I kick  there's no equal
I'm murderin' niggas  yo  and maybe because of the tone I kicks
When I grip the mic and kick shit niggas can't fuck with
So remember I go hardcore and slam
'Nough respect like a sensei  whoop ass like Van Damme
So any nigga that claim they bossin'
Why don't you bring your ass on over to Crenshaw and Slauson?
Take a walk through the hood where we up to no good
Slangin' them things like a real OG should
I'm stackin' and mackin' and packin' a ten  so
When you're slippin'  I slip the clip in  but ain't no set trippin'
'Cause it's Death Row  rollin' like the mafia
Think about whoopin' some ass  but what the fuck stoppin' you?
Ain't nothin' but a buster
I'm stranded on death row for pumpin' slugs in motherfuckers
Now you know you're outdone  feel the shotgun
Kurupt  inmate  cell block one

No prevention from this lynchin' of sorts
You're a victim from my drive-by of thoughts
No extensions  all attempts are to fail
Blinded by the light  it's time you learn braille
From a lunatic  I'm death like arsenic
When I kick a wicked rap  Dr. Dre will kick the scratch
With treachery  my literary form will blast
And totally surpass the norm
Not a storm  plural  make it many storms
In this dimension  I'm the presenter
And the inventor  and the tormentor
Deranged  like the Hillside Strangler
Emcee mangler  tough like Wrangler
I write a rhyme  hard as concrete
Step to the heat and get burned like mesquite
So what you wanna do?
The narrator RBX  cell block two
Rage  lyrical murderer
Stranded on death row and now I'm servin' a
Lifetime sentence  there'll be no repentance
Since it's the life that I choose to lead  I plead guilty
On all counts  let the ball bounce where it may
It's just another clip into my AK
Buck 'em down with my underground tactics
Facts and stacks of clips on my mattress
Bed frame  there's another dead dame
Laying lame  put to shame  who's to blame?
Me  the Lady of Rage  a woman comin'
From the D-E-A-T-H and R-O-W  takin' no shit
So flip and you're bound to get dropped
It's 1-8-7 on motherfuckers  don't stop
Handcuffed as I bust  there'll be no debate
It's Rage  from cell block H
Ayo  steppin' through the fog and creepin' through the smog
It's the number one nigga from the hood  Doggy Dogg
Making videos  now I stay in Hollywood
Bustin' raps for my snaps  now they call me Eastwood
Dre is the doctor and my homie  lil' nigga
Warren G is my hand and my hand's on the trigger
Shootin' at the hoes with the game that I got
Sent to death row 'cause I wanted to make a grip from servin' my rocks
And I'm still servin' for mine
Peace to my motherfuckin' homies doin' time
In the pen and the county jail
Mobbin' with your blues on  mad as hell
And you're sayin'  Fuck the police
And all the homies on the streets is all about peace
And it's drivin' the cops crazy
But ain't nothin' but a black thing  baby
Uh  I'm not flaggin'  but I'm just saggin'
I bet you don't wanna see the D-O-double-G
And you can't see the D-R to the E
Or my motherfuckin' homie D.O.C
You know you can't fuck with my motherfuckin' DJ
That's my homie and we call him Warren G
Yeah  and you don't stop
Doggy Dogg break 'em down with the motherfuckin' Dogg Pound
That's the only way we'll beat 'em  man
We gotta smoke 'em then choke 'em like the motherfuckin' Peterman
It's like three and to the two and two and to the one
Cell block four  peace  Doggy Dogg's done
Yo  now you know the path I'm on
You think you're strong?
See if you can travel on
'Cause only the weak will try to speak
Those who are quiet will always cause riots
There's three types of people in the world
Those who don't know what happened
Those who wonder what happened
Off the top I wish a nigga would try a nigga
Y'all niggas bad business
That's why the game all fucked up
Ridin' through your neighborhood
Throwin' money out the window like What!?
You about the dollar (You know nothin' 'bout it)
Your poor life been without it
My life in the spotlight
Tell these mothafuckas we don't even wanna talk about it—what?
I just bought California
Them other states ain't far behind it either
I remember selling instrumentals off a beeper
Millionaire before the headphones or the speakers
I was getting money 'fore the internet
Still got Eminem checks I ain't opened yet
M.V.P. shit—this is where the trophies at
But Andre young enough to still get involved
And Andre still young enough to say fuck y'all

It's jumping off in Compton so I gots to get my loot on
And come up on me some furniture or somethin'
Got a VCR in the back of my car
That I ganked from the Slauson Swap Meet
And motherfuckers better not try to stop me
'Cause they will see that I can't be stopped
'Cause I'ma cock my Glock and pop 'til they all drop
People in the crowd throwing things at the officers
And swinging at them as well
At an officer with some object in her hand
How many niggas are ready to loot?
Got myself an Uzi and my brother a nine
Can't get prints on a nine I throw away
Or get prints on my Uzi when it spray
Bust one to his head while he munches on a donut

To catch me and stretch me on Death Row

And mi don't give a fuck
And all my problems end with that buck-buck
A message to God
Since you finishing em early  what possessed you to start him?
We made a vow - later we'll regret til death do us part
Lord  I thought we was made for each other
You shouldn't connect those  made to be taken away from each other
Now what I'm supposed to do? I'm only half the man that I was
I'll never last  cause my better half is up there with you
You knew what you was doing when you made us  so with all due respect
You coulda forgave him  you didn't have to take him
He can take the game with him  cause he defines the word
The one who puts the G in it  who you think put me in it?
I'm feeling like my whole world is blinded  wondering why
Crying  pouring out my heart  pouring out liquor behind it
We fought like brothers  something we never should do
We coulda used time spent arguing telling the truth
He had talent too - I had plans on watching him blow
Don't know what hurts more  seeing him leave  or watching him go
