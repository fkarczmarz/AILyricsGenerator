lyrics
"I drank a little too much again
Now I'm stuck in your bed again
But this feeling is so damn good
Guess I'm loving it more than I should
I know I should leave
But when you are next to me  deep asleep
Your skin on my skin
Can't help the way I feel  ooh
When I hold you close to me
I want you to
'Cause I'm not the one to love
Oh my god  here we are
I'm fallin' deeper into this mess
Yeah  I know I shouldn't get undressed
We both know this ain't right
It's a little too dangerous  this little thing between us

I know I should leave
But when you are next to me  half asleep
Your skin on my skin
Can't help the way I feel  ooh
When I hold you close to me
I want you to
'Cause I'm not the one to love
I want you to
I want you to
I want you to
I know I should leave
But when you are next to me  half asleep
Your skin on my skin
I want you to
'Cause I'm not the one to love
I want you to
I want you to
I want you to
Desire  two souls on fire
You got me out here looking foolish
Look like a dog  I'm drooling
And you know just the way to do it
You gon' make me pop some tags  fashion season
You gon' make me do those moves  stop your breathin'
If you losing faith  I make you believe it
Got me feeling some type of way (Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
Got a chain on my heart  and it's spinnin' in diamonds
Desire  two souls on fire
Make me feel some type of way
Desire  two souls on fire
Feel some type of way
Desire  two souls on fire
Make me feel some type of way
Desire  two souls on fire

We can drive the latest cars  no mileage

If you don't break my heart  I'll let you inside it
Got me feeling some type of way (Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
Got a chain on my heart and it's spinnin' in diamonds
And that chain around your heart got me blinded
Desire  two souls on fire
Make me feel some type of way
Desire  two souls on fire
Feel some type of way
Desire  two souls on fire
Make me feel some type of way
Desire  two souls on fire
Do I make you feel some type of way?

We were tripping  we were so high
When you told me that you love me  were you bluffin'?
Was it nothing?
Now you're so dry
You can tell me that you're sorry  but I know that you don't mean it
Baby  don't lie
Don't lie
Baby  don't lie
And I can't blame myself for getting lost inside the promise of you
And I can't blame you leaving
'Cause what's meant to be will always be true
There isn't enough love in the atmosphere to keep you here  ahh
There isn't enough love in the atmosphere
Don't leave me here all alone
I ride for my baby
I died for my baby
I'd die for my baby  no lie
There isn't enough love in the atmosphere
In the atmosphere

If there's winners and losers  then I'll be the loser
I'm still here  I choose ya
I don't want another  if we can't have each other
'Cause baby  I love ya
Maybe then I'll be with you
If there's winners and losers  then I'll be the loser
I'm still here  I choose ya
There isn't enough love in the atmosphere to keep you here  ahh
There isn't enough love in the atmosphere
Don't leave me here all alone
I ride for my baby
I died for my baby
I'd die for my baby  no lie
There isn't enough love in the atmosphere
Went from beautiful to ugly
'Cause insecurity told me you don't love me
All it takes is a girl above me
On your timeline to make me nothing
This is me  a woman in dichotomy
I love me until I don't
Baby  I'm jealous
Of the pictures that you like
Baby  I'm jealous
Of the girls with lighter eyes
Baby  I'm jealous (Ooh)
And I know that it ain't right

Won't be the last
To let you know  but he gon' show you

Hiding in the shadows from my destiny
And you saw things that no one else could see
You saved me when I was my worst enemy
It feels so good to be alive
Just you and me tonight
Don't wake me up from this high
What a beautiful life
I heard your heart call mine
And then all the stars aligned
Don't wake me up from this high
What a beautiful life
Spread through me like a wild flame
I feel it in my veins
I'll never ever be the same
I'll never be the same
Cheers to the thing money can't buy
Can't buy what I feel inside
This thing  I can't deny
Our pretty little paradise

Fake some love and take somebody home
Kiss a stranger just to have a taste
But I should probably make better mistakes
I could smile and lie right through my teeth
And say that you're the only one for me
Stay the night and leave without a trace
But I should probably make better mistakes
Oh-oh
Somewhere between the tears and laughter
I should probably make better mistakes
I should finally listen to my friends
And stop thinking I know better than them
So I should probably make better mistakes

Can we start to slow it down?
Can we learn to live right now?

'Cause love don't live here anymore
And we fought hard but we lost the war

So I'll leave the nightlight on
In hopes that you will find your way
And make it safely home
And in the eye of the storm
Our love will be the only thing
That keeps us holding on
I'm a lost river that'll never reach the sea
But I couldn't leave you 'cause you treated me so damn right
There was nothing wrong with you
The truth is you're a damn good guy
But I knew from the moment that I met you  this wasn't right
And you had money and cars  looked like a star
You loved me so good  I could cry
Bought me roses and rings  such beautiful things
But I was taught never to lie
I hate to see the look on your face
I wish I could make myself stay
But our hearts don't live in the same space
So tell me how to break yours with grace
(So tell me how to break yours with grace)
I knew from the moment that I left you  you'd be alright
You're gonna find another lover  one who doesn't waste your time
I swear I wouldn't leave with you  but I just came to say goodbye

Can't seem to get it right  this crazy life
Broken promises  now realize
Solo ride until I die
'Cause I got me for life
Whoo  I don't need a hand to hold
Even when the night is cold
I got that fire in my soul
I don't need anything to get me through the night
Except the beat that's in my heart
Yeah  it's keeping me alive
I don't need anything to make me satisfied
'Cause the music does me good and it gets me every time

I'm in a better place  a little sweeter now
