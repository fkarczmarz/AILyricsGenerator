lyrics
"Since the day they got married
He'd been praying for a little baby boy
Someone he could take fishing
Throw the football and be his pride and joy
He could already see him holding that trophy
Taking his team to state
But when the nurse came in with a little pink blanket
All those big dreams changed
And now he's wrapped around her finger
She's the center of his whole world
And his heart belongs to that sweet little
Beautiful  wonderful  perfect All-American girl
Sixteen short years later
She was falling for the senior football star
Before you knew it  he was dropping passes
Skipping practice just to spend more time with her
The coach said  Hey  son  what's your problem?
Tell me  have you lost your mind?
And Daddy said  You'll lose your free ride to college
Boy  you better tell her goodbye

But now he's wrapped around her finger
She's the center of his whole world
And his heart belongs to that sweet little
Beautiful  wonderful  perfect All-American
And when they got married and decided to have one of their own
She said  Be honest  tell me what you want
And he said  Honey  you oughta know
Sweet little  beautiful  one just like you
Oh  a beautiful  wonderful  perfect All-American
Now he's wrapped around her finger
She's the center of his whole world
And his heart belongs to that sweet little
Beautiful  wonderful  perfect All-American girl
Too much has gone wrong and we should move on
That's what we both said
There's a million reasons why we said goodbye
Why we couldn't try  couldn't fight for it anymore
Put your ring in the back of the dresser drawer
And we closed that door
So why am I 2 A.M. pickin' up my phone
And you're standin' in my porch light
Backsliding
Wearin' your old t-shirt in the mornin'  it feels so right
Backsliding
We say we won't  but then we do
The same old thing  fallin' right back in
Say it's gonna be the last time
Backsliding  I'm backsliding
Backsliding  I'm backsliding
Well  I heard that you've been hangin' around with someone new
Yeah  word gets around in such a small town
Bet you heard I'm seein' someone too
There's a million reasons why we should be happy
Not lookin' back  livin' in the past anymore
But they ain't addin' up  I guess they ain't enough
'Cause here I am

With a bleached-blonde tramp
And she's probably getting frisky
Right now  he's probably buying her some fruity little drink
'Cause she can't shoot a whiskey
Right now  he's probably up behind her with a pool-stick
Showing her how to shoot a combo
And he don't know
I dug my key into the side
Of his pretty little souped up four-wheel drive
Carved my name into his leather seats
I took a Louisville Slugger to both headlights
Slashed a hole in all four tires
Maybe next time  he'll think before he cheats
Right now  she's probably up singing some
White-trash version of Shania karaoke
And he's a thinking that he's gonna get lucky
Right now  he's probably dabbing on
Three dollars worth of that bathroom Polo
Oh  and he don't know

Those storm clouds gather in her eyes
Her daddy was a mean old mister
Mama was an angel in the ground
The weatherman called for a twister
She prayed blow it down
There's not enough rain in Oklahoma
To wash the sins out of that house
There's not enough wind in Oklahoma
To rip the nails out of the past
Shatter every window 'til it's all blown away
Every tear-soaked whiskey memory blown away
Blown away (Blown away)

She locked herself in the cellar
Listened to the screamin' of the wind
Some people called it taking shelter
She called it sweet revenge

Since Cassie O'Grady disappeared
And me and Bobby Shaver been in all the newspapers
Every day for nigh on a year
They say we got tangled in a love triangle
A fatal game of truth or dare
But the truth remains a mystery and now it's ancient history
It's a Choctaw County affair
It's just a Choctaw County affair (Choctaw County affair)
Well  people talkin' 'bout it everywhere (Choctaw County affair)
Well  Cassie O'Grady was no Southern lady
Despite all the media hype
They all loved to make her out like a sweet little devout
All-American cheerleader type
But her mind was cattywampus
She was greedy  she was pompous
Strutting 'round with her nose in the air
She was a cold gold-digger tickling a hair trigger
It's a Choctaw County affair
It's just a Choctaw County affair (Choctaw County affair)
And now they say she's lying dead somewhere (Choctaw County affair)

When she threatened us with blackmail
She said she had some information that would wreck my reputation
And land Bobby back in jail
Now it's best to remember Bobby Shaver's got a temper
Like a buck-shot grizzly bear
But there's no body  there's no witness
So y'all go mind your business
It's a Choctaw County affair
It's just a Choctaw County affair (Choctaw County affair)
Oh  you mess with Bobby and you better beware (Choctaw County affair)
Yeah yeah-yeah
Well  the press went wild on the day of the trial
When they put us on the witness stand
They thought we'd turn on each other  but soon they all discovered
We would live or die  hand in hand
And that fancy D.A. from down Jackson way
Said he'd see us in the electric chair  ha
(Choctaw County affair)
How would you know 'cause you weren't there (Choctaw County affair)
It's just a Choctaw County affair (Choctaw County affair)
Out in the shack with a blue tick hound
Broke as hell  but blessed with beauty
The kind that a rich man can't turn down
She caught the eye of an oil man dancing
One summer night in a dime store dress
She had the looks  he had the mansion
And you can figure out the rest
It was all roses  drippin' in diamonds
Sippin' on champagne
She was all uptown  wearing that white gown
Takin' his last name
She could hear those church bells ringin'  ringin'
Fold your hands and close your eyes
Yeah  it's all gonna be alright
And just listen to the church bells ringin'  ringin'
Yeah  they're ringin'
Jenny was hosting Junior League parties
And havin' dinner at the country club
Everyone thought they were Ken and Barbie
But Ken was always gettin' way too drunk
Saturday night  after a few too many
He came home ready to fight
And all his money could never save Jenny
From the devil livin' in his eyes

Jenny slipped somethin' in his Tennessee whiskey
No law man was ever gonna find
And how he died is still a mystery
But he hit a woman for the very last time
She could hear those church bells ringin'  ringin'
Standin' there in a black dress singin'  singin'
Fold your hands and close your eyes
Yeah  it's all gonna be alright

You better take it from me
That boy is like a disease
And you're wonderin' why you can't get free
He's like a curse  he's like a drug
You'll get addicted to his love
You wanna get out  but he's holding you down
'Cause you can't live without one more touch
He's a  a good time cowboy Casanova
Leaning up against the record machine
He looks like a cool drink of water  but he's candy-coated misery
He's the Devil in disguise  a snake with blue eyes
And he only comes out at night
Gives you feelings that you don't wanna fight
You better run for your life

Not usually the kind to show my heart to the world

I hold my composure  for worse or for better
So I apologize if you don't like what you see
But sometimes my emotions get the best of me
And falling apart is as human as it gets
You can't hide it  you can't fight what the truth is
You can pretty lie and say it's okay
You can pretty smile and just walk away
Pretty much fake your way through anything
But you can't cry pretty
Oh no  you can’t dress it up in lace or rhinestones
It don't matter if you're in a crowd or home all alone
Yeah  it's all the same when you're looking in the mirror
A picture of pain  so let it flow like a river
You can pretty lie and say it's okay
You can pretty smile and just walk away

But you can't cry pretty

Let me make one thing clear  you can buy me a beer
But you ain't taking me home

To shed a few tears on my own
But sitting there across the room  I couldn't help but notice you
Seem a little down on your luck too
Yeah  my heart might be breakin'  but this seat ain't taken
And you've got me thinkin'
We should be drinkin' alone  together
Drownin' the pain is better
With somebody else who got problems  we ain't gonna solve 'em
But misery loves company
Tonight all I need is a stranger
Lips with a whiskey chaser
And a corner booth kiss to make me forget that he's gone
I don't know what she did to make you hurt like this
But  I know just what to do
It starts with a bottle of good Reposado
And ends with a shooter or two
Tomorrow when the sun comes up  tonight’s the night that never was

On a snow-white Christmas Eve
Goin' home to see her mama and her daddy
With the baby in the backseat
Fifty miles to go and she was runnin' low
On faith and gasoline
It'd been a long hard year
She had a lot on her mind and she didn't pay attention
She was goin' way too fast
Before she knew it
She was spinnin' on a thin black sheet of glass
She saw both their lives flash before her eyes
She didn't even have time to cry
She was so scared
She threw her hands up in the air
Take it from my hands
'Cause I can't do this on my own
I'm letting go
So give me one more chance
Save me from this road I'm on

And the car came to a stop
She cried when she saw that baby in the backseat
Sleepin' like a rock
And for the first time in a long time

I've been livin' my life
I know I've got to change
So from now on tonight
Take it from my hands
'Cause I can't do this on my own

So give me one more chance
Save me from this road I'm on
So give me one more chance

 tryin' to hide the tears
 she just couldn't believe it
 why'd you leave me? Why'd you have to go?
 now I'll never know
 standin' in the background
 Let us bow our heads and pray
 please lift his soul and heal this hurt
 and what could have been
 why'd you leave me? Why'd you have to go?

It's two kids flyin' down the hall
In the mornin' into our bedroom
It's a creaky board on the front porch
You swear you're gonna fix it soon
It's a kitchen table where we say our prayers
Give a little thanks to the man upstairs
And it ain't a mansion on a hill
It's perfectly imperfect
It's worth more than it's worth
This is our kingdom
Wouldn't sleep until we work things out

I had no clue what I was getting into
So  I'll blame it on the Cuervo
Oh  where did my manners go?
And I don't even know his last name
Oh  my mama would be so ashamed
And I don't even know his last name
Here we go!

Mmm  today  I woke up thinking about Elvis somewhere in Vegas
I'm not sure how I got here
Or how this ring on my left hand just appeared outta nowhere
I gotta go
I take the chips and the Pinto and hit the road
They say what happens here  stays here  all of this will disappear
There's just one little problem
I don't even know my last name
Oh  my mama would be so ashamed
And then it turned into  Oh  no! What have I done?

Tiptoeing 'round the house in her mama's shoes
Coloring her lips red in her bedroom
Prom queen wants to be like the magazines
Thinks she found her king  barely seventeen
Too much that the world's wanting you to do
When you're still just a child in your mama's shoes

She held on to that heart shaped locket
Staring at a family flawless
But it ain't a pretty picture tonight
Mom and daddy just wouldn't stop it
Fighting at the drop of a faucet
Cuts through the walls catastrophic
She's caught in the crossfire (Crossfire)
Puts her hands over her ears
Starts talking through her tears
I wish words were like little toy guns

Leave the plastic pistols in the front yard
Throw away the score card and just turn off all the noise

Something missing in my soul

Life has a way of showing you just what you need
And who you were made to be  yeah
I finally found what I never knew I always wanted
I couldn't see  I was blind 'til my eyes were opened
I didn't know there was a hole
Something missing in my soul
'Til you filled it up with your love
(Yeah  yeah)
(Yeah  yeah)
I never was the kind to think about dressin' in white"
