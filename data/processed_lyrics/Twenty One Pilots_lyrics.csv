lyrics
"I know I haven't been the best of sons
Hello  I've been travelin' in the deserts of my mind
And I haven't found a drop of life
I haven't found a drop of You
I haven't found a drop
I haven't found a drop of water
Water
Oh
Oh
I try desperately to run through the sand
As I hold the water in the palm of my hand
'Cause it's all that I have and it's all that I need
And the waves of the water mean nothing to me
But I try my best and all that I can to
Hold tightly onto what's left in my hand
But no matter how  how tightly I will strain
The sand will slow me down and the water will drain
As an addict with a pen who's addicted to the wind
End of my ways as a walking denial
My trial was filed as a crazy  suicidal head-case
And I'm lyin' here just cryin'  so wash me with Your water

Water
Oh
Hello  I haven't talked in quite some time
I know I haven't been the best of sons
Hello  I've been travelin' in the deserts of my mind
And I  I haven't found a drop of life
I haven't found a drop of You
I haven't found a drop
But I know that I'm goin' low
I'm a ban—I'm a bandito
I could take the high road
But I know that I'm goin' low
I'm a ban—I'm a bandito
I could take the high road
But I know that I'm goin' low
I'm a ban—I'm a bandito
This is the sound we make
When in between two places
Where we used to bleed
And where our blood needs to be
I could take the high road
But I know that I'm goin' low
I'm a ban—I'm a bandito
I could take the high road
But I know that I'm goin' low
I'm a ban—I'm a bandito
But I recently discovered it's a heatless fire
Like nicknames they give themselves to uninspire
But I'm still not sure if fear's a rival or close relative to truth
Either way it helps to hear these words bounce off of you
The softest echo could be enough for me to make it through

My lungs will fill and then deflate
To replace that slot with what I once bought
'Cause somebody stole my car radio
And now I just sit in silence
Sometimes quiet is violent
Reminding me of who I killed inside my dream

I ponder of something terrifying
'Cause this time there's no sound to hide behind
I find over the course of our human existence
One thing consists of consistence
And it's that we're all battling fear
I liked it better when my car had sound
There are things we can do
But from the things that work there are only two
And-a from the two that we choose to do
Peace will win and fear will lose
And there's faith and there's sleep
Faith is to be awake and to be awake is for us to think
And for us to think is to be alive
And I will try with every rhyme
To come across like I am dying
To let you know you need to try to think
To replace that slot with what I once bought
'Cause somebody stole my car radio
And now I just sit in silence
And now I just sit in silence
And now I just sit in silence
And now I just sit
And now I just sit in silence
And now I just sit in silence
And now I just sit in silence
And now I just sit
I ponder of something great
My lungs will fill and then deflate
To replace that slot with what I once bought

It's been a little while
Sippin' on straight chlorine
Let the vibe slide over me
I'll be back when it's all complete

Like a little splinter buried in your skin
Someone else can carve it out but when you've got the pin
It hurts a little less and you can even push it further in
When your body's screamin' out  trust your mind's listenin'
Like a silhouette that you can barely see
As a shadow cast upon the ground where you'll eventually
Lay forever  but the day goes on  the sun moves behind you
If you decide all is well
I'll keep on tryin'  might as well (Might as well)

Empathy might be on the brink of extinction
They will play a game
And say they know what you're going through
And I tried to come up with an artistic way to say
They don't know you
And neither do I

Hates what he believes and loves it at the same time
Here's my brother
Time gains momentum the moment when I'm living in 'em
A re-beginning moment's mending memories
Pretending enemies are friends of me
Sending me straight to bending me
My bad behavior but I bet I could have been a better man
But I bet I'll battle with 'em battle
Leave me alone!

Honest  there's a few songs on this record that feel common
I'm in constant confrontation with what I want and what is poppin'

In that slot  I won't need to replace
This culture is a poacher of overexposure  not today
Don't feed me to the vultures  I am a vulture who feeds on pain
Sleep in a well-lit room  don't let the shadow through

Thank God it's Friday 'cause Fridays will always be better than Sundays
'Cause Sundays are my suicide days

I wish I had a better voice that sang some better words
I wish I found some chords in an order that is new
I wish I didn't have to rhyme every time I sang
My name's Blurryface and I care what you think
My name's Blurryface and I care what you think
Wish we could turn back time to the good old days
Wish we could turn back time (Oh) to the good old days (Oh)
We're stressed out
Sometimes a certain smell will take me back to when I was young
How come I'm never able to identify where it's comin' from?
But it would remind us of when nothing really mattered

Wish we could turn back time (Oh) to the good old days (Oh)
We would build a rocket ship and then we'd fly it far away
And fill up every hole inside my mind
And I want everyone to know
That I am half a soul divided
Until my dyin' days
And if I'm not there and I'm far away
We're goin' home
I wanna strip myself of breath
A breathless piece of death I've made for you
A mortal rotting piece of song
Until my dyin' days
And if I'm not there and I'm far away
We're goin' home

(Okay)
So the hearse ran out of gas
The passenger person grabbed a map
And the driver inside it contrived a new route to save the past
And checked his watch and grabbed a cab
A beautifully planned taxi cab
And two men started to unpack
And then I heard one of them say
I know the night will turn to gray
I know the stars will start to fade
When all the darkness fades away
We had to steal him from his fate
So he could see another day
And then I cracked open my box
Someone must have picked the lock
A little light revealed the spot where my fingernails had fought
Then I sat up off the floor
And found the breath I was searchin' for
Then there were three men up front
All I saw were backs of heads
Or am I dreaming dead?
Then one turned around to say
Where all your blood is washed away
And all you did will be undone
Sometimes you gotta bleed to know
That you're alive and have a soul
But it takes someone to come around to show you how
Than I've ever been
The songs on the radio are okay
But my taste in music is your face
And it takes a song to come around to show you how
Than I've ever been

My interior world needs to sanitize
I've got to step through or I’ll dissipate
I'll record my step through for my basement tapes
Nice to know my kind will be on my side
I don't believe the hype
And you know you’re a terrible sight
But you'll be just fine
Just don't believe the hype
Yeah  they might be talking behind your head
Your exterior world can step off instead
It might take some friends and a warmer shirt
But you don't get thick skin without getting burnt

I don't believe the hype
And you know you're a terrible sight

When the leader of the bad guys sang
Something soft and soaked in pain
I heard the echo from his secret hideaway
He must've forgot to close his door
As he cranked out those dismal chords
And his four walls declared him insane
I found my way  right time  wrong place
As I pled my case
You're the judge  oh no
Set me free
You're the judge  oh no
Set me free
I know my soul's freezing
Hell's hot for good reason
So please  take me

Three lights are lit  but the fourth one's out
I can tell 'cause it's a bit darker than the last night's bout
I forgot about the drought of light bulbs in this house
So I head out down a route I think is heading south
But I'm not good with directions and I hide behind my mouth
I'm a pro at imperfections and I'm best friends with my doubt
And now that my mind's out and now I hear it clear and loud
I'm thinking Wow  I probably should've stayed inside my house
I found my way  right time  wrong place
As I pled my case

Your grandpa died when you were nine
They said he had lost his mind
You have learned way too soon
You should never trust the Pantaloon
Now it's your turn to be alone
Find a wife and build yourself a home
You have learned way too soon
That your dad is now the Pantaloon
You are tired  you are hurt
A moth ate through your favorite shirt
And all your friends fertilize the ground you walk
Lose your mind
He's seen too many stare downs
Between the sun and the moon
In the morning air  how
He used to hustle all the people
Walking through the fairgrounds
He's been around so long
He's changed his meaning of a chair now
Because a chair now
Is like a tiny island in the sea of all the people
Who glide across the very surface
That made his bones feeble
The end can't come soon enough
But is it too soon?
Either way he can't deny
He is a Pantaloon

It's warmer in the morning
Than what it is at night
Your bones are held together
By your nightmares and your frights
You are tired  you are hurt
A moth ate through your favorite shirt
