lyrics
" maybe not long enough
 dancin' like no one's there
 I love you under my breath
 oh
 I'm scared I'll miss too much
 I'd rather fall in love
 I feel out of touch
 I'm scared I'll miss too much
 I'd rather fall in love
 oh
 I met my biggest blessin'
 look what God has done
 I love you under my breath
 oh
 I'm scared I'll miss too much
 I'd rather fall in love
 I feel out of touch
 I'm scared I'll miss too much
 I'd rather fall in love
I quit tryna figure it out
Nothin' like havin' someone for you
Someone beside you when it's time to lay down
Open up my eyes to a feelin' I can't ignore
I need you all around me
I need you all around me
Wouldn't wanna be in any other place
From my home to the road
I'll make sure you're comfortable
You make sure I'm comfortable
Our love's unconditional
I need you all around me
Never thought I could ever be loyal
To someone other than myself
I never thought I could ever be a spoiler
Guess anything is possible with your help
Anything's possible since you made my heart melt
Gave me the best hand that I'd ever been dealt

Open up my eyes to a feelin' I can't ignore

Wouldn't wanna be in any other place
From my home to the road
I'll make sure you're comfortable
You make sure I'm comfortable
Our love's unconditional
I need you all around me
I need you to shine in my life
Better believe it
Oh-oh  whenever you're not in my presence
It feels like I'm missing my blessings  yeah
So I sleep through the daylight  stay awake all night
You think I'm biased to my significant other
You hit it right on the head  only been missing my lover
Got a whole lot of texts in my phone  and I don't reply
But the next eight bars tell you why
Ain't worried about nobody else
If I ain't with you  I ain't myself
You make me complete
There ain't no I in team
You make me complete  you're all that matters to me
Take the gas out the car  it won't drive
That's how I feel when you're not by my side
When I wake up in the morning up under you
And only you
Oh-oh  I'm grateful for your existence
Faithful no matter the distance
You're the only girl I see
From the bottom of my heart  please believe

See me like breath in the cold
Sleep with me here in the silence
So just hold on like you will never let go
I need to make sure you know that
Not anyone
Forever's not enough time to (Oh)
Love you the way that I want (Love you the way that I want)
I fear the day that I don't

And I just can't believe my first love won't be around  and I'm like
I thought you'd always be mine  mine
I thought you'd always be mine  mine (Luda!)
When I was thirteen  I had my first love
There was nobody that compared to my baby  and nobody came between us nor could ever come above
She woke me up daily  don't need no Starbucks (Woo)
She made my heart pound  and skip a beat when I see her in the street and
At school on the playground  but I really wanna see her on the weekend
She knows she got me dazing 'cause she was so amazing
And now my heart is breakin'  but I just keep on sayin'
I thought you'd always be mine  mine
I thought you'd always be mine  mine
I'm gone (Yeah-yeah-yeah  yeah-yeah-yeah)
Now I'm all gone (Yeah-yeah-yeah  yeah-yeah-yeah)
Now I'm all gone (Yeah-yeah-yeah  yeah-yeah-yeah)
Starting to forget the way you look at me now
Over the mountains  across the sky
Need to see your face  I need to look in your eyes
Through the storm and through the clouds
Bumps in the road  and upside down now
I know it's hard to be asleep at night
Don't you worry  'cause everything's gonna be alright
Be alright
Through the sorrow and the fights
Don't you worry  'cause everything's gonna be alright
Be alright
All alone in my room
Waiting for your phone call to come soon
To be in your arms holding my heart
And everything's gonna be alright
Be alright
Through the long nights and the bright lights
Don't you worry  'cause everything's gonna be alright
Be alright

Don't you worry  'cause everything's gonna be alright
Be alright
Through the sorrow and the fights
Don't you worry

Gone in an instance
Blink of an eye
No goodbye

Deep as the ocean
Blue like the sky
Oh my
Like a permanent stain
Hate our love was in vein
But we're the blame
For all the pain

Swag swag swag  on you
Chillin' by the fire while we eating fondue

It's hard to believe I'm the person you think I am

I'm on my ten thousandth life
Nine thousand nine hundred ninety-nine slipped my hands
But this the one I'm not givin' up
Night after night you fall asleep on me
I'm prayin' that I don't go back to who I was
I feel like I don't deserve you tonight (Tonight)
It's in the way that you hold me
I don't deserve you tonight (Tonight)
It's in the things that you show me (Show me)

Just trying to occupy my mind
So that I don't go looney over you (Ooh-ooh)
Just trying to amplify the sound
See it's one o'clock now
Noon felt like three hours ago
What's your E.T.A.?
Distance only made us grow fonder
Of one another
What's your E.T.A.?
Say you almost right here now
Just say you pulling up to my gate
Don't say the signal faded driving through the canyon
Just hurry up for my sake
I was born ready for you
Skin sweeter than cinnamon
Eyes deeper than the ocean

So I can learn your location
Only place I wanna be
Would you be here with me forever  ever  ever?
Wakin' up all alone ain't better  better  better
Every time I go the wrong way  you turn me back around
Turn me back like woah-woah  woah-woah  oh-oh-oh
Do you wanna look at me forever  ever  ever?
Yeah  do you see us in Vegas pushin' a Monte Carlo?
See them heat waves in the desert  look like a lake in the sand
You still intimidate me  keep me up on my toes now
Better man  what you made me
Made me aware of what I was missin'
Been missin' the way you give me envision  babe
Never thought I'd settle down  reckon I lied to myself
I was busy focusin' on bein' by myself
Set my feelings to the side  they all got dusty on a shelf
You wiped them down when I had nothin' left
Could you be here with me forever  ever  ever?
Would you be here with me forever  ever  ever?
Wakin' up all alone ain't better  better  better

Currency  it comes so naturally  but I can't buy your love

Every time I go the wrong way  you turn me back around
Turn me back like woah-woah  woah-woah  oh-oh-oh
Do you wanna look at me forever  ever  ever?
I promise I'm gonna love you 'til my dying day
Wake up  your face in my chest  your favorite hiding place
The roof is gone as we're driving out the private gate
Countin' the stars with our last name on the license plate
I lied to myself 'bout trying to be here all alone
When I leave  it's bye for now  it's just never bye for long
Set my feelings aside  let's settle down
Every time I go the wrong way  you turn me back around
Turn me back like woah-woah  woah-woah  oh-oh-oh
Do you wanna look at me forever  ever  ever?
Would you be here with me forever  ever  ever?

Can tell by the questions you're asking
You got me low-key nervous
It feels like we're on the same wave  yeah

I miss your touch some nights when I'm hollow
I know you crossed a bridge that I can't follow
That if I can't be close to you
I'll settle for the ghost of you
I miss you more than life (More than life)
And if you can't be next to me
Your memory is ecstasy

Flowers open when they feel the sunlight
Moonrise  tide change  right before our eyes
Aggressive but softly  you place your lips on my lips
We're each other's vice
Our feelings  they go deep  deeper than the touching
Deeper than the ocean  so we ain't never rushing through
Our days or our nights  ain't no repercussions
Never get enough  I'm only for your consumption
Always rain the most in April
Every scale needs to be stable
Earth keeps spinnin' around  we're breathin'
So thankful
My love for you's habitual  yeah (Oh  yeah)
Not for a moment  but forever
Know it sounds untraditional  oh yeah

Sometimes it's hard to face reality
Don't be afraid to stand alone
Don't be afraid to stand outside your comfort zone

And it ain't easy all alone
Relationships over the phone
Talkin' to your significant other all night long
Sometimes it's hard to face reality  oh  oh
Even though you might get mad at me  oh  oh
Sometimes it's hard to face reality
Should've been adjusted to my life
Had the opportunity to stay and wait for the last time

With everyone being around but
It's just personal  this just  for me and you
And I want you to know that I still love you (Girl  you say that you don't wanna talk  but it's cool)
And though the seasons may change
Sometimes love goes from sunshine to rain
I'm under this umbrella and I'm callin' your name (Girl  I know that I don't wanna lose your love)
And you know I don't wanna lose that  'cause I still believe
I still believe in love  I still believe in us
I hope you believe in us  the way I believe in us  you don't see
'Cause what you don't see is when we don't speak I really don't sleep  I wanna talk to you
And if I had the world in my hands I'd give it all to ya
I wanna know if you feel it  the way that I feel it
I wanna know if you feel it  the way that I  the way that I
And you taught me to be careful with your heart  your heart
I'll pick up the pieces if you come undone
Painting stars up on your ceiling

I need you to hold on
Heaven is a place not too far away
We all know I should be the one
To say we all make mistakes (We all make mistakes)
Take my hand and hold on
Tell me everything that you need to say
'Cause I know how it feels to be someone (Someone)
Feels to be someone who loses their way

With a turned up kind of loving  it just won't stop
No  so hard walking out
Got me stuck like krazy glue  ooh-wee
They hold on tight
Yeah they hold on tight  ooh they hold on tight
Them lips won't let me go
Lips won't let me go  lips won't let me go oh
Hold on tight  they hold on tight
Yeah hold on tight  that hold on tight
Ooh they hold on tight
Them lips won't let me go
Oh baby  holding back the faces I would make
I'm a fan and you're the rockstar  making it hard on me
Visualise a monster  cause you're too bad for me
Shot that arrow I'm hit  need you right near me
I try to maintain
So don't mind if I turn away  no no

Don't think that I'll be a saint
But I might go down to the river
'Cause the way that the sky opens up when we touch
On God
Runnin' to the altar like a track star
Can't wait another second
Feels so holy
I don't do well with the drama
I don't believe in nirvana
But the way that we love in the night gave me life
On God
Runnin' to the altar like a track star
Can't wait another second
Feels so holy

Hoping that somebody would slow down
Praying for a miracle

With a long journey ahead
Seen a truck pull over

He gave you direction
Showed you how to read a map
For the long journey ahead
Said it ain't over

Another day
And all the clubs you get in using my name
And I didn't wanna write a song
'Cause I didn't want anyone thinking I still care
And I think you should be somethin' I don't wanna hold back
Maybe you should know that
My mama don't like you and she likes everyone
And I never like to admit that I was wrong
'Cause if you like the way you look that much
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
You should go and love yourself

Tryna catch the beat  make up your heart
Don't know if you're happy or complainin'
Don't want for us to end  where do I start?
First you wanna go to the left  then you wanna turn right (Right)
Wanna argue all day  makin' love all night (All night)
Oh  I really wanna know
What do you mean? Oh  oh
When you nod your head yes  but you wanna say no
What do you mean? Hey  yeah
When you don't want me to move  but you tell me to go
What do you mean? Oh  what do you mean?
Said you're runnin' outta time  what do you mean?
What do you mean?

You're overprotective when I'm leavin'
Tryna compromise  but I can’t win
You wanna make a point  but you keep preachin'
You had me from the start  won't let this end
First you wanna go to the left  then you wanna turn right
(Turn right)
Wanna argue all day  makin' love all night (All night)
Oh  I really wanna know
When you nod your head yes  but you wanna say no
When you don't want me to move  but you tell me to go
What do you mean? (I wanna know  ooh)
Oh  what do you mean? (Ooh)
When you nod your head yes  but you wanna say no
When you don't want me to move (Hey)  but you tell me to go
What do you mean? (Be more straightforward)
