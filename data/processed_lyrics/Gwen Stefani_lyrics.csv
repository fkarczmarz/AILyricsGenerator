lyrics
"The moon got lost again last night
But now the sun has finally had its say
I guess I feel alright
But it hurts when I think
I'm lying here in the dark
And all I know is
You've got to give me everything (Give me everything)
Nothing less 'cause you know I give you all of me (Give you all of me)
I give you everything that I am
I'm handin' over everything that I've got
'Cause I wanna have a really true love
Don't ever wanna have to go and give you up
And I wanna make it worth the fight
What have we been doing for all this time?
All I wanted was to know I'm safe
Don't wanna lose the love I've found
Remember when you said that you would change?
Don't let me down
It's not fair how you are

'Cause I wanna have a really true love
Don't ever wanna have to go and give you up (Give me everything)
And I wanna make it worth the fight
What have we been doing for all this time?
Save all your love up for me
We can't escape the love
Give me everything that you have
And all I know is
You've got to give me everything (Give me everything)

Why would you wanna live so recklessly?
I don't know where I was  I was lost  I was nothing
The real version of me  I had never even seen
You're givin' me truth and it's such an unfamiliar subject
So  could you answer me please?

Have all your stories memorized
I've kissed your lips a million ways
But I still love to have you around
I've held you too many times to count
I think I know you inside out
And we're together most days
But I still love to have you around
Don't go away
My love (My love)
I want you to stay
In my life
Don't go away
My lover (My love)
I'm happiest when we spend time
You're a salty water ocean wave
I know the storms will always come
But I still love to have you around
And Heaven knows what will come next
A rollercoaster built to crash
But I still love to have you around

I must apologize for acting stank and treating you this way
'Cause I've been acting like sour milk all on the floor

If I could escape (Escape)
And recreate a place that's my own world (Own world)
And I could be your favorite girl (Forever)  perfectly together
And tell me boy  now wouldn't that be sweet? (Sweet escape)
