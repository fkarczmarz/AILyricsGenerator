"Oh 99  where did we go wrong
Oh 99  (I...) I love you
99  I keep breaking your heart
Oh 99  how can we be apart
Oh 99  (I...) I love you
I never thought it would happen  I feel quite the same
I don't want to hurt you anymore
I never knew it would work out  no one to blame
You know I love you  99
99 (Whoo-ooh)  you keep holding my hand
Oh 99  they don't know who I am
Oh 99  (I...) I love you
I never thought it would happen  I feel quite the same
I don't want to hurt you anymore
I never knew it would work out  no one to blame
You know I love you  99

La la la la la la la la la
I said hello but you were gone when I turned around
I wanna tell you but the words just can't be found
I like the way you move and just the way you are
You got me askin' myself how I survived this far
'Cos I've never been afraid of love 'til I met you
Never thought a girl could make me feel the way you do
Never been afraid of - Never been afraid of love 'til I met you
Can't be something that you never ever had

(Never been afraid of) Never been afraid of love 'til I met you
But she hears only whispers of some quiet conversation
The moonlit wings reflect the stars that guide me towards salvation
I stopped an old man along the way
Hopin' to find some old forgotten words or ancient melodies
He turned to me as if to say
It's gonna take a lot to drag me away from you
There's nothin' that a hundred men or more could ever do
I bless the rains down in Africa
Gonna take some time to do the things we never had
Ooh-hoo
The wild dogs cry out in the night
I know that I must do what's right
As sure as Kilimanjaro rises like Olympus above the Serengeti
I seek to cure what's deep inside
Frightened of this thing that I've become

Another twenty years gone by
Pulled myself out of my bed
It's getting harder every time
Then I realize there's no one left to call
Whoa - Seems like things ain't what they used to be
Whoa - Can't cry anymore
I'm alone
Whoa - Where did everyone go?
I drive to work every morning
And no one looks me in the eye
It feels like love has left the world
And I can't help but wonder why
I had that dream again where I begin to fall

I know my way  I know that I'll find her somehow
Angela carries me back to the time
When I knew that her love was still mine
Angela's holding the child in her womb
And I pray that she will be calling soon
She sits alone  not knowing that I am so near
Why can't she hear my voice as I call out her name
Angela carries me back to the time
When I knew that her love was still mine
Angela's holding the child in her womb
And I pray that she will be calling soon
Somewhere she weeps  her hair gently brushes the floor
I know my way  I know that I'll find her somehow
Angela carries me back to the time
When I knew that her love was still mine
Angela's holding the child in her womb
And I pray that she will be calling soon
Anna don't turn me down  there's still a chance
If we can hold out once more
'Cause we started out with love  that was more than enough
And that's a lot to give up
Even if you turn and walk away  love will bring you back somehow
I will wait forever and a day  'cause I believe without a doubt
The time will not run out on our love
Anna you gotta stay  it's just a stage we're going through
And Anna this all can change  if we turn the page
Then we can start all again
'Cause we almost touched the sky  and it could never again be this right
Anna please change your mind

Even if you turn and walk away  love will bring you back somehow
I will wait forever and a day  'cause I believe without a doubt
The time will not run out on our love

Feel for the mothers who weep for them

In their world of pain and suffering
Have you ever seen the look in a hungry child's eyes?
They can't eat money or promises
Why is it always the ones that we love
Are the ones that will never come home?
Why must all of the bridges we cross take their toll?
Always remember the voice in your head
Speaks to you when you're alone
And it comforts you
From the top of your heart
To the bottom of your soul
You can swim in a river of tears they cry
For they sleep on the winds of uncertainty
Show us a sign and make us believe again

I thought I knew you
But now I know you well
I wake up beside you
Move across your killing floor
I need my freedom and I see an open door
The room is getting smaller and the walls are closin' in
No one's leavin' and nobody's gettin' in
I try to run
I try to hide
I try to tell you what I'm feelin' inside
Should I stay
Should I go
You know I wanna touch you
But there's nothing left to hold
Don't chain my heart
Don't chain my soul
Don't chain my heart
'Cause you got to let it go
Looks like trouble
The signs are everywhere
I bend a little but you take more than your share
Crimes of passion
Crimes of mortal men
The storm is coming
The winds begin to rise
Please release me from this house of compromise

Although she says she cares when she does it doesn't show
Frozen smile she gave this time
She can yes or she can say no
It's a fearful heart
That would let go
Finally free so many years and separate lives
It could be our time make up your mind
I'm right in front of you
Although you say you care if you do it doesn't show
You throw a smile and wave goodbye
She can yes or she can say no
Wanna pull her close just to let know
A fearful heart but she turns away
When I just don't know what she's trying to say
She can yes or she can say no
It's a fearful heart that would let go
How many wage gonna tell you
But maybe I've got this so wrong
Goodbye...
She can yes or she can say no
Wanna I pull her close just to let know
It's a fearful heart but she turns away
And I just don't know what just trying today
She can yes or she can say no
It's a fearful heart that would let it go

Searching for the girl who had just caught his (eye)
I was a fool! he cried
His mind had wandered
He blinked and the sky moved ever so slightly
He searched the city
She was nowhere to be found
Meanwhile she was floating downward  downward
Do you want your freedom
Do you want my love
Do you want your freedom
From the one you're thinking of
There lied a lady
Naked and yet not knowing
A spell had chained her heart forever
Preyed upon by the wolves in Times Square
Fell into an abyss of thin air
Innocent 'n caged in sanctuary
There sat the dragon Lord playing solitary
Confined to rule the holy walls 'neath Hell's Kitchen

Suddenly a voice was heard
In a flash the brave young man appeared
The dragon whirled and caught him with his tail
Chased him to the stairway
Caught him halfway to the top
Sent him whirling down
Fireballs  summer solstice
The Dragon Lord descended down on him
She turned to look but saw only darkness  silence
You don't want your freedom
You don't want my love
You don't want your throat cut
And I don't understand
How all this has come to pass
How we've come to surround ourselves
In a sea of thieves
In a land without learning
Only the fools believe
I went driving last night
On a dark canyon road
Had the sky to myself
But I wasn't alone
Had the pain of my lifetime
For my company
How did it end up like this
For you and me
When love breaks the promise
The heart has to keep
It leaves only truth here to find
When the spirit is crushed
And the hurt is so deep
Between you and I
Even when love has come and gone
And our hearts have moved along

And that always was enough

One chance  one solitary life  how could I let you go
Got a phone call  or was it a dream  a voice spoke to me
I could swear it was you that I heard crying desperately
Melanie  nothing but the touch of your hand can rescue me
Oh  Melanie  reach inside this emptiness and you will set me free
I can still see your face in my mind with every turn I take
And the wind through my heart feels so cold  as it calls out your name
Melanie  nothing but the touch of your hand can rescue me
Oh  Melanie  reach inside this emptiness and you will set me free
Oh  Melanie  nothing but the touch of your hand can rescue me
I keep a place in my heart for you
The days of waiting they keep getting longer
And not a thing I can do
Sent to report on political views
It was by chance through a lens that I met you
A Cape Town girl with no shoes
You were runnin' down the road
I was going your way
I stopped and turned around to lent you my hand
You smiled though you were suffering
You broke into my heart
I saw your eyes and then I knew
You broke into my heart
Like the wind and rain that followed you
You broke into my heart
Had the Lord above forgotten you?
You broke in from the start
And all my tears belong to you

I sat and watched as she danced by the fires
Through ancient songs did the tale unfold
They sang of diamonds that came from their mountains
The loss of lives mining white man's gold
I had to leave and go back to Manhattan
Where all my stories are bought and sold
I know the city would surely be saddened
If what I knew could be told
You were runnin' down the road
I was going your way
I stopped and turned around to lend you my hand
You smiled though you were suffering
You broke into my heart
I saw your eyes and then I knew
You broke into my heart
Like the wind and rain that followed you
You broke into my heart
Had the Lord above forgotten you?
You broke in from the start
And all my tears belong to you
It's been so long since I last heard your laughter
So many letters and still no news
I hope you find all the things that you're after
You know my heart is with you
You were runnin' down the road
I was going your way
I stopped and turned around to lend you my hand
You smiled though you were suffering
You broke into my heart
I saw your eyes and then I knew
You broke into my heart

Had the Lord above forgotten you?
You broke into my heart
I saw your eyes and then I knew
Woa oh oh oh oh woa
Woa oh oh woa
Woa oh oh oh oh woa
You broke in from the start
And all my tears belong to you
You believe in each and everyone of us
You're never alone in the world
I was born in a lost and found
An orphan raised in the underground
Then one day I opened up my eyes
Looked around and I realized
You're never alone in the world
You believe in each and everyone of us
Someone said we're one family
How can that be with all this poverty?
Time to reach out and make a start
Hold each other's hands and lift each other's hearts

Somehow the music stopped  and so did our love
I tried to put the pieces together  and I got a grip on my life
They say there's one born every minute who has all for a lifetime
What good is a lifetime if I can't be with you
When I see your face  my heart cries out for you
I guess that fools never learn how to fall out of love
I do admit I really miss you  there are some things time cannot change
And I would be a liar baby  if I told you I didn't care
'Cos it makes a difference  baby when you're not there
It starts calling your name
When I see your face  my heart cries out for you
Yeah
Side by side
I'll be yours forever
Rain or shine
Any kind of weather
Any kind
There isn't anything I wouldn't do for you
Let's take what's getting old and make it new
Oh!
Eye to eye
It's a blinding confrontation
You and I
We're a deadly combination
So don't start mixing truth with jealousy
The road we're on is clear as far as I can see

How could I ever let you go

Is he wearing a familiar face
Does he still live below Seventh Avenue
With the princess dipped in lace
Does he know that I'm a soldier of fortune
And not a victim of circumstance
We drew lots for his soft underbelly
Now his fate is sealed with my lance
I can tell by the look in your eye
You've never seen the man with nothing to say
I can tell by the look in your eye
You'd better watch yourself
St. George is on his way
Is it true that he's a mighty warrior
And a viper of the first degree
I've been sentenced here to slay the giant
Geld this fear I cannot see

Thoughts I can't define
My heart is racing and the night goes on
I can almost hear a laugh
Coming from your photograph
Funny how a look can share a thousand meanings
Even though you're gone I feel you deep inside
(Ooh)
Dance beneath the light with that look in your eyes
I can't stop loving you
Time passes quickly and chances are few
There's a window in the heart
I've tried to look through from the start
You're never really sure what someone else is thinking
Someone's broken something new
Another altered point of view
Just a certain someone's conscience playing
What lives inside the wind that cries her name
Tried to catch a shooting star
What seems so close can't be that far
Living in a dream that's never ending
Dance beneath the light with that look in your eyes
I can't stop loving you
Time passes quickly and chances are few
Dancing with that look that's in your eyes
I can't stop loving you
Time passes quickly and chances are few
I can't stop loving you
Time passes quickly and chances are few
I won't stop till I'm through loving you
Loving you
In the middle of a dream
Woke up in a pool of sweat
Thought I heard a scream
Ran over to the window sill
Stuck my head out for a peek
Dressed in black was a man I didn't recognize
Running down my back street
My heart skipped a beat
You better watch out
There's a stranger in town
You better watch out
There's a stranger in town
You better watch out
When he comes around
Don't make a sound
Got the morning paper and the headlines read:
Danger to the queen
Buckingham Palace better tighten things up
The son of a bitch is mean
Vendors on the corner just doin' their job
Acting like nothing's new
Scotland Yard's still looking for him
But he doesn't leave a single clue
What can they do?

Where the maelstrom is hollerin'  for a moment you’re free
Where the eagles are soaring  and kings are enthroned
Can you save me?

I've been struck by lightning
You’ve been spared from the gallows  but it’s still not the end
You got the rest of your life to make your amends
It’s harbor you’re seeking  and shelter from harm
Don’t leave me here stranded  better sound the alarm
Can you save me?

The heavens opened up  and an angel spoke:

You stick around and you’ll get nothing...

Now it would take more than I could buy
Sure I could lie to myself too

Eyes  give every drop
This ain't the way that should have made her stop
Arms  just let her know
No one fills the place she used to grow
Smile  don't leave me now
Cause you're the reason she's here anyhow
Words be gentle when you speak into her heart
Cause if it breaks  she may not come again
I've been waitin' for your love
And it's been here all the time  right in front of me
I've been sitting  waiting for your love
Look  forget your pride
She might kiss as you're like even tide
So  be in her heart
Especially when we're apart

When you don't even love yourself
You live your life like a jagged knife
Just waiting on the shelf
How can you live for tomorrow
When you curse the night and day
The minutes pass through the hour glass
As you let them slip away
Do you love me when I play your game
How can you touch the sorrow
With a leather gloved hand
When you summon the winds of anger
Just as fast as you can
You crucify an orphan
With the rainbow in your eyes
Then you send out invitations
And address them with his cries

 always know that

Then my heart would pound

It's worth the pain that makes the tears
It's worth the light of a million years
You light the sun that shines from my eyes
It's all in return for what you're givin' me
You are the reason for the earth beneath my feet
And you kill the space that I call free
It's worth the pain that makes the tears
It's worth the light of a million years"
