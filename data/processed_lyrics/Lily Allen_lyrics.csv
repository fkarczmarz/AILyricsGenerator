lyrics
"But she's nearly 30 now and she's out every night
I see that look in her face  she's got that look in her eye
She's thinking  How did I get here?
And wondering why
It's sad  but it's true how society says her life is already over
There's nothing to do and there's nothing to say
Until the man of her dreams comes along  picks her up and puts her over his shoulder (Shoulder)
It seems so unlikely in this day and age
She's got an alright job  but it's not a career
Wherever she thinks about it  it brings her to tears
'Cause all she wants is a boyfriend  she gets one-night stands
She's thinking  How did I get here? I'm doing all that I can
It's sad  but it's true how society says her life is already over (Over)
There's nothing to do and there's nothing to say
Until the man of her dreams comes along  picks her up and puts her over his shoulder (Shoulder)
It seems so unlikely in this day and age

Did I ever tell you my uncle's monkey ran away from the zoo?
Would you tell me what this all means?
What happens if I go through that door?
When I'm bored  I kinda drift away
I've been thinking and I've got this plan
Let's go  right now
Come meet me in the sky  I'll be waitin' for you
And we can't hear what they say
Now  we're so high it can't rain

I don't like dropping names  but Kurt Cobain is all in my face
How the hell am I gonna tell him Elvis already took first base?
All we need is a little more elevation
Take me back to where I can breathe  ooh
When I'm bored  I kinda drift away
I've been thinking and I've got this plan
Let's go  right now
Come meet me in the sky  I'll be waitin' for you
And we can't hear what they say
Now  we're so high it can't rain
Sailing  s-sailing through the clouds
Trippin'  tri-tri-tri-trippin' out
Sailing  s-sailing through the clouds
Trippin'  tri-tri-tri-trippin' out
Come meet me in the sky  I'll be waitin' for you
And we can't hear what they say
Now  we're so high it can't rain
Come meet me in the s—
Come meet me in the s—
My little brother's in his bedroom smoking weed
I tell him he should get up 'cause it's nearly half past three
He can't be bothered 'cause he's high on THC
I ask him very nicely if he'd like a cup of tea
I can't even see him 'cause his room is so smoky
Don't understand how one can watch so much TV
I only say it 'cause I care
So please  can you stop pulling my hair?
Now  now there's no need to swear
Please don't despair  my dear mon frère
I just can't sit back and watch you waste your life away
You need to get a job because the bills need to get paid
Surely there's some walls out there that you can go and spray
I'm feeling guilty for leading you astray
Now how the hell do you ever expect that you'll get laid
When all you do is stay and play on your computer games?

Please don't despair  my dear mon frère
I'm tryna help you out so can you stop being a twat
It's time that you and I sat down and had a little chat
And look me in the eyes  take off that stupid fitted cap
I only say it 'cause I care
So please  can you stop pulling my hair?
Now  now there's no need to swear
Please don't despair
Please don't despair
We'd stay in bed all day having sex and smoking fags
So much has happened since then
I wish we could go back
I'd do things differently  but I went off the tracks
So cliché for me to say  I never meant to break your heart
I'm to blame for all your pain
I never could have played that part
I had to do it  baby
We were both depressed
Towards the end we were not even having sex
I felt like I was only good for writing the cheques
I like a drink but that does not make me a wreck
So cliché for me to say  I never meant to break your heart
I'm to blame for all your pain
I never could have played that part
So cliché for me to say  I never meant to break your heart
I'm to blame for all your pain
I never could have played that part

One year in you gave me  a set of keys
Two years and you bended down on one knee
Three years and we're living out in the country
Four years and you've given me my beautiful babies
But it was all too much for me
Now I'm exactly where I didn't want to be
I'm just like my mummy and daddy
I guess the apple doesn't fall far from the tree
I guess the apple doesn't fall far from the tree
I guess the apple doesn't fall far from the tree

Soon as it was over though I had claimed you for myself
Didn't take me long before I had moved my stuff to yours
Glad to leave the past behind and I'm glad to close the door
Because you know I love you
Because you know I love you
So far it's been so good and it seems we'll stand the test of time
You never call me baby but you refer to me as mine
What I like the best is how you can keep me on my toes
Staying home with you is better than sticking things up my nose
I had that awful feeling
That I needed help
My life had lost its meaning
But you saved me from myself
As long as I've got you and we can be
Together and forever just you and me
You sleep with your mouth wide open and you go to the pub alone
You only cook from frozen but I don't ever hear you moan
You let me lie in bed when you're doing breakfast with the kids
Landing on my feet with you I'm so happy this is how we live
Because you know I love you
Because you know I love you

You always looked like you were having such fun
You always were and you always will be
The taller and the prettier one
People seem to love you
They gravitate towards you
That's why I started to hate you so much
And I just completely ignored you
I don't know why I felt the need to keep it up for oh so long
I don't know why I felt the need to drag it out for all these years
Believe me when I say that I cannot apologise enough
When all you ever wanted from me was a token of my love
Go back to the start
I've been so evil with my constant invasions
I'll always pull you up on every stupid thing that you said
But I found it so entertaining messing around with your head

Believe me when I say that I cannot apologise enough
When all you ever wanted from me was a token of my love
Go back to the start
Ever tell you
Who you are
Or can or can't become
So what if it's one in a hundred
Who's to say you are not that one?
Eventually you'll get a piece of that patriarchy pie
There'll be tears
Drawn out fights
I don't see no reason you can't
Have your cake and eat it
Have your cake and eat it
Have your cake and eat it
Have your cake and eat it
Have your cake and eat it
Have your cake and eat it
Have your cake and eat it
Have your cake and eat it
Have your cake and eat it
I was treading a line
Between drive and survival
If I could go back
See myself as a child
I'd say stick to your guns girl
In fact go get that rifle
Men in the middle
Keep the world spinning round
Love this life
Stand your ground

Why I should stay
How'd I get myself into this place?
I wish had qualities like:
I wish I could fit myself in my pocket
And tie myself to a rocket
And send myself to outer space
I wish I had a different face
I wish I had one good reason why I should stay
How'd I get myself into this place?
I wish my life was a little less seedy
Why am I always so greedy?
Wish I looked just like Cheryl Tweedy
I wish my life was not so boring
Don't get me started on Monday morning

Don't wake me up today
Under my duvet's
Where I wanna stay
Don't wanna come out to play
I wish my life was a little less seedy
Why am I always so greedy?
Wish I looked just like Cheryl Tweedy
I wish my life was not so boring
Don't get me started on Monday morning
Another programme on antiques on the TV set
So many things about myself that I despise
(I wish my life was a little less seedy)
So many things about my life that I despise
(I wish my life was a little less seedy)
So many things that I despise
(I wish my life was a little less seedy)
And I wonder how long it will take me to get home
I wait for an hour or so at the carousel
I have a cigarette to pass the time
'Cause the traffic's hell
I don't want anything more
Than to see your face when you open the door
You'll make me beans on toast and a nice cup of tea
And we'll get a Chinese and watch TV
Tomorrow we'll take the dog for a walk
I'll be exhausted so I'll probably sleep
And we'll get a Chinese and watch TV
You wipe the tears from my eye
And you say that all that it takes is a phone call
I cry at the thought of being alone and then
I wonder how long it'll take till I'm home again
I don't want anything more
Than to see your face when you open the door
You'll make me beans on toast and a nice cup of tea
And we'll get a Chinese and watch TV
Tomorrow we'll take the dog for a walk
I'll be exhausted so I'll probably sleep
And we'll get a Chinese and watch TV

Tomorrow we'll take the dog for a walk
I'll be exhausted so I'll probably sleep
Hey  hey  hey  hey
Baby  baby
I have to say
That there's something you should know
When I'm standing there
In my underwear
I know that I've let myself go
But I still feel sexy
When you undress me
And whisper in my ear
Come over here
Come over here
Let's spice it up
You can dress me up
I'll be anyone you like
Got my leathers on
Yeah let's get it on
Come on ride me like a bike
I'll be Beyoncé
Baby  say my name
Tonight you are my Hova
Baby  come over

Come on let me get to work
I'm going to hypnotise you
Then I'm going to yank your chain
And we can do it again
All over again
Driving your sedan
Up to my minivan
I see you in my mirror
Ain't no other chick
Going to cut my shit
You know I'd have to kill her
You know how to use it
I'm about to lose it
You blow my fucking mind
Park it right up behind
Park it right up behind
Close your eyes
Baby  take off your shirt

Come on let me get to work

Where did you learn to do the things you do?
You're everything
You're all my dreams come true
You know your way around like no one else
You're right there
Like you care
You're so close
I'm nearly there
Oh yeah!
Come on now  baby  yeah

Come on let me get to work
I'm going to hypnotize you
Then I'm going to yank your chain
And we can do it again
I feel like I'm under attack all of the time
I'm compromised
My head can't always hold itself so high
What if inside I'm dying?
Every night I'm crying
And even if I died trying
I bet you'd probably quite like it
If you go on record saying that you know me
Then why am I so lonely?
'Cause nobody fucking phones me
You say you see how I move
Don't act like you've been here too
I think you are being rude
Come on then

Since you know so much about me
Put your money where your mouth is
You should really hush your mouth
And keep your distance if you see me when you're out
Won't forgive you twice
I'll tell you all about your miserable life
Don't see me telling you what to do
Why do you scrutinise my every move?
And what exactly are you trying to prove?
When what you say's so far away from the truth
If you go on record saying that you know me
Then why am I so lonely?
'Cause nobody fuckin' phones me
If you go on record saying that you know me
Then why am I so lonely?
'Cause nobody fuckin' phones me
You say you see how I move
Don't act like you've been here too
I think you are being rude
Come on then
Since you know so much about me
That is the sun poking its head round the curtain
Now please can we leave  I'd like to go to bed now
It's not just the sun that is hurting my head now
I'm not tryna say that I'm smelling of roses
But when will we tire of putting shit up our noses?
I don't like staying up  staying up past the sunlight
It's meant to be fun and this just doesn't feel right
Why can't we all  all just be honest
Admit to ourselves that everyone's on it
From grown politicians to young adolescents
Prescribing themselves antidepressants
How can we start to tackle the problem
If you don't put your hands up and admit that you're on them
The kids are in danger  they're all getting habits
'Cause from what I can see  everyone's at it
Everyone's at it
Everyone's at it
Everyone's at it
I get involved  but I'm not advocating
Got an opinion
Yeah  you're well up for slating
See you've got a prescription  and that makes it legal
I find the excuses overwhelmingly feeble
You go to the doctor
You need pills for sleeping
So your daughter's depressed  we'll get her straight on the Prozac
But little do you know  she already takes crack

To feel something
But nothing
I feel it in my gut
I'm gonna let you fuck me

I'm just another thing to do
I don't know why I do it to myself (Myself)
Giving all my worth to someone else (Someone else)
I don't know why I do it to myself (Myself)
I'll do it  yeah  and I'll do it till
I've tried everything  everything  everything

Someone fill it up for me
Set me free
I don't want to fall in love
No  all I need is for someone to walk all over me
Close the door behind you please

 I'm fine

Though I'm young and stupid
I am wild and ruthless
You're better off without me
I am more than selfish
If I had the time of day
I might give all my days to you
It's not always easy
Being a family man
I'm just doing what I can
To get by
I've come to the land of the free
I am lost and shameless
Don't go forgetting me

Get in the car and drive to the club
There's a massive crowd outside  so we get into the queue
It's quarter past eleven now  we won't get in 'til quarter to
It's quarter to and we get to the front
Girl on the guest list dressed like a ****
She asked security to check inside my shoes
You can play this game with me  but you know you're gonna lose
Looked me up and down
I don't make a sound
There's a lesson that I want you to learn
Is if you're gonna play with fire  then you're gonna get burned
Don't try and test me 'cause you'll get a reaction
Another drink and I'm ready for action
I don't know who you think you are
But making people scared won't get you very far
In the club  make our way to the bar
Guy on the mic  and he's making too much noise
There's these girls in the corner  want attention from the boys
I see these girls and they're shouting through the crowd
Don't understand why they're being really loud
Make their way over to me and try and push me out the way

'Cause we're so uninspired  so sick and tired
Of all the hatred you harbour

Well  I think you're just evil
You're just some racist who can't tie my laces
Your point of view is medieval

You'll find me in the studio and not in the kitchen
I won't be bragging 'bout my cars or talking 'bout my chains
Don't need to shake my ass for you 'cause I've got a brain
And now it's time to speed it up 'cause I can't move at this pace
I'll go ahead and say them anyway

 he was never around
 you wouldn't believe some of the things that he did
 but there is no need (No need)
 you wouldn't believe some of the things that he did
 it taught me to be strong
 you wouldn't believe some of the things that he did
Yo  cah that's in my jeans
I don't want grief  don't want drama
I just went out for a little Chinese
Had Chinese then couldn't leave
I lost my phone and my cards and keys
Came  came home four o'clock
Walk back like I'm  walk back like I'm chief
Do me right  you're lying
It's in your eyes  don't try it
Did I cross your mind?
It's your life  I said I'd never
Let you waste my time
I said you'd never
Hear me say that twice
You crossed that line
You crossed that line
You know what you're doing
I won't listen to another excuse
This time you blew it
The people you used are jumping through hoops
I won't let you do it
You can't seduce me  now who looks foolish?

Dry your eyes  stop fighting
Rest that mind  give yourself some time
You might like what you find
It's your life  and I said I'd never
Let you ruin mine
I said I'd never  ever
Pay the price
You crossed the line
You crossed the line
Why did you do it? (Oh  yeah)
Why would you choose to use and abuse me?
This close to ruin (oh  yeah)
Why just stand by?
Don't you dare roll your eyes
Why put me through it?
Enough with the lies
I know what the truth is
Sorry  but I know your type
I won't be undermined
I can take this down to the wire
Soon see if I fight fire with fire
Dig that grave
You're such a bad liar
Stakes gettin' higher and higher and higher and higher
I cannot bear to see the look upon your faces
Do you think he'd think the things we do are a waste of time?
Maybe he'd think that we are getting on just fine
Do you think he's skint or financially secure?
Ever since he can remember
People have died in his good name
Long before that September
Long before hijacking planes
He doesn't know who's right or wrong
But there's one thing that he's sure of
This has been going on too long
Do you think he'd drive in his car without insurance?
Do you think his favorite type of human is Caucasian?
Do you reckon he's ever been done for tax evasion?
Do you think he's any good at remembering people's names?
Do you think he's ever taken smack or cocaine?
I don't imagine he's ever been suicidal
His favourite band is Creedence Clearwater Revival

Walkin' 'round London town
Would I wanna be anywhere else?

You can see it's all lies
There was a little old lady who was walking down the road
She was struggling with bags from Tesco
There were people from the city having lunch in the park
I believe that is called al fresco

But before she had time to accept it
'Cause he's got all her jewelry and wallet

Especially when I have to watch other people kissing
And I remember when you started calling me your missus
I'd tell you sad stories about my childhood
We'd spend the whole weekend lying in our own dirt
I was just so happy in your boxers and your t-shirt
Of when we had just started things
Dreams of you and me
That I can't shake those memories
I wonder if you have the same dreams too
The littlest things that take me there
That the things are reminding me of you
Sometimes I wish we could just pretend
Even if only for one weekend
Is this the end?

Now I sense a change
Something beautiful has slipped away
I let you in and
Then you disappeared
Like the dying of another day
I was never planning on
Any of this chaos
I wasn't being difficult
But you still betrayed us
Looking at my phone all night
Maybe I've lost my mind
And you say it served me right
Maybe I've lost my mind
You're on the ceiling
I'm down here on the floor
Keeps me coming back
Keeps me begging for more

And I still have to wear all the presents you sent me
You done your Christmas shopping and we're only in April
And you won't leave the house unless you're wearing your thermals

This is more than I can take
I'd give everything I own
If someone else could take my place
 I don't care about funny
 it's how I'm programmed to function
 but I'm not a sinner
 but I'm not sure
 then you walk right out the door
 mum
 don't go
 'cause you're always off on tour
 don't go
Wrapped in elastic in the blue bands
You reach for handouts with your two hands
Who's that? We’re the cool gang
No hippy but it’s so sticky
Steamboat Willie like the old Mickey
And it fuels my addictions
Hanging out in this whirlwind
If you cool my ambitions
I’m gonna cut you out
That’s why I can’t hang with the cool gang
Gonna put myself in your hands

When I was young I was blameless
Playing with rude boys and trainers
I had a foot in the rave 'cause I was attracted to danger
I would wake up next to strangers
Everyone knows what cocaine does
And it fuels my addictions
Hanging out in this whirlwind
If you cool my ambitions
I’m gonna cut you out
That’s why I can’t hang with the cool gang
Gonna put myself in your hands
That’s why I can’t hang with the cool gang
Gonna put myself in your hands
Back in the day like at Yo-Yo
Then in L.A. at the Chateau
I need to move on and grow some
Been in the Firehouse for too long
I’m gonna love you and leave some
And it fuels my addictions
Hanging out in this whirlwind
If you cool my ambitions
I’m gonna cut you out
That’s why I can’t hang with the cool gang
Gonna put myself in your hands
That’s why I can’t hang out with the cool gang
Alex!

I work at home in my parent's basement
I don't troll  I make statements
I'm not a cliché sittin' in my PJ's
Double cupping at lunch on a Tuesday
I get vexed if you don't appreciate me
Real talk  I put the world to rights
And when I'm a big boy  I'm gonna write for Vice
It's not for me  it must be wrong
I could ignore it and move on
But I'm a broadband champion
A URL badman
And if you're tryna call it art
I'll have to take it all apart
I got a high-brow game plan  a URL badman
I'm a U-R-L B-A-D M-A-N with no empathy

Since we separated
All the empty space in my head
First I felt liberated by it
But solitude is overrated
The other day I swear someone said
Someone else is sharing your bed
Maybe you picked up where I left
Now my heart is sinking
I don't know what I've been thinking
I turned a strong man weak
I'm hoping somehow he'll forgive me
I think to myself
What you waiting for?
You'll never be sure
Swinging back and forth
Just leave him alone
What you waiting for?
You'll never be sure
Swinging back and forth

Now the dust has settled
I should probably level with you
Meant it when I said I do
Don't know why I was untrue
With everything I put you through
How'd it make you feel if I said I still love you
Never thought we'd be this couple
I ran at the first sign of trouble
I turned a strong man weak
I'm hoping somehow he'll forgive me
I think to myself
What you waiting for?
You'll never be sure
Swinging back and forth
Just leave him alone

You'll never be sure
Swinging back and forth

Conversation got boring
You said you'd go into bed soon
So I snuck off to your bedroom
And I thought I'd just wait there
Until I heard you come up the stairs
And I pretended I was sleeping
Put your arm around my shoulder
And it was if the room got colder
And we moved closer in together
And started talking about the weather
You said tomorrow would be fun
And we could watch 'A Place in the Sun'
I didn't know where this was going
When you kissed me
Are you mine? Are you mine?
'Cause I stay here all the time
Who'd have known? Who'd have known?
When you flash up on my phone

I haven't left you for days now
And I'm becoming amazed how
You're quite affectionate in public
In fact your friend said it made her feel sick
And even though it's moving forward
There's just the right amount of awkward
And today you accidentally called me Baby
Are you mine? Are you mine?
'Cause I stay here all the time
Who'd have known? Who'd have known?
When you flash up on my phone
I wanna lie in bed all day
We'll be laughing all the way
Let's just see how we go
Let's see how we go
Are you mine? Are you mine?
'Cause I stay here all the time
Who'd have known? Who'd have known?
When you flash up on my phone
I no longer feel alone
I wanna lie in bed all day
We'll be laughing all the way
Let's just see how we go
Surprised 'cause I thought you were alright
Feels like every night we're fighting
Stop crying every time I get a text
Every time my phone rings
I've always said that no man can own me
Everything is bless
Last night full of happiness
And this morning you get a text
And even though me vex
Me just a reason with your conscience

Stop crying every time I get a text

Fuck what you saw 'cause I'm not tryna draw for him

Girlfriend cotch and relax
Mek me tell you all the facts

Original foundation badman
Me know say you a freak
And you need a thug inna di sheets
You know say me a thug inna di street
Got everything you need
And me nah play number two
So why do you want it?
You can keep rocking the boat
It's like we're listening to Aaliyah
The way we go back and forth
I know you're bad like Marilyn Monroe
I see fire in your love
Stop crying every time I get a text
Every time my phone rings
I've always said that no man can own me"
