lyrics
"All of the contours
Are laid out before me now
To leave a trace
With all of the light and shade
We take up our own space
I'll find my own way back
Back to the past tense
A lifeline to highs and lows
To seeing the bright side and I should know
We wait for the afterglow
To cover the blind side and I should know
All of the empty thoughts
All of the outlines
Are laid out before us now
To leave a trace
All of your words and mine
They keep returning
I'll find my own way back
Back to the silence
You might also like
A lifeline to highs and lows
To seeing the bright side and I should know
We wait for the afterglow
To cover the blind side and I should know
I've given up all I can
I've given up all I can
I've given up all I can
That I'm afraid to die
I'm no good at goodbyes
I can't apologise
And if I don't stop now
Will it follow me down?
I guess I have to try
It's the art of getting by
'Cause I sunk some ships with selfish lips
And it all came back to me
I was terrified
I never told them why
And the songs I wrote 'bout hearts I broke
Would never come for free
I cheated and I lied
But I meant it when I cried
So what do you say
When you lose your way?
The past is in the past
It isn't meant to last
But if I can't let go
Will you carry me home?
Can we celebrate the end?
I'm asking for a friend
You might also like
'Cause I filled my bed with my regrets
But it hasn't killed me yet
None of it mattered
None of it mattered
And the mess we made on Fridays
Gave me Sundays on my knees
But you still matter
You still matter
You still matter (You still matter)
You still matter (You still matter)
You still matter (You still matter)
You still matter (You still matter)
You still matter (You still matter)
You still matter (You still matter)
You still matter (You still matter)
You still matter (You still matter)
I don't want to say
That I'm afraid to die
The past is in the past
It isn't meant to last
But if I can't let go
Will you carry me home?
Can we celebrate the end?
I'm asking for a friend
Can we go? Can we go?
Can we go? Can we go?
Can we go? Can we go?
Thinking of the friends and faith I lack
And no one broke my heart quite like that man
It's better if you don't
I won't follow you again
Can they tell I don't like me at all?
I'm never as alone as I am back home
Pulling every thread
Seemed like a thing to do
Now I can't give it back
My favourite kind of blue
It's better if I don't
I won't call on you again
Tinseltown was always in the rain
I've been gone and notice every change
And some of them arе not our friends
You might also like
It's better if I don't
Think too much of you
I've been on my own
So I should see it through
I mumble when I speak
But I mean it when I do
I carry what I keep
I don't miss a lot of you
I drink and I think too much
I should quit one of the two
But I won't wish for luck
And I won't bother you
It's better if you don't
'Cause I can't hold it all
Trying to correct the wrongs
Better luck now that you're on your own
So don't just lie there
Hoping for the pin to drop
Keep counting all the fresh starts we had
I'll raise another white flag so that
We keep counting all the fresh starts we had
I'll fly another white flag over us
No justifying staying down in silence
We stay between the white lines
No justifying staying down in silence
We stay between the white lines

Hoping for a stroke of luck
But one you're counting on
Trying to deflect away
Are you still stuck here
Hoping for a stroke of luck?
Keep counting all the fresh starts we've had
I'll raise another white flag so that
We keep counting all the fresh starts we've had
I'll fly another white flag over us
No justifying staying down in silence
We stay between the white lines
No justifying staying down in silence
We stay between the white lines
No justifying staying down in silence
We stay between the white lines
No justifying staying down in silence
We stay between the white lines
No justifying staying down in silence
We stay between the white lines
The white lines
Between the white lines
Cover up that you're ruthless
Nobody  nobody
Nobody's ever gonna notice
And I am catching on and I am seeing red
How about I prove I'm right and raise it overhead?
I never promised you anything I couldn't do
We try to bury it and rise above
Bury it and rise above you  you
You never promised me you would see it differently
Bury it and rise above
Bury it and rise above you  you
Reaching  reaching for
Reaching for my resistance
Nobody  nobody
Nobody sees it at a distance
And I am catching up and I am seeing red
How about I throw my weight and raise it overhead?

Bury it and rise above
Bury it and rise above you  you
 a sacrifice that we made
 again till you unfocus them away
 we've come this far
Waste the time you could've been here
Count the debt  count the tears
Count the truths and all of my fears
I didn't want to be cynical
Passing place for the soul
You were never predictable
Now I need to let it go
Found the song  played it back
Heard your voice under the feedback
Found a tape that was blank
Saw your face fading into black
I know love is delusional
And I hate when I'm wrong
Yours was never conditional
And now I need to get it gone
No one еver warns you
You'll die in California
No one ever seems to say  say so
No one ever tells you
There's freedom in the failure
Dying in a dream feels like home
No one ever seems to say  say so

Close my eyes  close my heart
Close the book I never meant to start
Say your name in the dark
No one said it would be this hard
I didn't go to the funeral
Heard you cry on the phone
Your voice was so beautiful
And now I need to let it go
No one ever warns you
You'll die in California
No one ever seems to say  say so
No one ever tells you
There's freedom in the failure
Dying in a dream feels like home
No one ever seems to say  say so
God bless this mess that we made ourselves
Pull me into the screen at the end and
God bless this mess that we made for ourselves
Pull me into the screen at the end
Pull me into the screen at the end
Pull me into the screen at the end
Like it always was
Like it always was
Shaped by the clearest blue
But it's not enough
Just another time I'm caught inside every open eye
You'll meet me halfway
So please say you'll meet me
Meet me halfway
Tied to the shifting ground
Like I always was
Like I always was
You were the perfect storm
But it's not enough

Just another time I'm caught inside every open eye

Shaped (Will you keep it half-a-way?) by clearest blue
There is a strength in enduring
They never speak for themselves
We are disappearing
You will be all that I seek in a twisted light
I would live inside you
Words will be all that I keep in an open space
They would live inside you
We hold up to an idea
We just hold up to an idea
We keep going 'til we can't hear dead air
We hold up to an idea

We hold up to an idea
We just hold up to an idea
We keep going 'til we can't hear dead air
We hold up to an idea
We just hold up to an idea
We keep going 'til we can't hear dead air
When we're played out by the band drowning out our sorrows
What will become of us now at the end of time?
What will become of us all at the end of love
When we've stopped looking up?
You can take my heart
And hold it together as we fall apart
Maybe together we can make a mark in the stars we embark
And keep us together as the lights go dark
What will become of us all if we dare to dream
At the end of the scene?
You can take my heart
Hold it together as we fall apart
Maybe together we can make a mark in the stars we embark
And keep us together as the lights go dark
You might also like
What will become of us all at the end of the line?

You can take my heart

Maybe together we can make a mark in the stars we embark
And keep us together as the lights go dark
And you can take my heart
And hold it together as we fall apart
Maybe together we can make a mark in the stars we embark
Drowning in your own beliefs
Careful when you're standing at a broken altar
Asking if we feel relief
Careful when you're looking for a true confession
Mirror what you wanna see
Careful when you're telling us about obsession
Saying that we're never free
You better hold on to what you love
You better give up on giving up
Is it deliver-iver-iverance
Is it deliver-iver-iverance
If you hurt me in exchange?
Trust me when I tell you 'bout my own convictions
Made my mind up long ago
Trust me when I tell you it's a contradiction
Wishing that I didn't know
Trust me that I struggle with all your destruction
Screaming that I told you so
Trust me when I talk about the disillusion
Building up and letting go

Like you mean it

Could tell you that it's no big deal
Maybe I can aim this high
Or maybe I could eat my words
And tell myself to think forward
I will show I believe
And hold you up and know that you're all I see in the light
And never do what I used to
Maybe you
Could tell 'em that you stayed the course
Maybe I could clear my view
Or maybe I should eat my words

And hold you up and know that you're all I see in the light
And never do what I used to
Like there's nothing to regret and nothing to prove
Set my sights high enough
So I see the turning tides are parting for you
Taking back an empty threat
More than you could ever know
Take it back with no regrets
I was better off when I was on your side
And I was holding on
To try and not forget
Hoping that you never know
Take it back with no regrets
I was better off when I was on your side
And I was holding on
No more time second-guessed
Like there's nothing to forget and nothing to lose
Hold my ground long enough
'Til I see the turning tides are coming from you
Taking back an empty threat
More than you could ever know
Take it back with no regrets
I was better off when I was on your side
And I was holding on
To try and not forget
Hoping that you never know
Take it back with no regrets
I was better off when I was on your side

I was better off when I was on your side
And I was holding on
To try and not forget
Hoping that you never know
Take it back with no regrets
I was better off when I was on your side
Keeping secrets until everything became a bit too loud
I could wash it down (I could wash it down)
I could drown it out (I could drown it out)
By filling up the silence with an organ sound
And by writing sentences I used to think were quite profound
And it feels like the weight is too much to carry
Only time will tell
And I wonder if I should've changed my accent
Tried to make myself more attractive
Only time will tell
In the final cut (In the final cut)
In the final scene (In the final scene)
There's a final girl (There's a final girl)
And you know that she should be screaming
Telling all the tales took time that I just do not have

Don't want to find your daughter in a body bag
So I need to get out now while most of me is still intact

Only time will tell
And I wonder if I should've changed my accent
Tried to make myself more attractive
Only time will tell
In the final cut (In the final cut)
In the final scene (In the final scene)
There's a final girl (There's a final girl)
Does she look like me? (Does she look like me?)
In the final cut (In the final cut)
In the final scene (In the final scene)
There's a final girl (There's a final girl)
Savour the pain
I don't expect you to release me
Jumping the gun
Holding my tongue
I never ask you to forgive me
And you will never see my side
And I will always think I'm right
But I always regret the night
I told you I would hate you 'til forever
I told you I would hate you 'til forever
I told you I would hate you 'til forever
Playing the part
Playing the game
I don't expect you to believe me
Missing the mark
We tear it apart

Maybe it's too much for you
What else should I say?
What else could I do?
Maybe I am just too much for you
I told you I would hate you 'til forever
There's nothing left of you here
Things that we remember and do not regret
They don't mean a thing here
I'll be your guide so you can see
The other side and I will never let you get away
Never let you get away
I'll hold your head so you can see
Crossing your heart and hoping to never let you get away
Never let you get away
Everything you prayed for is not overhead
No one else will save you
Trust me when I tell you we are on our own
Overlap our fingers
I'll be your guide so you can see
The other side and I will never let you get away
Never let you get away

Never saying what I wanted
Saying what I needed
I pushed you to the edge
Never knowing what I wanted
Knowing what I needed you to say
Reflections you used to see

Never getting what I wanted
Getting what I needed
I left myself behind

I'm tracing a line
I'm tracing the lines of your hand
You collapse in threes
Show me inside
Wasted and wide like dead sand
You confide in me
Shamed and maligned
Shaped and defined by God's plan
You belong to me
You're crossing a line
I wait for a sign
I'm tracing the lines of your hand
Of your hand
Of your hand
What's yours can be mine
I'm tracing the lines of your hand
Of your hand
Of your hand
You belong with me
Is it worth it now?
And it's such a fucking bore
'Cause I don't need them anymore
So maybe if you just got some guts
We'd kill 'em with a thousand cuts
And say we did it out of love
So save your breath
Give a little of what you have left
Do they know something I don't?
Is it easier when you don't have to count to ten?
When you don't have to pretend?
I want to know that feeling
Is it easier when you don't have to start again?
When you don't wanna make amends?
I want to know that feeling
Good girls don't cry
And good girls don't lie
Good girls don't die
And good girls stay alive

When you don't have to pretend?

Killing your idols is a chore
And it's such a fucking bore
But we don't need them anymore
Before we were dragged up  something was different and nothing was new
How did you see me? We didn't know what we wanted to be
When did we move on? I didn't feel it  nobody told me
Time to kill
Was always an illusion
Time stood still
And now we never will  never will
We wrote our names along the bathroom walls
Graffitiing our hearts across the stalls
I've been waiting for my whole life to grow old
And now we never will  never will
And now we never will  never will
And now we never will  never will
Making a mess and running in circles  getting in fights
We were just kids then  we didn't know how and didn't know when
Taking our chances  calling it off and starting again

We can raise our glasses dancing on the ashes as it burns
Have you reached the point of no return?
We can raise our glasses dancing on the ashes as it burns

I'll be leaving now  nobody's losing
If you could play your part  stay in resistance
Every fault would fade into the distance
Run if you like
All the mistakes that you left behind
Hold me down
You can't deny and I can't deny
Open your eyes
I'll look away and you come around
To build your words
High enough to carry you over
And I never would've given you up
Never would've given you up  you up
If you only hadn't given me up
Only hadn't given me up  me up

 watch as they pull me down
 I'll keep them down
Nothing to lose  nothing to save to make a whole
What if I should make a loss?
Hold up both my hands  my fingers crossed
I don't sleep well  laying low
Never keepin' up  never lettin' go
What if I should look away?
Every human touch will be repaid
Without restraint
Within our veins
We bide our time  stay afloat
Keepin' the sun up off our bones
I never asked to know  never planned
'Til it was swept out of my hands
We bide our time  stay afloat
Keepin' the dying light exposed
I never asked to know  never lied
So I could keep you on my side
We feel the same
Without restraint
We feel the same
Within our veins

What if I should let it fade?

Without restraint

I never asked to know  never planned

Just like you said you would
There are tiny cracks of light underneath me
And you say I got it wrong
But I try hard to uncover them
I have somehow got
Away with everything
Anything you ever did was strictly by design
But you got it wrong
And I'll go anywhere but there
And you had best believe
That you cannot build what I don't need
And I know I need to feel relief
And I know you'll never fold
But I believe nothing that I'm told
And I know I need to feel relief
I know I need to feel released
Take care to tell it just as it was
Take care to tell on me for the cause
I know I need to feel released
Take care to bury all that you can
Take care to leave a trace of a man
You might also like
I will show restraint
Just like we said we should
You think I'll apologise for things I left behind
But you got it wrong
And I'm as sane as I ever was
You talk far too much
For someone so unkind
I will wipe the salt off of my skin
And I'll admit that I got it wrong
And there is grey between the lines
And you had best believe
That you cannot build what I don't need
And I know I need to feel relief
And I know you'll never fold
But I believe nothing that I'm told
And I know I need to feel relief

Shouldn't leave  feeling faint  we both know why
You got to show me both knees  cold  I lie
Hold me slowly  hide me till I can fight
Always  we can sing  we can make time
Old songs  flood and flame  you could be mine
But you got to show me both knees  skin and bone
Clothe me  throw me  move me till
I can sell you lies
You can't get enough
Make a true believer of
Anyone  anyone  anyone
I can call you up
If I feel alone
I can feed your dirty mind
Like I know  like I know what you want
Icon of symmetry  swallowing sides
Fall down in front of me  follow my eyes
But I've got to see you moving  waste no time
Teach me  make me holy till

Like I did last time
I won't go slow
All the things you tell yourself
Offer no resolution
You know that this will break us
But you push as far as we can go
Taking every chance to find solutions
That never make anyone happy
We are done this time
You don't owe me
Take a final look at me

If you never take the weight on your own?
No one tells us what is hard and what is fair
And we will deliver once we know where to fall
We are made of our longest days
We will take the best parts of ourselves and make them gold
We are made of our smallest thoughts
We are breathing and letting go
We will take the best parts of ourselves and make them gold
Can you steady all the hands that you hold
If you never look away from the drop?
And we will deliver once we know where to fall

We are made of our longest days

We are made of our smallest thoughts
We are breathing and letting go
We will take the best parts of ourselves and make them gold
Careful what you wish for
We're looking for angels in the darkest of skies
Saying that we wanted more
I feel like I'm falling  but I'm trying to fly
Where does all the good go?
We're looking for answers in the highest of highs
But will we ever  ever know?
And I need you to know I'm not asking for a miracle
But if love is enough  could you let it show?
If you feel it  could you let me know?
(Oh  oh)
(Oh  oh)
(Oh  oh) I'm not asking for a miracle
Ask for forever when the end is in sight
Showing what you want to
We're looking for light inside an ocean of night
But will we ever see it through?
And I need you to know I'm not asking for a miracle

No more bones and I will tell you no lies

At least I am not
So cold
You give me everything I never deserved
This time
You know I'll leave
Here's to taking what you came for
And here's to running off the pain
And here's to just another no man
Here's to never-ending circles
And building them on top of me
And here's to just another no man
Cut off

Red lines
That I will draw will come and cover you up

I will cover you and show you the way
It's a sequence that you never learned
It's a lesson I will never forget
I can hear you in the overtones
Just an echo of the promise we made
We can never look back
I'm the night sky
I'm the fire in your eyes
And I want you
Now and for all time
I'm the cold heart
I'm the secret that you hide
I'll be listening until you decide
I communicate in simple streams (Take your time)
I'm the only one who gave you the truth (Speak to me)
Once you leave me you were really gone (Far and near)
Give me something to remember you by (Always be)
All that's here is what you left behind (Majesty)
Slowly moving in the back of my mind (Can't forget)
Take a moment to remember me (And I will)
And make me blind so I don't ever look back

Can I forgive if I forget
All my mistakes and my regrets?
If all of this is for the best?
I've been singing that song again
Another ballad that won't make amends
It's been giving me nightmares again
And they don't end
I've been singing along again
Another poem designed for revenge
Now I'm living the nightmare again
And it won't end
Pity the actor canning the laughter
I know I waited too long
A conclusion far too foregone

An ugly song came from a ballad for a friend

I love it when you talk about it to people who weren't there
The arrogance and narcissism laid bare

No more excuses and no more playing dead
There are no silver linings in anything you said
You could keep on denying and I could stay away
I will take it all in one breath and hold it down

 you never seem to stay there

 I only want to belong

 cold
 everyone knows it's me
It's leaving your body now
Slow heart  set free
A circuit of consciousness
When you are truly yourself
You will succumb to a permanence

A shadow resides by night

There is a blank page for you
Give me the bones of what you believe
Maybe they'll save you from me
Will I be the strong hand keeping you safe?
Or will I break you in half?
And you will never be under my thumb
But you are not your own man
See the way we all run
When we know it all off by heart
Will we win or lose it this time?
When the pressure's building for a great white hope
Do you give up the things that you love?
And the pressure's building till it takes you whole
Can you go back on your own word?
For what you kill for slowly
How it will grind you into the ground

Keep believing it's my turn to hide
In a place where we don't have a prayer
There's a tether that's keeping me there
Trade our places
Take no chances
Bind me 'til my lips are silent
Stay where you are
Chasing things that we should run from
Will we ever get away from this place?
It's an image that's burned on my chest
For a moment you need me to stay
Cold-blooded and drifting away
Trade our places
Take no chances
Bind me 'til my lips are silent

And we've come as far as we're ever gonna get
Until you realise  that you should go-o-o-oh
Come in misery  where you can seem as old as your omens
And the mother we share
Will never keep your proud head from falling
The way is long  but you can make it easy on me
And the mother we share
Will never keep our cold heart from calling
In the dying light  I'm the only one here
And I will cover you  until you go-o-o-oh

Echoing of every place that we call our home
And I don't talk
Of any time I ever believed in the unknown
I need it
So I hold onto every mistake that I made alone
And I don't lie
When I say that we will never return to closing doors
Sleep tight in a new light
Through another warning call
Look down on the cold ground
I will try to break the fall
I feel it
Moving in another direction we call our own
And I won't chase
Anyone who ever believed in what they stole
I need it
So I hold onto every peace of mind that I chose
And I don't lie

Bleed out  what the fuck were you thinking?
We are gonna fall if you lead us
Nowhere  no wasted time

If we sink  we lift our love
I'll be a thorn in your side 'til you die
I'll be a thorn in your side for always
If we sink  we lift our love
Me  let me stop for a second
The held heart only beats in the evening
Low tide  watching full flight
I tell you to cut it out if you make me
You know why  the slowest bark is a breather
How high? How will you decide?

Hiding inside my dreams
Fighting inside my head
Scaring myself to death
We live in a wonderland
Like blood isn't on our hands
When will it be enough?
When will I say I knew we had to get away
Knew we had to get away
Knew we had to get away from the storm?
Can't live forever with my head in the clouds
Can't predict the weather with my feet on the ground
I can't live forever with my head and my heart in the clouds
I am counting every sheep
But these rabbit holes run deep
Trying to be so right
Desperate to start a fight
All of this pointless talk
Why can't I turn it off?
When will it all just stop?

And let it all fall down
Let it all fall down
Sky is light

You carried mine

They said that you would call
And we'll laugh until the end
Let the rain come down
Let it all come down
