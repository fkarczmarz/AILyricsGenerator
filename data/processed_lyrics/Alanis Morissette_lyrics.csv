lyrics
"Do you not play dirty when engaged in competition?
Do you have a big intellectual capacity
But know that it alone does not equate to wisdom?
Do you see everything as an illusion
But enjoy it even though you are not of it?
And don't believe in capital punishment?
These are twenty-one things that I want in a lover
Not necessarily needs but qualities that I prefer
Do you derive joy from diving in and seeing that
Loving someone can actually feel like freedom?
Are you funny and self-deprecating
Like adventure and have many formed opinions?
These are twenty-one things that I want in a lover
Not necessarily needs but qualities that I prefer
I figure I can describe it since I have a choice in the matter
And these are twenty-one things I choose to choose in a lover

I'm in no hurry  I could wait forever
I'm in no rush 'cause I like being solo
There are no worries and certainly no pressure
Up for being experimental?
Are you athletic?
Are you thriving in a job that helps your brother?
Are you not addicted?
These are twenty-one things that I want in a lover
Not necessarily needs but qualities that I prefer
I figure I can describe it since I have a choice in the matter
And these are twenty-one things I choose to choose in a lover
 we've been believing since time immemorial
 there was division
My sweater is on backwards and inside out
I don't wanna dissect everything today
But I can't help it
And there I go jumping before the gunshot has gone off
Slap me with the splintered ruler
And it would knock me to the floor if I wasn't there already
If only I could hunt the hunter
And all I really want is some patience
A way to calm the angry voice
And all I really want is deliverance
Do I wear you out?
You must wonder why I'm relentless and all strung out
I'm consumed by the chill of solitary
I'm like Estella
I like to reel it in and then spit it out
I'm frustrated by your apathy

And I am frightened by the corrupted ways of this land
If only I could meet the maker
And I am fascinated by the spiritual man
And what I wouldn't give to find a soulmate
Someone else to catch this drift
And what I wouldn't give to meet a kindred
Why are you so petrified of silence?
Or when you think you're gonna die?
Or did you long for the next distraction?
And all I need now is intellectual intercourse
A soul to dig the hole much deeper
And I have no concept of time other than it is flying
If only I could kill the killer
A place to find a common ground
And all I really want is a wavelength
And all I really want is some comfort
A way to get my hands untied
And all I really want is some justice
A way to calm me down
And all I really want is deliverance
A place to find a common ground
I've watched this experience raise them to pseudo higher levels
I've watched them leave their families in pursuit of your nirvana
I've seen them coming to line up from Switzerland and America
And how long have we been sleeping?
Do you see me hanging on to every word you say?
How soon will I be holy?
How much longer till you completely absolve me?
I've seen them give their drugs up in place of makeshift altars
I've heard them chanting Kali Kali frantically
I've heard them rotely repeat your teachings with elitism
I've seen them boasting robes and foreign sandalwood beads
How long have we been sleeping?
Do you see me hanging on to every word you say?
How soon will I be holy?
How much longer till you completely absolve me?

I've seen men overlooking God in their own essence
I've seen their upward glances in hopes of instant salvation

How long 'til enlightenment?
How much longer until you completely absolve me?

'Cause I don't even care anymore
Call me what you need to
To make yourself comfortable

I've not felt a glimpse of ease
And I have not made much headway
Since I have come back from the war
And I no longer give a damn
'Bout things that used to matter

As I am frozen on the spot

How to stay paralyzed by fear of abandonment
How to defer to men in solvable predicaments
How to control someone to be a carbon copy of you
How to have that not work and have them run away from you
How to keep people at arm's length and never get too close
How to mistrust the ones you supposedly love the most
How to pretend you're fine and don't need help from anyone
How to feel worthless unless you're serving or helping someone
I'll teach you all this in eight easy steps
I'll show you how to in eight easy steps
I'll show you how leadership looks when taught by the best

It still smarts like it was four minutes ago
We only influenced each other totally
We only bruised each other even more so
You touch me like you are my blood
You affect me like you are my dad
How long can a girl be shackled to you?
And how long before my dignity is reclaimed?
And how long can a girl stay haunted by you?
Soon I'll grow up and I won't even flinch at your name
Soon I'll grow up and I won't even flinch at your name
Where've you been? I heard you moved to my city

 a little too late
 confusing as it was
 they never went blind for what they did
 the Skeptic and the Son
 but I believe again
 will I be forgiven?
You don't owe him anything
Do you go to the dungeon
To find out how to make peace
With your days in the dungeon?
Writing a letter to you
Didn't make me feel any more peaceful
Than how I felt when we weren't speaking
Because I didn't cop to what I did
I can't love you 'cause we're supposed to have professional boundaries
I’d like you to be schooled and in awe
As though you were kissed by God
Full on the lips
I'm in the front row
The front row with popcorn
I get to see you

Slid into the ditch
I have this overwhelming loss of ambition
Why we shouldn't be together
All of which could have been easily refuted
But the conversation was hypothetical
I am totally short of breath for you
Why can't you shut your stuff off?
I'm in the front row
The front row with popcorn
I get to see you
(And I laughed until my lungs hurt
I love how you bust my chops
You don't always feel seen
Sometimes you feel erasable
I think we should be careful of how much time we spend together)
For a while while I’m speaking
You know how much you hate to be interrupted
Maybe spend some time alone
Fill up your proverbial cup so that it doesn't always have to be about you
I've been wanting your undivided attention
I like the fact that you're nothing like me
Are you not burdened by the lack of perspective people have of your charmed life seemingly?
I'm in the front row
The front row with popcorn
I get to see you
(You never meant to be ungrateful
Nor held up to be whipped or wept for certainly
Apparently you've been misrepresented
Dealing with the concept of arrows being slung
Towards your outrageous fortune)
I’m mad at myself for spending so much time with you and your Jekyll and Hydeness
I’m glad I figuratively slapped you on the wrist
(I know he's blood but you can still turn him away)
(You don't owe him anything)
(Unfortunately you needed a health scare to reprioritize)
No thanks to the soap box
Having me rile against them won't make an ounce of difference
I'm in the front row
The front row with popcorn
I get to see you
Many a stitch a friend a man's been left for you
The tongues I’ve bitten for you
Many a new city for you
Many a risk taken for you
You who has soldiered through the profane
They were distracted and shut down
So why  why would you talk to me at all?
Such words were dishonorable and in vain
Their promise as solid as the fog
And where was your watchman then?
I'll be your keeper for life  as your guardian
I'll be your warrior of care  your first warden
I'll be your angel on call  I'll be on demand
The greatest honor of all  as your guardian
You  you in the chaos feigning sane
You who was pushed beyond what's humane

I am in my kitchen
This place is so familiar on my knees
I can hear the footsteps
I can see their back walking out
I don't know who to reach for when I need
And so I'll pray to Her today
She's coming in warm all like Kali
She's not buying my shell
She sees right through my armor
She lingers in my shadows knowingly
She treats them like they're angels
She beckons me to braver inquiry
And so I pray to Her today
She's coming in hot all like Shakti

And even when I cut her off

She's coming in hot like all Kali
We were shivering  yet warmed by the subject matter
My wife is in the next room
We've been having troubles  you know
Please  don't tell her or anyone
But I need to talk to somebody
You said  Wouldn't it be a shame if I knew how great I was
Five minutes before I died?
I'd be filled with such regret before I took my last breath
And I said  You're willing to tell me this now
And you're not gonna die any time soon
And I said  I haven't been eating chicken or meat or anything
And laughed and said  We're at the top of the food chain
And yes  you're still a fine woman
I cringed
I was hoping
I was hoping we could heal each other
I was hoping
I was hoping we could be raw together
Thank you for your business  sir
You're successful and established  sir
And we like the frequency with which you dine here  sir
And your money
I was all pigtails and cords

And you said  Yes
I said  I don't believe in revenge
In right or wrong  good or bad
In the emergency room  bleeding after beating his kid
And she threw a shoe at his head?
And I think what he did was wrong
And I would've had a hard time feeling compassion for him
I had to watch my tone for fear of having you feel judged
I was hoping
I was hoping we could dance together
I was hoping
You only find out they’re racist after you accept
There’s free office cake on the first day of your diet

It’s a funny tweet that nobody faves
And who would’ve thought it figures
It’s a traffic jam when you try to use Waze

You may never have or hold a child
You will learn to lose everything
We are temporary arrangements
And you're like a 90's Noah
And they laughed at you
As you packed all of your things
And they wonder why you're frustrated
And they wonder why you're so angry
And is it just me or are you fed up?

I don't wanna be your mother
I didn't carry you in my womb for nine months
Show me the back door
Visiting hours are nine to five
Already know that you'd find some way to sneak me in and oh
Mind the empty bottle with the holes along the bottom
And I am not the doctor
I don't wanna be the sweeper of the egg shells that you walk upon
And I don't wanna be your other half
I believe that one and one make two
What are you hungry for?

I have been loud and pretentious
I have been utterly threatened
I've gotten candy for my self-interest
The sexy treadmill capitalist
Heaven forbid I be criticized
Heaven forbid I be ignored
You mean we actually are all one
I've been out of reach and separatist
Heaven forbid average (Whatever average means)

You walked the fields with all the fences down
You never knew the scent of the predator
You didn't know the house was on fire
And so you worked as you should
While they prey'd on all you ached for
And they pounced as they would
While the guards were away  oh
Hey  hey  you marauders
You got away while they claim I'm a liar
Why aren't the gods and heroes all around me?
And everyone's turning their eyes to the ground
And so you strike while it's hot
While the barricades are broken
You attacked at your will
While all the locks are frayed  oh

Desperate for the embryonic

You mispronounced my name
You didn't wait for all the information

Wait a minute  sir
You kinda hurt my feelings
You see me as a sweet back-loaded puppet
And you've got meal ticket taste
I see right through you
I know right through you
I feel right through you

How dare he?
Your mother never left the house
She never married anyone else
You took it upon yourself
To console her
You reminded her so much of your father
So you were banished and you
Wonder why you're so hypersensitive
And why you can't trust anyone but us
But then how can I begin to forgive her?
So many years under bridges with dirty water
She was foolish and selfish
I don't know where to begin
In all of my fifty odd years
I have been silently suffering and adapting
Perpetuating and enduring
That I have unresolved problems?

Excruciating labor

I felt so self-conscious on the couch
He was sitting down across from me
Who doesn't know how involved she should get
You say his interjecting
Was him just calling me on my shit

I walked up the stairs in my mind's eye
I remember how they would creak loudly
She was only responsive with a drink
He was only responsive by photo
I was only trying to be
The best big brother I could

Sometimes ready to crack open wide
Can you imagine I pay him
Seventy-five dollars an hour?
Sometimes it feels like highway robbery
And sometimes it's peanuts

Miss cracking up and wrestling
