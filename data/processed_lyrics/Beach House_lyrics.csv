" it's the stone of a home you know
 but they don't know how far we'll go
 but they don't know how far we'll go
 we're still right here
 can't say we heard it all
 we stood so long we fell
 but they don't know how far we'd go
 we're still right here
 can't say we saw it all
 we stood so long we fell
 we're still right here
 can't say we felt it all
 we stood so long we fell
Like night you’ll disappear
Caught in the atmosphere
Where you go
She casts no shadow
Still you know she's near
L–
Here she comes
All parts of everything
Stars in the motherhand
With the dark thunder
Above you
Come to us soaring

10:37
House made of the dawn
'Cause I've been around before
Thought I wasn't looking anymore
Been a fool for weeks
'Cause my heart stands for nothing and your soul's too weak
Got a will that's been around for days
Big mistake
We don't need a sign to know of better times
Running around 'cause you beat yourself up
And you made a crack and the one that you love is gone
How much longer can you play with fire
Before you turn into a liar?
Running around 'cause you beat yourself up
And you made a crack and the one that you love is gone
How much longer can you play with fire
Before you turn into a liar?

I've been around before
Thought you weren't looking anymore
I'm gonna tear off all the petals
From the rose that's in your mouth
Beyond love
You wanted to find Elvis and I didn't understand
They take the simple things inside you
And put nightmares in your hands
Beyond love
This man comes to me
Heartbreak did this
He was made to believe
That he should live without it
All I know's what I see
No change in this
Visions born in the dreams
Of a world left without it
We really wanna know
We really do agree
We really do agree
We really wanna know
The last thing that she sees before they turn off all the lights

Beyond love
All I know is what I see and I can't live without this
Could you ever believe beyond love?
I really wanna know
 but it's something to hold
 but it's something to hold
 but it's something to hold
On the ceiling
My mouth
And these arms
Hold the feeling
Even I can't control my nature
If they should come up much before you
I would not ever try to capture you
Lead me to the gallows
Where out corner my eye
There's something
It's pulling me back from nothing
From nothing
If they should come up much before you
I would not ever try to capture you

Scenes change
Before they are over
Brought near
Cold gone glowing
Night sing
Star death ringing
Brought fear
I want to lie in
They call Orion
The colors missing
Upon the dark spring
Cold red light-years
Brought near
Dark gone glowing
Night sing
The worlds colliding
Unreal dividing
The colors missing
All things I loved
But do not know
On Hopewell Road
These days of candy
Live in your mind
Those violet lines
White fenced in miles
Across my eyes
A world inside you
No photograph
My natural one
The rising sun
Live in your mind
Just like that
I know it comes too soon
The universe is riding off with you
A little bit of you I keep it close to me
I know it comes too soon
The universe is riding on with you
I know it comes too soon
I know it stays for nobody
I want to know you there
Tell her nothing
Tell her that you’re
Waiting
And I know you like it
So you try to hide it
I was looking
Out the window
All the people
Waiting
Tell her something
Tell her nothing
Tell her that you’re
Fading
And I know you like it
So you try to hide it
And you know I like it
So I dive to find it

Is it my imagination?
Waves crash mechanical motion
Left all illusion
Of dark and dead-end rooms
Where the drinks keep pouring down
And the candles keep me warm
Isolation tenders
Something fragile coming soon
Skinny angels making eyes at cameras
Perched in every room
I had a good run playing horses in my mind
Left my heart out somewhere running
Wanting strangers to be mine
Memory's a sacred meat
That's drying all the time
I am loving losing life
Strawberries in springtime
Pretty happy accidents
My awareness that I'm lucky
Rolling clouds over cement
Maybe there's a screenplay
Or a bathroom I can hide
Down the hallways of a high school
And the dances left behind

Write letters on the sky
How many turns it took to reach you
I had a good run playing horses in my mind
Disappearing in the mirror
Watch it as it burns out
(It is just a flame)
Freckle faced young virgin
(It is just a game)
Platinum vision
Bringing you down again and again
Again and again
Black clock looming distant
You're a great white
They were never listening
Waiting for the light to come again
Deep beneath the waves
Lilies of the day
Garden of remains
Diamond maiden chained
To your sons and daughters
Bending at the altar
Don't you disappear in the mirror again and again
Again and again

Get dressed to undress
Depressed to impress
All night long
All night long
Turn on the TV
They all wanna see me
Come undone

Pick all the petals
Off all the daisies
One by one

The pattern caught in a falling tear

Tell me what you see
Cross it like a T
It's all the same to me
This game I play
I do it every day
Then promise I'll be fine
Bear it every time
When you turn the lights down low
See this state I'm in
Is crawling in my skin
Fevers took me back
And turned me inside out
When you turn the lights down low
It's what you do
This pulls me through
To the other end
Where it begins
You see through me
I come alive

Candy-colored misery
I'd go anywhere you want me to
You should see there's a place I want to take you
When the train comes I will hold you
(When the train comes I will hold you)
'Cause you blow my mind
When the unknown will surround you
(When the unknown will surround you)
There is no right time

The branches of the trees
They will hang lower now
You will grow too quick
Then you will get over it
The branches of the trees

There's a place I want to take you
When the unknown will surround you
There's a place I want to take you (Were you high)
When they knocked on the door looking for you?
When the unknown will surround you (Take my hand)
As our bodies lift up slowly
There's a place I want to take you (Were you high)
When they knocked on the door looking for you?
When the unknown will surround you (Take my hand)
As our bodies lift up slowly
Mirrors once again
Nothing left to say
Tomorrow's gone today
Lose your smile
Lose your smile
Sweet lies on your face
Tears are out of place
Sunshine in the rain
Comes in rainbows and leaves again
Lose your smile
Lose your smile
It's your own self giving in
Who's to blame this time?
Lose your smile
Lose your smile

No tear in the eye or fear in my mind
The forest is thick and we don't recognize
We parted our lips and we reached from inside

Need more people to be satisfied
With no fear of a god and a prayer for the night
You come into our minds and you rush through our lives
We parted our lips and we reached from inside

Seven girls at the end of day
She who sings
She who prays
Side by side
In a line
See their eyes
Eyes that show
Eyes that show what's you
True today
Seven ways
Eyes that shine
Silent skies
Show a way
What is you
Where is she today
Saw my girl
From within
She who sways
She who spins

Stranger things will come before you
Always out of the way
Can you call it? See it coming
Just enough to tell a story

Waiting for a new year

Visions of a feeling

 I don't mind

What's that you say?
Down the hall  I heard a song
Who knows  drifting away
Baby at night when I look at you
Nothing in this world keeps me confused
All it takes  look in your eyes
All of me is to tow the waste
What's that you say  it's going away?
It's painful but you do what you must
Takes time to know
Baby at night when I look at you
Nothing in this world keeps me confused
All it takes  look in your eyes
Who knows if there're roses in heaven
Let go of that empty feeling
Not dumber just a little bit older
The sound (The sound)
The swell of strings begins to rise
The stage (The stage)
Is set (Is set)
This heart of mine
Goes out of time
Blue skies turn black
Behind our back
Don't let me go
Once was a fairy tale
Then it all went to hell
Swans on a starry lake
Hearts that were made to break
Tears through a white lace veil
Pink funeral

I looked in your eyes
Ready for this life?
Did you see it coming?
It happened so fast
The timing was perfect
Water on glass
Like tracing figure eights
And if this ice should break
It would be my mistake

Between the thrills

When they go boom

Is the one you might lack
In the size of your eyes

Righteous prize?

With our hearts
When they beat pure
They stand apart
Watch the seabird fall

And then it's dark again
A new development
Wishing that it meant
Something natural
Don't we know it's cruel
And it goes dark again
Just like a spark
Hallucination comes
Think of everyone
That never shared before
From my mouth to yours
And then it's dark again

And then it vanishes
No one around
And then it comes again
Just like a spark
And then we're vanishing
No one around

It's no good unless it grows
Feel this burning  love of mine
Deep inside the ever spinning
Tell me  does it feel?
It's no good unless it's real
Hillsides burning  wild-eyed turning 'til we're running from it
I'd take care of you if you'd ask me to
In a year or two
You say swimming in the lake  we'll come across a snake
It is real and then it's fake
Feel its heartbeat  feel what you heat
Far so fast  it feels too late
I'd take care of you if you'd ask me to
In a year or two
Aah  aah
Can I wait the hours 'til you find me?
Climb up to the tower so that you could see
Violence in the flowers where they found you
Can I wait the hours?
Would it be untrue?
Climb up to the tower so that you could see
All across the hours
Frightened eyes looking back at me
Change your mind  don't care about me
Frightened eyes looking back at me
Change your mind  don't leave without me

Mad in your intentions  fear it isn't real
All the recollections spinning in a field
Left in your possession 'til it isn't real

The thunder rolls in with the dark
Tiny fingers on the edges
Watch it unravel  pulling everything apart
In the night  we sleep together
The walls are shaking in their skin
Does it become you  troublemaker?
Watch them unravel you  pulling everything apart
Always  always a face to remind me
Someone like you
Someone like you

Of an age that was and could never be?
So we hold it close when we feel the most
Like a love that we could not leave behind

The name that you call in its place isn't waiting for your embrace
The world that you love to behold cannot hold you anymore
In a matter of time it will slip from my mind
In a matter of time
Our father won't come home 'cause he is seeing double
And in a while you start to smile
Can I believe in how the past is what will catch you?
And in a while you start to smile

Looked everywhere
Driving home every night
The shadows stay by your side
You built a city
All in your head
Triangle of ever light
It turns you on every night
Need a companion
A hidden prayer
You know you're not losing your mind
What’s left you make something of it
The sky and what's left above it
The way you want nothing of it
Baby I'm yours
No better color
Look everywhere
You built a city
All in your head
You know you're not losing your mind
What’s left you make something of it
The sky and what's left above it
The way you want nothing of it
Don't know which side you're on
Wishes on a wheel
Wishes on a wheel
The voices in the hall
Will carry on their talking
Carry weight you can't take
Wishes on a wheel
Is it even real?
The contact that you make
The moment when a memory aches
Who can tell?
You do it well
Wishes on a wheel
How's it supposed to feel?

Won't know which side you're on

But I can't have it
Images fly by
I cannot say much
But I want it all
And I want it all (woo)
I want it all
But I can't have it
Images fly by
I cannot say much
But I want it all
And I want it all
When she closes her eyes
Looks inside
Never knowing
Shooting for the stars
It's gone too far
And you know it
I can't keep you there
You will braid your hair
Throw it everywhere
You're everywhere
You don't give a fuck
Swimming pools
Forever glowing
You break all the rules

You will braid your hair
Throw it everywhere

In a swimming pool
You break all the rules
Keeps on going

I cannot say much
But I want it all
And I want it all
You're my trick of the eye
I want it all
That passes me by
But I can't have it
Keeps on going

You will braid your hair
Throw it everywhere
Images fly by
Or everywhere
You don't give a fuck
Swimming pools
I cannot say much
Forever glowing
You break all the rules

You will braid your hair
Throw it everywhere

In a swimming pool
You break all the rules
And I want it all
Keeps on going
Oasis child born and so wild
Don't I know you better than the rest?
All deception  all deception from you
Your love is stag in the white sand
Wilderness for miles  eyes so mild and wise
Don't I know you better than the rest?
All deception  all deception from you
Anyway you run  you run before us
Black and white horse arching among us
Anyway you run  you run before us
Black and white horse arching among us
Your love is stag in the white sand
Oasis child born into a man
Don't I know you better than the rest?
All deception  all deception from you
Wilderness for miles  eyes so mild and wise
Oasis child born and so wild
Don't I know you better than the rest?
All deception  all deception from you
