"Why don't you let me stop by?
So we should party all night
I hope you got a healthy appetite
You know that I'm the girl that you should call (Come on)
Make it like your birthday every day
Give you something good to celebrate
So make (So make) a wish (A wish)
I'll make it like your birthday every day
I'll be (I'll be) your gift (Your gift)
Give you something good to celebrate
So hot and heavy 'til dawn
I got you spinnin' like a disco ball
All night they're playin' your song

A long vacation didn't sound so bad
Was full of secrets  locked up tight like Iron Mountain
Running on empty  so out of gas
Thought I wasn’t enough
Found I wasn’t so tough
Laying on the bathroom floor
We were living on a fault line
And I felt the fault was all mine
Couldn’t take it anymore
By the grace of God (There was no other way)
I picked myself back up (I knew I had to stay)
I put one foot in front of the other and I
Looked in the mirror and decided to stay
Wasn't gonna let love take me out that way
I thank my sister for keeping my head above the water
When the truth was like swallowing sand
Now every morning  there is no more mourning
Oh  I can finally see myself again
You might also like
I know I am enough  possible to be loved
It was not about me
Now I have to rise above
Let the universe call the bluff
Yeah  the truth will set you free
By the grace of God (There was no other way)
I picked myself back up (I knew I had to stay)
I put one foot in front of the other and I
Looked in the mirror and decided to stay
Wasn't gonna let love take me out
That way  no
Not in the name of love (In the name of love)
That way  no
That way  no
I am not giving up
By the grace of God
I picked myself back up
I put one foot in front of the other
And I looked in the mirror (Looked in the mirror)
Looked in the mirror (Looked in the mirror)
By the grace of God (By the grace of God)
(There was no other way)
I picked myself back up (Picked myself back up)
(I knew I had to stay)
I put one foot in front of the other and I (In front of the other)
Looked in the mirror and decided to stay
Wasn't gonna let love take me out that way
Let's take a journey
I know a place
Where the grass is really greener
There must be somethin' in the water
Sippin' gin and juice
The boys break their necks
Tryna creep a little sneak peek (What? What? What?  At us)
You could travel the world
But nothing comes close to the golden coast
Once you party with us
You'll be falling in love
Oh  oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
California girls  we're unforgettable
Daisy Dukes  bikinis on top
Sun-kissed skin so hot  we'll melt your popsicle

Living our lives through a lens
Trapped in our white picket fence
Like ornaments
Aren't you lonely
Up there in utopia
Where nothing will ever be enough?
Happily numb
So put your rose-colored glasses on
And party on
Stumbling around like a wasted zombie
We're all chained to the rhythm
Stumbling around like a wasted zombie
We're all chained to the rhythm

Are we tone deaf?
Keep sweeping it under the mat
Thought we could do better than that
I hope we can
So put (So put) your rose-colored glasses on
And party on
Stumbling around like a wasted zombie
We're all chained to the rhythm
Stumbling around like a wasted zombie
We're all chained to the rhythm
It is my desire
Time is ticking for the empire
The truth they feed is feeble
As so many times before
They greed over the people
They stumbling and fumbling and we about to riot
Stumbling around like a wasted zombie (Like a wasted zombie)
I wanna see you soon as I wipe the crust from my eyes

I'm the small town
One in seven billion
Why can't it be me?
They told me I was out there  tried to knock me down
Took those sticks and stones  showed 'em I could build a house
They tell me that I'm crazy  but I'll never let 'em change me
They said I'm going nowhere  tried to count me out
Took those sticks and stones  showed 'em I could build a house
They tell me that I'm crazy  but I'll never let 'em change me

Why did we put all our hopes in a box in the attic?

Caught my attention
I kissed a girl and I liked it

Barbies on the barbecue

We'd make out in your Mustang to Radiohead
And on my eighteenth birthday  we got matching tattoos
Used to steal your parents' liquor and climb to the roof
Talked about our future like we had a clue

I would be your girl
We'd keep all our promises
Be us against the world
In another life
I would make you stay
