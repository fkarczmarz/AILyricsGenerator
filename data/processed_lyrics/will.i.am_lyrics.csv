"Thugger
(808 Mafia)
Every time I fuck I gotta hit me least like two bitches
Money stand like eight feet just like two midgets
Who the fuck told you that Young Thugger Thugger don't fuck up the beat?
Stoner my lifestyle
I'm livin' too wild
I came to make you proud
That money keep her around
Can't wait for my time to come back around
She see that you don't got Lil Haiti's style
Plus I just seen Snoop on Girls Gone Wild
I just bought a Bentley and a bitch came with it
Young rich nigga hittin' million dollar licks
Balling in New York like a motherfucking Knick
And everywhere I go I gotta pass like the staff
I'm goin' off top like a motherfuckin' lay up
I left ten bands in a motherfuckin' cab

Every time I fuck I gotta hit me least like two bitches
Money stand like eight feet just like two midgets
I knew I was gonna run my money up and everybody didn't
Hope the pussy nigga get a bigger sentence
And I'ma shoot that motherfucker 'til he livid
Bitches wanna see a nigga thumb through it fast
I'ma name myself Young Thug Attendant
All of my cups are muddy I fuck my bitches' buddies
Panamera with the tinted roof
I just ball her down whenever she call my pattern
Every time I fuck I gotta hit me least like two bitches
It's Guwop
Trap house (Thugger)  bunkin'
Trap house mansion
We got London on da Track
I'm pourin' fours and shit  I need to just put a deuce in (Drank)
Car cost four-hundred-thou' and I put a roof in
My nigga pot cook it so good  he put his shoe in it
You know that there's some straps in the club  they let my crew in (Squad)
If you ain't talkin' 'bout buyin' grams then I'm a deaf man (Shh)
I can make the dope do numbers  the Stacey Augmon
I told my bitch to dye her hair red like Dennis Rodman
If Gucci Mane got so much money then why he robbin'?
(It's Guwop)  again
Thugger and Guwop  again
Chasin' that guap  again
That my lil' whoadie  again
We chasin' that money baby  again
We fuckin' your homie's baby  again
Pull up and pour it
I'ma go gold and you know it
I got gold on my Rollie (Woo)
And I'm real right like a poet
