Let's pretend Marshall Mathers never picked up a pen
Let's pretend things woulda been no different
Pretend he just made excuses that were so paper thin
Pretend he just stayed outside all day and played with his friends
Pretend he even had a friend to say was his friend
And it wasn't time to move and schools weren't changin' again
He wasn't socially awkward and just strange as a kid
He had a father and his mother wasn't crazy as shit
And he never dreamed he could rip stadiums and just lazy as shit
You need to get your cranium checked. You're thinkin' like an alien
It just ain't realistic. Now pretend
They ain't just make him angry with this shit
And there was no one he could even aim when he's pissed at
He's gon' have a hard time explainin' to Hailie and Lainey
Airplanes in the night sky are like

Airplanes in the night sky are like
Shooting stars? I could really use a
Wish right now (Yeah)
I could use a dream or a genie or a wish
To go back to a place much simpler than this
'Cause after all the partyin' and smashin' and crashin'
And all the glitz and the glam and the fashion
And all the pandemonium and all the madness
There comes a time where you fade to the blackness
And when you starin' at that phone in your lap
But that's just how the story unfolds
You get another hand soon after you fold
What would you wish for if you had one chance?
And I'll be right back at it by the end of the night

Before the politics that we call the rap game
And back when ain't nobody listen to my mixtape
And back before I tried to cover up my slang
And get back to the music that started this shit?
I'm hopin' we can make some wishes out of airplanes

I guess 2010's the first year that you gave a shit
I need some space so someone please make me some room in this bitch
Why do I rep that east side and why do they all call me B.O.?
Don’t be letting them tell you them lies
We make the industry real when it’s fake
So stay meditating so your head is facing
Excuse my language but I’m fed up with the same shit
My momma told me this back when I was nameless
I guess you could call me David Ruffin
Sometimes I rhyme like I’m inside Einstein's mind
Looking at these jive guys claiming they lost they mind
Till you had the whole world flipped upside down
Right side up from the DEC so the Eastside’s up
Fired up so you know
I’m kinda like a blur with these words
Guess I'm more absurd with these verbs
Pretty soon I’ma leave Earth
This is military combat soldiers standing guard round my yard
We don’t want her round my team
She’s a slut and she’s a freak
But you don’t know cause she’s discreet
I swear I see everything that's a bit
Man I’m fed up to my neck with the stress
I guess the only exception to these girls is that I rap
But I only attack
Everybody know that I’m a motherfucking monster
Monster... Energy Drink shoulda been my sponsor
I give a fuck about numbers so I do find it ironic
These niggas get mad at me
Talking all sideways with they eyes glazed
And they say that I went pop and the streets say I ain't hip hop
Members of the hip-hop community are mourning the shocking

If I had a dollar for every agent they sent my way?
Then I'd have enough money to send a rocket to space
And get some of that hair gel them NASA hoes be using
Cuz most these truther pages on a payroll
Heroes and villains become harder to identify
Kindred spirits separated at birth
Fighting for their place in time to be solidified
The clock ticks faster and faster
While time runs a marathon in this Babylon
The beginning of the calm before the storm
It seems the bigger I get it's the more they get mad at me
Cause there ain't no rules inside this fight that we battling
And I swear it's like a fucked up reality
You think you know me? You ain't seen the half of me
And they don't make a television that handles the frequencies
Of my channel and there ain't no computer that can hack it

Got a watch for my wrist and a watch for my Pops

I'm in my castle and I'm never coming down
They always said I had my head in the clouds

How can you get the picture if it come out blurred
What life taught me can’t be unlearned
And every bridge can’t be unburned
You can’t wait ‘til you get your turn
I could try to make it home but you’re still on third
They say life’s about choices
In the face of defeat I declined
That’s how you leave a legacy behind
Hold me when I’m down
Bury my soul underneath the ground
Shining like a chandelier
Hold me when I’m down
Bury my soul underneath the ground

Damn  fo’ real
This was never the plan
It was never intended for her to end up the defendant
And I guess it just happened by chance
Damn  and you hope
You hopin’ that a miracle happens
You prayed that the Judge doesn't bang that gavel
Just so you can go back and avoid a disaster
And you could still be holding her hand

I was doing fine  once upon a time
Then my brain left and it didn't say bye
Don't look at me wrong  I'm out of my mind
Like Nostradamus and da Vinci combined
So paranoid of espionage
I'm watching my doors and checking my blinds
My brain's on vacation  they telling me
And I'm bi-polar to the severity
And I need medication  apparently
And some Electroconvulsive therapy
I am a rebel  but yes  I'm so militant
Still  I'm illegible for disabilities
I am psychotic but there is no remedy
This is not figurative  this is literally
If these niggas go dumb  I go to the mental facility
See  man  I'm so out there  I slap fives with ET
I don't need a feature
They don't want me to eat à la carte when I'm on this beat

Leave him in the dust  all he see is my Adidas

Never turning back  how you think I got here?
And I'm never slowing down  fuck was that  a deer?
If you got a problem  step to the office
Matter fact  never mind  talk to the Kiosk  bi-atch

 the water ain't even bubbling
 this here is not for publishing
 I swear I see them building pyramids brick by brick
 trying to maintain
 running when I hit the ground

 I pray my prayers make it through the cloud

 it's unfortunate that niggas out here robbing for Jordans
 but got enough to get a Glock 40
 even though I understand the story
 so what's the score?
 drinking White man's poison
 that's extortion
 running when I hit the ground

 that means it's always on
 then you can't make no dollars
 this ain't no Mr Rodgers
 running when I hit the ground

 I pray my prayers make it through the cloud
'Cause if life was one big pool  I'd be in the deep end
So I play my role and never ever speak it  like a secret
And all the while you just try to figure me out (What?)
But you can't see past my shades
Past my shades  past my shades
And you can't see past my shades
Past my shades  past my shades
And you can't see past my shades
Past my shades  past my shades
And you can't see past my shades
Past my shades  past my shades
'Cause there's nothing to hide  my soul's in my eyes
And I'm ahead of my time but I cannot rewind
The only thing I fear is the mirror in my bathroom
People look and try to see a disguise
But there is nothing that nobody can't see in light

You know I got two belts  the black and the white one
I begin and I master
I see in my eye glasses
But they saying what I'm seeing through is false like Ross
I can hear him through the wall like Walk
This Way  trying to dissuade my thoughts
I'm a slave to myself and disobeyed my boss
It's all in disarray this parade I walk
They get amazed when they catch a chain I toss
Amidst this array of different ways I talk
And it hangs from your brain if my chain you caught
Like I cough without covering my mouth
I tip the scales like the king of the south
Forgot that I was fat  I lost my way
But now I'm back looking for the shade I sought
And not wonders  I'm Scott Summers
So don't make me take off my stunners
Bobby Ray  you know you got my numbers
And them deer can't see us like hunters
But you can't see past my shades

Always in detention for the lack of my attention
But trying to get a record deal is all I can remember

I still elevated to the level that I’m at

What ever happened to Bobby Ray? He used to be here for us
Then he got famous and left all of his fans in the dust
We never hear from you  you're constantly changing
And your relatives always miss you at family occasions
And your mother misses you too  since all the fortune
You've been too busy recording  now she feels unimportant
And your daddy's been going through it since he lost his mother
The least you could do is call him to show him  you support him
I never thought you would sell out  you're becoming so cocky
I asked you for a picture after your show  you walked right by me
I'm like  Ain't this the dude that said that it ain't about the price tag?
Now on your records all that you do is brag
What happened to Cloud 9 and Generation Lost?
You were my idol  just when I thought I'd give up on everything

What ever happened to B.o.B? He once was my favorite
I swear to God that I had all of his mixtapes on my playlist
He was hood  but so different at the same time
It was like a breath of fresh air  everytime he rhymed
And everybody was on him and the world fell in love
I guess he's stopped giving a fuck for all of his little people
With your shades on  we can't even see you
Is that what happens  when somebody makes it off of rapping?
They taste the fame and change like it's just automatic
Where's the integrity? You're on that other shit
You don't even sound the same  I liked your other shit
But we'll still stand beside you  'cause somewhere deep inside you
There's more than what meets the eye
I swear on the Bible  you were my idol
Just when I thought I'd give up on everything

I watched my whole life change in a couple of years
Who woulda ever thought I woulda caught the world by the ears?
I swear  this shit is so much bigger than I had figured
But if it wasn't meant to be  this wouldn't be my career
It's like  people only see it the way it appears
But they never see the ropes and the pulleys and the gears
In the middle of this rap game on the battle field
All of these shock jock interviews  tryna phone me
You never know who's gonna try to play you and make you look phoney
I live and die for my team  these niggas are more than my homies
We put it all on the line  we gave up all our belongings for this rap shit
'Cause at the end of the day  it ain't just rap shit
I call it making a way for our survival
Just when I thought I gave up on everything

With a feeling that something's missing
Bred in a corn addiction
With a synthetic composition
On the brink of a civil war
Or the forming of one religion?
I wonder what came first
Dinosaurs or Darwinism?
Pledging allegiance to a flag
Since elementary
Writing curses in cursive and casting spells
Stung by the spelling bee
And they says congratulations
You graduated
From slavery
To paid slavery
You actually made it!
Here! Take this gown and cap and wave it
Like a celebration of going to school just to get a job to pay for it
Like a nation that traded it's minerals in exchange for paper payment
I wonder who we'd worship if we weren't captured and traded
Consider this my affidavit
Here to rule yo ass
Prescription drug thug cocaine mule yo ass
Agricultural skills sure would suit yo ass
Whiplash from the kickback of the impact
Push yo shit back
As long as my head is intact
I'll be as political as I want
Because I get taxed
Who's ass is this fat and who has a six pack
Compare his passes to his passes
There's a thousand sports channels
Who's this savage?
And see who calls each other bitch fastest
Haters go out they way to fuck up my day
But I ain't even worried about your bitch asses
They make the sky toxic
Prescribe the antibiotic
You could die off it
What the fuck are you supposed to do?
Morgellons in your kosher food
What the fuck is even kosher food?
Third generation crops won't produce
Be careful who you keep close to you
Then Russia and China would be Triple HHH
And the Illuminati would be Vince Macmahon
Now when the haters are The Undertaker
The crowd doesn't stand a chance
When the international bankers are walking through the stands
Slide yo ass some Xan
You think you a fan but you really just a lamb
Niggas start trends every day but don't never get no pair of Vans
What the fuck is an advance?
Niggas live on colored people time
What the fuck is in advance?
I just want my fucking bandz
I'm a walking talking human conundrum
Like a Muslim going HAM
Looking for the promised land
False stories of Christopher Columbus
Holding Pocahontas' hand
Black History is the shortest month
Native Indians don't get shit but
Man I fucking love it
Democratic or Republic
All of these beliefs and mine's the right one
Trying to process all this info you hide from
Till you wake the fuck up out on the advice son
Culture and religion condition your mind hon'
The smell of freedom is making my eyes run
I don't got all the answersises
What the fuck you think goes on in schools you send your kids to?
That's why only ratchet shit is what these kids is into
A language comprehendable
Friends do what they friends do
People act so fucking hard but really they just gentle
Psychological children
Grownups with issues
Grownups with children
Who grow up with issues
Cancer tissues
I have the cure
I have the remedy
I am the savior
I am not the enemy
Everybody's in debt
But this is a free country!
Why you on the clock
Anything to take they mind off being property
Trying to say it properly
Working on my tact
But I am the anomaly
They know i'm the shit like a elio-colonoscopy
They know i'm the shit by just looking at my discography
They know i've been sent to awake this idiocracy
Turn you into a worker bee
Harvest the honey tree
Mother Earth quakes underneath
No more Amen
No more folding hands goodbye"
