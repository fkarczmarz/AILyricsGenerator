" someone's waiting
I'm still an animal
And I stopped dreaming now
In your eyes I see the eyes of somebody i knew before long long long ago
But I'm still trying to make my mind up
Am I free or am I tied up
2x
Nobody knows it but me when i slip yeah i slip
Then I stopped dreaming now
I'm supposed to fill it up with something
In your eyes I see the eyes of somebody
But I'm still trying to make my mind up
Am I free or am I tied up?
I change shapes just to hide in this place
Nobody knows it but me when I slip
There is a hole and I tried to fill it up with money
But it gets bigger till your horse is always running
In your eyes I see the eyes of somebody
That could be strong
Tell me if I'm wrong
And now I'm pulling your disguise up
Are you free or are you tied up?
I change shapes just to hide in this place
Nobody knows it but me when I slip
Then I stopped dreaming now i supposed to fill
It up with something  something  something

 something
 long ago
 I'm still an animal
 money
 running
 I'm still an animal
 I'm still an animal
 I'm still an animal
I feel it coming on a sense of welling grief
And though they‘re serving samovar  somehow I’d rather be
Up in an airplane above the archipelago
I stuttered in my armour in an airplane above the archipelago
I could see where you grew up  and the murderer in me
Please  the blanket and the sheets
The leaves the gardener rakes are articles of faith
The company believes I’m running derelict around these foreign streets
The colonel knows I want to crack his head for taking me
Up in an airplane above the archipelago
I stuttered in my armour in an airplane above the archipelago
Now I see where you grew up  and the murderer in me
They said there was an ice age forty thousand years ago
Incidents of road rage warring on the streets below
They said there was an ice age forty thousand years ago
Incidents of road rage warring on the streets below
Up in an airplane above the archipelago
I stuttered in my armour in an airplane above the archipelago
Don't want to toy with your survival
Just want to keep you company
And when you're free you can come for me
Don't want to be your planet
Cause the world's not like you plan it
Just want to have you come and play
Just say my name from day to day
I tried and it's never enough
I always tried to hide when I needed your love
I want to be the man in the back of the car
I will let it ride
Your love will carry me (Love-pain)
Your love will carry me (Love-pain)
Your love will carry me (Love-pain)
Your love will carry me (Love-pain)
Don't want to burst your bubble
But the world is toil and trouble
Everybody wants a piece
Of something they don't really need
I don't want to get high
I just want to survive and have fun on the side

Your love will carry me (Love-pain)
Your love will carry me (Love-pain)
I tried and it's never enough
I always tried to hide when I needed your love
I want to be the man in the back of the car
I will let it ride
It’s gone so long now
With our faces at the wind
Would you come over
Forgive my hard ways
And stay up all night
Like the chinatown parades
Say you will
I won’t climb out through the other door
If I ask you to say you will
I can’t be trusted
To wait on hard times
I’d rather run out
And be caught behind the lines
Open corridors light up the paintings
Aww come on over
And keep away the shakes
Say you will
I won’t climb out through the other door
If I ask you to say you will
They gave us their machines
They tried but they won't save us
The locked-up luxuries
You’ll find that you don’t need them at all
The world got swallowed by the place
You're moving to the sound of a train
That carrie Billie Holliday away
And you say that you can't get away
But the night is just enough for both of us
It's all been dressed to be improved
I guess i don't read the news
Here haven't think of disguise
And see the stone blast in your eyes
But don't say I never try
And you say that you can't get away
But the night is just enough for both of us
And you say that you can't get away
But the night is just enough for both of us
 our disgrace
 I see you're back again
 don't bother to explain
 it's all been in my head
 black & blue
 come again
 I see you're back again
 don't bother to explain
 it's all been in my head
 black & blue
 our disgrace
 I see you're back again

 I see you're back again
 don't bother to explain

 we've had no time to paint the place
 I see you're back again
 don't bother to explain
 it's all been in my head
 I found my innocence again
 I see you're back again
 don't bother to explain
 it's all been in my head
 I see you're back again
 don't bother to explain
 it's all been in my head
Something to put your jewelry in
But it struck me as the property of the childless
It was cold out and warm in
The edges were sharp
The edges were sharp
Take me down the hillside
Show me where they used to play
Take me down the hillside
Show me where they used to play
Thought he could survive in the black tin box
Thought you could survive in the black tin box
I mailed you a Dutch postcard
Where I tried to be comforting
Playing superman

Running through the orange light of the after-day
Thought he could survive in the black tin box
Saturdays are all the same
Sympathy is overrated
Like a snapshot when you've lost the game
Now it's all a funeral
I've become a serial killer of us all
Now it's all a funeral
I've become a serial killer of us all
It's over
At your own burial
Don't forget to cry at your own burial
Thinking of my 81st birthday
Every day this body goes to waste
Remembering how I would raise an army
When we went back to your place
Now it's all a funeral
I've become a serial killer of us all

My name is rosy and my hangs on you
Catman  umm  catman
So keep your high-heel boots and your knee-high mind
Come up to my pad and see my work
Go for a meal and hear my joke
Or get in a bag and take a poke
But don't be too clever or we'll kick your fillies in
Look out  look out
The rosies are coming to town
Look out  catman  look out  catman
The rosies are flashing along
Catman  we feel a fool today
I say  catman  umm  catman  umm
My name is rosy and my wangs on you
Catman  umm  catman
So leave your well polished tail and your uptight suit
Show us some funnies that are better than daddies
Or bake us some cakes that are better than mommies
Or give us your witties that are trapped in your willies
But don't be too clever or we'll scratch your goodies out
Watch out  watch out
The rosies are riding the town
Watch out  catman  watch out  catman
The rosies are slashing about

We'll squeeze your lemon and give you a mug
We'll cut your daisies and give you a slug
And don't be too clever or we'll blow your sillies off
Keep out  keep out
The rosies are passing the town
Keep out  catman  keep out  catman
The rosies are bashing around
Coochy coochy coo  bunny bunny boo  patti patti poo
Catman! catman! where are you?
Don't be a prune  catman  give us all you've got
Your blueberry eyes and your evergreen lies
Cause after all  by this fall you might grow too old
And you can't ask your mommy to use an old fruity in her pie
Patter cake  patter cake  baker's man
Bake me a cake as slow as you can
Pat it  and prick it  and mark it with 'o'
And put it in the oven for me and my mo
Batter cake  batter cake  baker's girl
Fake me a cake as fast as you curl
Bat it  and whip it  and mark it with blood
And throw it in the oven with trickles and mud
Wetter cake  wetter cake  baker's boy
Make me a cake that's sweet as your toy
Wet it  and slick it  and mark it with 'p'
And leave it in the oven for lizzie and me

 no  my face
 you want it both ways
 I'm trading  gold diamonds for stars
 showing me who you are
 woah  oh
 take your breath away
 you still love my taste
 I keep my sanity
 you want it both ways
 I'm trading  gold diamonds for stars
 showing me who you are
 woah  oh
 fly away
 fly away
 fly away
 I could feel the waves from you and I
I wanna rewrite my heart and let the future in
I wanna open it up and let somebody in
Can you free me from the logic that I knew?
I'll believe it even if it is not true
Am I falling asleep on my feet again?
I call out - is anybody listening?
And it's like I'm diving into emptiness
But at least there is something beating in my chest
Can you free me from the logic that I knew?

The Light From The Primitive Sun
You Know I Really Wanted Her
Society Thinks So Highly Of
This Hotel I Vomited On
Before I Lost The Sight Of Her
Now The Pharaoh Is Woken
She Has Already Spoken
Anyway
There's No Reason To Get Hurt
You Don't Need To Sell Your Shirt

You Finally Found Your Place
You Know It Always Works

To dream of home
I watch it and I can’t help but play favourites:
I don’t remember how I got down
I only know there’s been some kind of harm done
I don’t remember how I got down
She lingers like a chain
It's more than grave but not too serious
I am so wide awake
The wind is moving blossoms through the door
It's more than I can take
But half as much as what it was before
Having thoughts of the morning
In the shade I
In the shade I
In the shade I lie
In the shade of
In the shade of
An eternal wall
When I'm gone let the radio blare
When we fuck we leave the lights on
I'm watching your video play
I know from the minute you stare
To come and my radios blare
That when I'm home you can believe me
I'll be there for you
And there's no other way to say it

I wanna last
And take the sun from all the half-awake
Cause you aren't here
You know that you aren't here
So many times
We were the ones to right and settle wars
Cause when you don't
You're signing up to take it on all fours
And you aren't here
I know that you aren't here..
So many times
We were the ones to reach the heart of wars
Cause if you don't
They tie you up and pull you into fours
And you aren't here
You know that you aren't here..
A garden

And no labels to put on
To this thing we keep
And dip into when we need
And I don't have the right
To ask where you go at night
But the waves hit my head
To think someone's in your bed

Papers and little useless things
Slide down along the pavement away from me
Taking my tea in silence
Telling strange jokes to myself
God help this divorce

We were like family

Taking my tea in silence
Telling strange jokes to myself

Wild hungry arms
You give me all the love I need
And I have no trips about it
And these played-out faces around me
Want you to know where they go
But they ain't got nothing on you
To say I'd open your mouth for me
I've got you locked down like police
Please don't knock over my heart
Cause my heart is full of you
I don't worry 'bout tomorrow
Cause my heart is full of you
Her mama says that she should kick it with a better ninja
Her daddy hates on Run The Jewels and don't like Michael Render

I'll stay faithful from November on to next December

I've been waiting all night just to see her
I've been trying to get myself off of the floor now
And it's only me to blame
Cause I pushed the truth away
And pretended to be happy
I feel the weight
I feel the weight
I feel the weight of a love that's gone away
I feel the weight
I've been wondering what is freedom
Is it checking out from all you're feeling?
Is it feeling OK cause you're not running
From the boring person that you're becoming?

Garden in a blaze
Feel the summer's rays
Outside the walls
Still I wait
For your call
I was a sailor and the sail got caught in dark seas
I sank beneath the waves and was buried in my grave
I cast away my hope forevermore
I was a sailor in the service of the dark moon
And I promised you that one day I would come clean
And we'll walk around the sun forevermore
Where's your gaze?
Light through the haze
Lost in the maze
Who knows?

But we won't back down from anything in search of a remedy
No we won't back down from anything in search of a remedy
Father put his foot down on my games forever
So in the marketplace I stay calm and clever

 take your time
 I know that it's hard and your eyes are full of dark
 take your time
 yeah

I see you fake but you can't take the ticking
Unknown through most the world
Why do you stay up all night
Cause you heard its the way to be?
I can stay or leave
I'm ready now
As long as you're willing
7 nights up all night
7 nights you feel alright
Cause 7 nights is a good time
Until the stars are gone
I don't wanna chase the fame
And have everybody know my name
But just one girl won't forget me
It's always been a long shot
I said it's always been a long shot
There's always one more situation to covet
Do you really love it?
Do you really love it?
I'm in the graveyard if looks could kill

You’re at Charles de Gaulle with dumbbells in your baggage
Dumbbells in your baggage
Miles Standish was not a hero
He just talked fast when it fell below zero
Fell below zero
Pay anything not to be pressed for survival
Don’t press me for survival
Sell me no
Starry world
Sell me no
Starry world
But I tried
No starry world
You’ll never know how I tried
I tried
No starry world
And the parking meter can tell you something deep
In your sleep
They said that it’s all coming and everything will get cleaner and brighter
And take my breath away
But that won't make me change the way i see the world
Over and over
Over and over
Our fate's the same so let me hold on to you girl
Over and over
Over and over
These are the days when the ones who do despise you will try to take
Shits on you 9-to-5 to survive
But that won't make me change the way I see the world
Over and over
Over and over
Our fate's the same so let me hold on to you girl
Over and over
For call the space between the crave  that sound of road to me too

For out to London  maintain crowd around here for the weekend We had to take our clothes before the the sun was gone completely

I was choked by the jailor
And fucked the gorilla
I ran through the country ahead of my time
I escaped through a keyhole before they erased me
I married the beetle and learned to be graceful
It's why all this warfare pours out of my eyes
Now I see just what you mean
It hurts too much to breathe
All alone in this plastic jungle
Sometimes I wanna get slain
I wanna get slain
I wanna get slain

Now I notice that I drink too much
And the turning of the universe oh
Spent the morning as a pretender
Will this be the age of surrender
The falling dark it lines
The walls let ours combine
I didn’t wanna wake up
But then I felt your touch
Now I notice that I drink too much
And the turning of the universe oh
And the children lie in their places
I can see the lines in their faces
The falling dark it lines
The walls let ours combine
I didn’t wanna wake up
But then I felt your touch
Now I notice that I drink too much
And my mind was on a ledge
Saying who's gonna help you now
Without sun we pull what feeds us
From the heat that's in between us
How can we expect to build a boat
Seagulls running everything
It's all the opposite I think
The ladder runs side to side
Enough to make you want a drink
But there's no place to hide
Watching shadows within shadows
They hide their dark selfs from the sun
And her voice is just a memory
You're not fooling anyone
Met a man barside
With eclipses for eyes
And you tell yourself you won't let them touch
Did I say too much? Did I say enough?
Circle round the room still
Have fun breaking my will
Someone else on your skin
And it's all my fault for not getting off
SIIIIIIIILLLLLLLLVVVVVVVVIIIIIIIIAAAAAAAA
SIIIIIIIILLLLLLLLVVVVVVVVIIIIIIIIAAAAAAAA
Reach the city steps tonight
Following the power lines

Underneath the black night
And your voice cries out for the coup de grâce

The sun was spilling kerosene
But I was feeling wide awake
Girl you can be so obscene
When you sang a lullaby
A missionary called your name
You disappeared and hopped a flight
For the Serengeti plain
Tell everyone you know
Open up the door
Tell everyone you know
Open up the door
When your love has gone
You carry on
This is her song
This is a song for no one
This is a song for no one
I think I own a photograph
That shows her in the freezing rain
With the Italians on the bank
They know how to entertain
A string of pearls behind your head
A music box to catch your tears
Now call your mother in L.A
She hasn't heard your voice in years

You can jump a ride
But don't ask why
And don't close your eye
This is a song for no one
This is a song for no one
Everybody wants to turn up  give it to them
You put a lasso on the scene
Feeds and pages  feeds and pages
The heart of me
Because I can't believe
That anything's cool anymore
I want to touch you  I want you to touch me
I can't stop this hurtful shit from happening
And this is not our way
The fear of God into
The heart of me
Because I can't believe
That anything's cool anymore

I remember standing in a cathedral
Somewhere in northern Europe  I think it was Paradiso
The space around my head was ringing
I felt like I finally touched this world
I felt as if I finally understood
That we had to do something of our own now
Even if I didn't know it at the time
I couldn't take it anymore
The heart of me
Because I can't believe
To the heart of me
Because I can't believe
The lights in my head flip off and on
Down below  down below
The sweat on my hands is not my own
The ring shoots through me
Like the principal's here
And it's hidden over there
Right behind the chair
I tried to beat the devil too many times
I'm in love and she is tragic magic
I wanna listen to my evil eye
And I put her down but she won't have it
Which way to go
Before it tramples on me
But the rabbit jumps back in his hole
And I forget that I am just like everybody else
Everybody else
Hear me out  hear me out
Your apron of blades  your fears and doubts
Hear me out  hear me out
Your sweet little stain just won't wash out
The ring shoots through me
Like the principal's here
Honey  where's your child?

It's spreading and I wanna show you something

Made my heart beat faster
The rat-tat to remind me
That there was something behind me
You can hear them
You can hear them banging on the tin
But my love won't be saved
We'll all be staring at the wave
They told me I wasn't anything
Before the bombs started falling
I was a fee for the master
I was a walking disaster
You can hear them
You can hear them banging on the tin
But my love won't be saved

She had circles like Romany Marie
She would start the day with the Novocaine  believe me
By the end of the day
There were coming shocks from the palace clocks  believe me
There was nothing we could do or say
We were holding hands in the garbage cans  believe me
You can wish but this order is thinner than the glaze on a vase
While the innkeep follows us the road gives in to haze
And the smell of water comes
You can wish but this order is thinner than the glaze on a vase
La la la la  la la la la
You’ll never win the game
When you wander off keep your ballots soft  believe me
Believe me
La la la la  la la la la
You can wish but this order is thinner than the glaze on a vase
La la la la  la la la la"
