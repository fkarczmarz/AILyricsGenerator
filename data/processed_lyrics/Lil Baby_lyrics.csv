lyrics
"My mama been told me don't give no poor performance
And whatever you gon' do  just do it
Never thought 'bout doin' music
I was tryna build my phone up
Contacts full of drug abusers
Ridin' around with that Mexican  tryna figure out what my cousin doin'
Prison with the 'migos  found out they was sellin' bricks
Wish I would've knew that shit  I would've been lit
I be at James Harden house  I'm all in Houston in the mix
I'm talkin' 'bout spare time in New York  I buy floor seats to watch the Knicks
And I don't even know no players
I just wan' show off my new drip and put my chains in layers
I might just stand up and go crazy  someone make the layup
And we ain't squashin' shit for free  you niggas gotta pay us
You niggas better pay up  yeah
Know he might not beat it  I told the lawyer go for a lighter sentence
I don't want know no problems with y'all niggas  y'all got women tendencies
Givin' out my respect  get respect in every city
Niggas know I came up  but I came back through the slums with Diddy
Fucked around and got plugged in  I'm buyin' that red Richard Mille
Stay out my lil' brother business  just know that they gettin' millions

What kinda watch you wanted?
I should've knew you was gon' rat the day you told me
A hundred racks in all dubs  it ain't no foldin' me
I ain't no puppet  I ain't with nobody controllin' me
I go LeBron when it's crunch time  it ain't no holdin' me
I told lil' shawty just let bygones be bygones
Tell the feds get off my dick  I don't gotta buy guns
They got the right one  yeah
Press the button right there to let the doors in
To let the doors in
I'm goin' all in
She callin' more friends
Fed shit
DMac got me too bangin'
All four of my pockets full now
I can't be totin' no handguns (Glock)
Unless that bitch come with a thirty (With a thirty)
I can't be fuckin' these dog hoes
Unless that bitch come with a buddy (With a friend)
I can't be drivin' no regular cars (Skrt)
That bitch gotta come with a button (A button)
I was broke like a while back
Now I'm up all of a sudden
I just came home with nothin' (Woo)
Now I'm up all of a sudden (Hey)

I'm in the booth with a money bag

Runnin' through hoes like a running back

Unless that bitch come with a thirty
I can't be fuckin' these dog hoes
Unless that bitch come with a buddy
I can't be drivin' no regular cars
That bitch gotta come with a button
I was broke like a while back
Now I'm up all of a sudden
If I said fuck you I meant that
And if you want smoke you can get that
I just want proof of the backend
Any time I fuck her I hit from the back end
I'm pullin' her hair while I dig in her
I'm in the trap with the drugs on me
Fly as fuck like a dove on me
Diamonds wet like a tub on me
Left the spot with a dub on me
I can't be totin' no handguns
Unless that bitch come with a thirty
I can't be fuckin' these dog hoes
Unless that bitch come with a buddy
I can't be drivin' no regular cars
That bitch gotta come with a button
I was broke like a while back
Now I'm up all of a sudden
I just came home with nothin'
Now I'm up all of a sudden
Now I'm up all of the sudden
I just came home with nothin'
Now I'm up all of a sudden
Still poppin' Percocet
Drankin' lean too
Shit I gotta deal with
Caught a few cases  I been on the road but overall a nigga still free
I done been robbed I know how it feel  a nigga gon' have to come kill me
I been through it all  I came this far how a nigga not gon' feel me
Ain't no facade  no cap in my raps everything that I say is the real me
I give all my problems to God
Let him handle all my enemies
I get on my knees and beg him please I just hoping that he hearin' me
I came too far to stop now  I can't let a nigga get ahead of me
I came too far to stop now  I can't let a nigga get the best of me
Remember that shoot out we had that time we thought a kid died
Only thing I know when we pulled up  everybody hopped out firin'
I remember on the way back  everybody in the car quiet
I'm just knowing everybody thinkin' we just pulled a homicide  homicide
See me on the news at the spot
Tryna see who they say got shot
I'm the first one stood up  told my brothers y'all all I got
Know if somebody seen us they gon' talk
Phone ringin' I thought it was a thottie
Thinkin' damn  we just caught a body
Hopin' everybody keep it solid
Fuck the nigga  I'm thinkin' bout the kid
The nigga shouldn't did what he did
I'm just glad a nigga still here for all the stupid shit that we did
Gotta be here for my kid  gotta watch my son get big
Everything I say is no lie  I'm just glad the kid didn't die

All I see is young niggas on Instagram with them sticks
I never post no gun  but when it's smoke I bet I send a blitz
That bullshit that you on thinkin' cool get you a 100 years
I bet yo partner fuck yo bitch  I bet you don't hear nothin' from the clique
I ain't gon' tell you no lie  this shit'll make a grown man cry
Folks give yo ass that time  you'll never see the outside
All you do is think and wonder why
Kiss the good life goodbye
Now you gotta fight to survive  ain't no guns all you got is knives
Hear a nigga sharpen 'em at night
Young niggas gone on the ice
Grown men fucking grown men they'll never tell you that part
Buy a phone you gotta have a spot
Everyday a nigga get knocked
Search team turn to the narcs  man this shit can really get hard
Caught a few cases  I been on the road but overall a nigga still free
I done been robbed I know how it feel  a nigga gon' have to come kill me
I been through it all  I came this far how a nigga not gon' feel me

Stop at a lil' party

I can't fuck with shawty 'cause she got a big mouth

'Cause I'm getting cash
That ain't my place
Bought a new Wraith
She in my face
I want her head
I want her legs
I want a redhead
I want her head
I want her neck
I want her legs
You don't even beg
We can fuck on the floor
We can fuck in the shower
Leave your friends at the door
Tell 'em give you a hour
And they know I'ma GOAT
I got paper and power
Man  these niggas some hoes
Everything they say sour
I bought a Bentley and blew out her brain
Since I got money and people done changed
I'm keepin' my .40  I'm up on my aim
Jump out of line  I bust at your brain
Shoebox money  it ain't nothin' to me
I could make a hunnid in my sleep
These niggas cappin'  that's all they see
They just wanna be like me
Takin' this swag and then give it back
I didn't get mad  I went and got more
They just wanna be like him
I don't wanna be like them
Used to wanna be like him
'Til I stayed down and ran up an M
Baby ballin'  they should put it on film
Shootin' for bricks  I don't aim for the rim
Fuck the gym  I don't work out
Take a sip of the lean  wash the Perc down
These niggas mad 'cause I won't lose
I gotta win  I just began
No fake love  no fake friends
Just 30 in this FN

We started off as close friends (Close friends)
Somehow you turned into my girlfriend (My girlfriend)

I even went and bought her diamond rings  matching earrings
Everything was so cool (So cool)
Lately baby been actin' so rude (Been so rude)
I don't know what somebody told you (What they told you)
But I ain't gon' lie  I miss the old you
I know you remember how I would hold you
Still remember how I approached you
I think I loved you 'fore I knew you
Know we be fuckin' 'fore I screwed you
Made a promise I won't use you
Play my cards right  I won't lose you
Got 'em tuned in like I'm YouTube
Got somethin' on me like it's voodoo
I'll go nuts for you  go cuckoo  lose my cool and all

Keep our business to ourselves

I know I shouldn't've never left
But everything I did for us
And us  I'm speakin' on my kids
Thinkin' 'bout this shit I did
Like how the hell I get myself involved in this bullshit?
Married to the game  I can't make you my fiancée
Bad young boss bitch  treat her like Beyoncé
But damn what them broads say  I fucked them all the first day
And that's why you trippin' anyway  like when I fuck 'em I don't pay
Even if we never speak again
I'll make sure you're ridin' in the latest Benz
Keep your business all apart if you can stay out of mine
Bought a brand new Audemars  but I done ran out of time

(Tay Keith  fuck these niggas up)
I paid some extra before we even come out
And don't even wear it to show I ain't playin'
I hit the bitch and I gave her some racks
And I pull up my pants  she know I ain't stayin'
Go on a store run and get rubber bands
I done got rich  I done put on my mans
Choppers in traffic  that's just how I'm livin'
They say that I'm trippin'  they wouldn't understand
She take a trip  she come back with a tan
I take a trip  I come back with them bands
When I was dealin'  it really was killin' 'em
Had 'em competin'  tryna see what I'm payin'
She throw a hoodie on soon as we land
She don't like pics  I got too many fans
I'm runnin' shit  I can do what I want
And it's really a limit  you do what you can
I found the booth and I put that shit up
'Fore I run out of cash  they gonna run out of land
I fell in love with this bitch 'cause her head was amazing
I swear I don't even know her name
I'm 'bout to takeoff  I gave 'em a chance
They gave me ten M&M's on advance
Thought I'd be trappin' forever  but God came and blessed me
I guess it was part of the plan
How he on fire  but he cool as a fan?
Can't get at you  we gon' get at your man
They can relate to me 'cause I be poppin' it
Put in they face  let 'em see what I'm sayin'
I'm rockin' shows like I play with a band
Free all the bros  know I would if I can
If I don't mean it  I swear I ain't sayin' it

They say I went commercial  I ain't know it
They want me catch a murder  I ain't goin' back
Play myself and my position  who doin' that?
We got FN with extensions  we throwin' that
Her ass got my full attention  she throwin' that
Niggas talkin' way too much  I ain't goin' back
And forth with niggas 'cause these niggas be holdin' racks
I turned eight million right until I'm a quarterback
Spent a million like I'm tryna bring Kobe back (24  woo)
They say the drop hot and it's ready
Might stretch it out  but it ain't fetti (Yes)
Say my dawg doin' time
But I know he ain't gonna snitch 'cause it's still some shit he didn't tell me
My dawg stabbed his celly
He told me the whole story over the celly (Brr  hello?)
Went up on my price  in my pocket like Kelly
My head gettin' heavy
And you know I still got Balmains on my ass (Woo)
No  I can't do no Amiris
Diamonds cold as December  my vibe Sagittarius
Dior store can't keep up with me
I'm spendin' thousands like money is nothin' to me
I'm never comin' back  them people under me
Lotta bands on the table
They say I went commercial  I ain't know it
They want me catch a murder  I ain't goin' back
Play myself and my position  who doin' that?
I can switch up and come back another way
If the vibe ain't right  come back another day
Biggest dripper  I start up a tidal wave
Remix weed  we put it in a microwave
Batch for twenty-three like I know Michael J
He can say what he want  but he gotta pay
Used to hide all the guns where my mama stay
Sell my drugs 'round the corner
I pay all these bills  I'm a grownup
My cars a lil' different  I own 'em
I ain't with no leasin'  my bitch tellin' me I need credit
It's loud and clear if I said it
I come from the gutter  I spent me a hundred on Chevys
You can take me out the hood  but you can't take the hood out of me
Know the hood proud of me
I Givenchyed my tee  went and upgrade my teeth
Hold up  who got Backwoods? I need roll up
Dior store can't keep up with me
I'm spendin' thousands like money is nothin' to me
I'm never comin' back  them people under me
Lotta bands on the table
They say I went commercial  I ain't know it
They want me catch a murder  I ain't goin' back
I can't fuck with shawty  know she’ll tell
Slim shit  look like Draya Michele
I been goin' crazy  givin' ’em hell
She ain't tryna go with me  I'ma pay her
Connect the dots then I plug up the scale
If we get caught  they gon' give me the chair
Fuck the law  make 'em earn what they pay 'em
Ain't no back and forth with no bitches  this ain’t tennis
And they braggin' ’bout bitches  I promise we hit 'em
I flooded my wrist  let the bros split a million
At this point I'm heartless I ain't got no feelings
Buy every building in the hood for my children
Like a Drake song  got your vibe feelin’ groovy
With no phone  we can make us a movie
I ain't in my bag  I still got my feet out
If we wanted smoke with y'all  you couldn't be out
Free the bros  buy my shit off the kiosk
I'm at the vibe with the spot  this the creep house

Five percent tint on the whip  you can't see out
Ready to set it off  Queen Latifah

Youngest out the crew  AMG Benz
Stand up like a man  take it on the chin
They got consequences in this life of sin
When you come home  we gon' all win
Go in any club and make it thunderstorm  this shit reckless
He gon' knock you off with his Rollie on
Drive the Rolls Royce like a hotbox  really came from nothin'
Only ride with my security because I can't be armed
Can't get caught with another gun
They gon' know me when I'm gone
They hear my pain inside my songs
It's like a switch  I cut it on
Pills kick in  gettin' in my zone
Do my job  ain't see no wrong
I'm never talkin' on them phones
Feds gon' try to do us wrong
Man  they got my nigga Long
Lately I just been alone
Nobody know what's goin on
Just glad I made it off the road
Granddaddy showed me life is a gamble
Ever since I been on them dice
They gon' suck it up like a bowl of rice
I'ma give it to them niggas every time
I can't fuck with shawty  know she'll tell
Slim shit  look like Draya Michele
I been goin' crazy  givin' 'em hell
She ain't tryna go with me  I'ma pay her
Connect the dots then I plug up the scale
If we get caught  they gon' give me the chair
I know they ain't feelin' my pain
I got codeine inside my veins  yeah
I don't know who gassed you niggas up  go get a refill
They offerin' the shooter the death penalty  won't tell on me
I know if I go broke today  them same hoes gon' bail on me
I got them throwin' salt  they steady tryna fuck up my recipe
Sellin' weed in the projects  relapsed on the Hi-Tech
Told the gang that we up next  put 'em on a G5 jet

Tryna dodge the bullshit and tryna make it to the top
If I never sell a record I'ma make it on the block

But I'm tired of being tired of being tired
That part of me done died
I see it  then I don't  act like I'm blind
I'm confident it won't be one of mine
I know emotions come with lies  so I tell the truth all the time
Ain't got no sympathy for no bitch
I admit that I'm rich and I'm lit
Jumpin' up on stages  I get two hundred an occasion
Bro had really fucked the game up  we made niggas shut they trap down
They see how I made it  I'm the reason they won't rap now
See me out in traffic  make a hater pull his hat down
The biggest OG's salute me  a stylist can't even style me
The robbers probably wanna get me  I'm hoppin' out Lamborghinis
The youngins turn in my city  they try me  I get it cracking
Some of this still would happen if I never had started rapping
My people them still steady trapping and they still be getting active

And I done it all in a pair of Diors  yeah
