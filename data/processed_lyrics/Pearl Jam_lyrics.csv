"What you thought was your daddy was nothing but a…
While you were sitting home alone at age thirteen
Your real daddy was dyin'
Sorry you didn't see him  but I'm glad we talked
Hey  oh  oh-oh
While she walks slowly across a young man's room
She said  I'm ready for you
Why  I can't remember anything to this very day
'Cept the look  the look
I  I'm still alive

Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah!
Ooh yeah  ooh ooh
Five  five  against one
I said one  two  three  four  five against one

Torch her from you to me  yeah
Abduct it from the street  and  uh
I'd rather be  I'd rather be with
I'd rather be with an animal  ah
Rah!
Why would you wanna hurt me?! Oh

Tell him  take no more  she practices her speech
As he opens the door  she rolls over
Pretends to sleep as he looks her over
She lies and says she's in love with him
Can't find a better man
She dreams in color  she dreams in red
Can't find a better man
Can't find a better man  can't find a better man
Oh-ooh-ooh
Talkin' to herself  There's no one else who needs to know  she tells herself  oh-oh-oh
Memories back when she was bold and strong
And waiting for the world to come along
Swears she knew him  now she swears he's gone
She lies and says she's in love with him
Can't find a better man
She dreams in color  she dreams in red

Now the air I tasted and breathed has taken a turn
And now my bitter hands chafe beneath the clouds
Of what was everything
All the pictures had all been washed in black
Tattooed everything
How quick the Sun can drop away

Will the light shine through?
Under this broken roof
It's only rain that I feel
I've been wishin' out the days
I have been plannin' out
All that I'd say to you
Since you slipped away
Know that I still remain true
I've been wishin' out the days
I wouldn't have lost you another way
From wherever you are
The real possibility that I may meet you in my dreams
I go to sleep

If I don't fall apart
Will my memories stay clear?
So you had to go
And I had to remain here
But the strangest thing today
So far away and yet you feel so close
And I'm not gonna question it any other way
There must be an open door for you
Is the real possibility I may meet you in my dream
Sometimes you're there and you're talkin' back to me
And it's okay
Are you stuck in the middle?
A spectral invisible ghost
I'm here juxtaposed
Like images of angels in the snow
Our courage melts away  it comes then goes
Where you been? Cannot find
A glimpse of my friend
Don't know where or when one of us left
The other behind
Divisions came and troubles multiplied
Incisions made by scalpel blades of time
Comes then goes
Comes then goes
Can I say  how ya been?
I can guess and conjecture
My altered perceptions unclear
Please interfere
Sadness comes with it a sea of tears
Would some love be best had it not appeared?
Is this you? Here I stand
Intense recollections of pain  self-neglecting again
Like you  I keep it in
Thought you found a game where you could win
Yeah  it's all vivisection in the end

High or low  try again
She fell off the altar
A vision you caught her but then
A woodcut in red
I wish it was not you that she had led
Selfish navigation with no end
Where'd you sleep? Can I find
A deeper connection
In the face of rejection I'm trying
I'm trying
Evidence in the echoes of your mind
Leads me to believe we missed the signs
Can I try one last time?
Could all use a savior from human behavior sometimes
And the kids are alright
The Queen of Collections took your time
Sadness comes 'cause some of it was mine
Comes then goes
Comes then goes
Comes then goes
 and I'm a mess
 but I can't walk
 and I must refuse your test
 and I will resist
 let I be wed
 yeah
 not my picture
 but I guess I…
What love is to our devotion
Imperceptibly big
Big as the ocean
And equally hard to control
So save your predictions
And burn your assumptions
Love is friction
Ripe for comfort
Endless equations
And tugging persuasions
Doors open up
To interpretation
Expecting perfection leaves a lot to endure
When the past is the present and the future's no more
When every tomorrow is the same as before
The looser things get
The tighter you become
The looser things get
Tighter
Not one man
Can be greater than the sum
That's not a negative thought
Coulda held me up rather than tearing me down
Drown in the river

Fall away their circumstance

In all of this dark matter
Take the breath from our chest  break the thoughts in our mind
We're losin' time  dark matter
Denounce the demigods
King diamond to discard
Deploy the dialogue
Your word against the law
It's strange these days
When everybody else pays for someone else's mistake
This blame takes shape
Still everybody else pays for someone else's mistake
Erodin' away  we're pullin' apart

And to this day  she's glided on
Always home but so far away  like a word misplaced

A bad time  nothin' could save him
Alone in a corridor  waitin'  locked out
He got up out of there  ran for hundreds of miles
He made it to the ocean  had a smoke in a tree
The wind rose up  set him down on his knee
A wave came crashin' like a fist to the jaw
Delivered him wings  Hey  look at me now
Arms wide open with the sea as his floor
Oh  power  oh
He's flyin'  whole
High  wide  oh
He floated back down 'cause he wanted to share
His key to the locks on the chains he saw everywhere
But first he was stripped  and then he was stabbed
And he still gives his love  he just gives it away
The love he receives is the love that is saved
And sometimes is seen a strange spot in the sky
A human being that was given to fly

Know a man  his face seemed pulled and tense
Like he's ridin' on a motorbike in the strongest winds
So I approach with tact  suggest that he should relax
But he's always movin' much too fast
Said he'll see me on the flip side
On this trip he's taking for a ride
He's been takin' too much on
There he goes with his perfectly unkempt clothes
There he goes
He's yet to come back  but I've seen his picture

Does it inspire?
Leanin' out to catch the sun's rays
A lesson to be applied
Are you gettin' something out of this
All-encompassing trip?
You can spend your time alone redigestin' past regrets or
Makes much more sense
To live in the present tense
Have you ideas on how this life ends?
Checked your hands and studied the lines?
Have you the belief that the road ahead
Ascends off into the light?

Lifting rocks to make a wage

I guess it was the beatings made me wise
But I'm not about to give thanks or apologize
I couldn't breathe  holdin' me down
Hand on my face  pushed to the ground
Enmity gaged  united by fear
Forced to endure what I could not forgive
I seem to look away  the wounds in the mirror waved
It wasn't my surface most defiled
Head at your feet  fool to your crown
Fist on my plate  swallowed it down
Enmity gaged  united by fear
Tried to endure what I could not forgive
(Yeah)
Saw things  saw things
Saw things  saw things
Clearer  a-clearer
Once you were in my rear-view mirror
I gather speed from you fuckin' with me
Once and for all  I'm far away
Hard to believe  finally the shades are raised
Hey  yeah

 hands on deck
 got so close before it turned
 they've seen enough
 broke its wings then put it on display
 still alive like a passerby overdosed on gamma rays
 they forged the north and west
 who'll be the last to have a laugh?
 hard to admit
 lost eloquence

Hear the sirens  hear the circus so profound
I hear the sirens more and more in this here town
Let me catch my breath to breathe then reach across the bed
Just to know we're safe  I am a grateful man
The slightest bit of light and I can see you clear
For fear this someday will be over
I pull you close  so much to lose
Knowin' that nothing lasts forever
I didn't care  before you were here
I danced in laughter with the ever after
But all things change  let this remain
Hear the sirens coverin' distance in the night
The sound echoin' closer  will they come for me next time?
To send you in the arms of another man

If I think too much  I can get over-
Whelmed by the grace  by which we
Live our lives with death over our shoulders
Want you to know  that should I go
I always loved you  held you high above too
I studied your face  the fear goes away
It's a fragile thing  this life we lead
If I think too much  I can get over-
Whelmed by the grace  by which we
Live our lives with death over our shoulders
Want you to know  that should I go
I always loved you  held you high above too
I studied your face  the fear goes away
The fear goes away  the fear goes away
The fear goes away
State of love and trust as I busted down the pretext
And I listen for the voice inside my head
Promises are whispered in the age of darkness
And I listen from both sides of a friend

I can hear you singing in the distance
I can see you when I close my eyes
Once you were somewhere and now you're everywhere
I'm feeling selfish and I want what's right
Right now I feel a lack of innocence
I feel not much of anything
And the cause is life or death
I've been hoping that our hope dies last
This life I love is going way too fast
And I'm hoping that I hurt your
Hoping that I hurt your
Hoping that I hurt your fist

Random speakers in my mind
And blocking my precious time
You used to let it go and let it float away
You don't get to speak with twice as much to say
It's all in the delivery
I said the messenger who is now dead
Was all on the periphery
I didn't see him but I heard what he said
Everyone walks and it's no one's fault
Whoever said it's all been said
Gave up on satisfaction

Home is where
The broken heart is
Home is where
Every scar is
Room to tomb and cradle to grave
All the answers will be found
In the mistakes that we have made
One bad ear and one eye blind
It takes a village but don't take mine
Living forwards in a backwards town
I feed 'em drinks just to watch 'em drown
Swallow my pencil and bleed out my pen
Surrender the wish we'll be together again
And I won't give up
I won't give up
Gave up on satisfaction
Pull myself aside on a sleepless night
As the silence gets louder my heart gets pounding
Our freedoms fraught with danger being circumscribed
A life cut short and circumcised
Whoever said it's all been said
Gave up on satisfaction
Whoever said it's all been said
Gave up on satisfaction
Whoever said it's all been said
Gave up on satisfaction
