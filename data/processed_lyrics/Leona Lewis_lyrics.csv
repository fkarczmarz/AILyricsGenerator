lyrics
"Would you believe me? Would you agree?
It's almost that feeling that we've met before
So tell me that you don't think I'm crazy
When I tell you love has come here and now
A moment like this
Some people wait a lifetime for a moment like this
Some people search forever for that one special kiss
Some people wait a lifetime for a moment like this
Can't we make this dream last forever
And I cherish all the love that we shared
A moment like this
Some people wait a lifetime for a moment like this
Some people search forever for that one special kiss
Some people wait a lifetime for a moment like this
You might also like
Could this be the greatest love of all?
I wanna know that you will catch me when I fall
So let me tell you this...
A moment like this
Some people wait a lifetime for a moment like this
Some people search forever for that one special kiss
Some people wait a lifetime for a moment like this
A moment like this
Some people wait a lifetime for a moment like this
Some people search forever for that one special kiss
 whoa (Oh)
 our love grows
Or the barriers I built
My head refused to listen
But my heart knows how I feel
Tried to tell myself it's useless
Let the butterflies just flutter by
Never thought that I'd...
Never thought I'd write another love song
Never thought I'd say these words to you
Never thought I'd write another love song
But I can't keep on fighting with you
Didn't take no for an answer
Why'd you let me torture you?
When I made you keep your hands off
Stick around and follow the rules
Gladiator with a sweetness
Holding heaven in your arms
Won the battle for my heart

Never thought I'd say these words to you
Never thought I'd write another love song

 I didn't need the pain
 found somethin' true
 yeah
 I'm in love with you
 but they don't know the truth
 keep bleeding love

 but they talk so loud
 try to fill me with doubt
 I see your face
 maybe
 I'm in love with you
 but they don't know the truth
 keep bleeding love

 mmh
 I'm in love with you
 but they don't know the truth
 you cut me open and I

 keep bleeding love (You)
 keep bleeding love
 you cut me open and I
 keep bleeding love (You)
 keep bleeding love
 you cut me open and I
 keep bleeding love
What do I need it for?
You can take away all these words
There's no meaning anymore
You can take away everything
Leave me lying on the floor
I wanna run away from love
This time I have had enough
Everytime I feel your touch
I'm broken
Shattered all the pieces apart
Never thought I'd fall so hard
I'm putting back together my heart
It's broken
You can take these photographs
Watch them fade away
You can throw away all these letters
I don't care about what they say
You might also like
I wanna run away from love
This time I have had enough
Everytime I feel your touch
I'm broken
Shattered all the pieces apart
Never thought I'd fall so hard
I'm putting back together my heart
I'm broken
I know it's gonna take some time
To finally realize
I got nothing left inside
Nothing to hide
Inside
Save me
I wanna run away from love
This time I have had enough
Everytime I feel your touch
I'm broken
Shattered all the pieces apart
Never thought I'd fall so hard
I'm putting back together my heart
Afraid of losing
It's like I'm not in control
I'm watching myself fall down
Thinking you won't be around
You know you got my heart unlocked
And even if I want to run
I can't go
I can't breathe
And I can't breathe
And I can't breathe
And I can't breathe
Without you near me
And I can't breathe
And I can't breathe
And I can't breathe
And I can't breathe
Without you near me
And I can't breathe

Maybe I make believe
You're not different
But you got me in love
Don't wanna be alone again
I cannot function without you here
My indecisions and all my fears
Get higher higher day by day
Higher higher
But I can't go
Go
I get weak
Without you I can't breathe
And I can't breathe
And I can't breathe
And I can't breathe
Without you near me
And I can't breathe
And I can't breathe
And I can't breathe
And I can't breathe
Without you near me
And I can't breathe
I'm lost in your warmth
That I just can't breathe
Just can't breathe
And I can't breathe
And I can't breathe
And I can't breathe
Without you near me
And I can't breathe
And I can't breathe
And I can't breathe
And I can't breathe
Without you near me
And I can't breathe
 I
 I'm not traveling alone
 and
 don't wanna fall
 but it's obvious you're a survivor
And I feel it in my heartbeat
Oh you can’t put out these flames
You can’t keep me down in my seat
I got fire under my feet
And I feel it in my heartbeat
Oh go get out of the blaze
If you can’t take the heat
Fire (woah oh oh woah)
(Woah oh woah oh)
(Woah oh woah oh ooohhhh)
I tripped and I stumbled
Watched my world crumble
Sometimes you eat dirt
You live and you learn
Thrown in with the lions
The tigers and titans
Afraid to get hurt
But now I’m making them purr
I got fire under my feet
And I feel it in my heartbeat
Oh you can’t put out these flames
You can’t keep me down in my seat
I got fire under my feet
And I feel it in my heartbeat
Oh go get out of the blaze
If you can’t take the heat

Was drowning in quicksand
Nobody grabbed my hand
Thought it buried me
Instead I'm set free
Moving onto bigger things
I begin to spred my wings
No longer in chains
I’m dancing over these flames
I got fire under my feet
And I feel it in my heartbeat
Oh you can’t put out these flames
You can’t keep me down in my seat
I got fire under my feet
And I feel it in my heartbeat
Oh go get out of the blaze
If you can’t take the heat
Fire (woah oh oh woah)

This may not be
Not be perfect
But I’m happy
And I’ve earned it
Every tear shed
Will be worth it
I got no regrets cause I got
I got fire under my feet
And I feel it in my heartbeat
Oh you can’t put out these flames
You can’t keep me down in my seat
I got fire under my feet
And I feel it in my heartbeat

And helped me understand where I'm going
You walked with me when I was all alone
With so much unknown along the way
Then I heard you say
I promise you  I'm always there
When your heart is filled with sorrow and despair
I'll carry you when you need a friend
You'll find my footprints in the sand
I see my life flash across the sky
So many times have I been so afraid
And just when I… I thought I'd lost my way
You gave me strength to carry on
That's when I heard you say
I promise you  I'm always there
When your heart is filled with sorrow and despair
And I'll carry you when you need a friend
You'll find my footprints in the sand

You'll find my footprints in the sand

When your heart is full of sadness and despair (And despair)
I'll carry you when you need a friend

There's a first time for everything
It's definitely one of them nights (Nights)
I knew when I looked in his eyes (Eyes)
I never wanted to lie (Lie)
I knew that my baby would cry
If he knew what we were doin'
But if his love don't pass the test (The test)

Hope he understands
But I gotta take a chance tonight
And I can't wait no more
Sittin' all alone

Sittin' all alone (Alone)
I can't wait no more
But I gotta take a chance tonight
And I can't wait no more
Shattered on the sidewalk
Tragic  broken like a China doll
Burning like a gunshot
My heart was beating  and so was yours
We threw each other down on the floor
My heart is breaking  it's made of glass
Guess anything that's good never ever lasts
'Cause everything that hurts  you've hurt before
You're about to tear this love apart
And break another glassheart
'Cause every time we touch  touch turning cold
Promise that we'll never fall apart
And I'll love you with my glassheart (Heart)
And I'll love you with my glassheart (Heart)
And I'll love you with my glassheart
Right now  I'm standing in our empty room
Staring out the window
I hear music that we used to make
Boy  play me that crescendo

Oh
Promise that we'll never fall apart (Oh)  fall apart

And I'll love you with my glassheart (Heart)
That you have to choose
What you win or lose
You can't have everything
Don't you take chances
You might feel the pain
Don't you love in vain
'Cause love won't set you free
I could stand by the side
And watch this life pass me by
So unhappy
But safe as could be
So what if it hurts me?
So what if I break down?
So what if this world just throws me off the edge
My feet run out of ground
I gotta find my place
I wanna hear my sound
Don't care about all the pain in front of me
I'm just tryna be happy

Holding on tightly

Pass me by
So what if it hurts me?
So what if I break down?
So what if this world just throws me off the edge?
My feet run out of ground
I gotta find my place
I wanna hear my sound
Don't care about all the pain in front of me
'Cause I'm just tryna be happy
Oh
So many turns that I can't see
Like I'm a stranger on this road
But don't say victim
Don't say anything
So what if it hurts me?
So what if I break down?
So what if this world just throws me off the edge?
My feet run out of ground
I gotta find my place
I wanna hear my sound
Don't care about all the pain in front of me
I just wanna be happy
I just wanna be (Oh)
I just wanna be
These can be lonely days
It's hard to know who's on your side
Most of the time
Who can you really trust?
Who do you really know?
Is there anybody out there
Who can make you feel less alone?
Sometimes you just can't make it on your own
If you need a place where you can run
If you need a shoulder to cry on
When you need some shelter from the rain
When you need a healer for your pain
I will be there time and time again
When you need someone to love you
If you have broken dreams
Just lay them all on me
I'll be the one who understands
So take my hand
If there is emptiness
You know I'll do my best
To fill you up with all the love
That I can show someone

When you need some shelter from the rain
When you need a healer for the pain
I will be there time and time again
When you need someone to love you
Here I am
For you to tell me that everything's a big mistake
This dream was not suppose to break
I'm so sorry now for the pain I caused you
But you don't love me anymore
You don't want me anymore

Why would I be leaving?
I was believing it's you and me against the world
Not saying I was afraid of you
Won't put the blame on you
But I won't change for you
Just when you thought you'd drop me
I gotta drop the news  I'm still existing
I'm still here
I am with or without you
I am breathing without you
I am somebody without you
I am  I am
I am free without you
I am stronger without you
Thought I would never rise again
But I am  I am
First steps that I was making on this new planet
Never done it  found all I wanted

Warm and loving  amazing
I never once regretted it
And now brick by brick  I'm rebuilding it
All of the mistakes that I made
Finally led the way to a better place

When you feel unloved
When you try so hard
And it all falls apart
When a promise breaks
When the colors fade
When the world looks grey
And you can't find your way
I got you ooh
I got you ooh
I got you ooh
Through the darkness
And the heartless
When the rain won't stop
When you feel unloved
When it all falls through
I got you
I will hold your high
I'll be by your side
When it all falls through
I got you
When you lose your faith
When you're out of place
When the water's deep
And it's hard to breathe
When the bottles close
When you've lost control
Hope against all hope
So far from home

A place to crash
I got you
No need to ask
I got you
Just get on the phone
I got you
Come and pick you up if I have to
What's weird about it
Is we're right at the end
And mad about it
Just figured it out in my head
I'm proud to say
I got you
Go ahead and say goodbye
I'll be alright
Go ahead and make me cry
I'll be alright
And when you need a place to run to
For better for worse
I got you

Everyday cleaning up where you live

What you mean to me
And now I know how far you'd go
I know I let you down
But it's not like that now
This time I'll never let you go
I will be all that you want

Look in my eyes
Help me make this make sense
Wondering when you're gonna see this clearer
You don't even realize
That at this very moment
You're talking to yourself in the mirror
It's true
You know what to do
'Cause I'm not a fool
So neither are you
But they finally realized that you and I is all the help you need
So why are we sitting here on the floor? (Listen to me)
We ain't crying no more

And we're far too strong
To let this go on
You know what to do
'Cause I'm not a fool
So neither are you
I know what I'm fighting for
Come back to my senses
I'm ready for something more

Oh
You're lifting me up

I'm staring at tears on the pages
Of letters that I never could write
And I know love isn't painless
But it's worth the risk  it's worth the fight
I'm playing it over and over
I wish that I could turn back time
Why do we say things we can't take back
And why do we miss what we never had?
Both of us fell to the ground
The love was so lost  it couldn't be found
What would it take to forget who's blamed?
I'm tired of crying at the sound of your name
Why don't we turn this around?
Love ain't the enemy
Don't you wanna be
Lost then found?
Lost then found
Lost then found
Love ain't the enemy
We could be lost then found

Empty glasses and tables
Echoes fill these rooms

I swear to make things right
Whatever we've lost I know we can find
Why do we say things we can't take back
And why do we miss what we never had?
Both of us fell to the ground
The love was so lost  it couldn't be found
What would it take to forget who's blamed?
I'm tired of crying at the sound of your name
Why don't we turn this around?
Love ain't the enemy
Don't you wanna be
Lost then found?
The winds are calling up  we can't stop the rain
Wish that you could take it back  but it's too late
It's too late
Why do we say things we can't take back (Why do we say?)
And why do we miss what we never had?
Both of us fell to the ground
The love was so lost  it couldn't be found
What would it take to forget who's blamed?
I'm tired of crying at the sound of your name
Why don't we turn this around?
Love ain't the enemy
Don't you wanna be
Lost then found
Lost then found
Lost then found
Love ain't the enemy
We could be lost then found
The words came pouring out
Can't stop the rain
Wish you could take it back
But it's too late  it's too late
We could be lost then found
So I can finally see your face again
Even though I
Never met you
I still miss you
I can feel you in my dreams
And I hope that
When you wake up
Just maybe you'll remember me
And now I believe that this is fate
I know everything is gonna be okay
Just as long as we have each other
Through the sunshine and through the rain
I know that it'll last forever

I set your letter on the window pane

We'll always be
Ooh
I would lay down next to you
Stay in bed all afternoon
We were birds of a feather
We were always together
And I never will forget
All the little things you said
In that beautiful summer
Used to call me your lovebird
And I've grown
And I started a feeling
That my wings have been broken
And I can't believe that I would ever want to be set free
But I just can't stay
So your lovebird's flying away
Your lovebird's flying away
'Cause my heart's been stuck in a cage
And I'll miss you everyday
'Cause there's nothing left to say

Gotta get back to breathing
And I can't believe that I would ever want to be set free
But I just can't stay
So your lovebird's flying away
Your lovebird's flying away
'Cause my heart's been stuck in a cage
And I'll miss you everyday
'Cause there's nothing left to say
And you'll always be
A part of me
You made me who I am
Open up the gate
'Cause your lovebird's flying away
And I'll miss you everyday Oh
Hey
Tired of sleeping
Get in the shower
And make my bed alone
I put on my make up
Talking to the mirror
Ready for a new day
Without you
And I walk steady on my feet
I talk  my voice obeys me
I go out at night
Sleep without the lights
And I do all of the things I have to
Keeping you off my mind
But when I think I'll be alright
(My hands)
Don't wanna start again

I talk about you now
And go a day without crying
I go out with my friends now
I stay home all alone
And I don't see you everywhere
And I can say your name easily
I laugh a bit louder
Without you
And I see different shades now
But when I think I'll be okay
(My hands)
Don't wanna start again
(My hands)
No they don't wanna understand
(My hands)
They just shake and try to break whatever peace I may find

Sometimes I wake
I see them reaching out for you
Quietly break
Whatever shields I spent so long building up
I cannot fake
They miss holding my baby
My hands
They just shake and try to break whatever peace I may find
(My hands)

My baby's coming home for Christmas
I've been up all night inside my bedroom
He said he'll be with me real soon
So I wait
And I wait
But I've had as much as I can take
'Cause I've got five more nights of sleeping on my own
Four more days until you're coming home
Three more dreams of you and mistletoe
Two more reasons why I love you so
I've got five more nights until you're next to me
Four more days of being lonely
If I can make it to Christmas Eve then it's
One more sleep (One more sleep until it's Christmas)
One more sleep (Can't believe how much I missed us)
One more sleep (One more sleep until it's Christmas)
One more sleep
Now I don't think I can remember
A cold and lonelier December
And I find myself singing at the window
Wondering when you're gonna get back home
So I try
And I try
But there is nothing I can do to pass this time

One more sleep (One more sleep until it's Christmas)
One more sleep
Until we're rocking around the Christmas tree
Until I got you sitting next to me
We got a lot of catching up to do
I just can't take this missing you
Five more nights on my own
Five more nights of sleeping on my own (Yeah) (On my own)
Four more days until you're coming home (Until you're coming home)
If I can make it to Christmas Eve then it's
One more sleep

Unlearn all of the things you taught
Woke up now I can't keep standing still
I got the power
I feel the power
Power
This is where you end and I begin
See the world through my kaleidoscope
I am the one I've been waiting for

In all I've done
And I can barely look at you
But every single time I do
I know we'll make it anywhere
Away from here
Even if you cannot hear my voice
Why you can't raise your voice to say

Makes it so hard not to cry
And as we say our long goodbye
I nearly do

I carry you a million miles
I'll never let you down (No)

Don't be scared

May your smile
Shine on
Don't be scared
Your destiny may keep you warm
'Cause all of the stars have faded away
Just try not to worry
You'll see them someday
Take what you need
And be on your way
And stop crying your heart out
Get up
Come on
Why you scared?
You'll never change what's been and gone

Along with your letters
They will never see the light of day
'Cause I'll never take them out
And there's no turning back
It's for the better
I believed everything you said
And I gave you the best I had
Oh
So take a bow
'Cause you've taken everything else
You played the part
Take a bow
'Cause this scene is coming to an end
I gave you love
All you give me was pretend
So now...
Take a bow
The future's about to change
Take a look around
There's no one in the crowd
I'm throwing away the pain

Only called when I needed help
If I've only thought of myself
Couldn't find the words to say what I felt
If I've ever lied to your face
Shut you out to keep you away
You'd always give and I'd always take
For seeing the best and the worst of me
The angel underneath
Thank you
When I had trouble finding my way
And our hearts get stronger after they break
For seeing the best and the worst of me
The angel underneath

One too many days hoping to hear the phone
One too many days feeling all alone
Maybe it's time for me to move on
The stones from the wreckage to build something new
Sometimes a lie makes you search for the truth
Sometimes the worst brings the best out of you
Sometimes the worst brings the best out of you
All this emptiness is space for me to breathe again
Loneliness is finding my own freedom
Through the shame I taught myself to walk with grace
One day you'll regret those heartless things you said
Sometimes a lie makes you search for the truth
Sometimes the worst brings the best out of you
I lost my way but found myself

But I ain't havin' none of that

Throw them in the fire
Blowing hair in the wind
Let spirit guide me
No limitations
It's a brand new day
It's a new horizon
This is who I am
This is what I want

The essence of me
These mountains are steep

Everyday a little victory
Take them one by one

Putting on my gloves

These mountains are steep
But there's no stopping me

Got nothing to fear
And the moon and the stars
Were the gifts you gave
I felt the earth move in my hands
Like the trembling heart
Of a captive bird
That was there at my command
My love
I felt your heart so close to mine
And I knew our joy
Would fill the Earth
The first time ever I saw your face
Your face

 you can sink 'em in

Now it's armageddon
And I woke up like a fighter
Building up a legion
You were rising like a star
Reigning like a king
While I was waiting in the wings
And I won't wait any longer
If you wonder 'bout the lightning
I'm on the horizon
(Yeah)
Scared that you would miss out
Scared that I would shine without you
But this voice was getting loud
And it just wouldn't give in
Cause I was made to sing

Going in circles
Why won't we let this die?
It doesn't matter all the times you broke my heart
When I'm alone  wish you were with me in the dark
But when you're here  you know we always fall apart
We're better off on our own
Wish I could tell you goodbye  but I won't
'Cause every time that I try  I can't let go
'Cause I can't un-love you
Frozen  even though we're broken
We keep holding on to these distant memories
And though you know I saw those pictures on your phone
And you don't even bother asking where I go
When I don't make it home  now everybody knows
We're better off on our own
Wish I could tell you goodbye  but I won't

It's goodbye  'cause you love it when it hurts
Finally  you came to say it
I don't need this everyday  and
I was dumb to see it  dumb to believe and never doubt you
I am in this too
Only see red and blue without you
I can't sing myself another song without you

They can take tomorrow and the plans we made (Plans we made)
They can take the music that we never played
All the broken dreams take everything
Just take it away
But they can never have yesterday
They can take the future that we'll never know

Just take it away

Thought I could count on you to be around
What is the problem?
Are you taking me seriously?
Is it a joke to you?
Or maybe I'm a fool
Why am I trying?
So hard to be the girl that you need
How is this fair to me?
When you break through
This is too much
Don't call it love

Someone to catch me when I hit the ground
Would you like it if I
Did the same thing to
You and I lasted
Walking years in my shoes?

Cause of what you did
There's no me and you
Would you like it if I
Did the same thing
You would not like
Walking in time?

You let me down  thought I had found
Someone to catch me when I hit the ground
Down
Down
Stop bringing me
Stop bringing me
Down
So long overdue  those tears were for you
Don't say you love me again just because you see the end
Don't act like you care  it's too late to pretend
I never wanted to burn our bridges  but I'm so tired
So hard to walk away  but I can't wish for yesterday
Oh  oh
I don't wanna lose you  I don't wanna lose you
But it's so hard when you don't care anymore
Our love was amazing  now it's not worth saving
Something tells me you don't care  you don't care anymore
Someday soon you'll understand when no one's there to hold your hand
When loneliness is your only friend
I'm not saying there won't be another time for you and me
I won't let love die or let you hurt me again

You'll see someone you don't recognize
You'll see someone who looks like me
But I'm not the me I used to be
Found I could fall  but I could get up
And after all  I could hold my head up
I made it out  I made it through
I'm someone now  I'm someone new
But you could say you knew me then
You could say you knew me when
You knew me when I was on the edge
And my confidence was shattered
You knew me when I didn't know my worth
Didn't know how much I mattered
You knew me when you thought you could keep me down  no
You knew me when  you knew me then
But you don't know me now
You look surprised to see I've changed
But I've turned the key and I've turned the page
Stepped out the dark into the sun
To a whole new me that I've become
I was scared  had so much fear then
Now I'm free  now I'm fearless
Took too much for too long
I'm someone now  I'm someone strong
