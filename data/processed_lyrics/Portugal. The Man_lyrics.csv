lyrics
"They spit you up river just like all those lions
That walked the banks
And would you only use blues?
Brilliant big black mouth
Lengths of pines that route the river through
Through and through
We’d like to watch the ghosts dance
We’d like to watch the ghosts dance
Paint me that arm
That lies directly over mountains
Where the glaciers climb so tall
We’d like to watch the ghosts dance
We’d like to watch the ghosts dance
We’d like to watch the ghosts dance
We’d like to watch the ghosts dance
I am but a man
Silver bells
That line the way
Baited trails
We’ll find you there
Silver bells (Silver bells)
That line the way (Line the way)
Baited trails (Baited trails)
We’ll find you there
I am but a man
Glowin' brighter with each year I am
I was standin' on a mountain
It's like my daddy said
You gotta use your head
All your light can't save me
There are things that you can't live without
And I became
Whole again
There'd be times like these
You might also like
I said all your light can't save me
No one said there'd be times like these
No one said there'd be times like these
No one said there'd be times like these
I was licking flames when I broke your reins
All your light can't save me
No one said there'd be times like these
No one said there'd be times like these
All your light can't save me
All your light can't save me
All your light can't save me
Some were simply shaken free
And some were the colors
That took to the streets
They found in those later years
They knew what we need
It's love for each other
And every living thing
And I hope my time
Hope my time
Is used
It's all my only and lonely time too
Now pick up and pack up
The place you were pink
And falling around
Dripping and crawling and
Clawing inside
You're missing some sounds
The ones that float carry
And dance about time
And space that it lends
Room to be free
Like the sun and the moon
Save for the sounds
We'll be reborn
We'll be the colors
That pour through the streets
And find in there after years
That we're all - we're all the same
We're all the colors
That pour through the streets

But if I bring along a friend it'll be fine for now
Read the bible in the evening  hang with demons on the weekend
After you  I don't know what I believe in
After you  Hell should be easy
After you  I don't know what I believe in
After you  Hell should be easier
Follow that little red bouncing ball
As it bounced 'round the galaxy came back to us all
The little bit he learned about outer space is
It's gotta destroy before it creates
After you  I don't know what I believe in
After you  Hell should be easy
After you  I don't know what I believe in
After you  Hell would be easier

I'm the golden baby born into the center
Mother was a gun and I fed nature to the beggars
Always talking but the kids never listen
They die in the evening  become demons for the weekend
After you  I don't know what I believe in

After you  I don't know what I believe in
After you  Hell will be easier

All the needy still need  and I know

All the preachers still preach  and I know
They ain't bringin' no change
I'm not afraid to die
'Cause all these colors will change (And I know)
I'm not afraid to die
'Cause all these colors will change
All the lows still low  and I know
All the high still get high
And how I wish we could dance
But all these rhythms don't seem to match up
Seem to match up
I'm not afraid to die
'Cause all these colors will change
I'm not afraid to die

If I wanted to talk I would have called a friend
Don't worry when I get back home
I'll just stay in bed  I'm better off alone
I woke up to my glory days
Never was a child  I was born this way
Always there but always out of place
Feels so alien
I don't know what I know  but I know where it's at
Just because I lost it doesn't mean I want it back
I don't know what I know  but I know where it's at
Just because I lost it doesn't mean I want it back
Is it the world I'm living in?
Sorry  but I don't recall the crime
My memory has left me behind
May have been a man  maybe a friend
Or maybe aliens

And it's not that I'm evil
I just don't like to pretend
That I could ever be your friend
Is it the world I'm living in?
Don't you know you might find
A better place to play?
You said that you'd never been
But all the things that you've seen
They slowly fade away
So I start a revolution from my bed
Cause you said the brains I had went to my head
Stand up beside the fireplace
Take that look from off your face
Cause you ain't ever gonna burn my heart out
She knows it's too late as we're walking on by
Her soul slides away
But don't look back in anger
I heard you say
Take me to the place where you go
Where nobody knows if it's night or day
Please don't put your life in the hands
Of a rock'n'roll band
Who'll throw it all away

Tight rope  no chains  holdin' it together
But it's hard to see clouds when you're six feet underground
Keep building a house then tearing it down

Take it easy  tiger
Dumb coconut  can't break it open

No way that I could pretend

Thats what I stay to myself
Everyone they care for theyself
If you ain't helpin my wealth
Then its best that you just step
I just smoke and drink til i pass out
Everybody wanna hand out
Got bandz on me no cashin out
Stay low key like a stash house
Drivin round with them racks out
Make the girlfriend tap out
With her back out till she blacked out
Now she comin back like a crack house

Ooh  wooh  I'm a rebel just for kicks  now
Ooh  wooh  I'm a rebel just for kicks  now
I been feeling it since 1966  now
Might be over now  but I feel it still
Can't keep my hands to myself
Think I'll dust 'em off  put 'em back up on the shelf
In case my little baby girl is in need
Am I coming out of left field?
Leave it with a baby sitter
Mama  call the grave digger
Gone with the fallen leaves
Am I coming out of left field?

We took a trip down in '87
We were looking for a place where we don't fear Heaven
Looking to the town to show us what they got
We got space to do just what you please

If I never need again I'll find that sleep again
Took a trip down in '87
They were looking for a place where we don't need Heaven

The sunrise I used to see but never see now
The people found the mountain
Climbed up from that hole in the ground
Through the crack in the sky threatened to fall
The future was born with a sunrise
The sunrise that builds into days and even more years
The people found the mountain
Climbed up from that hole in the ground
Through the crack in the sky threatened to fall

The sun it rose up from the belly of sea

The people found the mountain
Climbed up from that hole in the ground

Are you living your teens in a shed?
Is growing up giving you the bends?
Is my little sunshine getting jealous of the moonbeams
Feeling gloomy in your bed?
You left your friends where the pavement ends
The road of broken bones begins
Between here and now
There's glitter falling and a banner that says  Welcome to Hell
Make yourself at home  but leave behind free will
Can you feel me now?
You know I can't feel this pain in my heart
Because it's hard to see it falling apart
Maybe I'm too blind to see why trouble finds me
But if it's here I'd rather see where it leads
Call me Mr. Lonely
You can call me anything  call me if you know me
You can call me king  I got 48 below me
You can call me anything  call me if you know me
You can call me king  but that ain't no one below me
You can call me king  I'm the king  you wanna know me
But no one calls me  call me Mr. Lonely

Do you whisper your dreams to the deaf (Hello?)
Deny that it's all in your head (That thought)
The bitter past sleeps  sitting pretty in a limousine
Looking cruely under-fed (The real king)
Leave your friends where the pavement ends
The road of broken promise begins
Feet  don't fail me now
Broken promises  alcohol anonymous
Inducted in the hall of fame for vomiting
I puked around the world  I'm the Duke of Earl
I used to have a girl  but she wasn't happy
She left me naturally  she left with Natalie
They left in the back of a taxi  they was laughing at me
So I lit the club  bottles up  popping shit
False sense of happiness  perhaps I'll take what I get
I guess it's better than nothing  right? Least I got this blunt to light

Past and time that called out
With their hands beside you
As all the people shouted
Up to the northern territories
My  they glowed like a bug
Burning at the ends
Of shade covered crowns
Whose only words were
Wicked mumbles that shake unstable
Manners brought these thoughts about you
Lights up like flies and ants that dip about
And aim to
Just swallow us up like them bread baked gums
Now I remain glowing at the ends
I remain glowing at the ends
It's because it's you they've become

Growing ash and steeple factories

It never finds you
Cheap work finding pockets
