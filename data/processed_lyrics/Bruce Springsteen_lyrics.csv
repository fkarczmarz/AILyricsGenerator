lyrics
"Forcing a light into all those stony faces left stranded on this warm July
As the wizards play down on Pinball Way on the boardwalk way past dark
And the boys from the casino dance with their shirts open like Latin lovers on the shore
Chasing all them silly New York virgins by the score
And Sandy  the aurora is rising behind us
This pier lights our carnival life forever
Hey  Sandy girl
Or get busted for sleeping on the beach all night
Their skins are so white
Chasing the factory girls underneath the boardwalk
Where they all promise to unsnap their jeans
And you know that tilt-a-whirl down on the south beach drag
I got on it last night and my shirt got caught

This pier lights our carnival life on the water
Running  laughing 'neath the boardwalk
Ah  with the boss' daughter
Sandy  that waitress I was seeing lost her desire for me
I spoke with her last night  she said she won't set herself on fire for me anymore
She worked that joint under the boardwalk
She was always the girl you saw bopping down the beach with the radio
The kids say last night she was dressed like a star
In one of them cheap little seaside bars
And I saw her parked with lover boy out on the Kokomo
Did you hear the cops finally busted Madame Marie
For tellin' fortunes better than they do
For me this boardwalk life's through  babe
You ought to quit this scene  too
Sandy  the aurora is rising behind us
This pier lights our carnival life forever
Oh  love me tonight and I promise I'll love you forever
My father held me to his side
As they put me to the water
He said how on that day I cried
With the same hot blood burning in our veins
Adam raised a Cain (Yeah)
Adam raised a Cain (Yeah)

All of the old faces
Ask you why you're back
They fit you with position
And the keys to your daddy's Cadillac
In the darkness of your room
Your mother calls you by your true name

Now they blew up his house  too
Down on the boardwalk  they're getting ready for a fight
Gonna see what them racket boys can do
Now there's trouble busing in from out of state
And the D.A. can't get no relief
Gonna be a rumble out on the promenade
And the gambling commission's hanging on by the skin of its teeth
But maybe everything that dies someday comes back
Put your makeup on  fix your hair up pretty
And meet me tonight in Atlantic City
Well  I got a job and tried to put my money away
But I got debts that no honest man can pay
So I drew what I had from the Central Trust
And I bought us two tickets on that Coast City bus
But maybe everything that dies someday comes back

Trying in vain to breathe the fire we was born in
Catching rides to the outskirts  tying faith between our teeth
Sleeping in that old abandoned beach house  getting wasted in the heat
And hiding on the backstreets
Hiding on the backstreets
With a love so hard and filled with defeat
Running for our lives at night on them backstreets
Slow dancing in the dark on the beach at Stockton's Wing
Where desperate lovers park  we sat with the last of the Duke Street Kings
Huddled in our cars  waiting for the bells that ring
In the deep heart of the night  we can let loose of everything
To go running on the backstreets
Running on the backstreets
Terry  you swore we'd live forever
Taking it on them backstreets together
Endless juke joints and Valentino drag
Where dancers scraped the tears up off the streets dressed down in rags
Running into the darkness  some hurt bad  some really dying
At night sometimes it seemed you could hear the whole damn city crying
Blame it on the lies that killed us  blame it on the truth that ran us down
You can blame it all on me  Terry  it don't matter to me now
When the breakdown hit at midnight  there was nothing left to say
But I hated him and I hated you when you went away
Wa oh  wa oh

Stranded in the park  and forced to confess

Got a head-on collision smashin' in my guts  man
I'm caught in a crossfire that I don't understand
But there's one thing I know for sure  girl
I don't give a damn for the same old played-out scenes
Baby  I don't give a damn for just the in-betweens
You better listen to me  baby
Talk about a dream  try to make it real
You wake up in the night with a fear so real
You spend your life waiting for a moment that just don't come
Well  don't waste your time waiting

Let the broken hearts stand as the price you've gotta pay
We'll keep pushin' 'til it's understood

In the dumps with the mumps as the adolescent pumps his way into his hat
With this very unpleasing sneezing and wheezing  the calliope crashed to the ground
And some fleshpot mascot was tied into a lover's knot with a whatnot in her hand
And now young Scott with a slingshot finally found a tender spot and throws his lover in the sand
And she was blinded by the light
Blinded by the light
She got down but she never got tight  but she'll make it alright
Some brimstone baritone anti-cyclone rolling stone preacher from the east
And some new-mown chaperone was standin' in the corner all alone  watchin' the young girls dance
And some fresh-sown moonstone was messin' with his frozen zone to remind him of the feeling of romance
Yeah  he was blinded by the light
Blinded by the light
He got down but he never got tight  but he's gonna make it tonight

Of a runaway American dream
At night  we ride through mansions of glory
In suicide machines
Sprung from cages out on Highway 9
Chrome wheeled  fuel injected and steppin' out over the line
Oh  baby this town rips the bones from your back
It's a death trap  it's a suicide rap
We gotta get out while we're young
'Cause tramps like us  baby we were born to run
Wendy let me in  I wanna be your friend
I want to guard your dreams and visions
Just wrap your legs 'round these velvet rims
And strap your hands across my engines
Together we could break this trap
We'll run till we drop  baby we'll never go back
Oh  will you walk with me out on the wire?
`Cause baby I'm just a scared and lonely rider
But I gotta know how it feels
I want to know if love is wild  babe
I want to know if love is real
Oh  can you show me?

The highways jammed with broken heroes
On a last chance power drive
Everybody's out on the run tonight
But there's no place left to hide
I'll love you with all the madness in my soul

Where we really want to go  and we'll walk in the sun

Now I hear she's got a house up in Fairview
And a style she's trying to maintain

Tell her there's a spot out 'neath Abram's Bridge
And tell her there's a darkness on the edge of town

Driving in to Darlington County
Looking for some work on the county line
We drove down from New York City
Where the girls are pretty but they just want to know your name
Driving in to Darlington City
Got a union connection with an uncle of Wayne's
We drove 800 miles without seeing a cop

 I burst through the front door
 up the stairs I climbed
 our bed was empty
 hung my head  and cried
 working in the rain
 to see her you gotta look hard
 your pulse is getting weak
 I don't want it back

 jagged melody she still clings to me like a leech

Back in high school
He could throw that speedball by you

Suspended in my masquerade
I combed my hair 'til it was just right
And commanded the night brigade
I was open to pain and crossed by the rain
And I walked on a crooked crutch
I strolled all alone through a fallout zone
And came out with my soul untouched
I hid in the clouded wrath of the crowd
The flag of piracy flew from my mast
My sails were set wing to wing
I had a jukebox graduate for first mate
She couldn't sail but she sure could sing
I pushed B-52 and bombed them with the blues
With my gear set stubborn on standing
Never once gave thought to landing
I hid in the clouded warmth of the crowd

From the churches to the jails
Tonight all is silence in the world
As we take our stand
Down in Jungleland
And picked a rendezvous for the night
They'll meet 'neath that giant Exxon sign
That brings this fair city light
There's a ballet being fought out in the alley
Until the local cops' cherry top
Rips this holy night

The street's alive as secret debts are paid
Kids flash guitars just like switch-blades
Hustling for the record machine
The hungry and the hunted
Explode into rock'n'roll bands
That faced off against each other out in the street
Down in Jungleland
In the parking lot the visionaries dress in the latest rage
Inside the backstreet girls are dancing to the records that the DJ plays
Lonely-hearted lovers struggle in dark corners
Desperate as the night moves on
Soul engines running through a night so tender
In a bedroom locked in whispers
Of soft refusal and then surrender
As shots echo down them hallways in the night
No one watches when the ambulance pulls away
Or as the girl shuts out the bedroom light
Outside the street's on fire in a real death waltz
Between what's flesh and what's fantasy
And the poets down here don't write nothing at all
They just stand back and let it all be
And in the quick of the night
They reach for their moment and try to make an honest stand
Into the bus stop to pick up a paper for my old man
I'd sit on his lap in that big old Buick and steer as we drove through town
This is your hometown
This is your hometown
This is your hometown
This is your hometown
In '65 tension was running high at my school
There was a lot of fights 'tween the black and white
There was nothing you could do
Two cars at a light on a Saturday night
In the back seat there was a gun
Troubled times had come
To my hometown
To my hometown
My hometown
To my hometown
Now Main Street's whitewashed windows and vacant stores
Seems like there ain't nobody wants to come down here no more
They're closing down the textile mill across the railroad tracks
To your hometown
To your hometown
To your hometown
To your hometown

Last night I sat him up behind the wheel and said
Just a-twirling her baton
And ten innocent people died
With a sawed-off .410 on my lap
Through the badlands of Wyoming
I killed everything in my path
I can't say that I'm sorry
For the things that we done
Midnight in a prison storeroom
With leather straps across my chest
And snaps my poor head back
You make sure my pretty baby
Is sittin' right there on my lap

They declared me unfit to live
Said into that great void my soul'd be hurled
They want to know why I did what I did
Had to get away from those fools
We learned more from a three-minute record  baby
Than we ever learned in school
Tonight I hear the neighborhood drummer sound
I can feel my heart begin to pound
You say you're tired and you just want to close your eyes
And follow your dreams down
Well  we made a promise we swore we'd always remember
Like soldiers in the winter's night with a vow to defend
Well  now young faces grow sad and old
And hearts of fire grow cold
We swore blood brothers against the wind
I'm ready to grow young again
And hear your sister's voice calling us home
Across the open yards
Well maybe we'll cut someplace of our own
With these drums and these guitars

Now on the street tonight the lights grow dim
The walls of my room are closing in
There's a war outside still raging
You say it ain't ours anymore to win
I want to sleep beneath peaceful skies
In my lover's bed
With a wide open country in my eyes
And these romantic dreams in my head
Because we made a promise we swore we'd always remember
Blood brothers in the stormy night with a vow to defend
Fuelie heads and a Hurst on the floor
She's waiting tonight down in the parking lot
Outside the 7-Eleven store
Me and my partner Sonny built her straight out of scratch
And he rides with me from town to town
We shut 'em up and then we shut 'em down
I wanna blow 'em off in my first heat
Summer's here and the time is right
For racin' in the street
We take all the action we can meet
And we cover all the northeast states
From the fire roads to the interstate
Some guys come home from work and wash up
Then go racin' in the street

I met her on the strip three years ago
In a Camaro with this dude from L.A
I blew that Camaro off my back
And drove that little girl away
But now there's wrinkles around my baby's eyes
And she cries herself to sleep at night
She sits on the porch of her daddy's house
But all her pretty dreams are torn
She stares off alone into the night
With the eyes of one who hates for just being born
For all the shut-down strangers and hot rod angels
Rumbling through this promised land
And wash these sins off our hands
'Cause summer's here and the time is right
You know playin' blind man's bluff is a little baby's game
You pick up Little Dynamite  I'm gonna pick up Little Gun
And together we're gonna go out tonight and make that highway run
You don't have to call me lieutenant  Rosie  and I don't want to be your son
The only lover I'm ever gonna need's your soft sweet little girl's tongue
Ah  Rosie  you're the one
Dynamite's in the belfry  baby  playin' with the bats
Little Gun's downtown in front of Woolworth's  tryin' out his attitude on all the cats
Papa's on the corner  waitin' for the bus
Mama  she's home in the window  waitin' up for us
She'll be there in that chair when they wrestle her upstairs  cause you know we ain't gonna come

I'm coming to liberate you  confiscate you  I want to be your man
Someday we'll look back on this and it will all seem funny
But now you're sad  your mama's mad
And your papa says he knows that I don't (have any money)

Whoa  so your daddy says he knows I don't have (Papa says he knows that I don't have any money)
Well  tell him this is his last chance to get his daughter in a fine romance
Because the record company  Rosie  just gave me a big advance
And my tires were slashed and I almost crashed  but the Lord had mercy
And my machine  she's a dud  I'm stuck in the mud somewhere in the swamps of Jersey
By the time we meet the morning light  I will hold you in my arms
I know a pretty little place in Southern California down San Diego way

If you come knockin' late at night
She'll let you in her mouth
If the words you say are right
If you pay the price
She'll let you deep inside
But there's a secret garden she hides
She'll let you in her car
To go driving 'round
She'll let you into the parts of herself
That'll bring you down
She'll let you in her heart
If you got a hammer and a vise
You've gone a million miles
How far'd you get
To that place where you can't remember
And you can't forget?
She'll lead you down the path
There'll be tenderness in the air
She'll let you come just far enough
So you know she's really there
Then she'll look at you and smile
And her eyes'll say
She's got a secret garden
Where everything you want
Where everything you need
Will always stay
Your Mamma's yappin' in the back seat
Tell her to push over and move them big feet
Every Monday morning I gotta drive her down to the unemployment agency
Well this morning I ain't fighting  tell her I give up
Tell her she wins if she'll just shut up
But it's the last time that she's gonna be ridin' with me
And you can tell her there's a hot sun beatin' on the black top
She keeps talkin'  she'll be walking that last block
She can take a subway back to the ghetto tonight
Well  I got some beer and the highway's free
And I got you  and baby  you've got me

Now there's girls melting on the beach
Oh they're so fine and so out of reach

And French kisses will not break that heart of stone
With her long hair falling
And her eyes that shine like a midnight sun
She's the one
Hey! Hey!
That thunder in your heart
At night when you're kneeling in the dark
It says you're never gonna leave her
But there's this angel in her eyes

And tonight you'll try just one more time
To leave it all behind and to break on through

Well Billy slammed on his coaster brakes and said anybody wanna go on up to Greasy Lake

I got a bottle of rose so let's try it
We'll pick up Hazy Davy and Killer Joe and I'll take you all out to where the gypsy angels go
They're built like light
And they dance like spirits in the night (All night) in the night (All night)
Stand right up now and let it shoot through you
Well now Wild young Billy was a crazy cat and he shook some dust out of his coonskin cap
By the time we made it up to Greasy Lake I had my head out the window and Janey's fingers were in the cake
I think I really dug her cause I was too loose to fake
And we danced all night to a soul fairy band
And she kissed me just right like only a lonely angel can

Deliver me from nowhere
I was unrecognizable to myself
Saw my reflection in a window and didn't know my own face
On the streets of Philadelphia?
I walked the avenue 'til my legs felt like stone
I heard the voices of friends vanished and gone
At night I could hear the blood in my veins
Just as black and whispering as the rain
On the streets of Philadelphia
Ain't no angel gonna greet me
It's just you and I  my friend
And my clothes don't fit me no more
I walked a thousand miles just to slip this skin
The night has fallen  I'm lyin' awake
I can feel myself fading away
Or will we leave each other alone like this
Bad Scooter searching for his groove
Seem like the whole world walking pretty
And you can't find the room to move
'Cause I'm running on the bad side
And I got my back to the wall
