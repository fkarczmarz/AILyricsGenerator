" hide it!
 frame it
Transfusion with somebody
Morose and old
Drop into fruitless dying
It was tempting and bared
The whoring angel rising
Now burning prayers
My silent time of losing
My foes - they can't destroy my body
Long for the blur
We cannot dry much longer
Cement to dirt
Disgusted with my cheapness
My foes - they can't destroy my body
My foes - they can't destroy my body
My foes - they can't destroy my body
My foes - they can't destroy my body
Your private lives exposed
The talk shows pump it up
Lab rats diseased for show
We're doomed to use the slang
Outbreak of drug roulette
A church burned to the ground
Not even noticed yet
(To nowhere)
A backwards swastika
The black skin riddled in lead
A Nazi gangster Jew
It beats a dog that's dead
It's in to use the slang
Outbreak of gun roulette
The cross slants to the side
Will prove the damnedest yet

Leads to nowhere
The backlash dislocates
Untimely reign of death
The wolf poked with the stick
Awaits with cancerous breath
Leads to nowhere
Outsiders still suppose
There's Holy streets to roam
The truth should not surprise
Your homes were built on lies
After years  your ears will hear
You screamed that you tried
But it's words of a weakling and promises made by a liar  drunken liar
Now you pick up that splintered chair that was aiming for your head
A head that should have been long ago kicked in by me alone
I won't lose a second of sleep for this
Not again
Don't touch me
Don't touch me
Don't touch me
No
Ever again
Don't touch me
Don't touch me
Don't touch me
Orphaned to the dope and drinks
I learned my lessons well somehow from you
No tears  can't clutch my regrets
But these years of detachment have left me with demons now surfacing
But I'm becoming more than nothing
You never knew the answers to any of my questions  did you?
You made up all the answers to my unimportant existence

You don't have to dump me off
Not again
Don't touch me
Don't touch me
Don't touch me
Fuck  no
Ever again
Don't touch me
Don't touch me
Don't touch me
Fuck  no
Don't touch me
Never again
Don't touch me
Don't touch me again
I vow  lest I die tomorrow
Tomorrow  tomorrow
You'll never be the father I am
The bastard father to the thousands
The ones with fathers just like you
We're fucking you back  fucking you back
I'm shoving my life right down your throat
Can I find the guts? Can I feel the heart?
Look at the ground as you choke me up
Does it taste like tequila or failure?
We're fucking you back
We're fucking you back
We're fucking you back
We're fucking you back
Criticize what you wreck
We're fucking you back
Fucking you back
The unwanted
The ones with fathers just like you
We're fucking you back
Fucking you back
You group of pitiful liars
Before I woke to face the day
Your master plan transpired
Something told me
This job has more to meet the eye
My song is not believed?
My words somewhat deceiving?
Now I'm unwhole
You've waged a war of nerves
But you can't crush the kingdom
Can't be what your idols are
Can't leave that scar
You cry for compensation
I ask you please just give us
Five minutes alone
Just give us
Five minutes alone
You took me for a fool
You used complexion of my skin
For a counter racist tool
You can't burn me
I've spilled my guts out in the past
Taken advantage of
Because you know where I come from
My past

Five minutes alone
Headbutt to broken glass
Five minutes alone
Just give me
And stop
I ask you please just give us
Five minutes alone
I ask you please just give us
I ask you please just give us
I ask you please just give us
I ask you please just give us
I ask you please just give us
I ask you please just give us
I ask you please just give us
I ask you please just give us
I ask you please (Five minutes alone)
I ask you please
(Five minutes alone)
I'm asked to bleed
I try to breathe
And I try to free
I paid my deeds
(Five minutes alone)
I paid with my soul
I take back control
I take back control
My spirit rise
Forget the past
Present tense works and lasts
Pointed at by lesser men
New life in place of old life
Unscarred by trials
A new level
Of confidence
And power
Demanding plea
For unity between us all
United stand
Death before divided fall
In mock military order
Vulgar power
Impatient because time is shorter

Life kills

Then the memory of shame birthed its gift
Running from beatings  deflating
I'm becoming more than a man
More than you ever were
Driven and burning to rise beyond Jesus
I'm born again with snake's eyes
Becoming God-size
I found my life was slipping through my hands
Perhaps through death  my life won't be so bad
Staring through your eyes
Belittle your friends to serve me  to suck me
To realize my saving grasp
I of suicide  I the unlord
I'm born again with snake's eyes
Becoming God-size

Is this some conspiracy?
Crucified for no sins
No revenge beneath me
Lost within my plans for life
It all seems so unreal
I'm a man cut in half in this world
Left in my misery
The reverend  he turned to me
Without a tear in his eyes
Nothing new for him to see
I didn't ask him why
I will remember
The love our souls had sworn to make
Now I watch the falling rain
All my mind can see now is your
Well  I guess you took my youth
And gave it all away
Like the birth of a newfound joy
This love would end in rage
And when she died  I couldn't cry
The pride within my soul
You left me incomplete
All alone as the memories now unfold
You might also like
Believe the word
I will unlock my door
And pass the cemetery gates
Sometimes when I'm alone
I wonder aloud
If you're watching over me
Some place far abound
I must reverse my life
I can't live in the past
Then set my soul free
Belong to me at last
Through all those complex years
I thought I was alone
I didn't care to look around
And make this world my own
And when she died
I should've cried
And spared myself some pain...
You left me incomplete
All alone as the memories still remain
The way we were
The chance to save my soul
And my concern is now in vain
Believe the word
I will unlock my door
And pass the cemetery gates
The way we were
The chance to save my soul
And my concern is now in vain
Believe the word
I will unlock my door
And pass the cemetery
Gates
Gates
Under the lights where we stand tall
Nobody touches us at all
Showdown  shootout
Spread fear within  without
I say we're gonna take what's ours to have
Spread the word throughout the land
They say the bad guys wear black
We're tagged and can't turn back
You see us comin'
And you all together run for cover
We're takin' over this town
Here we come  reach for your gun
And you better listen well  my friend
You see  it's been slow down below
Aimed at you  we're the cowboys from hell
Deed is done  again  we've won
Ain't talkin' no tall tales  friend
'Cause high noon  your doom
Comin' for you  we're the cowboys from hell

But better not take it out on me
'Cause a ghost town is found
Where your city used to be
So out of the darkness and into the light
Sparks fly everywhere in sight
From my double-barrel  12 gauge
Can't lock me in your cage
You see us comin'
And you all together run for cover
We're takin' over this town
Here we come  reach for your gun
And you better listen well  my friend
You see  it's been slow down below
Aimed at you  we're the cowboys from hell
Deed is done  again we've won
Ain't talkin' no tall tales  friend
'Cause high noon  your doom
We're coming for you  we're the cowboys from hell
Here we come  reach for your gun

Ow
Agony is the price that you'll pay in the end
Domination consumes you then calls you a friend
It's a twisted fall
Binds are like steel and manipulates the will to be
And it's hard to see how soon we forget
Your eyes will see the dawn of the day
And the writing on the wall
Those words that stare into your soul
A now blacked heart is reaching out in divinity
Sealed you in brick by brick till your end forcing you to bend

It fits the attitude
If you could see yourself
You put you on a shelf
Your verbal masturbate
Promise to nauseate
Today  I'll play the part
Of nonparent
Not make a hundred rules
For you to know about yourself
Not lie and make you believe what's evil
Is making love and making friends
And meeting God your own way
The right way
To see  to bleed
Cannot be taught
In turn  you're making us
Ah  fucking hostile!
We stand alone
The truth in right or wrong
The boundaries of the law
You seem to miss the point
Arresting for a joint?!
You seem to wonder why
Hundreds of people die
You're writing tickets  man
My mom got jumped  they ran!
Now I'll play the public servant
To serve and protect
By the law and the state
I'd bust the punks
That rape  steal  and murder
And leave you be
If you crossed me  I'd shake your hand like a man
Not a god
To see  to bleed
Cannot be taught
In turn  you're making us
Ah  fucking hostile!
We stand alone
Vince!
Come meet your maker  boy
Some things you can't enjoy
Because of heaven  hell
A fucking wives' tale
They put it in your head
Then put you in your bed
He's watching  say your prayers
'Cause God is everywhere
Now I'll play a man
Learning priesthood
About to take the ultimate test in life
I question things
Because I am human
And call no one my father
Who's no closer that a stranger
I won't listen

That's always sixteen
I've found the secret
Of eternal youth
Some get high
On life or money
But there's an escape
Drop out of the race
To walk through the world
By oneself
You can't be protected...
Your trust is in whiskey
And weed and Black Sabbath
It's goddamn electric
Don't waste your time
Embrace it
And then you'll know yourself
The change in you is goddamn electric
The weight of the world
Has lifted and parted
My eyes roll blind
To sights that distracted
Through tunnel vision
And dope-hair blinders
I'll cut a path
And evoke my will

The change in you is goddamn electric
Don't waste your time
Embrace it
And then you'll know yourself
The change in you is goddamn electric
Will focus the mind's eye...
One hand on the bottle
No pressure from the outside
My sight's goddamn electric
And these eyes have seen a world
Goddamn electric system...
Don't waste your time
Embrace it
And then you'll know yourself
 I fucked your love
 I dripped her ass
 I thought you might be spying
 you fuck
The gift to entertain you
But through blood  I inherited
A life that could destroy you
I drink all day  I smoke all day
I took Madonna's breath away
I've done it all but tap the vein
These hard lines and sunken cheeks
Are textbook reasons
All these Christians come alive
And try to sell you
My soul for a goat
Yet I'll outlive the old
You know it's bad  some may say sad
A hangover is inspiration
Like a junkie  I hurt for it
A bad trip  the emptiness
I never sleep  or I always sleep
A lack of fulfillment to me is me
The big picture
These hard lines and sunken cheeks
Are part of what the Christians mean
To immortalize my situation

And I reject
Tempter  tempting
Tempt me  molest me
You know that I'll submit
For this is my weakness
And it saves me from relationships
With those Christians
You know they'll sell you
My soul for a goat
Yet I'll outlive the old
In a world of corruption
Human nature is
Of violent breed
Who cares if there's no tomorrow?
Laid out for me
Can't you see?
Rise
Above the lies
Morals on a backwards globe
A sin to you
It's my life and provision
Black or white
Some pay to pray
You question why they
Act this way
It's their fucking decision

Only tranquility
Mean nothing to me

Honesty born in me

Reason to fight

Or synthetic deities
Is where I belong
My stand is the human race
Without a label or a face
So they can lick my sack
No more judgment day
Only tranquility
Mean nothing to me
Honesty born in me
Heresy

Don't he remember us?
Can't he believe me?
We seemed like brothers
Talked for hours last month
About what we wanna be
I sit now with his hand in mine
But I know he can't feel...
No one knows
What's done is done
It's as if he were dead
I'm close with his mother
And she cries endlessly
At least what's remembered
It's so important
To make best friends in life
But it's hard when my friend
Sits with blank expressions
No one knows
What's done is done
It's as if he were dead

Hear my words before it's through
I want to come in after you
My best friend
My best friend
Come back
(He as hollow as I alone now)
While loved ones mourn the day
The absence of our faces
Is this too much for them to take?
Such values you taught your son
Look at me now
I'm broken
Inherit my life
I'm broken
A clichéd fact of life
Force-fed to make us heed
Inbred to sponge our bleed
A poison apple for mingled blood
Venereal mother embrace the loss
Look at you now
You're broken
Inherit your life
You're broken
Look at us now
I'm broken
Inherit my life
I'm broken
Look at me now

I scream at the wind
Thought I heard
The words of others
Imprison myself
And stay in a shell
I won't let you in
To have a story to tell
Things tend to drag me down
My fear grips the will of stone
My grip fears I'll die alone
I promised myself
Somewhere in teenage life
I'd never submit to the ones
I will not be like
Live in a hole
But stay close to my kind
'Cause they understand
What burns in my mind

Your condition was nod awake
Robbing all of what you could take in
Stabbed towards a death
A dirty smelling girl
Filling veins with juice of chaos
It's times like this you should pray for never
I broke your fucking mold
Then threw away the cast
New religion and new provisions
It's amazing you're alive
Drop the needle and stop what you're changing into
So I mended severed ties
Through flesh we cauterized
I filled you up with watered promise

It's times like this you should pray for never
It's times like this to pray for murder
So now I've seen it all

A gift unto myself
And I'm lucky I'm alive
I broke your fucking mold
Then threw away the cast
It's times like this you should pray for never
It's times like this to pray for murder
So now I've seen it all
Hells' wrath
No man has greater glory
Past the shores of ever dark
There stays a magic man
Who bears an evil mark
He helps all concerned
Those who come again return
Injecting lies while fires burn
The devil's heart with angel's words
Have you wondered what heaven's like?
He can show you in one night
Overwhelming with euphoric lift
Intoxication
Seeping down to the bone
And there's no question
Where you have to go
He's the medicine man
He's the medicine man

Once proud and fearless men
With desire in their eyes
Lost strong and fruitful lives
To self-indulgent ties
Their souls were dipped in venom
And put into a box
Then placed upon a crowded shelf
Where countless souls now rot
Have you ever wondered what hell's like?
He can take you there
Intoxication
Seeping down to the bone
And there's no question
Where you have to go
He's the medicine man
He's the medicine man
He's the medicine man
He's the medicine man
It can trigger my mind
Since I was just a child
I just summon power within my soul
It has given me life beyond life
I take blame for my murderous problem
My signature always reminds
It's a message in blood
It's your cryptic warning
Within the message in blood
Marks the years of pain
And your godforsaken
Ending to life
I'm provoked into sick confrontations
Brutal time after time
Slay in different designs
One man's misery is another man's mystery
No one cares to understand my demented means
Sticks and stones can break all your brittle bones

I'm screaming revenge again
Wrong
I've been wrong for far too long
Been constantly so frustrated
I've moved mountains with less
When I channel my hate to productive
I don't find it hard to impress
Bones in traction
Hands break to hone raw energy
Bold and disastrous
My ears can't hear what you say to me
Hold your mouth for the war
Use it for what it's for
Speak the truth about me
Determined
Possessed
I feel a conquering will down inside me
Strength
The strength of many to crush who might stop me
My strength is in number
And my soul lies in every one
The releasing of anger
Can better any medicine under the sun

There comes a time within everyone
To close your eyes to what's real
No comprehension to fail
I vacuum the wind for my sail
Owning success is the bottom line
Like a knife into flesh
Afterlife is to death
Pulling and punching the rest of duration
There's a problem with race
Because of ignorant
Past-burnt fires
From evolution
We've been killing each other
I figure man should have it
Down to a science
I'm straight out in my opinion
You'd better listen to a man
Who knows what he's saying
For the mere fact that you feel inferior
Be superior and know your interior
A hated mass
For revolution

This land of fools will rise
No good for no one

You blame oppression
And play the role of criminals
To rape and burn
Shows progress is minimal
White hoods and militants

Violence in your city
If one man had one home
Or even talk to in his private grave
A closed mind playing the part
Of prison cells
A hated mass
For revolution
This land of fools will rise
No good for no one
You're no good for no one
This land of fools will rise
No good for no one
(He'd) Done nothing but stand
He talks big 'cause he's so small
So no one would give him a hand...
The kind of guy that would steal your cash
And buy a burning house
Then call you up and invite you in
And jerk you off with a sandpapered hand
I'd leave him physically crippled
Without a leg to stand
I throw that trash away
Because a rod like that is piss in the wind
My fists will be the decider
I wasn't raised a fool
I'd stomp his ass for free
Because a punk like that is piss in the wind...
Piss in the wind
A go-getter who ain't got none
A legend in his mind
Always the one to invite himself
And then gets left behind
Someone must've clipped his balls
Or wiped his ass all his life
A self-centered procrastinator
Attention seeker who's got nothing at all...

Stars shine like eyes
The black night sighs
The moon in silver dreams
Falls down in beams
Light of the night
Of sapphire haze
In orbit always
Bathed in cool breeze
Silver starlight breaks
Dawn from night
The crimson eye
Of great god Mars
As we travel the universe
For the way we live
If there's nothing to have
I'll break a sweat
And I don't regret
What you'd kill to see
Brings out the god in me
Come and be with me
Live my twisted dream
Pro devoted pledge
Time for primal concrete sledge
The man of a thousand retirements
Will always be the one to tell you when to quit
I won't take stock in a withered man
I'm reaching into you  I'll make you understand

Head lying in your hands
Shaking in the corner
Done too much alcohol
Gotta get away from it all
'Cause it feels my blood is freezing
My self-insanity has taken its toll
Frustration has taken its control
Now I'm far from home
Spending time alone
Been put through the test
My mind laid to rest
I'm on a psycho holiday
Shot down on sight
You are the target of attention
One woman here
Another there

Is this where I lived
Or where I died?
You want my money
You take my space
My mind is telling me
To leave this place
My self-insanity has taken its toll
Frustration has taken its control
Now I'm far from home
Spending time alone
Been put through the test
My mind laid to rest
I'm on a psycho holiday
Now I'm far from home
Spending time alone
It's time to set my demons free
Been put through the test
My mind laid to rest
I'm on a psycho holiday
Now I'm far from home
Spending time alone
It's time to set my demons free
Been put through the test
My mind will never rest
That you think you own
You have that smart-ass attitude
It's time to stop the fiction
I live it every day
While your mind's far away
I'm out here putting pride on the line
And you case on me with pure respect
One chance at one thing
Hard time is coming
Most regular people would say
It's hard

Don't fuck with this

We've got no time to lose
Your news is old news
Right approach for the wrong
It's time to spread the word
Let the voice be heard
Dominate and take the motherfucking world
Breathing life into our lungs
Every creed and every kind
To give us depth for strength
Taught when we're young to hate one another
It's time to have a new reign of power
Make pride universal so no one gives in
Turn our backs on those who oppose
What's wrong with their mind?
What's wrong with your mind?

Every creed and every kind
To give us depth for strength
Taught when we're young to hate one another
It's time to have a new reign of power
Make pride universal so no one gives in
Turn our backs on those who oppose
What's wrong with their mind?
What's wrong with your mind?
It's time to rise
Breathing life into our lungs
Every creed and every kind
To give us depth for strength
Taught when we're young to hate one another
It's time to have a new reign of power
Make pride universal so no one gives in
Turn our backs on those who oppose
What's wrong with their mind?
What's wrong with your mind?
Corpses left in piles
Ungracious bludgeonment
That breaks the earth for miles
Nothing can stop it
The day has come
From below
It's catastrophic
Freezing
There's no healing
Families are dying
This world is shattered...
All shattered
Life-crushing turbulence
This wrath can't be denied
Wishing you could help your friends
Standing where they died
Echoes haunting
A hollow planet
Lacerations
Dissected nation

I can't afford for you to see what's in
I'd rather shoot myself than have you watch me
I feel you'd steal my skin to try and wear me
I was betrayed one more day
Of my short life
To suffocate my being
You were sticking to me like a scab
Then stepped out of myself
I'm shedding skin
Through swollen eyes
I'm shedding skin
I'm shedding my skin

I've kept a simple woman through the thick and thin
But I've found the guts to sever from my Siamese twin
I throw you away every day
A dead part of life
In between my longing for torture
Blood on my face that came from your face
A mix of kissing and bleeding
I'm shedding skin
Through swollen eyes
I'm shedding skin
I'm shedding my skin
You're fucking and sucking
Your flower has soured
It's harder and stronger
But no one's been inside you longer and harder and deeper
I'm shedding my skin
To peel you off of me
You've got to love me
I'm shedding my skin
To drain you out of me
 woman God
No education
No family life to open my arms to
You'd say that my job is today
Yet gone tomorrow
I'll be broke in a gutter
I know the opinion
A broken record
Fuck you and your college dream
Fact is we're stronger than all
You're working for perfect bodies
Perfect minds and perfect neighbors
But I'm helping to legalize dope
On your pristine streets
And I'm making a fortune
You're muscle and gall
Naive at best

Hard as a rock
Shut like a lock

He holds out his hand on your television and
Draws back a stump
It's too late for some
Far too late
Far too late!
Hail kings
The new kings
Stronger than all
A simple progress to legalize
There would not be a choice
But to take our side
Be there no question
Of certain strengths
Know this intention
Forever stronger than all
The pills that kill and take the pain away (Take the pain away)
Diet of life  shelter without
The face that cannot see inside yours and mine (Yours and mine)
When I'm hiding
When I need it  it lets me breathe
For our handle on this life
I don't believe this time
Would you look at me now? (Would you look at me now?)
Can you tell I'm a man? (Can you tell I'm a man?)
With these scars on my wrists
To prove I'll try again
Try to die again
Try to live through this night
Try to die again
Forever fooling  free and using
Sliding down the slide that breaks a will (Breaks a will)
Mother's angel  getting smarter
How smart are you to regress unfulfilled?

Gun up to the mouth
Fret not family
Nor pre-judged army
This is for me
Don't you try to die
Like me
It's living its lies
And makes graves descending
It's not worth the time to try
To replenish a rotting life
Tortured history
Addict of misery
This exposes me

It's livid and it's lies

Blind eyes of society bring
The category of minority
Now what are we supposed to be?
Born free to be
Powerless to change the world
With our lives in the hands of madmen
Now in times when society needs us
This is where the sin begins
We're aware they're going to free us
Rage from our hearts within
But we'll be closer to heaven

You rob a dead man's grave
Then flaunt it like you did create
If I hit bottom and everything's gone

Huah
Happened before us
We are confined to a
The conquering of our world
As we knew it
Rise above this pit
Of sorrow and pain
Among the few
We are the avant leaders
We've got to live
Through this trouble and decay
This question haunts my mind:
Will we survive this night?
We're harboring the meek
Will we survive the sleep?
Unsure and scared
We are planning our reprise
Revolves around this world
We don't know anymore
The odds against us
Yet we're stronger and prevailing
Learn from mistakes
Counting souls for sale

A common affair for the ones who are juiced
If it is weakness that grants us the power
We thrive on what's stronger than most of the world
The smart ones stay on the outside
While drunken heads and arms erupt
Centered man swings a punch
A punk rock escapade
Five bucks a head to be king dick in the crowd
We are the ones who must sport the position
Lesbian love is accepted and right
Shaved heads meet hair in the mix
Blending the 80's and 90's with hate
Put in position to wage teenage mayhem

Abandoned for the bums on the street
A lifestyle that's unexplainable

You can just keep it
You must follow the etiquette
Fake! Fake! Fake! Fake!
You know when it rains you're in your bed at home
You act so real when you are alone
Fake! Fake! Fake! Fake!
You better not let the mohawked crowd see
You must admit that you mimic the weaklings
The trend is dead!
The trend is dead!

Painful and untrue
I said I loved
But I lied
Was the keeping of someone like you
Love was twisted and pointed at you
Never-ending pain
Quickly ending life
You keep this love

I'd been the tempting one
Stole her from herself
This gift in pain
Her pain was life

Some bald guy writhing

Truly fuck the world for all it's worth
Every inch of planet Earth
Fuck myself  don't leave me out
But don't get involved  don't corner me
Inside  ulcer
Unjust bastards
File out  face first
Meet the lies and see what you are
It's forcing you down
And it's grinding against you
Let the war nerve break
For every fucking second the pathetic media pisses on me and judges what I am in one paragraph
Look here  fuck you all
(Expect  expect  expect  expect  expect  expect)
Expect the worse  you bleeding heart
But kill me first before it starts
Yes  my cock is getting hard
