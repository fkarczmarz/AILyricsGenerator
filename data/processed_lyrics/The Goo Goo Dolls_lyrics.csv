lyrics
"With the lies they told to you
And the least they ever gave you
Was the most you ever knew
And I wonder where these dreams go
When the world gets in your way
What's the point in all this screaming?
No one's listening anyway
Your voice is small and fading
And you're hiding here alone
And your mother loves your father
'Cause she's got nowhere to go
And she wonders where these dreams go
'Cause the world got in her way
What's the point in ever trying?
Nothing's changing anyway
They press their lips against you
And you love the lies they say
And I tried so hard to reach you
But you're falling anyway
And you know I see right through you
'Cause the world gets in your way
What's the point in all this screaming?
Honestly
'Cause I never heard a word you said now
And I ain't just being mean
'Cause all we are is what we're told
And most of that's been lies
It's like a made-for-TV movie
And I just blew my line
Someday you never made it
Maybe you never will
Now I feel unknown
And it's safe that way
Now what's that supposed to mean?
I'm burned out on some empty reasons
Another waste of time
It's something that I wish I'd said
But I don't think it'd rhyme

Someday you never made it
Maybe you never will
See I'd love to be you
At least then I'd see you
Sorry I put them words in your mouth
But you wouldn't talk to me
You're everything I want and haven't got
I'm sick of everything I'm not
Put my heavy coat on for a while
It's freezing in the corner of my mind
Someday you never made it
Maybe you never will
And it's hard to see you dreaming
You hide inside yourself
And I wonder what you're thinking
And everything you're chasing
It seems to leave you empty
And I won't take long to burn
All eyes on me
Through the nothing that you've learned
All eyes on me
And the things you choose to be
All eyes on me
But your eyes look away
It's so hard to be someone
Strung out from today
And all that you knew slips away
You drown in deeper oceans
Inventing new religions
They smile and stab my back and
I lie and have to laugh

It's so hard to be someone
Strung out from today
And all that you knew slips away
And you hide in your room
And the lights turn away
And you move from the truth
All the faint morning light
Filled with hope
Cause you're here in my life
And we've gone
From the edge of our souls
Made it back to a place we call home
You... See me through
I was alone in the dark and the fear was my truth
Yeah all the things that you are
Beautifully broken
Alive in my heart
And know
That you are everything
Let your heart sing and tonight
We'll light up the stars
All that you are
I feel wrong
I'm so human and flawed
I'll break down even though I'm still strong
And time... will make fools of us all
Build us up and then laughs when we fall
You... pull me through
When I'm alone in the dark and the fear is my truth

You're the sound of redemption
The faith that I've lost the answers

Beautifully broken
Alive in my heart
And know
That you are everything
Let your heart sing and tonight
Let your heart sing and tonight
We'll light up the stars
All that you are
Three more point right back at you
I'm not saying that there's something wrong with life
Cause that's a sad excuse
An age old game of rat and mouse
Is chasing us from house to house
I'm not saying that there's something wrong with you
It's wrong with me as well
Are you alive?

Is it too late to call and tell you to be strong?
Are you alive?

We had the time of our lives
Lost the rest of our minds

Faded down from your eyes

To feel who you are
Hiding myself in your eyes

Now your world is way too fast
Nothing's real and nothing lasts
And I'm aware
I'm in love but you don't care
Turn your anger into lust
And I'll be waiting
Love and sex and loneliness
Take what's yours and leave the rest
So I'll survive
And I'm torn in pieces
I'm blind and waiting for you
My heart is reeling
I'm blind and waiting for you
Still in love with all your sins
Where you stop and I begin
And I'll - I'll be waiting
Living like a house on fire
What you fear is your desire
It's hard to deal

Forgotten but not gone

Fortune teller said I'd be free
And that's the day you came to me  mm
Came to me  mm
Come to me  my sweetest friend
Can you feel my heart again?
I'll take you back where you belong
And this will be our favorite song
Come to me with secrets bare
I'll love you more so don't be scared
And when we're old and near the end
We'll go home and start again
I caught you burnin' photographs
Like that could save you from your past
History is like gravity

You're nothing that you seem
I'm drowning in your vanity
Your laugh is a disease
You're dirty and you're sweet
Everything you are
Falls from the sky like a star
Everything you are
Whatever ever you are
I want to kick at the machine
That made you piss away your dreams
And tear down your defenses
'Til there's nothing there but me

Is what you feel
The truth remains
In midnight conversations
I asked for this moment
But you turned away
Sad like a lonely child
Broken the day you're born
I held the light to you
But I was so vain
And you remain
A promise unfulfilled
I ask you for more
But you push me away

A promise unfulfilled until today
And if we feel the silence
Leavin' this all behind us
When it's gone
What will you say?
How do we hold on? 
You lie awake at night
Bringing home the new invention
See it there in pieces on the ground
A television war between the cynics and the saints
Flip the dial and that's whose side you're on
A-sleeping on the White House lawn ain't never changed a thing
Just look at all the washed out hippie dreams
And it's falling all around us
Is this some kind of joke they're trying to pull on us?
Fallin' all around us
I'll turn my head off for a while
The tabloid generation's lost
Choking on its fear
Used to be that's all we had to fear
And conscience keeps us quiet while the crooked love to speak
There's knowledge wrapped in blankets on the street
A visionary coward says that anger can be power

Wishing for you to find your way

This game you play

You need to let me know
You leaving or you going to stay
