"You were far away
And I
Didn't ask you Why?
What could I say?
I was far away
You just walked away
And I just watched you
What could I say?
How close am I
To losing you?
Tonight
You just close your eyes
And I just watch you
Slip away
How close am I
To losing you?
Hey
Are you awake?
About today?

Lift my shirt up
Stand up straight at the foot of your love  I
I lift my shirt up
I was carried to Ohio in a swarm of bees
I never married but Ohio don't remember me
Lay my head on the hood of your car  I
I take it too far
Lay my head on the hood of your car  I
Take it too far
I still owe money to the money to the money I owe
I never thought about love when I thought about home
I still owe money to the money to the money I owe
The floors are fallin' down from everybody I know
I'm on a blood buzz  yes I am
I'm on a blood buzz
I'm on a blood buzz  God I am
I'm on a blood buzz

I get on the ground the second I'd see you
You cannot command your love
I wasn't a catch  I wasn't a keeper
I was walkin' around like I was the one who found dead John Cheever
Hand in glove
So blame it on me  I really don't care
It's a foregone conclusion
I see you in stations and on invitations
You'd fall into rivers with friends on the weekends
Innocent skies above
Carin at the liquor store  I can't wait to see you
I'm walkin' around like I was the one who found dead John Cheever
In the house of love
So blame it on me  I really don't care
It's a foregone conclusion
A foregone conclusion
It's gonna be different after tonight  you're gonna see me in a different light

I'm already seein' stars in the air
Do not know what all the troubles are for
Give 'em ice for their fevers
You're the only thing I ever want anymore
Live on coffee and flowers
Try not to wonder what the weather will be
I figured out what we're missing
I tell you miserable things after you are asleep
Now we'll leave the Silver City 'cause all the silver girls
Gave us black dreams
Leave the Silver City 'cause all the silver girls
Everything means everything
It's a Hollywood summer
You'd never believe the shitty thoughts I think
Meet our friends out for dinner
We belong in a movie
Try to hold it together 'til our friends are gone
We should swim in a fountain
Do not want to disappoint anyone

'Cause I'm evil
I'm a confident liar
Have my head in the oven so you'll know where I'll be
I'll try to be more romantic
I want to believe in everything you believe
I was less than amazing
I do not know what all the troubles are for
Fall asleep in your branches
You're the only thing I ever want anymore
Now we'll leave the Silver City 'cause all the silver girls
Gave us black dreams
Leave the Silver City to all the silver girls
Everything means everything
I was afraid I'd eat your brains
I was afraid I'd eat your brains
'Cause I'm evil

I wanted to ask if you could stay
But you were on somethin' with your friends around
There was nothin' I could say
But I'm gonna keep you in love with me for a while
I'm gonna keep you in love with me
The next time I saw you  you were breakin' down
A million years had gone away
You looked right at me  and I just turned around
There was still nothin' I could say
But I'm gonna keep you in love with me for a while
I'm gonna keep you in love with me
I'm gonna keep you in love with me for a while
I'm gonna keep you in love with me
I have dreams of anonymous castrati
Singin' to us from the trees
I have dreams of first man and first lady
Singin' to us from the sea

Singin' to us from the trees
I have dreams of first man and first lady
Singin' to us from the sea
Besides I barely ever see you anymore
And when I do it feels like you're only halfway there
Young mothers love me  even ghosts of
Girlfriends call from Cleveland  they will
Meet me anytime and anywhere
The day I die  the day I die
Where will we be?
The day I die  the day I die
Where will we be?
Don't do this  I don't do this to you
And don't expect me to enjoy it
'Cause I really don't have the courage not to turn the volume up inside my
Ears  for years I used to put my
Head inside the speakers
In the hallway when you get too high and talk forever
The day I die  the day I die
Where will we be?
The day I die  the day I die
Where will we be?
The day I die  the day I die
Where will we be?

I get a little punchy with the vodka
Just like my great uncle Valentine Jester did
When he had to deal with those people like you
Who made no goddamn common sense
I'd rather walk all the way home right now
Than to spend one more second in this place
Come outside and leave with me
Let's just get high enough to see our problems
Let's just get high enough to see our fathers' houses
The day I die  the day I die
Where will we be?
The day I die  the day I die
Where will we be?
The day I die  the day I die
Where will we be?
The day I die  the day I die
The sight of you among the sights
I get the sudden sinking feeling
Of a man about to fly
It never kept me up before
Now I've been awake for days
I can't fight it anymore
I'm going through an awkward phase
I am secretly in love with
Everyone that I grew up with
I do my crying underwater
I can't get down any farther
All my drowning friends can see
Now there is no running from it
It's become the crux of me
I wish that I could rise above it
But I stay down with my demons
I stay down with my demons
Bats and buzzards in the sky
Alligators in the sewers
I don't even wonder why
I hide among the younger viewers
I huddle with them all night long
The worried talk to God goes on
I sincerely tried to love it
I wish that I could rise above it

Can I stay here? I can sleep on the floor
Paint the blood and hang the palms on the door
I do not think I'm going places anymore
I wanna see the sun come up above New York
Fuck
So I stay down with my demons
I stay down with my demons
I stay down with my demons
I don't see what's strange about this
Tiny bubbles hang above me
It's a sign that someone loves me
I can hardly stand up right
I hit my head upon the light
I have faith but don't believe it
It's not there enough to leave it
Everything I love is on the table
Everything I love is out to sea
I have only two emotions
Careful fear and dead devotion
I can't get the balance right
With all my marbles in the fight
I see all the ones I went for
All the things I had it in for
I won't cry until I hear
'Cause I was not supposed to be here
Everything I love is on the table
Everything I love is out to sea

I'm not alone

I need somewhere to stay

Keep my arms the rest of the night
Ah
Ah-ah-ah-ah
I'm not alone
I'll never be
And to the bone
I'm evergreen
And if you want (Dead seriously)
To see me cry (Don't swallow the cap)
Play Let It Be (Pat yourself on the back)
Or Nevermind (Dead seriously)
Is it time to leave? Is it time to think about
What I wanna say to the girls at the door?
I need somewhere to be
But I can't get around the river in front of me
Leave my arms the rest of the night
Ah
Ah-ah-ah-ah
I'm not alone (Dead seriously)
I'll never be (Don't swallow the cap)
And to the bone (Pat yourself on the back)
I'm evergreen (Dead seriously)
And if you want (Dead seriously)
To see me cry (Don't swallow the cap)
Play Let It Be (Pat yourself on the back)
For the feeling that I lost today
Someone send a runner for the feeling that I lost today
Someone send a runner through the weather that I'm under
For the feeling that I lost today
Someone send a runner for the feeling that I lost today
You must be somewhere in London
You must be loving your life in the rain
You must be somewhere in London
Walking Abbey Lane

Is there a powder to erase this?
Is it dissolvable and tasteless?
I don't have the sunny side to face this
I am invisible and weightless
Just come and find me
I took the medicine and I went missing
Graceless
I figured out how to be faithless
But it would be a shame to waste this
Just come and find me
I took the medicine and I went missing

You can all

In my mind  I am in your arms
I wish someone would take my place
Can’t face heaven all heavenfaced
No one’s careful all the time
If you lose me  I’m gonna die
How completely high was I?
I was off by a thousand miles
Hit the ceiling  then you fall
Things are tougher than we are
I could walk out  but I won’t
In my mind  I am in your arms
I wish someone would take my place
Can’t face heaven all heavenfaced

I retire to the briars

Got my rings around me
I got baby to pound me
I see stars and go weak
My baby cries and lays me down
In the skies over black Venice
I see eyes of a white menace
The surprise of the week
Is that I never heard the sound
And all the L.A. women
Fall asleep while swimmin'
I got paid to fish 'em out
And then one day I lost the job
And I cried a little
I got fried a little
Then she laid her eyes on mine

She wore blue velvet

Am I ever coming down?
I'm not going anywhere
Who do I think I'm kidding?
I'm still standing in the same place where you left me standing
I am easy to find
You never were much of a New Yorker
It wasn't in your eyes
If you ever come around this way again
You'll see me standing in the sunlight
In the middle of the street
I am easy to find

Davy says that I look taller
But I can't get my head around it
I keep feeling smaller and smaller
I need my girl

Remember when you lost your shit and
Drove the car into the garden?
You got out and said I'm sorry
To the vines and no one saw it
I need my girl

The molecules and the caplets
They all have something against me
Nothing I do makes me feel different
This one's like your sister's best friends
In a bath callin' you to join them
Can't avoid them
This one's like your mother's arms
When she was young and sunburned in the '80s
It lasts forever
The more level they have me
The more I cannot stand me
I have helpless friendships
And bad taste in liquids
This one's like the wilderness
With the windows open
I keep re-readin' the same lines
Always up at 5am every mornin'
Like a baby

It's just the lights comin' on

Gave me a reason to get out of the city
See you inside watching swarms on TV
I gave my heart to the army
The only sentimental thing I could think of
With cousins in colors and somewhere overseas
But it'll take a better war to kill a college man like me
I'm too tired to drive anywhere

Laying down to soak it all in before we had to run
I was always ten feet behind you from the start
Didn't know you were gone 'til we were in the car
'Til I saw how hard it'd be to reach you
I thought I saw your mother last weekend in the park
Everyone was lighting up in the shadows alone
'Til I saw how hard it'd be to reach you
But you do everything that they ask you to
'Cause you don't mind seeing yourself in a picture
As long as you look far away
As long as you look removed
Showered and blue-blazered
Fill yourself with quarters
Showered and blue-blazered
Fill yourself with quarters
You get mistaken for strangers by your own friends
When you pass them at night
Arm in arm in arm and eyes in eyes glazing under
Into the un-magnificent lives of adults

So you have something to wear on your sleeve of sleeves
So you swear you just saw a feathery woman
Carry a blindfolded man through the trees

Hanne Darboven had a great idea
Move back home with mom and dad
The pool is drained and they're not there
My bedroom is a stranger's gun room
Ohio's in a downward spiral
I can't go back there anymore
Since alt-right opium went viral
I am not in Kansas
Take me for a walk and blame this on the water dripping off the spear
You even get to wear a dress
And feed his flesh to wayward daughters
Everyone is so impressed
First Testament was really great
The sequel was incredible
Like the Godfathers or the first two Strokes
Every document's indelible
Infidels and Heartbreak Beats
Smidges of bad ecstasy
I must have left it in my pocket
With my Christianity in my rocket
I'm binging hard on Annette Bening

If the sadness of life makes you tired
And the failures of man make you sigh
You can look to the time soon arriving
When this noble experiment
Winds down and calls it a day
My shadow's getting shorter
I'm a child at the border
There isn't anybody else left to love us
I wanted you when I was a child
I raked the leaves and I started fires
Now I'm reading whatever you give me
It's half your fault so half forgive me
I'm way behind in reflex math
Biphasic sleepless emotional crashes
I always wake up way before the weather
My mother needs an army
But I'm leaving home and I'm scared that I won't
Have the balls to punch a Nazi
I am not in Kansas
Take me for a walk and blame this on the water dripping off the spear
I read whatever it is you give me
It's half your fault so half forgive me
At the real Neil Armstrong taught me
To play cutthroat at my Aunt Angela's house
While my real dad's skate got caught in the ice
And he drove us home with a spiral fracture
It was then I was enlightened
Roberta Flack the whole way home
I was entirely unfrightened
Dozing off and eternally un-alone
The flowers cover over everything
They cover over everything
The flowers cover over everything
I am not in Kansas
Take me for a walk and blame this on the water dripping off the spear
Time has come now to stop being human
Time to find a new creature to be
Be a fish or a weed or a sparrow
For the Earth has grown tired and all of your time has expired
All the gardens are sprouting with flowers
All the treetops are bursting with birds
And the people all know that it's over
How I want you here
You don't know what it's like to be around you
I still got my fear
It’s the way you say yes when I ask you to marry me
You don't know what you are doing
Do you think you can carry me over this threshold
Over and over again into oblivion?
It's the way that you're gonna stop needing to tell me
You want me as much as I want you to tell me
I'm over the threshold
Everything is gonna be totally okay into oblivion
I still got my fear
I still got my fear
It's still always you every morning I think of no matter what
How I want you here
I know I am easy to find but you know it's never me

Walk-on's almost over
Teenagers on ice

Talkin’ of forgiveness

Underneath the lights
What was the worried thing you said to me?
I'll follow you everywhere
While you work the room

You were staring down the street 'cause you were trying not to crack up
It wasn't like a rain  it was more like a sea
I didn't ask for this pain  it just came over me
All the waters coming up so fast  it's frightening
Am I the one you think about

I was staring down the street 'cause I was trying not to crack
I was solid gold  I was in the fight
I was coming back from what seemed like a ruin
I couldn't see you coming so far
I just turn around and there you are
I'm so surprised you want to dance with me now
I was just getting used to living life without you around
I'm so surprised you want to dance with me now
You always said I held you way too high off the ground
You didn't see me  I was falling apart
I was a white girl in a crowd of white girls in the park
You didn't see me  I was falling apart
I was a television version of a person with a broken heart

I don't listen to anything now
Nothing to do with us
I'm just so tired of thinking about everything
I'm not afraid of being alone
I just don't know what to do with my time
But I'm learning to lie here in the quiet light
While I watch the sky go from black to grey
Learning how not to die inside a little every time
I think about you and wonder if you are awake
You don't know anything
I think about you way more than anything else
I'm not that spiritual I still go out all the time to department stores
Between you and me I still fall apart at the thought of your voice
But I'm learning to lie here in the quiet light
While I watch the sky go from black to grey
Learning how not to die inside a little every time
I think about you and wonder if you are awake
And I'm learning to live without the heartache it gives me
Nothing I wouldn't do for another few minutes
Learning how not to cry every time there's another sad unbearable morning
But sometimes there's nothing I can do

You remind me of everyone
Rylan  did you break your mother's heart?
Every time you tried to play your part
Is it easy to keep so quiet?
Everybody loves a quiet child
Underwater  you're almost free
If you wanna be alone  come with me
Rylan  we can take the quick way out
We can turn blank white in a blank white house
Say that you're a pervert  you're a vulture
Don't you wanna be popular culture?
Is it easy to keep so quiet?
Everybody loves a quiet child
Underwater  you're almost free
If you wanna be alone  come with me
Is it easy to live inside yourself?
All the little kids are high and hazy
Everybody's got nowhere to go

I wanna hurry home to you
Put on a slow  dumb show for you
And crack you up
So you can put a blue ribbon on my brain
I'll overdo it
Looking for somewhere to stand and stay
I leaned on the wall and the wall leaned away
Can I get a minute of not being nervous
And not thinking of my dick?
My leg is sparkles  my leg is pins
I better get my shit together  better gather my shit in

From one side of it to the other

To meet you at The Alcott
I'd go to the corner in the back
Where you'd always be
With your golden notebook
Writin' something about someone
Who used to be me
And the last thing you wanted
Is the first thing I do
I tell you my problems
You tell me the truth
It's the last thing you wanted
It's the first thing I do
I tell you that I think I'm fallin'
Back in love with you
I sit there silently
Waitin' for you to look up (Ah)

When you see it's me
I had to do something
To break into your golden thinking (Ah)
How many times will I do this
And you'll still believe? (Ah)

It's just a feeling in my mind
What was it you always said?
We're connected by a thread
If we're ever far apart
I'll still feel the pull of you
I'm either at the bottom of a well or spinning into somebody's outdoor glass furniture
Is this how I lose it? Everything at once? Carried to space by a dolphin balloon?
Maybe we'll end up the ones eating chocolate chip pancakes next to a charity swimming pool
The next time I see you will probably be in some pool or upscale tropical funeral
I dream that's what Nina Simone said to her lover John when he left
Maybe we'll talk it out inside a car
With rain falling around us
We all know this rain is hard to take
I know I can get attached and then unattached
To my own versions of others
My view of you comes back and drops away
It's just that I’m still here and there's still everything you don't know
You don't know how I need you
You got me all wrong
You can take me
There's no difference between you and me
Tell me what you would say if I said that to you
Don't let me get in the way of you finding everything

The proud lord said
That I must bow so low
Only a cat of a different coat
That's all the truth I know
In a coat of gold or a coat of red
A lion still has claws
As long and sharp as yours
That lord of Castamere
But now the rains weep o'er his hall
With no one there to hear

I didn't even think you were listening
I wasn't ready at all
To say anything about anything interesting
It's a thing you have
You just don't know that you do it
You wait around in a conversation
While I get in and start stumbling through it
I was so distracted then
I didn't have it straight in my head
I didn't have my face on yet or the role or the feel
Of where I was going with it all
I was suffering more than I let on
The tropic morning news was on
There's nothing stopping me now
From saying all the painful parts out loud
Got to my feet
Feeling that I'd let you down
Wanted to say it slow and perfect
But it all somehow got switched around
Something went off on its own
It's not what I meant to say at all

Making ocean sounds

I wore it on the island of my head
I had only one thing to do and I couldn't do it yet
You felt like heaven stood up in you
You said love fills you out
It moves you from the skeleton and pulls you around
I got it worse than anyone else
And I just can't find a way to forgive myself
I had only one thing left and I couldn't see it yet
I have owed it to my heart  every word I've said
You have no idea how hard I died when you left
If I yield to my trances  will I get up close again?
I had only one thing to do and I couldn't do it yet
I had only one thing left and I couldn't see it yet
You had your soul with you  I was in no mood"
