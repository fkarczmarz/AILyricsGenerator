lyrics
"I played the dial tone that changed your mind
I was the information in disguise
I'd love to tell you about yourself
I know  I know you're leaving
I hope  I hope we keep on dreaming
Thinkin' it's a damn shame to let it go
(Already gone)
I want to feel your love
And it's such a damn shame to let it go
(Already gone)
We could've lived together as one
I keep on blinking the last of my light  light
As my connection fades  I close my eyes
Still I will sing the song you hear at night
Keep you remembering me
I know  I know nobody's sleeping

I want to feel your love
And it's such a damn shame to let it go

We could've lived together as one
I let you down  down
I need attention
Imagination works
For better or for worse
Thinkin' it's a damn shame to let it go
(Already gone)
I want to feel your love
And it's such a damn shame to let it go

 you're wonderful
 we've made a mistake
I've been drinking wine
And I just made a big mistake
Happens all the time
Slay me
Come out from the dark
Sold my soul to television
Different kind of art
We'll be okay
We've got the time
Found the perfect crime
You don't need to know what everybody's thinking
Looking back at yourself
Fighter pilot vision
Outside the line
I'll apologize for everything later
I'm addicted to you
And I make bad decisions

Lately
Think I've had enough
But I can't turn it off
Why you look so sad?
Where's the sense in that?
We'll be okay
We've got the time
Found the perfect crime
You don't need to know what everybody's thinking
Looking back at yourself
Fighter pilot vision
Outside the line
I'll apologize for everything later
I'm addicted to you
And I make bad decisions

You don't need to know what everybody's thinking
Looking back at yourself
Fighter pilot vision
Outside the line
I'll apologize for everything later
I'm addicted to you
Something more
When you show
I follow
A beacon that is calling me
The light that never dies
Reflections thrown above the sea
Cast shadows in the sky
Standing right in front of you
Is where I need to be
Reliving this as something new
And something finally
Take the deep end
And swim 'til you can stand
'Cause it will make a difference in the end
Trip the shutter
And keep the picture close
Save it until you need it the most
I'm coming home
I'm coming home
I'm coming home
It's so much colder
But it was no surprise
Did you ever get to know me?
'Cause it has never been so plain to see
And when you say you won't forget me
Well I can tell you that's untrue
'Cause every day since you left me
I thought less and less of you
And I've worn out all the reasons
To keep on knocking at your door
Could be the changing of the seasons
But I don't love you anymore
The door is open  you whispered to me
As you stood frozen in deep uncertainty
I hope that you know what I am thinking
Before you go with your heart sinking
And when you say you won't forget me
Well I can tell you that's untrue
'Cause every day since you left me
I thought less and less of you
And I've worn out all the reasons
To keep on knocking at your door
Could be the changing of the seasons
But I don't love you anymore  anymore
Anymore

Look past the blinding light  look past the blinding light

Tells the world that you're thinking of what to do
A window opens up and someone calls your name
But I can tell you don't know how to play this game
I know this isn't it (Ooh-ooh  ooh-ooh)
You'll hit your target someday (Ooh-ooh  ooh-ooh)
So now you're on your own
Won't you come back home?
To see you're not that kind
And find the strength to find the strength to find another way
To find another way
To find another way
To find another way
So tell me what you need and I'll accommodate
But if too long goes by  you just might be too late
An opportunity you can't afford to waste
So have the lines in your head first  for heaven's sake
You hear the day beckoning (Ooh-ooh  ooh-ooh)
Know that it's all in your head (Ooh-ooh  ooh-ooh)

Before it gets started
And I believe this costume party is over
And I believe this costume party is over
Before it gets started

I got myself real pretty  I fixed up my hair
And when that dancehall's set to break
I wanna leave with the best I know
When that anger takes its shape
I will be leaving the best in show
Give me your time  I'll give you plenty of mine
Or give me something to burn  I'm tired of waiting my turn
Anything you wanna try
The sky is fallin'  so pull up a chair
Everyone's watchin'  but nobody cares
The queen of fashion  ahead of her time
Whatever happens  the pleasure is mine
I'm picking up the pieces of that stained glass pane
And as my speed increases  I strip off my shame
I slip the hook right off the bait
I'm a machine running self-control
Got a tongue that doesn't quite translate
Lickin' somebody else's bowl

Whatever happens to fall past my head
If I could begin to understand that
What I miss is what I wanted (Is it true?)
The curtain call  the spotlight fades into a dream
I had a couple nights ago (And that was you)
A plastic doll  the silver lining to my pillowcase
What a show
I think I'm out of luck again
Sympathy callin' out my name
I keep my distance from the sparks and gasoline
I'd start a fire all the same
Was it me or was it someone else
Dressed in my skin  havin' fun? (I am)

Of what I've done

I'm a healer  I'm a fixer
I'm a present danger to my health
I'm so strong
Doing what I'm supposed to do
There's something wrong
With somebody like me
I've been here before  the warning
It opens up the door
And now I'm falling
Why did I let it go?
Why did I leave myself?
No explanation as to why I'm here and not somewhere else
It's reaping what I sow
I think I need some help
I wanna let you in and I'll begin
One for science
One for Krishna
One for luck and one more for the road
I've been trying to find an answer
That I'm certain I will never know
I won't depend on something supernatural
I won't pretend that it's gotta be right for me

While sleeping in my bed
A field of lavender beneath my head
No user interface
It won't escape me again
And if I sleep tonight
The cosmic radiation
I won't complain
Maybe I can find the right frequency and station
I might just stay
Don't wake up
I'll be here for centuries
Sweet magnetic energy
Nothing quite like this ever has existed
But God knows how I missed it
Gravity is losing its hold
Ho-oh-oh-old
I can feel it fading

I wouldn't act your age
With no cloud in sight
We had predicted rain
Eyes down to your nose
Ask how my day has been
You don't wait for me
I'm working late again
It was so nice to see you
You haven't changed at all
Down to the letter
I was a boy  I was a boy
How is it always the same?
It's okay  I'm fine
I wait for something to change

We've all been around
To turn out  wait there
Back to the easy life
Who's in on the joke?
Can't see the funny side
Same time next week
I'll be a different guy
It was so nice to see you
Don't be a stranger now
You've got my number
Give me a call  give me a call
How is it always the same?
It's okay  I'm fine
I wait for something to change
I'm over the line
(I'm over the line)
Why is it always a game?
There's no win  no pride
Wait for attention to fade
It's a cheap design
(I'm over the line)
I work them missteps and leave 'em in
I'm a Hordak  be my Evil-Lyn
Fade to black and the dream begins
I left my prison without a sound
Ball and chain weigh a thousand pounds
Mean no harm  we can pal around
At least 'til the ref call out of bounds
I don't need the playbook  I wrote one
I know this game is a cold one
Who can say? I guess we both won
Hold up  I know something that's more fun
Paid up  working the angles
Play moth and see what the flames do
Or break off and see when it came true
I break all the rules then blame you
Both went home with the NK
It's two different homes with the same tape
It's two different heads in the same space
Ultimate test of your game face
How is it always the same?
It's okay  I'm fine
I wait for something to change
I'm over the line
(I'm over the line)
Why is it always a game?
There's no win  no pride
Wait for attention to fade
It's a cheap design
Any way to grow up and stay young
You're getting stuck with papers and the magazines
It's just your luck  the strangers living out your dream
Once in a lifetime
You give it away soon as you found it
Another day  another breaking wave
Can't live without it
Company  a shadow playing on the wall
And suddenly  you don't miss it at all
You're keeping up  soon  you're gonna be a star
And that's enough to know for certain who you are
Once in a lifetime
You give it away soon as you found it
Another day  another breaking wave
Can't live without it
Another breaking wave

Some folks sighed relief
Others cried
For the man
Who'd been stripped of his pride
And I remember his face
Felt the sadness
Replacing the grace
The taste is still on my lips
Losing grip my finger tips the cigarette
And I'm a sucker for feeling this way

Since you climbing out the walls
I would let you go
