" that's Kodak
 you know that
 you know that
 you know that
 man this shit real crazy
 still nodding off 'cause a nigga too faded
 money is my motivation
 one hunnid
 it's one hunnid
 it's so dirty
 they was lurking
 man this shit real crazy
 still nodding off 'cause a nigga too faded
 money is my motivation
 baby
 we'll still do it
 I jump on a plane
 I live for this
 man this shit real crazy
 still nodding off 'cause a nigga too faded
I woke up feeling like fucking up some paper
Gotta just check out these clarity
I get so fly like a parachute
I pull up right now and embarrass you
I sold the crack on my avenue
Only the strong survive
I'm just enjoying my life

I ran it up with the same niggas
Get that money and stay with the same niggas
I know that money can change niggas
They don't look at you like you the same nigga
I just hope I can remain humble
I'm 'bout to cut off some niggas I know that ain't with me
Runnin' with niggas that wanna see niggas
That get it and niggas who strive
I knew there'd come a time when we'd all be here
Future Hendrix
It's red bottoms when you walk to me
Come here and talk to me
Yeah (8-8-8-8-808 Mafia)
Pour that bubbly
(8-8-8-8-808 Mafia)
Pour that bubbly
I'm drinking bubbly
I'm drinking bubbly (Yeah)
I corrupted your town with them guns and them pounds
I grew up on the grounds with them dealers and hounds
We order more bottles and fuck on more models and pass 'em around
I say everything triple time
I just know the ones you call upon
I just had to pay my dawg a bond
Looking at me like a triple threat
Smoke the kush up like a cigarette

Celebrating like the championship
Celebrating like the championship
Celebrate like the championship
Celebrate like the championship
Don't tell me you celibate to the mula
I just went Rick the Ruler with the jeweler
I just went St. Tropez-in' like a goonie
I'm so fucking sick and tired of these rumors
Take it back and take a look at yourself
Too many days gone by
I could never see a tear fallin'
Water drippin' on me like a faucet
I just took a bitch to eat at Chipotle
Spent another sixty thousand on a Rollie
All my diamonds got you brainwashed
See what they did to Biggie and Pac
All this motherfucking money got me codeine crazy
Diamond pinky ring a lollipop
Diamonds colder than a glacier
Ballin' harder than the Pacers
I been tryin' to have some patience
Told my mama she should pray on it
Told the streets they gotta wait on it
She gon' put a nigga name on it
I just dropped a whole thang on it
I'm making USD's overseas
That's U.S. dollars that you can't achieve
I forgot her name but her pussy soakin'
When I seen her on the pole
Reminded myself when I used to come over
Reminded myself when I used to get loaded
Remindin' myself that I'm still gettin' loaded
I try to control it
Married to this motherfuckin' money
All this motherfucking money got me codeine crazy
You thought I forgot about us?
I know that you know I don't fold under pressure
We live by the codes of the ghetto
I'm closing this out with my memo
I'm treating this shit like a demo
I'm putting my heart and my soul in this shit and some more
I'm in that Dolce Gabbana
I might get after Madonna
I get it crack in the summer
Strapped in the 'Lac and the Hummer
Fronted a pack to my partner
All this lingo got her panties to dropping
All this cash and it ain't nowhere to hide it
I'm an addict and I can't even hide it
They was tryna serve me at the arraignment
I'm taking everything that come with these millions
I'm taking everything that come with my children
Pour that bubbly
I'm drinking bubbly
 baby!
 but he make moves
 now a nigga gotta shame you
 I be rockin' all my chains too
 Boy I think the money's startin' to change you
 Lord save you
 know a nigga never take two
 so I turned to a star

(Bringin' tears to my eyes)
Made it out the trenches  it got harder for my niggas
I just wanna see my dawgs ball  seven figures
I done got rich and it cursed me
Ever since I got successful  they envy
Tryna shake the devil  on promethazine
Tryna show you love but you don't feel me
Gave up on me so you turned your back
I can see the demons 'cause a nigga been blessed
I can tell you worried  but a nigga been in debt
I can't get caught up inside the matter
I should've did better  but it's chatter
I ran up my money off the gravel
Love is just a word  it don't matter to me
I got so rich  nothing matters to me
I'm livin' my second life  it's so amazin'
I done been hit with a bullet  and one grazed me
I done been considered a failure  it don't faze me
I done came up out the ghetto  my crib gated
Same niggas played with the devil  these niggas hatin'
All these bitches fuck with no rubbers  this shit brazy
Icy-ed out the Hublot  these niggas lookin' fugazi (Yeah)
Money stack tall past the ceilin'  I can't be jaded
I done came from sleepin' on floors  you can't persuade me (Yeah)
I been takin' other niggas' hoes  it's gettin' outrageous (True story)
Rich nigga gettin' caught with a bitch worth minimum wages (Pluto)
Fuckin' with my ego  but I never lost a lady (Facts)
Fucked a pop star after I got my dreads braided
Never dropped her name but her head game contagious (No cap)

You can feel the pain when I'm rappin' 'cause I'm ragin' (Wizard)
You can see my past and where I was on they faces (Weak)
I done flipped the truck over and crashed  ducked the agents (Facts)
I been with these blue hundreds like a nigga racist (Freebandz)
I been gettin' richer each year  feel like I'm racin' (Gone)
Tried to tell you the formula but you wouldn't take it
Hard work and perseverance  they ain't related (Ain't related)
Poppin' up on Forbes is fuckin' up my relations (Fuckin' up my family)
Ten milli' plus on a crib and it's vacant (Woo)
I can see it vividly at the crib  Rico basement  (Woo)
Watch him get the mula  I was sittin' back bein' patient (I was bein' patient)
Thinkin' 'bout when I was posted up when they raided (Swear I was)
Now I Double R and Ghost it up  I feel spacious (Woo)
I don't feel the safest  but I feel gracious (Yeah)
I thank God every day  I don't feel basic
Probably lose my sanity if I ain't have my babies (Sheesh)
Probably be gamblin' with my life if I ain't made it
Home invasions  and you ain't have to persuade me (Nah)
Cut it with a razor and serve it 'til your day
Came from whippin' out the bowl  Tom Ford suit and tie (Yeah)

I'm lookin' for 'er
I'm lookin' for 'er
Is that her in the VIP-line
With the Vuitton and Yves Saint Laurent
Used to drive a Nissan now she in a Bimmer
I don't want 'er cause she from the corner
And I heard that Bimmer was a loaner
And don't even drink Corona's
What type of drink you want bruh
On champagne forever
On dirty sprite forever
You can come sip with me
If you'd like to change the weather
If you wanna live better
I wanna tell the world about you just so they can get jealous
And if you see 'er 'fore I do tell 'er I wish that I've met 'er
Turn on the lights
I'm lookin' for 'er too
I heard she ain't gon' cheat and she gon' never make no move
Turn on the lights
I’m lookin' for 'er

Send 'er my way
Tell 'er I've been lookin' for 'er in the broad day
Hangin' with the dope boys in the hallways
Turn on the lights
I'm lookin' for 'er too
I heard she got a pretty face and stand up like a stallion
I wanna be the one to find out if I go to prowlin'
And when we get together we make magic and it’s ours
Turn on the lights
I'm lookin' for 'er too
I heard she ain't gon' cheat and she gon' never make no move
Turn on the lights
I’m lookin' for 'er

She a hood girl
But she a good girl
She been mislead
Now she ready for the world
I want your energy
To take control of me
I've tried to go to sleep
And seen 'er in my dreams
Just in case I run across her today I'ma stay clean
And tell 'er I’ve been lookin' for 'er with a flashlight
You can't tell a nigga nothin' because I got my cash right
And tell 'er if she honest I promise to stay true
Turn on the lights
I'm lookin' for 'er too
I heard she ain't gon' cheat and she gon' never make no move
