"Pretty woman walking down the street
Pretty woman
No one could look as good as you
Mercy
Pretty woman
Are you lonely just like me?
Arrrrwww
What do I see?
She's walking back to me
All about your disease
But I got somethin' you need
Oh  yeah!
Ain't talkin' 'bout love
My love is rotten to the core
Ain't talkin' 'bout love
Just like I told you before
Yeah  before
You know you're semi-good lookin'
And on the streets again
You better find yourself a friend  my friend
Ain't talkin' 'bout love
My love is rotten to the core
Ain't gonna talk about love
Just like I told you before

Ain't talkin' 'bout love
Babe  it's rotten to the core
Ain't talkin' bout love
Just like I told you before
Uh  before
I've been to the edge
And there I stood and looked down
You know I lost a lot of friends there  baby
I got no time to mess around
Ain't talkin' 'bout love
My love is rotten to the core
Ain't talkin' 'bout love
Just like I told you before
Before  before
Ain't talkin' 'bout love
Don't wanna talk about love
Don't need to talk about love
Ain't gonna talk about love
 yeah! Get up!
 they say it's kinda fright'nin' how this younger generation swings
 it's more than just some new sensation
 it's more than just an aggravation
 the cradle will rock
 rock on!
 they try and drum him out of town
 and he's unemployed
 rock on!
 they try and drum him out of town
 boy
 the cradle will rock
 rock on!
 rock on!
A child of the storm  whoa yes
I can't remember when I was your age
Nobody rules these streets at night but me
The atomic punk!
Whoa yeah  wow
I am the ruler of these nether worlds
The underground  whoa yes
On every wall and place my fearsome name is heard
Just look around  whoa yes
Nobody rules these streets at night but me
The atomic punk!
(Ooo  Ahhh)
I am the ruler of these nether worlds
On every wall and place my fearsome name is heard
Look around  whoa yeah

Creature from the sea with the looks to me
Like she'd like to fool around

Gonna keep a pappy happy

It's not enough to fill me up
I need more than just words can say
This can be everything we've dreamed

We can have the best of both worlds
We can push with all our might  but nothing's gonna come
Oh no  nothing's gonna change
I wanna hold you and say
We can't throw this all away
Tell me you won't go  you won't go
Do you have to hear me say
I can't stop lovin' you
And no matter what I say or do
You know my heart is true  oh
I can't stop lovin' you

And I see the same old faces and I hear that same old talk
And I'm searching for the latest thing  a break in this routine
I'm talkin' some new kicks  ones like you ain't never seen
This is home  this is Mean Street
And we don't worry 'bout tomorrow
'Cause we're sick of these four walls
Now what ya think is nothing

She looks so fuckin' good  so sexy and so frail
Something got the bite on me  I'm goin' straight to hell

And I don't care where I'm goin'
Here's to your thin red line
Thought you'd never miss me till I got a fat city address
Blue-eyed murder in a size five dress
This is my chance to fly
Maybe enough ain't enough for you
But it's my turn at a try

Woo hoo! Take a look at this!
Woo-whee! You'll get some leg tonight for sure!
Tell us how you do! Hoo hoo hoo!
Something to fill in the holes
We think a lot but don't talk much about it
How do I know when it's love?
I can't tell you but it lasts forever
It's just something you feel together
When it's love
You look at every face in a crowd
Some shine and some keep you guessing
Waiting for someone to come into focus
Teach you your final love lesson
How do I know when it's love?
I can't tell you but it lasts forever

That funny feeling again
Winding me up inside
Every time we touch
Hey  I don't know
Oh  tell me where to begin
'Cause I never ever
Felt so much
Hey
And I can't recall
Any love at all
It's got what it takes
So tell me why can't this be love?
Straight from my heart
Oh  tell me why can't this be love?
I tell myself
Hey  only fools rush in
Only time will tell if we stand the test of time
All I know
You've got to run to win
And I'll be damned if I'll get
Hung up on the line  hey

Unless your love is tried and true
We take a chance with new beginnings
Still we try
Win or lose
Take the highs
With the blues
Always one more
You're never satisfied
Share one for all with you
It's only one for me
And meet you half the way
And you don't know what that means
I feel like a running politician
I'm giving you my share with no condition

Everything turns out all right
