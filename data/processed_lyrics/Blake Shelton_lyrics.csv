lyrics
"Or the guy with a guitar singing on a country track
I might be the guy with an ice cold can
Stirring up dust on some old farmland
When I walk into the party with you girl  you change all that
And I’m just the guy with the girl everybody wants to know
Wishin' you were there alone
Wonderin' how I ever got your little hand in mine
Lookin' over at ya like  Ain’t she beautiful?
I’m invisible  but I stand right there and smile
You're right beside me  oh and I see the same thing they’re seein'
It's funny watchin' 'em do the way they do
They come walkin' up to me but they only wanna talk to you
And I don't blame 'em that they're hypnotized
They keep staring at your heartbreak eyes
It's like their heart starts stoppin' when you come walkin' into the room
And I turn into the guy with the girl everybody wants to know
Wishin' you were there alone
Wonderin' how I ever got your little hand in mine
Lookin' over at ya like  Ain’t she beautiful?
I’m invisible  but I stand right there and smile
You're right beside me  oh and I see the same thing they’re seein'
But  I don’t mind being the guy with the girl

Wonderin' how I ever got your little hand in mine
Lookin' over at ya like ain’t she beautiful?
You're right beside me  oh and I see the same thing they’re seein'
But  I don’t mind being the guy with the girl (Guy with the girl)
No  I don't mind being the guy with the girl (Guy with the girl)
Yeah  I'm just the guy with the girl
I'm always the guy with the girl
I don't mind it  baby
I don't mind it  baby
No bouncer looking like a wannabe Vin Diesel
Don't need your friends all getting jealous
Watching you walk in looking so good that you could sell it
Uh-uh  not again
Girl  let's get this party started
Where the party always ends
Got a yellow backdoor porch party light
Got a speaker in the window playing Barry White
You and me out here swaying  stargazing
Gonna bring it back in  break the candles out
Get the mood turned on and the lights out
Lose a little something black and lacy in the couch
At the house
At the house
Yeah  that's what it's all about
Don't need no plans (nope)  no reservations (uh-uh)
Go ahead and get your freak on  ain't nobody gonna stop us

 boy
 this is Austin
I see you walking 'round inside of my head
Looking up at the sky shining brighter than a single sunrise
It's ever burned red
Rolling in the warm sunshine
I'm giving you the rest of my life
'Cause we got the fire tonight
And it makes me wanna dance with my baby
In the dead of the night
Just keep on moving and grooving 'til the daylight
I've been bragging about you
Don't you know I've been counting down the days?
Feeling just crazy enough to call up your old man

I'm giving you the rest of my life

Stealing these little sips
Doing our best to make the best of the worst of it
Keep playing them songs  keep singing along
Keep leaning it on in closer
Keep salting the rim  getting even with her and with him before the night is over
That first kiss was like a Colorado hit
We better keep on keeping it lit
'Til we can't remember  can't remember
What we came here to forget
Go ahead and check your phone  like I've been checking mine
Nobody's ex is texting for a rewind
Looks like it's just me and you
Falling in love just enough to get us through

Baby  baby
Spend the whole day hangin' with her
I might get fired but that's alright
I'm doin' what she likes
She likes it when I bring home fresh fajitas
And mix up a pitcher of margaritas
Catch a kind of buzz that lasts all night
Doin' what she likes
She likes hearin' how good she looks in them blue jeans
I like doin' what she likes
Like runnin' my fingers through her long hair
Lightin' watermelon candles upstairs
Lettin' them burn and holdin' her all night
I like doin' what she likes
She likes it when I get past second gear
Sees gravel flyin' in the rearview mirror
Sometimes I'm pushin' 95
Doin' what she likes
And she likes it when I find a road that's dark
Can we pull up somewhere and park?
Turn the radio on and turn off the lights
Keep doin' what she likes

Kick off the Sunday shoes
My boots just couldn't walk another mile
And that cloud above me had no silver linin'
I couldn't buy a break with my last dime
I'da never thought that you would have my back
But then we rolled in like the thunder and the lightnin'
Threw some punches then we had a laugh
Just some roughed up desperados
Hangin' tough through thick and thin
Kickin' up dust wherever we go
I can see that you and me are gonna be friends
Who'da thought we'd wind up here together?
It's crazy that we're standin' side by side
Fighting just like two birds of a feather
Who's gonna tell us now that we can't fly?

Wonder if you're really gone this time
Just when I'm about to lose my mind
There you are again on my phone
The moon is rising and you're all alone
Maybe we could just hang a while
Maybe we can make each other smile
Why don't you go ahead and break my heart?
If moving on is what you wanna do
You can't tell me that we'll still be friends
And maybe someday we can try again
If you really need a brand new start

I've made a mess of me
The person that I've been lately
Ain’t who I want to be
But you stay here right beside me
Watch as the storm blows through
And I need you
'Cause God gave me you for the ups and downs
God gave me you for the days of doubt
And for when I think I've lost my way
God gave me you
Gave me you
There's more here than what we’re seeing
A divine conspiracy
Could somehow fall for me
You'll always be love's great martyr
And I'll be the flattered fool
And I need you

Strangers and Christmas lights
I shouldn't feel so alone
But I wanna go home

When I'm holdin' you tight
But I want to go home
And I've been keeping all the letters that I wrote to you
I would send them but I know that it's just not enough
My words were cold and flat and you deserve more than that
Let me go home

An' I'd heard about him... I heard she found him right around when we said goodbye
And I came real close and almost lost my temper
But I bit my tongue  kept my cool  'cause I remembered
I don't care  she don't matter
I don't love her anymore  he can have her
I don't know why it slips my mind  I tell myself all the time
Guess I forgot again  for a second there  that I don't care
Almost 10:00... should've known his car would still be parked in her drive
Almost pulled in... knocked on her door and gave her a piece of my mind
Oh  but I just kept on drivin' back to my place
Wonderin' why I went so far out of my way  when...
I don't care  she don't matter
I don't love her anymore  he can have her
I don't know why it slips my mind  I tell myself all the time
Guess I forgot again  for a second there  that I don't care
I got home the light was blinkin' on that old machine

I still care  she's all that matters
I still love her just like always  gotta have her
I never got her off my mind  been hopin' she would call sometime
I know it's late  to be drivin' over there  but I don't care
She said hey it's me
I know it feels like forever
Since I've heard your voice
But I guess that's how it had to be
So we talked awhile
But before we hung up she said
There's something you need to know
I found someone
It just happened outta the blue
Even though I'm moving on
It don't mean that I don't still love you
You'll always have
A place here in my heart
But somewhere in this new life I've begun
I found someone
Well I wasn't surprised
It's hard to believe a little space and time
Could turn into miles and worlds apart
I said I'm happy for you
You deserve the very best
Since you've been gone
I've done some praying
Some searching for myself

Or who I dreamed it'd be

I found someone
Just happened out of the blue
And it took everything I had
It took me losing you
But you'll always have
A place here in my heart
But somewhere in this new life I've begun
Looking for my place under the sun
Flies found a hole in the old screen door
Granny said the dress that my sister wore
To church wasn't long enough
Mama poured grease in a Crisco can
Put a hundred thousand miles on a Sears box fan
Uncle Joe put tobacco on my hand
Where them yellow jackets torn me up
And I ain't making this up
You might not understand
That made me who I am
You wouldn't know to love it like I love it
Granddaddy smoked Salems with the windows up
Drove me around in the back of that truck
We drank from the hose and spit in the cup
We all survived somehow
Them ol' Duke boys were flattening the hills
Wouldn't dream of spending that two dollar bill
From pushing a lawn mower around
I'd go back there right now

And it cost me ninety nine
On a prison farm in Georgia
Close to the Florida line
Well  I'd been here for two long years
I finally made the warden my friend
And so he sentenced me to a life of ease
Taking care of Ol' Red
Now Ol' Red he's the damnedest dog that I've ever seen
Got a nose that can smell a two-day trail
He's a four-legged trackin' machine
You can consider yourself mighty lucky
To get past the gators and the quicksand beds
But all these years that I've been here
Ain't nobody got past Red
And the warden sang
Come on somebody
Why don't you run?

And I'd take Ol' Red for his evenin' run
I'd just drop him off and wait

His lady every night
And so I kept him away for three or four days
And waited till the time got right
Well  I made my run with the evenin' sun
And I smiled when I heard them let Red out
'Cause I was headed north to Tennessee
And Ol' Red was headed south

Singing Margaritaville and minding my own

Pulled up beside me talking on his cell phone
He started yelling at me like I did something wrong
He flipped me the bird and then he was gone
There's a big umbrella casting shade over an empty chair
Palm trees are growing and a warm breezes a blowing
I picture myself right there
I circled the parking lot trying to find a spot
Just big enough I could park my old truck
A man with a big cigar was getting into his car
I stopped and I waited for him to back up
But from out of nowhere a Mercedes Benz
Came cruising up and whipped right in

Was rotten to the core
I was the youngest child
So I got by with more
I guess she was tired by
The time I came along
She'd laugh until she cried
I could do no wrong
She would always save me
Because I was her baby
I worked a factory in Ohio
A shrimp boat in the Bayou
I drove a truck in Birmingham
Turned 21 in Cincinnati
I called home to mom and daddy
I said Your boy is now a man
She said I don't care if you're 80

Said come on home to Louisiana
And come as fast as you can fly
Cause your mamma really needs you

So she could see her baby
She looked like she was sleeping
And my family had been weeping
By the time that I got to her side
And I knew that she'd been taken
And my heart it was breaking

And it gets worse
Nah  there ain't no in-between

Mm  that's what I'm talkin' about
And they can't get me off the karaoke machine
The more I drink
The more I drink
And lights are on display
There's a big old tree for all to see
Where the children run and play
I look out my window
Something just don't seem right
Till I said hello and heard her voice
On the other end of the line
Mama called and said it's time for me come on home
The pies are in the oven
You can almost taste the air
It warms my heart to feel her love
And know how much she cares
It's funny how going back can get you back to where you belong
It’s the difference between just a melody and my favorite Christmas song
Mama called and said it's time for you come on home
Burning through my veins
She don't know how to miss me
She hits right where she aims
Baby's got my number and she's calling me up
Knows what she's doing with a single touch
Pushing my buttons like it ain't no thing
The neon's buzzing when she pulls that string
Turning me on like it's her job
Knows how to set me on fire
She's always holding the match
And when my body's beside hers
There ain't no turning back
She's Revlon red in the blackest night
Lighting up the room in the world just like
Pushing my buttons like it ain't no thing
The neon's buzzing when she pulls that string
Turning me on like it's her job
Sometimes I think she must get off

She's the needle on the vinyl of a midnight song
Pushing my buttons like it ain't no thing
The neon's buzzing when she pulls that string
Turning me on like it's her job
Sometimes I think she must get off
Long before we finally did
But ever since that first kiss
Who are we to question
God and his greater plan?
You and me are a blessin'
And I know we can reach the stars
That's how far my love will go for you
I know we can reach the stars
You've already hung the moon
It isn't always sunny days
A little time and a little rain
That's what makes the flowers grow and
And put 'em in a mason jar
You know you amaze my heart
You saved my heart

Hold yourself together like a pair of bookends
But I've not tasted all your cooking
Who are you when I'm not looking?
Do you pour a little something on the rocks?
Slide down the hallway in your socks?
When you undress  do you leave a path?
Then sink to your nose in a bubble bath?
My oh my  you're so good-looking
Hold yourself together like a pair of bookends
But I've not tasted all your cooking
Who are you when I'm not looking?
I want to know
I want to know
I want to know
Do you break things when you get mad?
Eat a box of chocolates cause you're feeling bad?
Do you paint your toes cause you bite your nails?
Call up mamma when all else fails?

When the door is locked and the shades are down?
Do you listen to your music quietly?
And when it feels just right  are you thinking of me?
I want to know
I want to know
I want to know
My oh my  you're so good-looking
I been known to dance with the devil
So how'd I get up on your level?
You're an angel sent from heaven down to me
I'm rough around the edges
You're a snapshot of perfection
I was headed in the wrong direction
I was reckless
Now I've just got one question
Why me? You could have picked anybody
Why me? When I see you looking at me
To get to be the one you gave your heart to?
Walk up in a party on my arm
Who would've thought you would wanna wake up
Every day beside me
I remember night one
Looking around for the right one
And I walked over
Even though you were outta my league
You were diamonds in the sky
I was dirt on a plow
You're all-American pretty
I'm a one-horse town
First smile you gave me
I was thinking it then
And I'm still thinking it now

If I tried to tell 'em how we met tonight
They'd ask how many drinks I'd had
Cause ain't no way it  all went down that right
You waiting on somebody and they never did show
You walked up I said what are you doing with your beautiful self?
You rolled your eyes but you laughed and your song came on
I begged you for a dance and we danced
Then you just shook your head and laughed and said I guess I need a ride
Then come to find out your house was just a block from mine
Yeah this is one of those movie scene cool kinda things where the stars align
Just an hour ago...
You walked up I said what are you doing with your beautiful self?

You can’t make up a night like this
You can’t make up a story like that
It’s one of those
How in the world did it happen
Kind of things
I’d never believe it
If I didn’t see it girl
You walked up I said what are you doing with your beautiful self?
You rolled your eyes but you laughed and your song came on
I begged you for a dance and we danced
You can’t make up a night like this
You can’t make up a story like that"
