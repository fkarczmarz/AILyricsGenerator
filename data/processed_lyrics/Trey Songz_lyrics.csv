lyrics
"Bet the DJ bring it back
Tell him play that shit again
All the ballers poppin' bottles
I know it's somebody birthday
Catch me in the club like I own that bitch
Shawty dancin' like she on that dick
Bad bitches never hold back
I only came here for two reasons
I came for (Whatchu came for?)
I only came for the bitches and the drinks
You might also like
I see you tryin' to handcuff her on the street
Ain't nobody got a body like hers
Got a dark skinned girl dancin' on me
Two white girls dancin' on me
I only came here for two reasons
I came for (Whatchu came for?)
I only came for the bitches and the drinks
I hit the club and buy the bar
I only came for the bitches and the drinks
You need to know what I came for
Bitches and the drinks
I know you know what I came for
Houston where the girls all thick
Matter fact tell the whole GA
Shout to every ten I see when I'm down in Tennessee
I only came here for two reasons
I came for (No)
This your favorite song when they put it on
Girl  I know you know it's all about you
I ain't saying no names  but you know what I'm saying
I could tell it by the way that you move
Calling all the cuties to the floor right now
It's a lot of booty on the floor right now
Take it to the bus  we can go right now
We can roll right now  right now
It's some pretty titties on the bus right now
Tell the hotel we pulling up right now
Elevator up  take a ride right now
Baby  ride right now  right now
Got a room full of fly girls  got a thing for a shy girl
Don't you want to be my girl? It's all about you
Get up on it like you should  girl
'Cause I love it when a hood girl turn around and be a good girl
This your favorite song when they put it on
Girl  I know you know it's all about you

Every night in the club  tricking with a different girl
Thought I'd never fall in love  then I met you
Girl  you changed my mind
One look and just one touch
And I knew she was the girl for me  like no other I had seen
They say that I'm tripping  but I know what I want
She might be my lover
She makes me want no other
She don't care if I go to the strip club  she wanna go too
And I never met a girl like you that makes me want to settle down

 freaky thoughts
How should we start this?
I guess it's long overdue that we speak
I mean who ever thought we'd be here?
It's fair to say you did
And I know we did
What a motherfuckin' life we done lived
How can you love me after all these drugs?
I just dropped a bag in the club off of nothin'
I just did it all for the love of the stuntin'
If you wanna talk to 'em on the other side
Outchea we gon' have your name so alive
Only thing I wanna hear 'bout is the money mission
I just heard another song 'bout a nigga wrist flickin'
Shout out to the dope boys tryna get skrilla
Roll up 'cause we got the smoke
Get high whenever we want
Specially when I'm feelin' down
I got my niggas around
Thank God  my niggas around
Thank God that liquor around
Dive in that liquor and drown
All of my niggas have pounds
Big homies the shit in the town
I get you hittin' the town
Never forgettin' the town
I been the shit in the town
'Fore I was shit in your town
Hop out the whip when I get in your town
And I'm dickin' the prettiest hoes

Nigga more focused than some bifocal glasses
Niggas on my team with the dealing' and the trappin'
We just want the rings and the women with the fashion
I could switch it up 'cause a nigga got the rose gold
Got the stick in this bitch jumpin' like pogo
Money in the bag that's just a nigga roll though
Don't we do it all for the dough though?
Don't you wanna ball like a pro though?
Think about it all while I'm dolo
She sendin' videos and the photos
Bustin' wide in the wide body photo
I'm tryna tell niggas they should know though
I feel like when Hugh Hef was young
Move from the hills to the valley
No type of stylist can style me
Where do I go when we leave here?
How can you love me after all these drugs?
Don't we do it all for the dough though?
Think about it all while I'm dolo
Don't we do it all for the dough though?
(Yours truly)
Think about it all while I'm dolo

The worst pain that I ever had (Turn the lights on)
Would hurt this fuckin' bad
The worst pain that I ever had
All the times when I know I should be smilin'
Seem to be the time that I frown the most
Can't believe that we're still survivin'

And if I lose you  I'm afraid I would lose who
Who I gave my love to
That's the reason I stay around

Never be enough if it just
(Just me for u)
And now she questioning if it's real when I say 'I love you'
I guess it's hard to feel when I'm never even there
Actions speak louder than words and they say I don't care
But I know what's in my heart if you can hold it right now
You see it's only beating cause you hold a nigga down
I can't say it's right when I'm running through the night
You're my shining star can't afford to lose your light
Oh no
She deserves something better and she know she does
(she know she does)

Even though I'm in the streets fucking with these fucking freaks
I know you been so through with me
You put up with my foolery
I guess you got so use to me
And my infidelity
And through the bad you saw the better man in me
You picked me up every time they put me down
You try to leave me Imma tie you to the ground
Baby look what you've allowed (x3)
And I'll never found no nigga in my house
She deserves something better and she know she does
(she know she does)
But I'm never gonna let her...

She's a liar  she's a liar
Am I tripping? Am I bugging?
Is it over? Tell me something
You don't call me no more  who you fucking?
Tell me what it is  tell me what I did
Where you go? Are you coming home
Any time soon? Are you coming home
Any time soon? Don't do this to me baby
But I ain't really tripping if you ain't tryna come back
Fuck that  you can stay wherever you at
I'm sorry for talking crazy
Yes  no  maybe
I just wanna know  why you playing games with my heart?
Could've sworn that you swore  never change from the start
I'm sorry for talking crazy
Yes  no  maybe
I just wanna know  how you gon' try to out me?
Tell me where the fuck would you be without me?
I'm sorry for talking crazy
Yes  no  maybe
Don't do this to me  baby
Don't do this to me  baby
I just wanna know
Yes  no  maybe

I've been selfish  I can't help it
Whole lotta years  whole lotta tears
Bullshit that you dealt with
But you let me and you left me
I really think that I would've made you my girl some day
Oh  but how foolish am I to think that you'd have to wait?
Like you never had shit  like you ain't a bad bitch
That could get her ass kissed from a nigga mad rich
Getting lifted  tripping off dumb shit  you the only one that could make me cum quick
You know  please tell me I love you  please tell me
I hope  please tell me he fucked up too
Where you go? Are you coming home any time soon?
Are you coming home any time soon?
Don't do this to me  baby
But I ain't really tripping if you ain't tryna come back
Fuck that  you can stay wherever you at
I'm sorry for talking crazy
Yes  no  maybe
I just wanna know  why you playing games with my heart?
Could've sworn that you swore  never change from the start
I'm sorry for talking crazy
Yes  no  maybe
I just wanna know  how you gon' try to out me?
Tell me where the fuck would you be without me?
I'm sorry for talking crazy
Yes  no  maybe
Don't do this to me  baby
Don't do this to me  baby
I just wanna know
Yes  no
I just wanna know
Yes  no  maybe
Seems like I'm having delusions
This cannot be our conclusion
Started off saying I was done
But when you're in love with someone
You come running  running back
I'm running  running back
But I ain't really tripping if you ain't tryna come back
Fuck that  you can stay wherever you at
I'm sorry for talking crazy
Yes  no  maybe
I just wanna know  why you playing games with my heart?
Could've sworn that you swore  never change from the start
I'm sorry for talking crazy
Yes  no  maybe
I just wanna know  how you gon' try to out me?
Tell me where the fuck would you be without me?
I'm sorry for talking crazy
Yes  no  maybe
Don't do this to me  baby
Don't do this to me  baby
Yes  no  how the fuck you gon' leave me here tripping?
Don't do this to me  baby  I'm going crazy
Don't do this to me  baby
Yes  no  maybe"
