lyrics
" my sexy Mona Lisa
 or if you wanna stay
 but fall asleep at eight
 but you're perfectly
 I'm just ridin' the wave
 but I love you that way
 'cause you're not coin-based
 but you're perfectly
 I'm just ridin' the wave
I wish I didn't love you ever since the first date
Thought me and you together would end up on top
I never once thought you would be trifling
I was open before (Had me open before)
But now I know
All the lies you told were right in front of me
You made it look so perfect when it wasn't meant to be
Your love made me blind
I gave all of my trust
Didn't think being faithful was asking too much
I was fooled but fate let me see how
They say every tear has its reasons
Every smile has its own season
Never once thought you would be trifling

All the lies you told were right in front of me
You made it look so perfect when it wasn't meant to be
Love made me blind (Blind)
Your love made me blind (Blind)
Love made me blind (Blind)
Your love made me blind (Blind)
Thought the sweet smell of your perfume was all mine
Didn't know you were a beautiful liar
'Cause love made me blind
All the lies you told were right in front of me
You made it look so perfect when it wasn't meant to be
Your love made me blind (Blind)
Your love made me blind (Blind)
Your love made me blind (Blind)
Yeah  yeah
I only miss you when I'm breathing (uh)
I only need you when my heart is beating
You are the color that I'm bleeding (uh)
I only miss you when I'm breathing
This ain't no ordinary feeling
You are the only thing that I believe in
I know you're coming back to me  and
I will be waiting here for you 'til the end
I only miss you when I'm breathing (breathing)
I only miss you when I'm breathing (breathing)
Without your love  don't know how I survive
It's you  it's you that's keeping me alive
I only miss you when I'm breathing
Woo
Aye-aye-aye-aye-aye-aye-oh
Aye-aye-aye-aye-aye-aye-oh
Aye-aye-aye-aye-aye-aye-oh
I wanna see pictures of you leaning
On these four walls and on the ceiling
Gave you a kiss  but I'm dreaming
These crazy thoughts are so deceiving
You are the drug  I am feining
Paradise that I'm still seeking
I'm still alive  hope there's a reason
Can't move my lips  but my heart is screaming

De Colombia hasta Rusia saben lo que siento

El presentimiento de levantar la copa
Y gritar duro al viento Gol
Es nuestra pasión
Se siente la fiebre cuando tocan el balón
Gol  no digas que no
Lo gritamos fuerte desde el corazón
