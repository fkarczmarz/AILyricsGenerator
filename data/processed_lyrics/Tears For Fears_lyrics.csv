lyrics
"Soon we will be older
When we gonna make it work?
Too many people living in a secret world
While they play mothers and fathers
We play little boys and girls
When we gonna make it work?
It's only me and my shadows
And with the hounds at bay
I'll call your bluff
To walk on tiptoes every day
And when I think of you and all the love that's due
We've got the whole wide world in our hands

Advice for the young at heart
Soon we will be older
When we gonna make it work?
Once given
This could be our last chance
When we gonna make it work?
Working hour is over
And how it makes me weep
'Cause someone sent my soul to sleep
And when I think of you and all the love that's due
We've got the whole wide world in our hands
We've got the whole wide world in our hands
We've got the whole wide world in our hands (In our hands)
Advice for the young at heart
Soon we will be older
When we gonna make it work?
Advice for the young at heart
Soon we will be older
When we gonna make it work?
Working hour is over
We can do anything that we want
Anything that we feel like doing
Heard every word that was said that night
When the light of the world put the world to right
Well here's to the boys back in 628
Where an ear to the wall was a twist of fate
I will shine a blinding light
Through those hearts as black as night
Sticks and stones may break my bones
But at least the seeds of love will be sown
Now once in awhile when I feel no shame
I get down on my knees and I pray for rain
And though the breeze blows gently while I state my case
There'll be certain men waiting just to scratch my face
Hand on my heart I will make a stand
For the life and the times of the mirrorman
In my head there is a mirror
When I've been bad  I've been wrong
Food for the saints that are quick to judge me
Hope for a bad man  this is the bad man's song

Ooh  ooh  ooh
Ooh  ooh  ooh
Guilt in the frame of the looking-glass
Puts a shine on the mind where reflections pass
Where the jigsaw pieces of a broken man
Try and fit themselves together again
Lies in disguise in the name of trust
Put your head in the sand it will turn to dust
What's your problem? What's your curse?
Won't it make the matter worse?
In my head there is a mirror
When I've been bad  I've been wrong
Food for the saints that are quick to judge me
Hope for a bad man  this is the bad man's song
Ooh  ooh  ooh
Woah
Ooh  ooh  ooh
Uh-huh
Ooh  ooh  ooh
Woohoo
Ooh  ooh  ooh
And they say Faith can move mountains
Fire can cleanse your soul
Faith can move mountains
But mind over matter won't you stop all your chatter  no
Faith can move mountains
Faith can move mountains
But mind over matter won't you stop all your chatter  no
I heard every word that was said that night
When the light of the world put the world to right
When I hear soft whispers at the break of day
...
Sweet talking boys who can do no wrong
When the stories are tall as the day is long
With such a thin line drawn between friend and foe
Lord help me now and bless my soul
Look at yourself  see how you lie
Your hands start shaking and you don't know why
Look at yourself  see how you lie
Your hands start shaking  they start shaking
Look at yourself  see how you lie
Your hands start shaking and you don't know  don't know  don't know why
Look at yourself  see how you lie
Shake  shake  shake  you don't know why
Don't know why  no you don't know why
Well there's food for the saints that are quick to judge me
Hope for a bad man...
In my head  there is a mirror
When I've been bad  I've been wrong
I have been really  really  really wrong
Food for the saints that are quick to judge me
Food for the saints that are quick to judge me
Hope for a bad man  this here is the bad man's Song
In my head  there is a mirror
There is a mirror
When I've been bad  I've been wrong
And I've been bad  I have been really  really  really wrong
Food for the saints that are quick to judge me
Food for the saints that are so quick to judge me
Hope for a bad man
Break it down again
So those are my dreams
And these are my eyes
Stand tall like a man
Headstrong like a horse
When it's all mixed up
Better break it down
In the world of secrets
In the world of sound
(Ooh)
It's in the way you're always hiding from the light
Could show you something new about you and your inner song
And all the love and all the love in the world
Won't stop the rain from falling
Waste seeping underground (Break it down again)
I wanna break it down (Break it down again)
You might also like
Break it down again
So those are my schemes
And these are my plans
Hot tips for the boys
Fresh news from the force
When it's all mixed up
Better break it down
In the world of silence
In the world of sound
(Ooh)
They make no mention of the beauty of decay
And all the love and all the love in the world
Won't stop the rain from falling
Waste seeping underground (Break it down again)
I wanna break it down (Break it down again)
Horsin' around
Pray to the power
Play to the crowd with your big hit sound
Play to the crowd
It's in the way you're always hiding from the light
Fast off to heaven just like Moses on a motorbike
Could show you something new
To help with the ups and downs (Break it down again)
I wanna break it down (Break it down again)
Break it down again (Break it down again)
Break it down again
No more sleepy dreaming
No more building up
It is time to dissolve
Break it down it again
This is not who we are
This is where someone was meant to say
Enough is enough
This is nothing like they said it would be
This has all gone too far
When everything is running out
This is love
She's the fire and the fallout
She reminds you of the things we never talk about
She's the lover with the best-laid plan
To break the man
She's a sinner in a sideshow
She feels at home when there's nowhere left to go
She's the devil you understand
Break the man
No more tearing the bandages off
No more living a lie
No more chewing the scenery
No more holding your feet to the fire
When everything is running down
No more pain

No more holding your feet to the fire
When everything is running down

She reminds you of the things we never talk about
She's the lover with the best-laid plan
To break the man
She's the trouble in the headline
She's the mother who turns back Father Time
She's the devil you understand
I stop believing everything will be alright
I'm walking uphill being turned around and round
Secret in motion when my feet are on the ground
In my mind's eye
One little boy anger one little man
I just had to laugh
The face you wore was cool
You were a photograph
When it's all too late
It's all too late
I did not have the time
I did not have the nerve
To ask you how you feel
Is this what you deserve?
When it's all too late
It's all too late

Become the start of you?
When it's all too late

Frozen to the bone
You'd be better off alone
Time stood still with his fingers in his ears
Didn't want to hear it from another bunch of hollow men
My temperature's been rated and I'm cold
Bring to me my big old sweater
Nothing more will make me better
I met her on a Monday and my heart did nothing new
But floating on a magic carpet high above the earth
In the flood
Bigger than your hurt
Don't you know that love is work?
In the flood
King got caught with his fingers in the till
With my blood

 rough and tumble

 baby
Blew down all the walls and gave me life again
Turned the world around
Blinded me with sound
(And there's no other way)
Took my hand and led me through the labyrinth
Showed me all the sadness and the suffering
Tears she turned to joy
And through the wall of noise told me
No need to worry about the world (About the world)
You can't see the beauty for all the hurt (For all the hurt)
Turn the world around (Oh-oh-oh-oh)
Blind them with your sound
'Cause it's the end of night
Mistral came into my lifе like a wind of change
Crept in through my еyes and seeped inside my brain
When stars were growing dim
She showed me the world within and told me
No need to worry about the world (About the world)
You can't see the beauty for all the hurt (For all the hurt)
Turn the world around (Oh-oh-oh-oh)

Melt in your arms
As the day hits the night
We will sit by candlelight

We'll have nothing to gain
Just to stay this real life situation
For one last refrain
As the day hits the night
We will sit by candlelight
When the saints go marching in
But now you're laughing at the sun
With all your high class friends you think you've got it made
The only thing you made was that tanned look on your face
With all your cigarettes and fancy cars
You ain't a clue who or what you are
You're dreaming your life away
Fish out of water
Go swim in the tide today
Fish out of water
We used to sit and talk about primal scream
To exorcise our past was our adolescent dream
But now it's sink or swim since your memory fails
Now in Neptune's Kitchen you will be food for killer whales
And on the crucifix his mother made
Hangs one more martyr to the hit parade
You're dreaming your life away

With the strains of Be my Angel  of rock in two four
Time may keep alive that old swan song
That we've been playing forever
'Til the time may be right to say goodbye
My voice is aching
I'm tongue tired
And the sounds we are making are so...
Goodnight song  played so wrong
Get some honesty
Take the best of me and then the rest let go
In every situation with its tireless rage
Step outside the cage
And let the real fool show
I should have stayed 'round to break the ice
I thought about it once or twice
But nothing ever changes
Unless there's some pain

 yes we will be strong
 in the casino
Fighting my way through a whole lot of trouble
Too many people were talking without moving their mouths
About the lies that have stolen my thunder
In the haze of my mind all the wires were crossed
I love you but I'm lost
From a flame to the spark of an ember
To a fire on the fifth of November
We have strayed from the light
Now we count the dots
I love you but I'm lost
I love you but I'm lost
How you like to make them pay (how you like to make them pay)

In a dream at the edge of a river
Where we swam and I watched you shiver
Came to life in my arms and then turned to dust

Looking for blood at the scene of the crime
It's been running in circles or nothing at all
Boxing at shadows and listening at doors
Pushing the buttons and pulling the blinds
We haven't been honest or clever or sure
Funny how the heart of everyone
Is the part you'll never know
Funny how the heart of holding on
Is letting go
The higher the mountain  the harder the fall
Turning the cornеr and looking for signs
You leap in the dark while I wait for thе call
Out of the furnace and into the flames
Holding a candle and crossing the line
We haven't been playing with fire or rain

Lost between the Beatles and the Stones

You walk me through my future like some superman
Tell me things that God alone should know
But that's okay
Hear me now
'Cause things ain't working out
If my soul be damned
It's all part of the master plan
Fade away
Walk around in circles as the fire escapes

So much I'm losing me
I cannot see the reason for the pain
With hungry joy  I'll be your toy
Just hoping you will play
Without the hope my body starts to fail
Memories fade but the scars still linger
Goodbye  my friend
Will I ever love again?
Memories fade but the scars still linger
Woah  woah
I cannot grow  I cannot move
I cannot feel my age
The vice-like grip of tension holds me fast
Engulfed by you  what can I do
When history's my cage?
Look forward to a future in the past
Memories fade but the scars still linger
Goodbye  my friend
Will I ever love again?
Memories fade but the scars still linger
Woah  woah

I'll go down to Wheal Mexico
To the depths of the mine

When I'm wrinkled and wise
I will trade all my liberty

'Cause you know I cannot bear to see you
In this state of melancholy
Curled up in your chair
Please don't worry
'Cause the world won't break apart as easy
As the glass
You dropped and smashed
When you tried to climb the stairs
There was a time
Not long ago
You stood right by your window
And your arms were painted feather-like
So sure that you could fly
Dragging you in with the undertow
I still beliеve this love can grow

Like mussels in a shell
Rolling and controlling
All the basements and the back roads of our lives
Fill their dreams with big fast cars
Fill their heads with sand
Holy white we'll paint the town
The colour of our flag
Hey there little lady has your baby got the look of some old man?
Standing on the corner of the third world
Hungry men will close their minds
Ideas are not their food
Notions fall on stony ground
Where passions are subdued
Colour all the madness for the madness is the thorn that's in our side
Standing on the corner of the third world
Of the third world  of the third world

When there's no one there
He calls out in the night
And it's so unfair
At least it seems that way
When you gave him his life
And all this time it's been getting you down
You ought to pick him up when there's no one around
Cause he knows in his heart you won't be home soon
He's an only child in an only room
And he's dependant on you
And it seems so strange
That at the end of the day
Making love can be so good
But the pain of birth
What is it worth
When it don't turn out the way it should?
And all this time it's been getting you down

So grave those first born cries
When life begins with needles and pins
It ends with swords and knives
Your blade fits like a glove
When forged in steel time cannot heal

With the change in the way you look
And it's sad love's not enough to make things better
Lies beneath the visions and daydreams
