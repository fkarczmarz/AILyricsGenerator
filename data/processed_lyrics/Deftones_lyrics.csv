lyrics
"Don't be tree trunk  don't fall on my living roots
I've been humming too many words  got a weak self-esteem
That's been stomped away from every single dream
But it's something else that brought us fees
Keep it all inside 'til we feel we can't unleash
But I think that you made it up  I think that your mind is gone
I think you shouldn't have glorified  now you're wrong!
They fuck in my head!
You and me  out here alone
Face flat along the edge of the grass
But I'm not here to preach  I'm just sick of looks
My parents made me strong to look up that glass
So why should I try? Act like I'm a little pissed off
With all that shit that needs to stay back in the shell
Your punk ass made it up  now your fuckin' mind is gone
Should've never glorified  now you're right!

They fuck in my head!
Bitch  you don't know me
Shut up  you don't know me
Squeal like a pig when you
Pickpocket  big fuckin' head!
Well  I'll tell you about my blunt stack
What's coming back  Jack? We'll turn back
I'm thinking about something naughty and won't tell anybody
I'd like to think  for who I down this shit
I belong where they be
Because we cannot get back those lives
Resist to cease  understand?
God hates black shades and all the clergy
Mr. P.I.G.  could I fuckin' see?
Shorty done crushed all of my brothers' dignity
And to the jury  carry your turns on my skin this color
Does that mean I'm burnt?
'Cause your punk ass made it up  your fuckin' mind was gone
Should've never glorified  wrong!
They fuck in my head!
You've been staring away
Are you phased
Or are you thinking?
Crack a smile and wave
It doesn't scare me away
Hit the brakes
So I gaze in your eyes
And I wonder
Can you take me on?
Your haze that I'm under
Come wake me up soon
Take a bow and wave
As you're carried away
It was great
But I'm not leaving
Crack a smile and wave
It still doesn't scare me away
Hit the brakes

For a thousand days
We could get carried away
Are you in? Are you in?

(I'm anxious)
(And I feel like cruising with you)
So I gaze in your eyes
And I wonder
Can you take me on?
Your haze that I'm under
Come to wake
So I gaze (in your eyes)
This vial's empty  so are you
Hey  glamorous
This vial's not God anymore  yeah
Speak! I don't get it
Should I ignore the fashion or go by the book?
I don't want it
I just want your eyes fixated on me
Coming back
I'm coming back around the fur
Prostitute  climb back down
From the floor
Please don't fuck around
And die like this
'Cause I love her
Speak! I don't get it
Should I ignore the fashion or go by the book?
I don't want it
I just want your eyes fixated on me
Coming back
I'm coming back around the fur

 right back to school
 I sift through all the cliques
 making me sick
 I switch it up
 smokin' cigarettes and sippin' vodka
 ain't no one can stop us
 so
 all that quit
 now grab a notebook and a pen
 but I know we're not
 'cause really it's everything that you're not
 so why don't you run?
 so why don't you run?
 now I'm on the next page
 it's time to close the book up
 I'm on the next page
 close the book up now
 so why don't you run?

Put away all your teeth
And take us way underneath
Because you could die if you take it alone
I watch you taste it
I see your face
I know I'm alive
You're shooting stars
From the barrel of your eyes
And it drives me crazy
Just drives me wild
I kind of like you when  when you make up the reel
Take the phone in your room
Stop the tape or resume
Well you could try if you think it will load
I watch you taste it
I see your face
I know I'm alive

I looked away
You were on fire
And I watched a change in you
It's like you never had wings
Now you feel so alive
I've watched you change
I took you home
Set you on the glass

The waves suck you in and you drown
You?
You hang the anchors over my neck

The crazier I came
The waves suck you in then you drown

Fifteen stitches and a soft parody
To make my eyes be like deceit
Believe the sting proves heart to me
Now I know that you love me
Thank god that you love at all
Dislocated at the joint
Timing is everything in the bed
'Cause you'll sleep for hours to keep away
Then sink the teeth and bat your eyes
Now I know that you love me
Thank god that you love at all
What surprise right here
Going on and going off
What's the surprise right here

I'm her new  cool meat
She pops the trunk  and she removes me
And a machine takes pictures of us
Now my jaw and my teeth hurt
I'm choking from gnawing on the ball
And just before I come to
Move to the back of the car
She made me touch the machine
New murderer  fuck 'em
First  untie me
Untie me for now

Both sides of what I'm being told

Now I watch how wild it gets
I finally achieve
Approaching a delayed
I'm positive
There's no sense to what I'm being sold
Yet here I go
I watch how wild we get
How will you spend your time?
Climbing out of the ashes
Turning time inside out
We're miles beyond the sound
We'll start again
Taste a lifestyle that never gets old
Yet here we go
Just watch how wild it gets

I never said or got to say bye to my boy
But it's often I try  I think about
How I'd be screaming and the times we'd be bumping
Our minds would be flowin'
This has begun you seem to have some doubt
I feel you next to fiending  getting spacey
With the common love of music
Think of this as the sun and the mind as a tool
But we could bounce back from this one
With attitude  will and some spirit
With attitude  will and your spirit
We'll shove it aside
How can you live with that you fucking parasite?

Is what I believe
The slit in the sky when you left
Is all I see
Nothing to sing about
I've bared all my leaves
No vision or dreams about you
Came true for me
Cut through
This razor wire
And dine on your heart
Mine till the end
Stuck with illusion now
I drown in your sea
I hope that you'll first save yourself
And then come for me
Cut through
This razor wire
And dine on your heart
Mine till the end
Break through

Bound by voice

Don't look  but I want it

Here we are

And it's too late to cause a change in the tides
So we slip into our hopeless sea of regret as I stare
Through the haunted maze in your eyes
Right through where I'll remain for all time
And time won't change this
This promise we made
It's how it'll stay
We've been possessed by these changing times
Through the haunted maze in our minds
Right through where we shall remain for all time
This promise we made
And time won't change this
Still and breathless
Just like always
Mirrors sideways
Who cares what's behind?
Just like always
Still your passenger
Chrome buttons
Buckles and leather surfaces
These and other
Lucky witnesses
Now to calm me
Drive faster?
Roll the window down
This cool night air is curious
Let the whole world look in
Who cares who sees anything?

Who cares who sees what tonight?
Roll these misty windows
Down to catch my breath and then
Go and go and go
Just drive me home and back again
Here I lay
Just like always
You hide from yourself
You separate every belief that is true
And you spent your life
Attached to this poison
You don't feel anything out of the rain
And it's true that
You spend your life
Trapped in this void
Where you will stay always
Can't rid of this thought of you rotting in
This same cold space
You don't want to feel anything new
You've decided
To spend your life safe from emotion
Or confused now
You spend your life
Trapped in this void
Where you will stay always
You waste your life
Relaxed in your void
Where you will drain all of you

All of these are variations of the basic ego-gloried life thing in which you follow the gospel truth
That cure that promised to erase the symptoms that stood between you and your goal
Greasy filthy handjobs in truck stop restrooms
Hot Carling all over the place
It's the school where you go to learn how to butt-fuck
Enough to take your oxygen away
Then I'll set you on fire
'Cause I'm on fire
And I'm with you alone
I'm so into this whore
Afraid I might lose her
'Cause I'll stick you
Pushed back the square
Now that you've kneed her in the throat
'Cause back in school
We are the leaders of all
Transpose or stop your life
Is what you do
Pushed back the square
Now that you need her

But the engine's drone
Our minds set free
To roam
We discover the entry
To other planes
Our minds bend
And our fingers fold
Of unknown
We discover the entry
To other planes
Stay with me
As we cross the empty skies
Come sail with me

Our eyes catch sync
We explode

To other planes
As we collide with the energy
In other ways
Stay with me
As we cross the empty skies
Come sail with me
We play in dreams
As we cross through
Space and time
Just stay with me
Now help me pray for
The death of everything new
Then we'll fly farther
We'll stop to rest on the moon
And we'll make a fire
I'll steal a carcass for you
Then feed off the virus

Ever changing picture
Hours out from land
In tune with all our dreams
The ocean takes me in
To watch you shake it
Watch you wave your powers
Tempt with hours of pleasure
Take me one more time
Take me one more wave
Take me for one last ride
I'm out of my head
Tonight
Tonight
Tonight
Tonight
The sound of the waves collide
The sound of the waves collide
The sound of the waves collide
Tonight (We ride)

(Truly)
But you're that girl
(With sharp teeth)
Who grabs at the walls
(And pulls meat down)
664-oh... I forget
It's not like I care

But you're that girl
(With gold teeth)
Who snaps at the walls
(And won't calm down)

Now take it home and fuck with it
Then you pulled away
New cavity moved into
My heart today
The more she sings
The more it seems
Now I'm through
With the new you
Now I'm through
With the new you
New you
I drove you home
Then you moved away
New cavity moved into
My heart today
The more I scream
The more it seems
Now I'm through

Now I'm through
With the new you
They've put into your mind
And brace for the glory
As you stare into the sky...
The sky beneath
I know you can't be tired...
And switch back to your time
Just go ahead and try and taste it
I know it should be ripe...
Thrust... ahead
Turning in circles
Been caught in a stasis
The ancient arrival
Cut to the end
I'd like to be taken
Apart from the inside
Then spit through the cycle
Right to the end

I wonder just how you shaped it
To get back to your prize...

Right to the end
Wake for the glory
I know you can't be tired!
Turning in circles

Cut to the end
I'd like you to take me
Apart from the inside
Then spit through the cycle
Right to the end
Turning in circles
Been caught in a stasis
I want you to take me
Apart from the inside
Right to the end
I fiddle around in the ashtray
To find your cigarette pinkish red
I light it and take a drag
I swear I'm losing it
You should accept
Makeup and shoes in a bag laid open
Grab my keys and some money
And circle around the lake
I guess you're losing it
I like to believe that maybe you're a lot likе me
Try using this equality we might need in thе air
'Cause there are no more left like you
A picture-perfect strange
Imagined in one shape
Unchained

Tempt my spirit within my name
We crawled in the tomb and release some honey
Eighteen hundred million ways striving to make it last
There is no one left like you
A picture-perfect strange
Imagined in one shape
Unchained
There are no more thrills I'll need
Than the desire that we shared
From the channels of our dreams
To the grave
When you're ready
It waits for us to
To leave this earth
Out
I don't know
I could stay or leave
Either way
Cause the comet can take us
All the way through
Goodbye
I'll be waving
Goodbye
I'll be waving goodbye
Return to see
Everything looks the same
I don't know
If the change made was grave
'Cause the craving remains the same

I wanna take you home
And watch the world explode
From underneath your glow
I wanna watch the way
You creep across my skull
You slowly enter
Because you know my room
And then crawl your knees off
Before you shake my tomb
I wanna watch you close
I need to see for sure
After the tapings through
Who do you think we can show?
I wanna watch the way
You creep across my skull

Before you shake my tomb
You enter slowly
You know my room
You crawl your knees off"
