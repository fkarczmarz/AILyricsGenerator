"Trump's got a love child and I hope that bitch is buckwild
My jack rang off with clickbait
A hunnid and fifty of us on the big stage?
How long it took a nigga just to get paid?
I'm in LA with the shaker and bongo
Trimmin' the bream with the blade and lawnmow'
You gon' make me kick you out this 'partment
You gon’ have to kick it in the lobby

Trump’s got a love child and I hope that bitch is buckwild
The revolution will not be televised
But it will be streamed live
In 1080p on your pea-brain head in the face ass mobile device
Alright?
This shit gon' bang at least six summers
From out that rock you been under
It’s hard to stomach cold murder
It's easier to get a nine millimeter
Wait a minute!
This shit gon' bang at least six summers
Word!
This shit gon' bang for at least six summers
But ain't shit gon' change for at least three summers
Pop-pop-pop goes the shooter
Come on
This shit gon' bang at least six summers
We need more peace and less lone gunners
Put down your heat and smoke marijuanas
Pop the lock off your muzzle
Niggas is dyin' like lost files in the shuffle
We know you buy to sell it back to the public
'Cause there's money to be made in a killin' spree
That's why he tryna start a war on the Twitter feed
And take them AK's up outta these inner city streets
This shit gon' bang for at least six summers
But ain't shit gon' change for at least three summers
Pop-pop-pop goes the shooter
Get the Coltrane and the Cobain
Get the Coltrane and the Cobain
Shi-tell me somethin' that I don't know
All this fuckin' evidence and if it ever make it to the stand
You was overseas stealin' niggas' land and oil
Billy copped the Desert Eag' and it's legal to tote it
Lil' nigga bullied out his Pumas
But why he have to shoot the whole school up?
Get the Coltrane and the Cobain
Get the Coltrane and the Cobain
This shit gon' bang at least six summers
Word!
This shit gon' bang for at least six summers
But ain't shit gon' change for at least three summers
Pop-pop-pop goes the shooter

 waiting to catch a break

Keep it low or pay the fee
Niggas talking but it's not too often that they living what they speak
Good pussy kept me entertained
Money came then it went away
Lord see over everything (Over everything)
Am I my brother's keeper? (Am I my brother's keeper?)
You know everybody gotta eat  bruh
I wanna live on ahead  if not a cloud in the air
The right side of the chair
If Jesus would've had a better lawyer
Would he have to see the cross?
I hope your niggas is true  I hope they don't do you like Judas
I pray to God
Pain wearing off  sleeping while I talk
Laid in the arms  woke up at the top
I wanna live on ahead  if not a cloud in the air
Right side of the chair
9 A.M. L.A. time
My brother just turned down a half a million dollars
For being one half of one of the greatest duos in hip-hop history
(Am I my brother's keeper?)
I couldn't love him more
(You know everybody gotta eat  bruh)
Everybody eats  B

Am I my brother's keeper? They still asking 'bout the duo
Applaud his finding salvation
But I'm still rhyming 'bout the you know
It's hard to leave your foundation  this spaceship took me to Pluto
Still an underground king  but the money's Jason Derulo
Sumo in the safe  Cujo on the grill
Diamonds in the face  racing leather wheel
Destroy and rebuild niggas
That's the only way to build nigga  yuugh
Definition of a real nigga
Am I my brother's keeper? I'm dialing in a bit deeper
Arm's reach of the reaper  they say it's cheaper to keep her
Life's a bitch
(How I ever  ever let you go)
(How I ever  ever let you go)
(How I ever  ever let you go)
(How I ever  ever let you go)
I'm running through changes  is it strange
(How I ever  ever let you go)
To be baited  shit I'm grown

But still a fade

Shootin' off with no marks

Huh  baby

 you bubblin'
 look at the cash comin' in
 this lil' nigga buggin' me
 quit all that jaw-jackery
 I don't want none of it (Yeah)
 had enough of it
 my posse deep and irate
 had a dream and I made it
 Vintage Guess over Bape
 I might just roll out today
 head back to my old ways
 I air it out
 I'd rather kiss on my Mary
 go on and spread it out
 one in the hand (go)
 all the pie you can give me
 don't have me in the middle
 left my slippers at the function
 I thought you said you didn't have a husband
 blood drippin' from the cutthroats
 after life in 911 Porsche
 dead prezies in an envelope
 waitin' for the antidote
 patience thinner than a pantyhose
 he's gonna get nasty about it!
 huh?
 one in the hand (go)
All you ever needed was a simple plan
So let's celebrate while we still can
I know what they say  I could give or care
They talk so much on me  I must be doing something right
I saw my son today  in the likeness of a full grown man
So I'll celebrate while I still can
I remember where I couldn't even see the point
Of stepping out the motherfucking house
I came to fixing up the tree that farms move
I've came too far
How many others have walked the same ground you have?
You'll be wise to pay attention to your old head
I spent the whole day throwin' records in the deep end
So let's celebrate while we still can
You might also like
Captivated  the fruits of my family tree
Where would I be without you?
What would you do without me?
It'd be a bad look talkin' 'bout what could've been
So let's celebrate while we still can
I remember where I couldn't see the point
But now I'm at the point where I got it figured out
I came to fixin' up the tree that farms move
I've came too far
Do not be concerned about the money in your brother's hand
What's mine is yours
Thought you knew me better than that
I was under the impression that we all want the best of life
So let's celebrate while we still can
The partnership of the  of the board and the body of the fellow that is doing the maneuvers
In the fluent directions with the  with this wave is what interests me
Yeah
I'm workin' on a world premiere
And I could see the world from here
They ask me where I'm going from here
Shit  anywhere long as the runway is clear
Shit  music business movin' too fast for me (God damn)
Wishin' I still had Mac wit' me (Yes Lawd!)
How do you tell a nigga slow it down when you livin' just as fast as 'em?
I couldn't understand when I seen 'em stretched out cold on the pavement
Niggas catch T-K-O's on occasion
Wishin' I could save 'em  what was I to say?
I was doin' dates  dippin' in and out of state
We was goin' in to get away
Sick of feelin' so outta place
Wishin' I could save ya  what was I to say?
Wishin' I could save ya  but now it's too late
Now  is this really what I wanted?
Is it really worth the pain?
Now am I really an asshole? Fuck what you say
Don't do me no favors  let's get back to basics
I'm losin' all my aces  I'm runnin' outta patience
Got some pretty faces knowin' what my name is
Up in high places  I got some new neighbors
They don't really say shit but when they see the spaceship
They just think I rap or some form of entertainment

You know I had to close my eyes  yeah
And if I have to free my mind
I may not have the lane  movin' all along
Knowin' that I can't do it on my own
And if I got the pain feelin' comin' out
Have to run away  think I'm goin' home
Yeah  you know I'm workin' on a world premiere
And I could see the world from here
I know you somewhere in the atmosphere
I know someday I'll meet you halfway there (Cheers)
They say there's nothin' you can do about it
Can't say that I'm new to sorrow
Wishin' I could take your problems
Trade 'em for a little more time wit'chu
Sprouted wit'chu on my shoulder  the greatest honor to know ya
I'd gotta be honest wit'cha  I hate you ain't in the picture
I hate all them fake niggas claimin' like they gon' really miss ya
I know there's no one to blame and maybe the point that I'm missin'
But I needed a minute  just give me a minute
You know I had to close my eyes  yeah
And if I have to free my mind
I may not have the lane  movin' all along
Knowin' that I can't do it on my own
And if I got the pain feelin' comin' out
Have to run away  think I'm goin' home
Oh  say it ain't so!
Tears keep fallin' down my eyes
Can't turn back the hands of time but I should be with you
I miss my friend
Damn it  I miss you
Cannot bring you back
These pictures I'm seein' are fuckin' me up
And I don't know what to do but reminisce and face the pain
Back in the day before you were a dog and you were just pup
Bangin' beats and bringin' bitches back to the tour bus
It's Q-Tip in this bitch and I'm just in here reflectin'
Head on collisions with memories in the intersection
Lookin' in my rearview  wishin' I could be near you
The freeways of my mind are crowded with traffic
The good times that we had and them bad habits
Grown man cryin' like a child tryna understand it
So sick of sendin' flowers to all of my brother's mommas
Don't know what's harder  fightin' trauma or keepin' a promise
A true confession breath is a blessin'  without a question
But niggas don't get the message until they get disconnected
My story ain't over  I'm still turnin' pages
But the picture I painted with you in it has faded
My queen  my dreams and even my wages
I know what it means to lose everything when you made it
Rags to the riches and back to the rags is a muh'fucka
The consequence of puttin' all your chips in one bucket
To be honest  I feel like gettin' right back to these commas
You motherfuckers keep the drama
I'm workin' on a world premiere
And I could see the world from here
I know there must be somethin' after here
I know some day I'll meet ya halfway there in the atmosphere
Cheers
Free my mind
You know I had to close my eyes
Close my eyes
You know I have to free my mind
Oooooh
You know I had to close my eyes
You know it's time for me...
You know I have to free my mind
Free my...
Free
Free
Free my...
...My mind

Who gon' love me and touch me the right way
Need me a lil' baby
Who gon' run up and jump in the fight with me
Need me a lil' lady
Who gon' keep it buck like Milwaukee
Need me a lil' lady
You could be a chosen one
Kiss me with your native tongue
Shoot it if you holdin' some
Miss me 'til the mornin' come
Beat it like you're hittin' a drum
Freak me 'til the world is done
Need me a lil' baby

From the kitchen to the livin' room
Brought a totally different energy up in the room
Go look for another and come back and say you'll never leave
I could break it down and put it back together properly
I know what you want and I know what you need
We should be lovin' each other crazy
We shouldn't wait 'til the day our days are through
We should be more than each other's baby
We should be lovin' each other crazy (We should)
We shouldn't wait 'til the day our... are through
We should be more than each other's baby

You was cruisin' with your top down  fourth of July
I was movin' down the block  we got caught at the light
Out my window  I was shootin' my shot
Watchin' fireworks in the sky
In the summers  we let the top down  soak up the light
All I wanted was just to lock down the love of my life
Nice and simple  like a midnight drive
Watchin' fireworks in the sky
I'm callin' it now  I'm callin' it now  I'm callin' it now
You'll find love with me somehow  yeah  somehow
I'm callin' it now
We was movin' kinda fast  but the feelin' was right
We should cruise out to Nevada  get married tonight
Life is simple  'long as you're in my life
Watchin' fireworks in the sky
In the summers  we spent the nights makin' love in the park
We was buzzin' off cherry wine  lookin' up at the stars
Soft and blissful  how you feel in my arms
Woke up  you were singin' this song like

 holy shit)
 I'm almost there
Arms  legs wrapped around you
Arms  legs keep grabbing
The idle mind is a dangerous place to be left in
But keep your eyes on me
Yeah  your heart don't stand a chance
It feels like it's been far too long
Your knees can't hold your legs
Your feet just want to pace
The eyes keep me all in a trance
Let me ask you
Would you leave it all in the back of your head
Or all in the palm of my hand  huh?
Ain't nobody holding you back
Don't it feel like it's been far too long  girl?
Your heart don't stand a chance
Your knees just want to break
Your eyes keep me all in a trance
And let me ask you  mmm
I know the approach is so far from what you're used to
But you know it
And do I hold a candle to the last one over your moon?
Baby  of course I do
And I'm not closing my tab
Don't it feel like it's been far too long  girl?

The moment is all that we have
My meter should be up by the half
A ticket is the least of my cares
So let me ask you  uh
Am I dreaming?
Mind on the tip of a cloud
Or is it real as the stone in your crown?
Your heart don't stand a chance
I'm waiting for the white flag
You're talking with the blunt in your hand
And won't you pass that  huh?
I know in the morning
The sunlight cover your wounds  huh
But I'm hoping that I look the same as the way you always knew
But I'm not over what we had  huh
Your heart don't stand a chance
Ooh  champagne pourin' down
Arms  legs wrapped around you
Arms  legs keep grabbing
I remember being tumbled around and not being able to get to the surface where the air was
Maybe a little bit
Some days I think about it
But I get over it real quick
It's too late to make amends
We could never be friends
I don't miss her one bit
I miss that whip
I miss that whip
She used to scoop me from the train station

People tired of taking beatings from beasts covered in sheets

Eat their apple pie in the morning then bury the strange fruit

An African liberation is ready to take arms
And stand on a graveyard and tell you to slave on
Downtown (Down)

Strictly for Blacks? History repeating
What they put in it?

You either fall for anything or you stand in it
It's a lot going on on this damn mission

They said  Pop up the trunk! I'm like Pop up this dick
I was high as a kite  I had Xannies and white
I looked up at the light like What the fuck is my life?
They said my plates ain't legit  so they opened my shit
And when they opened my shit  it was snow in a fridge
I felt dumb as a brick  I had no idea
She had stolen the whip and this bitch had warrants and shit and
This bitch pulled multiple licks and this bitch had bodies on burners
And when I called from my cell  the only message I heard was

She had a bright smile  big white teeth  I mean
Whiter than her white T  remind me of wifey
Met her at the studio  sort of like a high buyer
She told me she had game so we connected like the wifi
She had this Asian swagger ‘bout her  so I call her mai tai
Started followin' her  she was the only thing on my timeline
And there was this one picture  her in the swimsuit
That made a nigga want to beat it up  and I intend to
But I'ma have to put in work  baby girl  then drink it all
Face like Mona Lisa  I'm just tryna be the wall to hang on
I ain't got no patience  I can't wait long
She come and see me  but she don't stay long
And that's the problem  she a good girl
Maybe it's too much smoke in the room
And she don't want that Mary Jane in her Vidal Sassoon
So I'ma take a minute  and walk her to her Uber
Got a bullet in my heart  and she the shooter
Ay  .Paak

I would sell you faith but you niggas don’t believe
But God if you're listening

Ten P's in the rental truck
Trimmin' flowers in the Marriott with little cuz
Vision was like Martin Luther on the mountain peak
Took notes and took control of it manually
Hand to hand 'til it's white sands in the canopy
Now follow me
I’m too old to act childishly

Show off the paint for spectators and the faculty
Same ol' niggas that said they proud of me

A few more rounds before the feds come and get you
Is you gon' smile when your date gets issued?
You know them feds taking pictures
And good riddance
Is the element of danger an important factor for the members of your peer group?
'Bout the year Drizzy and Cole dropped
Before K.Dot had it locked
Tryna get my money pot so wifey wouldn’t get deported
What about your goals? What about your leverage?
So they don’t force you into some hole
What’s the meaning of my fortune reading?
Generations of harsh living and addiction
I came to visit during the seven-year stint
But they wouldn’t let me in because my license suspended
Now I’m scraping the pennies just to kiss you on your cheek
It’s gonna be a couple weeks before I get it
I know you miss me
It was late in the fall
And one of these is my rise
One of these is my downfall
And I’m the one to make it right
And one of these is my rise

And I’m the one to make it right
I wanna make it right

I like pain
Can you be specific? What kind of pain do you like?
Tried to tell niggas  in 2012  nigga
Working hand to hand and no avail
Volume one was too heavy for you frail niggas
So I got lean like codeine and pills (clap hands nigga!)
It's the visionary  in the vintage Chevy
It's been a while but  wow  you still care
Free Nats 'til they pass out obituaries
In bold caps  your bitch-ass was not there
And I can do anything but move backwards
The hardest thing is to keep from being distracted
My big sister still claiming me on them taxes
Tell Uncle Sam I just need a second to add this
Gave my mama ten racks
And she packed and went to Chumash with it
Quadruple the worth and give me half of it
Half of it I took in the back of the air mattress
A quarter stash was stashed in a box with the Air Maxes  the rest got lost in Saks Fifth
With my wifey  no BM
Whack niggas dropping links in my DM
Bad bitches up and down a nigga TL
I'm glad that you finally made it to the future but you're late

To every hundred niggas that came and gone missing
Only a handful will go the distance
I swear I seen this shit coming as if I was living up under the plumbing
While niggas was riffing and mumbling 'bout what they could do
I was cooking gumbo whipping the voodoo
I was in the jungle running with Zulu's
We was looking past the struggle while life was moving so fast
You had to be sharp as a Ginsu
To the top of the food group
Doing what I want and how I should  too
Stepped in the waters
The water was cold
Chilled my body
But it didn't touch my soul
