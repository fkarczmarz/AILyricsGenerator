lyrics
"On a road 90 miles too long
Someone don't want us together but
We just keep on walking 'cause we're one
I got a voice and you've got a reason
For the glory  we sing our broken song
Take a side and I'll take the other one
Two brothers under one nation
Wanna feel your love right now
Wanna see the night and feel the day
Ever try to touch somebody
90 miles away
But it won't be the same again
No  it won't be the same again
Yeah
Third brother  1989
Got through it  opened up the line
Stand tall  I'll follow you this time
We're all just waiting on a sign
Wanna feel your love right now
Wanna see the night and feel the day
Ever try to touch somebody
90 miles away
But it won't be the same again
No  it won't be the same again
I'll be with you until the end
But it won't be the same

We're broken  we're battered
We're torn up and we're shattered
We turned back on each other
The moment that it mattered
But the curtain is shaking
It's bending and it's breaking
And I'll be with you in the end
But it won't be the same again
Can't go back to the way it's been
I'll be with you until the end
But it won't be the same again
Everybody knows it  but no one tries to stop it
'Cause she barely even knows him  but if she could see inside
Everything is quiet as she waits to tell him who she is
Is this all we get to be absolute?
Quiet  but I'm sure there is something here
Tell me everything 'cause I want to hear
It's a kiss that sits upon on her lips that waits for planes and battleships
She wants to be a dancer and he has got a picture
On his wall and it's a sailor in a new port every night
Yet man was born to trouble like sparks fly upwards innocent
Is this all we get to be absolute?
Quiet  but I'm sure there is something here
Tell me everything 'cause I want to hear
Quiet  but I'm sure there is something here
Tell me everything 'cause I want to hear

Tell me everything 'cause I want to hear
Quiet  but I'm sure there is something here
Tell me everything 'cause I want you here
There is something here
She is right in front of you
You begin to wonder could you find a better one
And all at once the crowd begins to sing
Sometimes the hardest thing and the right thing are the same
Maybe you started to compare to someone not there
Where no questions cross your mind
But she won't keep on waiting for you without a doubt
Much longer for you to sort it out
And all at once the crowd begins to sing
Sometimes the hardest thing and the right thing are the same
Maybe you started to compare to someone not there
Maybe it's all you're running from
Perfection will not come

Be still and know that I'm with you
When darkness comes upon you
And covers you with fear and shame
Be still and know that I'm with you
And I will say your name
If terror falls upon your bed
And sleep no longer comes
Remember all the words I said
And when you go through the valley
And shadow comes down from the hill
If morning never comes to be
If you forget the way to go
And lose where you came from
If no one is standing beside you
Be still and know I am
Be still and know that I'm with you
Passing ships into the night under different skies
Would you just whisper what you said one last time
I could have sworn I heard you say that you are mine
It's the only way I've had of reaching you
Be the one and only
I will be the only one if you say you'll never go
I'll be screaming out your name from the back road
Be the one and only

We were siftin' through the sand

He's no longer with us  but he left this dusty room
Take it on your shoulder 'til you can find another
That's enough for now  he should've never left you broken
He should've held you  things your father never could do
That's enough for now  he would've never left you broken
He would've held you  things your father never told you
The century before you never could turn 21
Years and years he waited just watching for a son

That's enough for now  he would've never left you broken
He would've held you  things your father never told you
Breathing comes in pairs
Except for twice

Left my mother's mother without so much as a kiss

Happiness feels a lot like sorrow

Now that you understand there's no one around
Take a breath  just take a seat
You're falling apart and tearing at the seams
Heaven forbid you end up alone  you don't know why
It's on your face  is it on your mind?
Would you care to build a house of your own?
How much longer  how long can you wait?
It's like you wanted to go and give yourself away
Heaven forbid you end up alone and you don't know why
Heaven forbid you end up alone and don't know why

He walks  you say sit down  it's just a talk
He smiles politely back at you
You stare politely right on through
Some sort of window to your right
As he goes left and you stay right
Between the lines of fear and blame
You begin to wonder why you came
Where did I go wrong? I lost a friend
Somewhere along in the bitterness  and
I would have stayed up with you all night
Had I known how to save a life
Let him know that you know best
‘Cause after all  you do know best
Try to slip past his defense
Without granting innocence
Lay down a list of what is wrong
The things you've told him all along
And pray to God he hears you

 Sit down  it's just a talk
But I'm staring at what once was the wall
Separating east and west
And now they meet amidst the broad daylight
Somewhere between unsure and a hundred
But I'm banking on the rest to clear away
'Cause we have spoken everything
Everything short of I love
Somewhere between unsure and a hundred
Somewhere between unsure and a hundred
And who's to say it's wrong?
And who's to say that it's not right
Where we should be for now?

I never knew that everything was falling through
That everyone I knew was waiting on a cue
To turn and run when all I needed was the truth
But that's how it's gotta be
It's coming down to nothing more than apathy
I'd rather run the other way than stay and see
The smoke and who's still standing when it clears
And everyone knows I'm in
With eight seconds left in overtime
Let's rearrange
I wish you were a stranger I could disengage
Just say that we agree and then never change
Soften a bit until we all just get along

I'll keep you warm
Dancing in a downpour
Wore the same clothes and you said
We're sisters with nothing between  if one of us fall
The other will soon be following
Both of you fell the same day and you don't know why
But one of you never woke up
You lay your body down on the floor  you're desperate to hear
Her footsteps again  but this house is on fire
And we need to go
Run for your life  my love
Run and you don't give up
With all that you are and all that you want
I will be close behind  run for your life
She had a fire inside and that terrified you
You swore that you'd never lose your control
And I know the hunger inside of you is strong
You can only hold back the river so long

Oh  you don't have to go it alone
Run for your life  my love
Run and you don't give up
With all that you are and all that you want
Run for your life right now
And if you don't know how
I'll come back with you and take all that's true
And leave all that's burned behind
Run for your life
Oh  you don't have to go it alone
Go it alone  go it alone
Run for your life  my love
Run and you don't give up
With all that you are and all that you want
Run for your life right now
And if you don't know how
I'll come back with you and take all that's true
And leave all that's burned behind
Reach your hand and you try to touch their skin
But it's just you breathing
The torn fabric wrapped around you
Hands are shaking as you're reaching out
To cover that mirror now
No one can take this from you
No  we can't carry this for you
But you can stand if you want to
Or fall if you want to
I'll do the same as you
You can dance if you want to
Or break if you want to
I'll do the same as you
The same as you
All those days and nights you planned your future
Thought the river could never reach your home
But oh  how swiftly it comes
Lying there  naked in the moonlight
The cool water never quite touches your soul
Makes you want it all the more

Unaware the stare from someone
Don't appear to care that I saw you and I want you
What's your name  'cause I have to know it
You let me in and begin to show it
We're terrified 'cause we're heading straight for it  might get it
You've been the song playing on the background
All along but you're turning up now
And everyone is rising to meet you  to greet you
Turn around and you're walking toward me
I'm breaking down and you're breathing slowly
You say the word and I will be your man  your man
Say when and my own two hands
Will comfort you tonight  tonight
Say when and my own two arms
Will carry you tonight  tonight
We're coming close and then even closer
We bring it in  but we go no further
Later on if it turns to chaos
Hurricane coming all around us

They're coming back and you just dont know when
You want to cry but there's nothing coming
They're gonna push until you give in or say when
Now we're here  and it turns to chaos
Hurricane  coming all around us
Double crack throws you back from the window  you stay low
It all began with the man and country
Every plan turns another century
Around again  another nation has fallen
Maybe God can be on both sides
Of the gun  never understood why
Some of us never get it so good  so good
Some of this was here before us
All of this will go after us
It never stops until we give in  give in
Say when and my own two hands
Will comfort you tonight  tonight
Say when and my own two arms
Will carry you tonight  tonight
Say when and my own two hands
We would float on the summer wind and fall back to earth again
Hello love  remember that touch
That skin on skin summer rush  sweeping up the both of us
Like a shadow and a dancer
We were looking for the answers
Keeping perfect time
Like a shadow and a dancer
We know the summer thrill is gone
But we've never been so in love
Like a shadow and a dancer
We have stayed like the Cascade mountain range
And Pacific Ocean waves  some things never change
And it's you and me  and our bodies are remembering
We're turning ever so slowly in the candlelight  trembling
Like a shadow and a dancer
We were looking for the answers
Keeping perfect time

For now  you're not here and I'm not there
It's like we're on our own
To figure it out  consider how to find a place to stand
Instead of walking away and instead of nowhere to land
This is gonna break me clean in two
This is gonna bring me close to you
She is everything I need that I never knew I wanted
She is everything I want that I never knew I needed
She is everything I need that I never knew I wanted
She is everything I want that I never knew I needed
It's all up in the air and we stand still to see what comes down
When it falls in place with you and I  we go from if to when

She begged him not to go
The fighter wrapped his gloves
Just this one last time
I swear you'll still be mine
But he can't promise much
Maybe we were meant to be on our own
But maybe we don't have to be all alone
The fighter goes inside
The doubt is creeping in
He swings with all his might
At all that might have been
And she's in love with him
But lovers don't always win
He never even saw the swing

She begged him not to go
She unwrapped his gloves
Kissed his trembling lips
She touched his fingertips
But somehow they both know
Maybe we were meant to be on our own
But I got to try or it will destroy me
And these silent waves are my company
And I lost the line between the sky and sea
And I'm wondering will the wind ever come for me  yeah
'Cause I don't know
I don't know where I am
Can you tell me
Will I break or will I bend?
Will the wind ever come again?
I feel the sun coming up  rising from the East
And I see the Empire falling to her knees
And I lost the line between her and me
But my troubles are gone if the wind ever comes for me  yeah

Will I break or will I bend?

Alone and I'm in between
The place that I'm from and the place that I'm in
A city I've never been

Don't go  don't leave me now
'Cause they say the best way out is through

She begins to leave because of me
Her bag is now much heavier
I wish that I could carry her
But this is our ungodly hour

We're close and then we run
Kiss away the difference
I know you hate this one
Trying not to lose your own
Boxing up everything you've got
All you ever knew of home

Listens till he's twenty
Lasts till twenty-one
Rushing past the window
Like he's watching his own son
Sixty years of sorrow
Brought five or six of bliss
Left my mother's mother
Standing on the sidewalk  watching this parade
Or we could get out  pack our suitcase right now
Find ourselves a bus stop  make our own way
'Cause it feels like I've been here forever
Afraid to be my father and afraid to leave him too
But it's my name painted on the doorway
Tells me where I came from and what I've got to do
Wherever this goes  no matter how far
Baby  you are the song that's written on my heart
Wherever we stand  wherever we fall
It don't matter at all 'cause I will be forever yours
From this moment 'til the day the curtains close

On the road to someplace  someplace that we don't know

On the corner of First and Amistad
Where the west
Was all but won
We're all alone
Smokin' his last cigarette
Where were you
When everything was fallin' apart?
Where all my days
Were spent by a telephone
That never rang
And all I needed was a call
That never came
To the corner of First and Amistad
Lost and insecure
Lyin' on the floor
Why'd you have to wait?
Where were you? Where were you?
Just a little late

Where were you? Where were you?

The city breaks
But I've been callin'
For years and years and years and years
And you never left me no messages
You never sent me no letters
You got some kinda nerve
Takin' all I want
