lyrics
"Something like a miracle
Rest assured I feel the same way you do
Stay secure that's all I'm asking from you
(Stay secure)
I wish I had words to tell (I wish)
This feeling that I know so well
All that I can say
All that I can say
All that I can say
All that I can say
I've always been curious
Meeting someone serious
Looking for someone who loves like me
But the day I stopped my search
It seemed that you were put on Earth
To show me everything I could not see
You might also like
I wish I could find a way
To tell you how I felt that day
But I can't (I just can't)
I can't
All that I can say
All that I can say
All that I can say
All that I can say
Showing him that I'm all in
I would do it all again
Sweeter than cinnamon
Heaven-sent gentleman
Synonyms for loving him
All that I can say
All that I can say
All that I can say
All that I can say
You're all—
All that I can say
All I can say
All that I can say
He's all that I'll ever need
He's got a hold on me
I love you
Loving you is wonderful
All that I can say
All that I can say
All that I—
All I can say
Loving you is wonderful
If I can't love myself enough to know
When it's time
Time to let go
Sing
All I really want (Yeah)
It would be so sweet (Hey)
All I really want (Oh)
It would be so sweet
I asked for a sign
From my sweet Lord above
You think you're in love
You only see what you wanna see
And all I see is me for you
And you for me
You might also like
(Every day I wanna cry)
But if I give you one more try
And if I mean anything to you
Would it make everything all right?
All I really want
And to find a love that's mine
It would be so sweet
(I said I wanna be happy)
And to find a love that's mine
It would be so sweet
(To find a love that's mine)
Is to be happy (Wanna be happy)
And to find a love that's mine (Yeah)
It would be so sweet (It would be so sweet)
All I really want (If only we could be)
Is to be happy (We can be happy)
And to find a love that's mine (I wanna be happy)
It would be so sweet
But the answer lies in me
I do believe
That we can be happy
Gotta let it breathe
Life is too short to be tryin' to play some games
Now take some time and think about
If it's really worth losing me
Why must it be this way?
Why do you have to play with my mind
All the time?
Help me sing it
All I really want is for me to be happy
All I really want is for me to be happy
All I really want is for me to be happy
All I really want
Is to be happy
(I don't wanna have to worry about nothin' no more)
And to find a love that's mine
All I really want
Is to be happy
And to find a love that's mine
It would be so sweet
(Said I wanna be happy if it's all right with you and me)
All I really want (It'll be all right with me)
Is to be happy
And to find a love that's mine
It would be so sweet
All I really want
And to find a love that's mine
It would be so sweet
Is to be happy
And to find a love that's mine
It would be so sweet
All I really want
Is to be happy
And to find a love that's mine
It would be so sweet
All I really want
Is to be happy
And to find a love that's mine
It would be so sweet
(You know that I don't ever wanna leave you)
I wanna be with you
(Does he care for you? Does he want you?)
I wanna be with you
(Does he even care?)
I can't deal with the fact that
You don't want me around
Why you wanna see me down?
It's so unusual
That you don't love me no more
Why you wanna close the door?
I spent all my days and all my nights with you
Just tell me what am I gonna do without you
If loving you is so right
Tell me how I'll make it through the night
(You know that I don't ever wanna leave you)
(I wanna be with you)
I just wanna be with you
Nothing else I'd rather do
(I wanna be with you)
I want to spend my life with you  yeah  oh
You might also like
Let's take this time to think about
What was said and done
Now tell me why you had to run
Away from me
Now I can't sleep at night
Why we have to fight?
Every day from you  I look and I see something new
Now tell me what I got to do to get this through to you
It's the little things you do for me
That make me very happy
You know that I don't wanna leave you
I  I  I (I wanna be with you)
I just wanna be with you
There's nothing else I'd rather do
(I wanna be with you)
(I wanna be with you)
It seems like each and every time I come around
You don't want me there
And it's beginning to make me so scared
(I wanna be with you)
So scared that I might lose you
(I wanna be with you)
(I wanna be with you)
I just wanna pick up the phone  yeah
(I wanna be with you)
(I wanna be with you)
Oh  I wanna be with you
Oh baby  let me be with you  yeah
I need to be with you all day long  day long  yeah

I wanna be with you  gotta be with you  need to be with you
(Oh-oh  oh-oh)
Ooh (Oh-oh  oh-oh)

Chemistry was crazy from the get-go
Neither one of us knew why
We didn't build nothin' overnight
'Cause a love like this takes some time
People swore it off as a phase  said we can't see that
Now from top to bottom  they see that we did that
(Yes) It's so true that
(Yes) We been through it
(Yes) We got real shit
(Yes) See  baby
We've been too strong for too long
And I can't be without you  baby
And I'll be waitin' up until you get home
'Cause I can't sleep without you  baby (Oh)
Anybody who's ever loved you know just what I feel
Too hard to fake it  nothin' can replace it
Call the radio if you just can't be without your baby  yeah
You might also like
I got a question for ya (See  I already know the answer)
But still I wanna ask you  will you lie? (No)
Make me cry? (No)
Do somethin' behind my back and then try to cover it up?
Well  neither would I  baby
My love is on the up and up
(Yes) I'll be faithful

Now if you're down on love or don't believe this ain't for you
(No  this ain't for you)
And if you got it deep in your heart
And deep down you know that it's true

Fellas  tell your lady she's the one

I wanna be with you  gotta be with you  need to be with you
You're so beautiful
Here we go... come on
I dreamt that I could paint you with words
But there were no colors bright enough
Black or white enough
You are the star that touched the earth
Shine bright for all eyes to see
Radiate and touched me
Now I'm shining like you do
It was dim before I knew you
Bright light for weeping eyes to get used to
Trust who? That's some shit I had to adjust to
I tried to practice my war-like tactics
Such bliss breeds obliviousness
So recollect sweet breath still wet on my lips
My prayer's this: God protect my beloved and keep her covered From the valley to the summit like the land undiscovered
Like the stars unnumbered
You are so beautiful
You might also likeHook
I do all my best so I could be true to you
Ain't nothing in this word that I wouldn't do for you
?? everything usual
Want to build with you as I get older
You see through my drama and my world like a stage
Not the same years but living in the same age
Now I'm back cause of what you do to me
I can't ignore your aura cause it grabbed me by the hand
Like the moon pulled the tide and the tide pulled the sand
Never dreamed that it would be so beautiful
I wanna say that I love you
All my days and nights were lonely
And it's so beautiful
Suitable to be part of the cosmos
Bright the apple of my eyesight
The tender kiss that wets my appetite
Your name just excite me
Your eyes so alive they invite me
Cause you are so beautiful
You don't even know the length I would go
To make absolutely sho' you is respected and protected
That you always will be watched over
And never rocked over
I know a lot of foolish cats that slept on you
But what I'm gonna do is be totally committed
If you need me I'll be hotter than a New York minute
Cause the vibe that you give leave my soul replenished
Got my heart and soul in it
It's the way that I'm living
Oooh  ooh  oh  oh
Oooh  ooh  oh  oh
They said I’d never be a leader
They said I’d never wear a crown
If I wanted to be someone
I should learn to settle down
You should know better
I tell myself
You’ll never go further
I warned myself
You’ll never be better
Don’t know me that well
I made it to the end
I nearly paid the cost
I lost a lot of friends
I sacrificed a lot
I’d do it all again
Cause I made it to the top
But I can’t keep doubting myself anymore
No  ooh  oh  oh
No  ooh  oh  oh
I can’t keep doubting myself  no (ooh  oh  oh)

Now you’re looking at a leader
Now you’re staring at a queen
You’d said I’d never be someone
But now I’m pulling those strings
You should know better
Won’t make me back down
You’ll never go further
Can’t turn me around
You’ll never be better
So no stopping me now
I made it to the end
I nearly paid the cost
I lost a lot of friends
I sacrificed a lot
I’d do it all again
Cause I made it to the top
I can’t keep doubting myself anymore
No  ooh  oh  oh
No  ooh  oh  oh
You think you know
But you don’t know the half
You think you beat me down
But I’ll have the last laugh
I’ll keep getting up
Cause that’s what I want to do
I’m gonna be the best me
I’m sorry if it kills you
I made it to the end
I nearly paid the cost
I lost a lot of friends
I sacrificed a lot
I’d do it all again
Cause I made it to the top
I can’t keep doubting myself anymore
I can’t keep doubting myself   no  no
(Oooh  oh  oh)
And I remember holding The Breakthrough album
Holding it in my hands  in my car
Listening to it on repeat
To me she was this untouchable goddess
And  and when I met her
I really  really wasn't expecting her
To just be  like me
'Cause the sex was good  you had my mind
And I let you come back every time
You would violate and cross the line
And you knew that I would be the type to
Always wait so patiently  thinkin'
You was comin' home to me
Or felt your taps sayin'  Are you asleep?
Rewind that
'Cause the sex was good  you had my mind
And I  I let you come back every time
You would violate and cross the line
And you knew that I would be the type to
Always wait so patiently  thinkin'
You was comin' home to me
Or felt your taps sayin'  Are you asleep?
Don't wanna play house no more
You're so dumb to think you gon' marry me
I got to be out my mind to think I need someone to carry me
It's time I do something for me
You might also like
Time I choose my clothes
Choose my friends  be with my family
They been askin' Girlfriend  where you been?
We ain't seen you in weeks
Been chasin' this fool around
Thinkin' he gon' hold me down
I would follow his lead
Thinkin' I would be the one he keep around
When I ain't need it  not your finance
And all that I needed  real commitment
I really couldn't see it  not the real man
You said you would be in this relationship
So many men think (These men)
That all a girl needs (They think)
Is to be sold a dream (A dream)
But I won't fall for it
Don't wanna play house no more
You're so dumb to think you gon' marry me
I got to be out my mind to think I need someone to carry me
It's time I do something for me
Don't wanna play house no more
You treat me all wrong  tired of you playin' me
I been lookin' at the front door
This ain't yours so let me come in
Don't wanna play house no more
No more  I'm tired of you playin' me
It's time I do something for me
You turned your back  and back I came running
But the simple fact is that you ain't want me
Done enough lying and crying to myself
Nothing left to do but move
What else can I do but leave?
I believed that you would marry me  but now I gotta breeze
I be's with LT when you come to your senses
But then it's too late
That's always how it be
Catch me with the B's on the wheels  Giuseppe's on the hills
Shoulda Marc Jacob Fe Fe bagged me when you had me
Next dude will gladly pick up where you left off
It's time I do something for me
Don't wanna play house no more
You're so dumb to think you gon' marry me
(To think that you would marry me)
I got to be out my mind to think
I need someone to carry me
It's time I do something for me
Don't wanna play house no more
You're so dumb to think you gon' marry me
I got to be out my mind to think I need someone to carry me

Then why am I in overtime and sudden death every other day
I know that for the good of life there's a price we all gotta pay
Since everybody knows what it is that I need to do
I don't need no one to put me down
And I don't need no one to hang around and make me frown just makes me look older
And I don't need no one to black my eye and tell me lies
Don't wanna cry over nobody else
No no no no I can do bad all by myself
Somebody told me once that running from the rain don't make no sense

But I don't wanna take a chance on dirt when I got grass even though the grass has died
Oh since everybody knows what it is that I need to do

So  you think you know how to love a woman?
A woman  she needs more than material things
And a woman needs so much more that what a man can say
A real woman needs a real man that don't talk about it
Be about it
Put that work  and still shows his woman real romance
Well  I think it's still some things you need to know
(Think it's still some things you need to know)

A woman  she likes to talk and work it out
And a woman likes for you to watch her back

She wants your respect

See another woman knowing information
She don't even know about her man

Make your way home at a decent hour every night
Pick up your phone
Just to say you're still in love from time to time
Remind her that she's still beautiful in your eyes (Beautiful in your eyes)
And ride with your woman
Make her feel that you're always on her side
When she cries  ask her what she's feeling
Let her know you sympathize
Gotta swallow your pride (Your pride)
Got some making up to do  gotta make it right
Kiss her real slow and get down and blow her mind
Gotta take your time
I said kiss her real slow and get down and blow her mind
Say it one more time  say it one more time (Whoo)
Kiss her real slow and get down and blow her mind
Gotta take your time

I made it here with love  love
Said I've been and up and down and I've been through it all
Took a while to know my heart
Before a love like this  you go
Through the fire and valley lows
But if you just hold on
Please hold on 'cause love is strong  it'll save ya
Truth can be the sweetest pain
It can mess up everything
It's the only way you know
I'm payin' for it  I'm changin' for it
But I'll make it work
'Cause I'm no beginner
Thought they'd put my life on hold
But I knew somethin' they didn't know
I know myself too much to ever fold

Never found virtue from patience

Precious time is just wastin'

They can't find the assailant
Made it out of the basement
Made it out of the underground
From a time where you outta town
They might gun you down  blaow

Came from this Chi and wow  look what the fuck they found
A young legend  comin' to shut the summer down
You need to talk to me like you don't bring your mother 'round
If you really wanna be with someone else
You gotta feed yourself
Before you feed somebody else

'91  I stepped in this game
After What's the 411? things ain't been the same
And I can't complain
But with all this fame comes a whole lot of pain  but
I'm so glad to be here and my music's still sincere
Let's get back to the story of all this pain and glory
And '94 was my life and my life wasn't right
So I reached out to you and told you what I've been through
Hate it or love it  the underdog's on top
And I ain't goin' nowhere but you already know me
Hate it or love it  the underdog's on top
And I ain't goin' nowhere but you already know me
Then I came with Share My World
But at that point I was just a foolish girl trying to find my way
Then I dropped the Mary album
And people were saying that it's just not gonna work
And my feelings  they did hurt
But my fans showed me so much love
And I owe it all to them
Then I came with No More Drama  I remember that week
Thought about it every day and it made me change my way
I'm a real woman now because of all of these days

Each and every person out there that's ever done anything for Mary J. Blige
But most of all I wanna thank my fans
For hanging in there with me during the bad times
And now you're here
To see me at a point in my life where I can actually call myself a queen
And for those of you that don't like it
This is what you can do
You can do this
You can hate it or love it

Hate it or love it (Hey  yeah)
Hate it or love it
Don’t it seem like
Like I’m always there when it matters
But missing most of the other time
A terrible pattern
The rewards I see from working
Made me an addict
There's way more people that want it
Than people that have it
They fall victim to my system
Guess I sure know how to pick em
And I’m always her regret
And I always make it harder on whoever’s coming next
She’s crying now but she’ll laugh again
Cause we on the rise and she here with us
And we hold hands while I pray that she’s not the type to hold grudges
I’m wrong..

And I kiss the clouds on them rainy days
And smile for you when your skies are gray  bae
'Cause I'm a teardrop away from cryin'
And a few shots away from dyin'
Dear Lord  would you shower my pain?
Let it rain  let it rain on me
While I cherish the air I breathe
I'm an angel that can't soar  can't fly
And I mastered it  Lord knows why
It's just those rainy days
Spend a lifetime tryna wash away
Until the sun come out and shines again (Ooh  just spend a lifetime)
All of those rainy days (Away)
Spend your lifetime tryna wash away (Spend your lifetime)
Until the sun shines and I see your face ('Til the sun shines)
I feel like an angel with my broken wings
I feel like I'm fallin'  yeah
Makin' clothes for all of those that spread love
And for those who can't take it  stand up
Baby  we gon' make it
In the words of Marvin Gaye
War is not the answer
Nobody loves the rain
Can't stand it
It always seems to fall
Baby  handle it
Baby  didn't we tell you before
About chasin' those waterfalls? (Don't go chasin' waterfalls)
Nobody loves the rain
Can't stand it
It always seems to fall
Baby  handle it
Baby  didn't we tell you before
About chasin' those waterfalls? Yeah

Until the sun come out and shines again (Oh  might just spend a lifetime)
Until the sun shines and I see your face
Smile at me  smile at me
'Til the sun shines
Just smile for me
Just smile for me  just smile at me

After playing a game of truth or dare
I wanted to stay at your place
I never thought that I would fall in love with you
But since the day we kissed  I knew it had to be you
I never thought we would be together
I can't believe I just made love to you
After all the things that we've been through
Now what are we gonna do? Oh
