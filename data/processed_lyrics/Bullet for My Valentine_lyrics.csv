lyrics
"Repeat yourself  my hands are shaking
When I was told  my friend was gone I felt so guilty
A thousand questions left unanswered
I'll bleed if you want me to!
I'll serenade before I do
I'll bleed if you want me to!
On and on although you're gone
Candles burn without a flame on
Our final call to you  I know you're listening
How could you leave us that way?
Where did you go?
Ten years today!
Ten years ago  I stood beside the wood that held you
I must sit down  my legs are shaking
We let you go  with gifts of plectrums for your journey
And melodies to help you on your way
I'll bleed if you want me to!
I'll serenade before I do
I'll bleed if you want me to!

Whoah-oh-ah
Whoah-oh-oh
Whoah-oh-ah
I'll bleed if you want me to
(I'll bleed if you want me to!)
I'll bleed if you want me to!
On and on although you're gone
Candles burn without a flame on
Our final call to you  I know you're listening!
How could you leave us that way?
Where did you go?
Ten years today!
Where did you go? (ten years today!)
Where did you go?
How could you leave us that way?
But somewhere down that line
You're gonna get what's coming to you!
Look at me now!
Look at me now!
Look at me now!
Pull it out from my back
Soon I'm the one that's on attack
I can't wait to return the favour
Look at me now
Look at me now
Look at me now!
Too many times I've seen it
Rip a hole into our friendship
This is how it's been
How it always will be
You think you're above me? (You think you're above me!)
But now I'm here to envy
Four words to choke upon!
Look! (Look!)

You think you're above me? (You think you're above me!)
But now I'm here to end this
Four words to choke upon!
Look! (Look!)
You're gone!
Your body's cold
Hope is lost I can't let go
Can I die with you so we can never grow old?
Cut the ties (cut the ties)
With this note you left behind
As I read the words I hear you telling me why
I never said goodbye
Can't even ask you why
I hope you've finally gone to a place where you belong
My sadness shows
As your name is carved in stone
I wish I died (I wish I died)
On that night right by your side (Night right by your side)
So just kill me now and let the good times roll

Will I see you on the other side?

Will you come to me? (Will you come to me?)
Will you take me to the other side?
'Cause here I don't belong!
I never said goodbye
Can't even ask you why
I hope you've finally gone to a place where you belong
I never said goodbye
Can't even ask you why (I'm wasting)
Away in my own misery
Things happen but we don't really know why
If it's supposed to be like this
Why do most of us ignore the chance to miss?
Torn apart at the seams and my dreams turn to tears
I'm not feeling this situation
It's the best place to be when you're feeling like
Me (Me)

All these things I hate revolve around
Me (Me)

No more of taking this hatred from you

So burn all your bridges
'Cause I'm not going down (down)
This time I will be heard
I'm not going to burn
You fake (fake!) your damnation
You pray (pray!) for salvation
'Cause your heart is made of stone
You can die and rot alone
I hope you're unhappy and hurting inside
I want you to choke when you swallow your pride

And you pretend that I don't mean nothing
We get so complicated (complicated!)
This finger's for our memories
So rip my pictures from your wall
Tear them down and burn them all
There's nothing left to say so
Take the ashes from the floor
Bury them to just make sure
That nothing more is left of me
Just bittersweet memories
Memories
I want to run and escape from your prison
But when I leave I feel something is missing

I want more and I can't stop craving

It's all just too much
I guess my best was not good enough
And something is certain
I miss you around
And all that I want is to be with you
You kept me breathing under the water
When everyone else left me to drown
You were the light that shone through the darkness
Now I'm blind 'cause you're not around
I know I'm not perfect
I let you down
I guess that I'm paying the price for it now
You kept me breathing under the water
When everyone else left me to drown
You were the light that shone through the darkness
Now I'm blind 'cause you're not around
I don't know how we got here
But I know I don't belong
I don't know how we got here
Or why I'm holding on

Not dead or alive
No feeling to find
Like I've been hypnotised
How do I see
A light in the dark
When nothing is real
And I don't hear a heart
I can't wake up from this cold dark state
It's under my skin
Living within
I'm chained to my mind
So undignified
Run from the tide
That's rising so high
Come wash me away
'Cause I've no will to fight
Time won't wait for me to bend and break
Don't want to be so numb to everything

Yeah!
Under this pressure
I want to disappear
Turn on the lights as I need some clarity
So overwhelming
It's bearing down on me
And when it ends all this weight is crushing me
And nothing's easing  waiting
Patience is wearing
Nothing's helping  wasting
Mentally vacant
I can't cope now I'm down on my knees

It seems so right
But through it all
I sacrifice
When it's holding you down (holding you down!)
When there's no strength to fight (no strength to fight!)
When it's dragging you out (dragging you out!)

I've cried a thousand tears tonight
But nothing seems to quench
The thirst you keep on craving
But now I need an answer to my prayers and you're not there
So why think you listen?
Listen!
Has no one told you? Your cries are all in vain
And everyone keeps trying to take that all away
Has no one told you? Your cries are all in vain
Your cries!
Lord I can't disguise
The look inside my eyes
The more I try to look away
The more I'm staring
But now I need an answer to my prayers and you're not there

I'm dying from the inside
Body hurts too much to feel
Pressure adds to pain
Deliver us from evil
Straying out of sanity
Why can't you let me be?
Is nothing else important?

Because if I carry on
Deliver us from evil
Screaming for your vanity
Will darkness turn to light?

Would you be there should I stumble or fall?
To pick up the pieces

Forget about the shit that we've been through
I want to stay here forever and always
Whoa-oh-oh

I'm not sleeping anymore
Am I falling to pieces?
Will you wake me when it's over?
Nothing makes sense anymore
Am I falling to pieces?
I won't dwell on tomorrow
'Cause it feels like such a waste of time
And it cuts me from the inside
But I know I'm gonna be alright
My eyes are wide open
Sick of going through the motions
You're the gravity that keeps me falling
My eyes are wide open
You're the gravity that keeps pulling me down
Still stuck going nowhere
Been here many times before
Never knowing the reason
Blocking out all the voices
Screaming just to be ignored
Never given a reason

Soaked in red for what she said

Will I just fall to pieces
Or am I all right?
To iron out my creases
You must lacerate me 'til they're gone!
These are my final words to you!
I know you're listening  can you hear me?
The time has come to say goodbye!
These are my final words  to you
The clock is ticking!

Why do I beg for more?
I never thought that this is how I'd hit the floor

Why do I beg for more?
I never thought that this is how I'd
Hit the floor!
You take a look and breathe so sharp
Just a matter of time
Don't scream I ask of you  but then you let one out so now it's time to go
I come down on you like a ton of brick
All over so it's time to go

 cower in shame

 lay it to rest
 savour the taste
 walking away
 provoking its madness
 insanity
 sanity fails
 never again
 provoking reactions
 burying skeletons
 is this the feeling I'm craving?
 I'll...
 no fear
 feeling it resonate
 hearing it fade away
 this is choice that I’m making
 no fear

 inhale the future

We can hold these thoughts I have of you until it comes!
There's no more ways to tell you

We can hold these thoughts I have of you until it comes!
There's no more ways to show you
I just can't take no more
The thought of me inside you
Just makes me sick  you're going down!
There's no more ways to tell you
I want to fuck you now
With every ounce of anger
Looking out standing over the edge
Too numb to feel alive
So why the fuck are these thoughts in my head?
Reach in and pull them out!
Still nothing feels the same
Too late to hesitate
Why can't I run and escape from myself?
And live again!
Why can't I run and escape from myself?
Tell me why I feel like there's no way out
Trying hard to heal as the pain pours out
I don't wanna feel this way but it's hard
Cause I know that in the end
There's no way out
Oh my god is this really the end?
I guess I'm not alright!
I just can't tell what is real anymore
I'm trapped in my own hell!
I know this can't be real
This negativity
Is dominating and smothering me
I just can't breathe!
And I just can't tell what is real anymore
Tell me why I feel like there's no way out
Trying hard to heal as the pain pours out
I don't wanna feel this way but it's hard
Cause I know that in the end
There's no way out
There's nothing left for me
Just tainted memories
There's no one here for me
Just let me be!
Why can't I run and escape from myself
I just can't tell what is real anymore
Tell me why I feel like there's no way out
Trying hard to heal as the pain pours out
I don't wanna feel this way but it's hard
Cause I know that in the end
There's no
No way out!

You still couldn't recognize
That your problem lies within
In a vicious circle
Can you tell me why?
Why you've thrown it all away
'Cause it makes no sense to me
Why you wouldn't listen

I know these words
They won't mean anything
I hope it hurts
You've only got yourself to blame
And I can't take this anymore
I'm over it

When you don't want saving
It's on your head!

Will lead me to tomorrow!
