lyrics
"Got a lot of answers I'm looking for in these meds
'Bout time I talk to somebody  shrink my head
A lot of promises  broken things that were said
And I can't get out of this bed
Got bruises on my heart  plenty scars on my mind
Got blisters under the band-aid over my life
Gonna rip it open and show the world what's there
Lord knows I'm not perfect
When everything around me starts to fall
I rise up again to the call
We're all just a little bit broken (Yeah)
We're all just a little bit hurt (Yeah)
We've all got wounds half open (Yeah)
We all can use a little work
A little work  a little work
I  I have journals of it all  and I  I remember writing to myself throughout  you know  the periods of my life. That's how I can divulge my true feelings because it's been difficult to trust for me in my life. So the paper was always where I could emotionally get to those  those  those crevices  those little corners of feelings. I'm so glad I did it because at least I was checking in with myself. At least I knew that I was becoming a fuck-up.

Gotta wait  first of the month to pick up that check
He bounced  left  it was over  never came back
Had a lot of questions 'bout daddy after he left
Now it's just momma and them kids  and she said
I'll hold her down  don't you worry  we'll find a way
No matter how  I'll make sure the bills get paid
She gave it all and thank God their mouths got fed
She prayed the cycle would end
When everything around me starts to fall
I rise up again to the call
We're all just a little bit broken (Yeah)
We're all just a little bit hurt (Yeah)
We've all got wounds half open (Yeah)
We all can use a little work
A little work  a little work
I had to really work hard at telling the spirits  the visions  to go away. I had to say it out loud: Leave me alone  I choose the good. It was just this epiphany that I had in the  in the war  that I believe in the holy war  the war between good against evil that  that good will always be more powerful.
We're all just a little bit broken (Yeah)
We're all just a little bit hurt (Yeah)
We've all got wounds half open (Yeah)
We all can use a little work
A little work  a little
My grandfather  I always thought he was my guardian angel. My  my Grandpa Gore on my  uh  mom's side. And so I thought that he was leading me  telling me where to go  in the good direction. You gotta honor that part of yourself and let yourself fly  let yourself soar. And that's really taking those steps and getting there are those steps  and that battle  that fight in your mind  it's all here  and it's all internal  and it's making those little  those choices that are the hardest choices to make because they're not comfortable. They don't feel good all the time  making those choices  because they're the right ones to make. I just thought that was so cool  that message that I was getting from it.
I rise up again to the call
We're all just a little bit broken (Yeah)
We're all just a little bit hurt (Yeah)
We've all got wounds half open (Yeah)
We all can use a little work
A little work  a little work
I was living in an alternate  parallel universe to what was really going on in the world. I kept feeling like this weird kinetic energy through my body. Feel it around me  it was all encompassing. It was like this crazy laser camera that was following me. They're watching  everybody's watching. They're all gonna get me  the SWAT team  everything. This was real fear  serious fear.
Sometimes when you feel like you need it
They send in the medic  woah
But if it's your soul that is bleeding
That slow drip won't help it  no
It's time to get up to the front of the line
The guards of the battle and straight for the mind
Well  well  well  well
There's nothing that's holding you down
Stuck on the ground  far from the crown
'Cause you are a warrior more than you know
We're all just a little bit broken (Yeah)
We're all just a little bit hurt (Yeah)
We've all got wounds half open (Yeah)
We all can use a little work
A little work  a little work
A little  a little  a little
 shrink my head
 broken things that were said
 plenty scars on my mind
 a little
 and she said
 I'll make sure the bills get paid
 a little
 woah
 no
 far from the crown
 I  I
 ooh  woah

I had to turn my heart away
Smile like the sun  kisses for real
And tales  it never fails
You're lying so low in the weeds
And I bet you gonna ambush me
Now wouldn't you  Barracuda?
Uh  oh
Ooh
Met the porpoise and me  ah
Whisper game
And if the real thing don't do the trick
Uh  you better make up something quick
Ooh  Barracuda

No  you better make up something quick
Sock it to me  sock it to me
Sock it to me  sock it to me
Sock it to me  oh

You want to know about love?
Saraghina will tell you
If you want to make a woman happy
You rely on what you're born with
Because it is in your blood
Be Italian

Take a chance and try to steal a fiery kiss
Be Italian

Please be gentle  sentimental
Go ahead and try to give my cheek a pat
But be daring and uncaring
When you pinch me try to pinch me where there's fat

 before you go on your ways (Go on your ways)
 don't cry

 serenity
 this must be the end
The smell of your skin lingers on me now
You're probably on your flight back to your hometown
I need some shelter of my own protection  baby
Be with myself and center
Clarity  peace  serenity
I hope you know  I hope you know
That this has nothing to do with you
It's personal  myself and I
We got some straightening out to do
And I'm gonna miss you like a child misses their blanket
But I've got to get a move on with my life
It's time to be a big girl now
And big girls don't cry
Don't cry  don't cry  don't cry
The path that I'm walking  I must go alone
I must take the baby steps 'til I'm full grown  full grown
Fairytales don't always have a happy ending  do they?
And I foresee the dark ahead if I stay

Yes  you can hold my hand if you want to
'Cause I wanna hold yours too
We'll be playmates and lovers
And share our secret worlds
But it's time for me to go home
It's getting late and dark outside
I need to be with myself and center
Clarity  peace  serenity  yeah

Don't cry  don't cry  don't cry
The way you look in the morning
I can see your face and your daze
Our castle is beautiful and strong
I just wanna be close to you
I just wanna be close to you
How you own this body

Sing to me in bed
You hold me like you're protecting your throne
I'll be your queen

And live my hopes and dreams when I'll be dancin'

What's the dilly? You can call me Willy
Or call me Billy
You can call me whatever you like  no  really
Just don't call me up 'cause I got a milli
Young dollars in the bank  gotta be frank
Captain Hook chicks quick to make you walk the plank
Pirates of the Caribbean  I ain't being
Robbed for my dividends for not seeing it coming
I keep moving and running  I keep shooting and gunning
I'm holding it down  I ain't fooling around

Manolo and Louis  it's all I'm thinking of
I already know what my addiction is (Addiction is)

Don't cry  buy a bag and get over it
And I'm not concerned with all the politics (Politics)
It's a lot of men  I know I could find another
All I know is that I'm always happy when I walk out the store
(Store  store)
I guess I'm Supercalifragi-sexy
Nothing to be playing with
Try to walk a mile in my kicks
Love's like a runway  but which one do I love more?
No emotional baggage  just big bags filled with Dior (Oh)

Every day when I wake up
Tryna read my fortune on the bottom of my coffee cup
But it seems like I never finish
It's always half full (Or is it half empty?)
Maybe it's my own superstition or a kind of self protection
Life goes on with or without you
It's up to you what you gonna do
You could go or you could stay
Who cares anyway?
Life goes on with or without you
You could go or you could stay

And then they get fugazi
You call yourself a rider
You need to speed your loyalty up like Bugatti

Wish you could feel it
You would never survive this burning
Fever growing inside this shell that you call a body
What have you done to us?
You know when I'm most insecure
It's fire we're playing with
And I'm like a moth attracted to the flame
And one day when you wake up missing me
'Cause pain is love and love is pain
'Cause pain is love and love is pain
'Cause pain is love and love is pain
'Cause no one else will love you more
And take the pain from your thoughts
And when your world is falling
Maybe I'll let you crawl in
When you can love me all the way
'Cause pain is love and love is pain

I can't stretch enough to be everything to every one

And one day when you wake up missing me

And take the pain from your thoughts
And when your world is falling
Maybe I'll let you crawl in
