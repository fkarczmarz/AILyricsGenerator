lyrics
"Padded by locks  the door knob singed
A rusty close to a door knob hinge
Remembering the sounds
We used to know
But when those sounds sang from our halls
The backstop pressed against bleached walls
Do you remember the sound
Of snow?
And these flames
Boil in reclaim  on the way down
I can follow you
Your heart beats just like I wanted it to
And you want it  too
Oh-whoa  oh-oh oh
On the way down
You might also likeI can follow you
Your heart beats just like I wanted it to
And you want it  too
Oh-whoa  oh-oh oh
Behind the road
You wait for
Love...
So I said follow me down this time
I wrote the rules  but you've got the time
So can you help me?
I've got to break free
From these chains
Oh  from these chains on the way down
I can follow you
Your heart beats just like I wanted it to
And you want it  too
Oh-whoa  oh-oh oh
On the way down
I can follow you
Your heart beats just like I wanted it to
And you want it  too
Oh-whoa  oh-oh oh
Y-yo  oh-oh  oh-oh  oh-oh oh
Y-yo  oh-oh  oh-oh oh  oh...
Your eyes are closed before us
Your sighs are all around
Inside  the walls have fallen
And now you're all alone
I can follow you
Your heart beats just like I wanted it to
And you want it  too
Oh-whoa  oh-oh oh
On the way down
I can follow you
Your heart beats just like I wanted it to
And you want it  too
Oh-whoa  oh-oh oh
Behind the road
You wait for
Love...
Y-yo  oh-oh  oh-oh  oh-oh oh
With gold in my eyes
Are you paying attention?
I was searching for something
As I watched you run
I was sad when you said that you never really wanted some
Were you looking for someone?
As I watched you go
I am mad because I don't know what you used me for
I've been looking for so long
In Amerika
Throw my hands in the air
Flash faded
You know I hate it
It's all it really is
I was searching for something
As I watched you run
I was sad when you said that you never really wanted some
Were you looking for someone?
As I watched you go
I am mad because I don't know what you used me for
Always talking about one day
In Amerika
I've been looking for so long
But you cut me out
Throw my hands in the air 'cause I—

So jealous

As I watched you run
I was sad when you said that you never really wanted some
Were you looking for someone?
As I watched you go
I am mad because I don't know what you used me for
Always talking about one day
In Amerika
In the middle
Life's a riddle
Not a game of dice...
Not for a man who rolls with us
Days turn
Faster than a minute
How was I to know this?
Would you even notice me?
They're imposters
We threw away the time!
Anagram
It's the last
Time around
One of these days I wished you were around
Anagram
If we're just passengers
Then it's the first
Time around
One of these days I wished you were around!
All the people
In white stockings
Talk with pride
They'll be waving all the flags at night
Which will I decide?
Cuz they're imposters...

I'm thinking that it's all the same

I feel this cold inside me
It howls away all through the market
It calls your name
Hoh oh-oh
Hoh oh-oh
On my way to your apartment
I write for fear of silence
You carved a boat to sail my shadow
Now I walk alone
Hoh oh-oh oh
Ooh
I hit the sidewalk
And this is how it starts
Hide in a raincoat
When things are fallin' apart
After leavin' your apartment
I hit the coast by nightfall
So sure to keep you dreamin'
You understood

And this is how it starts

When things are fallin' apart
'Cause sooner or later
This is bound to stop
What we're falling for
After leavin' your apartment
At an art exhibit
On memory lane
You wore those pearls we found on Champs-Elysees
Framed like the golden masters
Forgotten all these years
Pouring like rain
A true thought appears
Oh  the genius of pain
Without a name
Pouring like rain
Cause I'm on my back  on my back again
Words we had to describe the same feeling
Now without a meaning
Cause I'm on my back  on my back again
Looking at a hole in the ceiling
I  I watched the movie of you today
Silver screen adapted from my thoughts on Broadway
You saved the world  we lived in such harmony
Blockbuster sales in twelve countries
Remembered all these years
Falling like rain
A truth that appears

 by the phone
 love
 love
Like a sawed-off shotgun
All the strings that follow you
And the things they're tied to
My love's behind you
Colored by the snow
The shine is gone
I used to know what made you wet
Now I'm searching for it
'Cause it's a mystery all the same
Now to get you back
On holiday
With a broken camera
And all I say
Is I could be happier
I could be happier
It's a mystery night
And I thought we had fun
But in the morning light
Your car's already gone
Do the things I wanna do
Not the ones I'm supposed to
Why can't I get close to
The man I saw in me
When I was young

'Cause I never wanna go away tonight
I never wanna open up my eyes
'Cause I never wanna go away tonight
 losing my mind  losing control
 they're staring at me
 oh-whoa oh  oh

 they're looking for my heart

 to some fortune that
 oh  whoa-oh
 losing my mind  losing control
 to some fortune that

It's been far too long
Crystallized
Round interstellar moons
Seed of light into your atmosphere
What's your world like?
Is the house we built still here?
Girl you know
When the beat of my drum
Meets the beat of your heart
You know I couldn't love
This is where I come from
This is where I belong
With the beat of your drum
Not any other
Fall through the sky
Little specks below
I feel it in my bones
Can you feel it too?
Is this the world I've known?

Meets the beat of your heart
You know I couldn't love
This is where I come from
This is where I belong
With the beat of your drum
And I want you to know you're not alone
Want you to know you're not alone anymore
I'm here with you
When your hands are shaking
I'm here with you
And your heart is racing
I'm here with you
In the darkest shade of blue
Running fast
Out of time
It's a feeling you can't describe
Floating past
A pale skyline
And here you look reflective
But you're so disconnected
Just think about it!
What's really on your mind?
And for you I would steal time
You're a daydreamer
And it's the same thing
O-ver and over!
We're running for our lives
In a slipstream!
You'll wake up someday
And realize you were
Dreaming of a life
You'll forget!
It's so affected
That color corrected night
But you're falling fast
Through plastic skies
And here you look reflective
So disconnected
It's not real life
Open your eyes and breathe
Everything's in its right place
But nothing gold can stay
Just tell me you know my face!

But we feel so alive!
You're a daydreamer
And it's the same thing
O-ver and over!
We're running for our lives
In a slipstream!
You'll wake up someday
And realize you were
Dreaming up a life
Fragile girls and boys
Gather beating hearts
Shattered work of art
I was afraid of the love that you asked for
You asked for
You were the light in my eyes  you're the answer

Love is not a choice

Can you control this sea at night?
T-take cover
Relax your lips
Long blonde hair

Nobody waits nobody calls anymore  talking is dead 
Nobody cares too many thoughts at the door 
It's all in your head
'Cuz these days I've awakened  I've been shaken!
Up in flames
Home  I'm always home...
In time  I could see you break
Burn and see your robbers don't shake
Walking on your tree vines
Tell him that you know your crimes
Oh  I'm always
Home  I'm always...
When the sun has gathered 'round and all is safe
Cross the falls to the southern river where the robbers drank
In time  I could see you shake...

Your toxic perfume
I've passed on now
I don't believe you
I'm in a parachute
Falling in deep
Sleep
Out of control
Can you feel it?
Is this the end of the road?
Falling in deep
Lost in a drea-eam

Staring at me?
I could be free-ee
In a drea-eam
Lay down by the firelight
For all I know it's the last time
Through the night  searching for a
Sign of life  memories of
Fears and strife keep his legs from
Turning blue  broken bones and
Muddy shoes  running through the
Fields I knew  join the ranks of the
Favored few  what have I...
...Become?
Before the day is
Done
Now that we have...
Got what's left  lost my rights when
I was young  taken by the
Ones I trust  long before
I knew of love  all the things
I understood  fighting for
The greater good  now tell me why
This feels so wrong  feels so wrong
To hold this gun  now look what I've

I am a saint drunk on the carpet
I am the master of my universe
Two floors in an old apartment
I will always be my mother's first
Like my father always love to start shit
Me and my lover watch the fireworks
Left the rubber right in my pocket
When I close my eyes
I see I see the light
I'll be I'll be the light
Goodnight
Glory be to God
Glory be to God
Goodnight
Glory be to God
Glory be to God
Maybe I will graduate
Grandma I'm going back to college

All the things that make me hostage
Takes a lifetime to break
All the chains that cut the hardest

Shoot straight right through the target

But when all the gates have closed and you're tired

Familiar figure
Staring right back at me
Split decision
Now my reflection's talking
But I didn't speak
He said oh my god you're piecing it together
You are just a shadow of me
Oh my lord you've never left the mirror
You were never ever free
You will be the chosen master
You will leave with the girl this time
You will be the leading actor
Movie of your own design
And when you hit disaster
The answer will be yours to find
You're the mirror's master
Now forever I'm resigned
Take in the vision
My imperfections shatter in the mirror in me
Another shadow slips in to the chateau
Hoping that I cannot see
I said oh my god I'm piecing it together
You were just a memory
Oh my lord you never left the mirror
You were never ever free
But tonight you will play the tambourine

Mirror ball
Everybody has reason to fall
The world is round
And heavy in my mouth
Living in the past
Time is lost
I know I have made mistakes
Hiding in the dark
The world is small
Through my mirrorball
It's over now
Am I a ghost?
Give me something to hold
Can't fall asleep
You're all I see
Am I a ghost?
Spinning out of control
Looking for some action
Opposite attraction

Fools in a spiral
Round this town of steel
My body tells me no
But I won't quit
'Cause I want more
'Cause I want more
My body tells me no
But I won't quit
'Cause I want more
'Cause I want more
Stop  the train is riding
Down to the station
Where I lived
When I was a cool kid

Oh  it's my road
It's my road  it's my road

It's my road  it's my war
It's my war
It's my war  it's my war
His eyes are open

Oh  'cause I want more

Familiar faces on my wall
This town is strange
Seasons never change
Time is up
The world doesn't stop for anyone
Until the sun dissolves
We all disappear
How does it feel?

God only knows what I would do to you

Pissing away fortunes
They'll be on their skids
Mothers will be tortured
And their dads on pills
Full of disappointment
Cuz they got no skills
Can't fix shit but it'll be okay
When all the money's gone away
And they'll be free
When they're reckless just like me
When they're reckless just like you
You've been stuck inside a dream
The one where you lose all your teeth
And you're in school without your clothes on
But you'll be okay
Everyone I know has got their debt to pay
Are you reckless just like me
Are you ready
Oblivion is coming on

You are the only
Image in my mind
Memorize the lines
And trace them slowly
Photographic soul
Stitch together pieces of a life I'll never know
Panoramic girl
You are just a memory that lives inside my dreams
Fix me in the wash
Strip my colors off
You are the vision
Swimming in my sight
Captured in the light
A crystal prism
Photographic soul
Stitch together pieces of a life I'll never know

Lately I've been fiending
Cause it's over  I'm stupid
Living a lie on my own  so alone
You're calling consistently
But I'm paralyzed on the floor far from you
And lately I've been thinking
I'm not feeling anything at all
Will I survive in the dead of night?
And now the lights are fading faster
Save me from my disaster  my disaster
Lay the lights down low
God only knows I give up to the fire
You didn't always come up from the water
I only thought you were crying from laughter
Saving myself from the mouth of a monster
Paralyzed on the floor again
Baby I've been fiending
And lately I've been thinking
I'm not feeling anything at all
Will I survive in the dead of night?
And now the lights are fading faster
Save me from my disaster  my disaster

Where the waters meet
Lie the days before us
Spinning on repeat
There's darkness through the doorways
Silence in the streets
There's something in the stillness
A distant memory
The world's not empty
It's how you want it to be
Float on an ocean
We're caught up in the motion
So we move
Somewhere in the mountains
And buried in the snow
Life grows underneath us
A thousand leagues below
Sunlight through the window
Spilling on the streets
No stillness in our orbit
We keep spinning
We keep spinning on repeat

Taste of Mezcal on my breath
Let me get this off your chest
Open my mouth  all the gems falling out
Make you lose control

Clothes on the floor  but the bed's on the ceiling

But talk only gets in the way
Rolling our eyes  no more words to describe how we
Lose control

Every little fight is just another night wasted
Are we gonna lose? Is this gonna last?
Think we're gonna break before I get a chance to say this
Don't wanna live without you
Staring in your eyes
Everything simplifies
Leave it all behind
Everything simplifies
All we need is nothing more
When everything simplifies
You and I need nothing more
Everything simplifies
Like the whole world is banging on the door calling

Hoo! Ha! Hoo!
It gets old when you talk to the sun
In a tongue understood by no one
Can it be that I hear what he's saying?
Is there a reason why I'm still awake?
I'll give you something to believe in (Ah-ah ah-ah)
Burn up a basement full of demons (Oh-oh oh-oh)
Now give me something to believe in

Pale as a ghost in the afternoon

Go...
Tell me where you
Walk  without moving at all
Oh  what a pretty high note
Where you run to  I'll go glistening
I should never know that
You were far from me  but here in sin
'Cause I want water where it's
Found  but you know
There  there...
Oh  tell me where you
Go in the night
Shadows are walking on the walls...

Lost in the summer  man  we're burning up
The time don't show when the sun gets carried
The tide curves off your body  oh  you'll stay with me
I-I-I-I-I-I  now I will show you
It's how I lie-ie-ie-ie-ie what no one told you
Oh  what did I say? She's all shook up
Vision by the seaside  we move in our hearts
But I don't know when the fire gets hazy
The flames roll down and off her body  oh  you'll stay with me
I-I-I-I-I  now I will show you
It's how I lie-ie-ie-ie-ie what no one told you
We'll go in the night  wondering why no one told you

And taste the ocean salt when the cold shines
My words are rolling soft down your south side  oh  you wanna?

I’ve lost myself
Deep in the algorithm of someone else
And under new conditions
I might find that I was always perfectly alone
Can somebody walk me home?
To pearly gates
The universe becomes a wave
And crashes down
Forever’s not enough
And under new conditions
You are not alone
Can somebody walk me home?
Can somebody walk me home?
Is anyone out there listening?
I’ve lost myself
But there is a song that echoes like morning bells
And as a distant memory shoots right through me
I am left so perfectly alone

Under the eye of a storm
Rainwater carried his bed
Around the world and back again
Tall and strong as an oak
Rainwater stuck in his head
It filled him with words left unsaid
At night he would dream
Rain's falling
Falling on you...
And the storm it was driving
Wash it away
All the trees on the island
But he washed it away
Crashing rocks by the sirens
It's falling on you
It's falling on you
And the storm it was driving
Wash it away
All the trees on the island
But he washed it away
Crashing rocks by the sirens
It's falling on you
Float on the infinite blue
While rainwater's falling on you
The tide carries
I give up my water and watch you sink in
At night when the coastline
Breaks
You hide in the fallen
Waves
On the rise and the sights of typhoon (Red and blue)
Washing by
And the rise falling in too (We fall through)
Holding tight
And the dull effects of your suitcase
Are casting again...

I was going backwards and I swear I saw me
Talking to Vyasa and he whispered softly
“You were here before in a different body”
Running through the Jungles of the Indus Valley
I was here before in a different body
Nirvana on the last try
Now the lotus flower blooms and the sun is rising
East to the West the event horizon
I smile to Vyasa and he started rhyming
It’s better forever and ever and ever than never enough whatsoever
Running through ruins of the Indus Valley
I was here before in a different body

Chemical is on its way
And my box is packed
Or should I stay? (it's coming)
But who's to say
All we know is
We're here today
Look in my eyes
This is just the reason why I stay
I know there are things we shouldn't say
Blame it on the reason why I came
Maybe cause I couldn't feel the
Pain
Fight the fear
Taste the grip
Feel the slip
Shake the soul
Feel the waves

Giving me waves until the end
