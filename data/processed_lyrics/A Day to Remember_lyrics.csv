" for thee
 and family
 then
 like I make my deals with the devil
 but couldn't reach that next level
 this is no competition to me
 outta mind is what you'll always be
 so I expect nothing less from you
 outta mind is what you'll always be
 so I expect nothing less from you
 you would not exist
 hey!) Still got something left to say
 I take what I need
 and keep away from me
 outta mind is what you'll always be
Playing my songs is the way I cope with life
Won't keep my voice down
Know the words I speak are the thoughts I think out loud
I like to keep things honest
I'd hate to keep you all wondering
Let's leave no words unspoken and save regrets for the broken
Will you even look back when you think of me?
All I want is a place to call my own
To mend the hearts of everyone who feels alone
Woah  you know to keep your
Hopes up high and your head down low
Keep your hopes up high and your head down low
Still got something left to prove  it tends to keep things movin'
While everyone around me says my last days are looming
Overhead  but what the hell do they think they know?
My head's above the water  while they drown in the undertow

All I want is a place to call my own

Woah  you know to keep your
Hopes up high and your head down low
All I want is a place to call my own
To mend the hearts of everyone who feels alone
Woah  you know to keep your
Hopes up high and your head down low
If you take it from me
Live your life for yourself
'Cause when it's all said and done
You don't need anyone else  come on!
So  let's get back to when everything seemed perfect
I'm not afraid of anything  I've got the whole world in front of me
All I want is a place to call my own
To mend the hearts of everyone who feels alone
Woah  you know to keep your
Hopes up high and your head down low
All I want is a place to call my own
To mend the hearts of everyone who feels alone
Woah  you know to keep your
Hopes up high and your head down low!
Keep your head down low!
Keep your head down low!
And all my friends don't give a fuck
Don't tell me that it's just bad luck
Remember when I tried
I never strayed too far from you
Forever by your side
No matter what I was going through
But now  I never know the things to say to you
That help me prove that I'm still on your side
I never show just what you do to me
Guess I was always wrong
I hate this town  it's so washed up
And all my friends don't give a fuck
Don't tell me that it's just bad luck
When will I find where I fit in?
I hate this town
'Cause no one can understand
I just can't be tied down
Nothing comes between me and my plans

To help keep you from me

Or meet me out the back to end it all and start again

Pessimism is a killer

Then we say what we need to say

Why can't we say the things  the things we wish we would?
Why can't we laugh the way  the way we know we should?
Fall under the weight of all the pressure that's misplaced
Flaws that I embrace

You might think it's something spiritual
 my dear  that I'll never leave your side
 how the times have changed
 let's get this straight
 when will they stop falling for this?
 we'll call this a day
 stay in your place
That everything's going as planned
And then everything falls away
Into the darkness of this shallow place
But you should know your fate by now (Fate by now)
But I broke the mold somehow
You keep trying to resolve the past right now
But I swear I'll be the one (Swear I'll be one)
To let the world know what you've done to me
(Let the world know what you've done)
Leave what you need for now
It's not the time or place you're searching for
All I can give them's my worst of intentions
You're nothing to me and everyone can see

Where's my naivety?
Wonder when I'm gonna get taller
Where's my naivety?
Thinkin' back when we were younger
All of the things we believed that we could do
Don't wanna live by fear of failure
Where's my naivety?
Somehow lost along the way
I'm done chasin' things that don't belong to me
What I'm searchin' for grows further out of reach
What I hate about gettin' older
Where's my naivety?
Wonder what it's like not bein' sober
Where's my naivety?

We run this town  and you can't fight us all
We keep 'em coming back for more
Don't think you can hold us down
We'll tear this building down
Try to be careful what you say
Give it up  your tact is astounding
Find your place and leave us with some
Peace of mind
You do this every time
So  here's to another banner year
We've crossed that thin line  don't try to hold us here
If for just this once  you'd think of us
I hope you're happy with yourself
Get up  get out  who's gonna break your fall
When we don't back down  you're gonna seem so small
We keep 'em running for the door
Just wait  things will come back around
It's too late for them  they're headed straight for a melt down
I'm not a part of your cliché

I've never felt the low that I feel tonight
Your words made everything drag on and on
I finally found her
What the fuck am I doing?
I can't tell the difference from wrong and right
I second-guess my decisions
'Cause I haven't been this person in my whole life
I think I need something new here
When I keep longing for what I had
No need for second opinions
Don't think you've got to go it alone here
I've got nothing left to hide
I thought this was what you wanted
Someone who gets everything right
Gets everything right
I thought this was what you wanted
Someone to put you first in their life
'Cause we're running out of time

Something's gotta give
I'm like a time bomb ticking in your head
Paranoia clouding your judgement

Can I fucking live?

Fall when I should run  am I worth a reassemble?
I have come undone  this illness is my crutch
Call out to anyone  am I worth a reassemble?
I toss  turn beneath the waves
A silent victim of the depths
Cast aside I'm scrambling to catch my—
I can't find my way out as I'm descending
My path remains unclear as the water overtakes me
Drowning in my despair
I have come undone  desperate and out of touch

Started out in the spring of 2003
Except to tell me all the things I couldn’t do
Don’t want to hear about it
Got with my guys packed into all our cars
I played a show a night 'till it made me sick
You ain’t here to make no friends
And﻿ I said hey (hey)
I’m right back at it again
I ain’t here to make no friends
Left home with no kinda backup plan
And everyone one that we knew that we couldn’t stand
Don’t want to hear about it
Spent most of our nights sleeping on hardwood floors
Played a show at night 'till it all made sense

Bitch...
Something is so off!
Can we leave it this time?
What did you think?
I thought it was awesome. Leave the 'bitch' please?
You like the 'bitch?'
And right then I knew that everything had changed
A whole side of you that went missing's gone
And all I'd thought of you is wrong
Gotta step away for perspective
Need to take a chance to clear my head
Don't wanna understand your position
Oughta wash my hands of you and run
Think I lost my nerve  like I lost you
Held trapped by what we were
No  I'll never feel the same
Same about you  same about you
No  I'll never feel the same
Same about you  same about you
Spent time today reminiscing
Think I learned a lot about who we are
Couldn't diagnose your condition
But now I see the signs you left behind

'Cause I am just an open book for everyone to see
I always leave empty handed  I can't keep the things that mean the most to me
I'm walking steady on a tightrope clinging only to the words that I wrote
I might be temporarily blind but I'm not stupid
Can you tell me how you feel and look me in the face? (I've always wanted to know)
Nothing ever seems to work when you're around
You always build me up to break me down
I'd give you everything but that would never be good enough and that's alright with me

Let's have some fun and never change up for anyone
Try not to miss me when I'm gone
Woah-oh-oh  woah-oh-oh
I sold my soul to the open road
I'll live my life alone!
You won't find me in the same spot  believe me
I could never stop  my life's turned upside down
Meet me out past the train tracks  I'm leaving
And not coming back  you're right  and I was wrong

I'm gonna need you to try to follow along
I did the best that I could to try to write you songs

I still wish you the best of luck  baby
And don't go thinking that this was a waste of time

No other words need be spoken
And I've got nobody else to blame though I tried
Kept all of our past mistakes held inside
I’ll live with regret for my whole life
I confess that I brought this all on myself
Condemned to suffer alone  like there's nobody else
When you're gone  it's like a whole part of me’s missing
So I'll keep living the lie and just hope that you're listening
