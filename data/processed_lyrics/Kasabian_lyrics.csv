"Dope me up on women and credit cards
Promise X-Ray vision and fancy cars
The tables set for the bourgeoisie
Better get in line with your dinner tray
Cause when it's all ran out and it's just you left
With the nut job swigging his crystal meth
And there's a constant ring of machinery
Is there a place for me in history?
Sending the boys away
Leaving them out to play
Throwing them miles away
Now it's another day
To shelter from the storm
Sending the boys away
Leaving them out to play
Throwing them miles away
Wishing for new year's day
To shelter from the storm

Sons of time are rising  16 minds exploding
It's the 21st century ain't it cool?
It's taught us how to eat and how to drool
And the wind up merchants are out in force
Telling you my brother to change your course
And you won't be the first to think it's wrong
When all you really want is to bang a gong
Cause it's all sewn up in our misery
Is there a place for me in the history?
Sending the boys away
Leaving them out to play
Throwing them miles away
Now it's another day
To shelter from the storm
Sending the boys away
Leaving them out to play
Throwing them miles away
Wishing for new year's day
To shelter from the storm
(Cotton mouth is bleeding)
We gotta break down the walls and shelter from the storm
We gotta break down the walls and shelter from the storm
We gotta break down the walls and shelter from the storm
We gotta break down the walls and shelter from the storm
Sending the boys away
Leaving them out to play
Throwing them miles away
Now it's another day
To shelter from the storm
Sending the boys away
Leaving them out to play
Throwing them miles away
Wishing for new year's day
To shelter from the storm
Love seems to be a distant light
Long was the road for your heart was an illusion
Haven't figured out the way you roll
I'm tired of sleeping in the day
Tried to look the other way
Call my name (all through the night)
Call my name (all through the night)
Down in the woods you can hear the wolves are howling
Climbing up the walls again tonight
Nothing seems as good as it once was
Caught in her electricity

Too hot to touch like a radiator
Smoke's dry  blood on the sofas
And the fast food glows in your Westfield nightmare
Jet packs  life in a simulator
Drip feed and straight to the incubator
We're all high  living on the fumes
I wanna know if you hear the rhythm
I wanna know if you hear them
I wanna know if you hear the rhythm
Out in space
I wanna know  I wanna know
I wanna know if you hear them
Cry me a river
Don't you want the stars in the sky
See  you better rise from the ashes
Don't you wanna try just a little  will ya?
Try just a little  will ya?
Don't ever say we're only human
You're making all the kids feel insecure
Another day  another dollar
And all we ever wanted was a love so pure
So fresh  smile like a navigator
Riled up  jumped up sophisticator
The pound signs were rolling in her eyes

Saying  I just can't stop losing control
I said that I just can't stop losing control

I said that I just can't stop losing control
Trench wander pavement
Trying to score some love
In the corner of the city
Matching faces with fees

Standing with all the whores and cannibals

I met Dali in the street  he knocked me off my feet
Now I start to see that all’s not well
There’s policemen in my bed telling me I’m dead
If only I could show them what I’ve seen
I’ll have to take you down below where insects run the show
Sound and vision turning inside out
The lines make you look older then you’re gone
And everyday I got someone bringing me down
I got the eyes of a madman  I’m chasing round
How does it feel to live your life where nothing is real?
So just send me down the river

We jumped over cemetery gates
There on the wasteland  we saw the horizon
I noticed your pupils dilate
They're at it again  let's roll just like we used to
In fields when we were young our hearts got lost in the circles
We had it all  a rise and fall
Came from the booze and the fags generation
And prayed for the mayhem to start
You said you were foolish but I saw the genius
In pulling the stitches apart
They're at it again  let's roll just like we used to

 I said
Go get yourself outside of your mind
Whether it's right or whether it's wrong
I'm on the treadmill all day long
A true friend is hard to find
Chicken on the high street making you bind
Shimmying up the totem pole
I got sick of the arctic roll
I walked for sixteen blocks
Tiptoed over those burning rocks
You were a household name
Wonder what they say if they knew your game
Let's go daywalking
I heard enough of everybody talkin'
I hear the choir singing
And now the alarm bells are ringin'
Ain't never ever ever gonna top this
And you'll be lucky to survive this

A true friend is hard to keep

Risen from prison an outlaw
Spending our time in the lion's jaw
In the end you sink or swim
Loving more loving come on now
Socially biting your tongue now
Run down oh run down old houses
Feeding the cats to the mouses
Oh take aim now!
Oh take aim now!
Can you see me in the way now
Oh take aim now!
Oh take aim now!
Gotta get us out of here
Drop them and give them star prizes
Lock them away in high rises
Held off and called on by truncheons
Rattling keys to the dungeons

Doberman's asleep
You'll never have to lay your head down here
Watch them disappear
The truth is
They never had no future
They never had no past
I was alone
I was alone again
This beat on London's sky
Whiskey's almost dry
I smile 'cause I've already escaped
Just like to see how far I can take it
They never had no future
They never had no past
I was alone
I was alone again

We spent all our nights drinking Patrón
Under shark infested skies
In your hilltop paradise

Basquiat's hanging on the wall
Sugar daddies at your beck and call

Frightened by shadows in the autumn leaves
We wore stolen hearts  vintage souls
Aided by lies amongst the meat eating foes
And hey ho  where did it go
When did we lose our sight
And it's a nice show
The ones we perform
Performing them day and night
See the lines upon my face
Walking in circles with the human race
And all the little people they want to be free
But I can't get there 'cause I got you holding me back
And hey ho  where did it go
When did we lose our sight
And it's a nice show

Performing them day and night

Are we made of glass?
Play out at the highest levels
Sunken leather sofas
Stop all human interaction
Keep them in their corners
We can start and turn off everything
It’s only then you’ll see your life begin
Save me
From this world
Tell me
‘Cause I need to know

Not the hands controlling
Do you think if we pull out the rug

A wise man told me that we are born with wings
But never taught to fly
Doesn’t that make you wonder why?
Is it to prevent us from falling out of the sky
Or is it to stop us from soaring too high?
So let me ask you this
‘Cause when you look at the man in the mirror
He’s made of nothing but glass
You’re never aware that mountains don’t move themselves
Tectonic plates take something to make them shift
That all it took was a staff to part the Red Sea
All it took was a bus to Montgomery
A single woman who refused to give up her seat
We fought an entire army with a bouquet of flowers back in the ‘70s
But now you’re taught to remain a hamster on a wheel until you run out of energy
Afraid that if you strive for an ideal you end up like a Kennedy
It’s like being on a treadmill every day but never losing any weight
‘Cause to see success the food before you digest has to change
But still afraid to question why
One of the biggest criminals I ever met wore a suit and tie
When did we stop believing?
When did we stop marching?
Who you wanna shoot down? Who you trying to kill?
You've been watching too much TV
It's playing with your memories  it's trying to break your heart
Just calm down  take your medication
It numbs you to the world  not my world
And all the kids  they say
Live to fight another day  live to fight again
And all the kids  they say
There's no life underneath your finger
I dreamt a little bigger  I'm sick and tired of this
If you show us what we can't have
What do you expect when we take it back from you?
'Cause it's no joke  no joke

I wanna make you see the light
