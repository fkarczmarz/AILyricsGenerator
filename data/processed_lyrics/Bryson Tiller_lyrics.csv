lyrics
"For real though
It's so wild now
Woke up in the hills this morning
'Vante Parker in that teal and orange
And Russell in that gold and purple
I used to sit up in my room and ponder
Finished school and get a Doctor's
Man who knew he'd have it figured out?
These fuck niggas saying
And some say there's levels to this shit
Feeling like there's a medal I should get
All these haters getting heavy on my dick
Getting books with my niggas
So how the fuck can people back home say I shook on my niggas?
Your two cents ain't working for me
I don't like commercial niggas
Please shut the fuck up before I hurt you (Fuck your feelings)
Don't take it personal (it's nothing personal)

I said I'm back and I'm so much better
Louis slugger with the hits
Knock them out the park then I'm knocking down your bitch
I'm watching how you pitch
I just talked to Rich 'bout palm trees and bad bitches
And how these snakes can harm me with bad business
I just wish momma was here to live up under chandeliers with us
I guess all I ever had to do was take this shit a little more serious
Let's get it
There's not much to say
God Tiller
I was just thinkin'
We started talkin' like two years ago  three years ago
Uh-huh
Yeah  you know I tried to stop
Yeah  you know I tried
I tried to give you a little less of my time
Startin' to feel like I'm never in my right mind
In my right mind (In my right mind)
Wish you had feelings like mine  baby
Feels like I'm still just a homie (Homie)
No  shawty just don't do it for me (Uh-uh)
You do it for me (Yeah  uh-uh)
Say goodbye

You know I tried  I really tried
Now you're right back on my mind
I feel the time just (Tick-tick-tick-tick-tick) passin' by
Thought this was always forever  so I'm askin'
Why would you lie to me  babe?
You know I was here to stay
Ain't really got much left to say
Overloaded
On all the memories and all the moments  yeah
When I look back to them  it's hard to focus
Oh  I like to imagine the time being frozen (Frozen)
Why? 'Cause you was tired of somebody (Somebody)
I won't say his name  I'm simply tryna forget everything
Since you don't remember anything
 it was almost instant (Oh  girl)
 girl)
 tell me how you feel about it (Oh  girl)
 that's the way it's sounding (Oh  thank God)
 I would've never found this  I doubt it
 you know I gotta keep you around me (You around me)
 blazing these ounces
 baby  no matter what the amount is
 what's changed? (Changed  Young Tiller)
 but
 it's been that way (Ayy  oh yeah)
 I still feel the same (I still feel the same)
 it's always  always
 huh)
 didn't I tell you  girl?)
 I still feel the same (I still feel the same)
 make a difference  but (Yeah)
 I can't complain (Oh)

Say I didn't love you  you know a nigga loved you
Did you forget to mention?
All the things I did for you  times I made a trip
'Cause I know you hate the distance
Baby  it's alright (It's alright)
Go ahead and take your time
But you gotta make your mind
Make your mind up  ooh
Girl  it's on you to tell me what you wanna do
Ayy
Tell me no  tell me somethin'  tell me is it someone?
Seen you claim him pronto  must know somethin' I don't
I can't keep explainin' myself  feels like I'm drainin' myself
I guess there's no one to blame but myself
Got a big Henny cup  thought drinking would help
Been taintin' myself  I'm ashamed of myself
I've been praying for myself like you used to
Embracin' myself  like you do too
I know things is different  your name is different
And as strange as it is  I'm okay with this
And I can't say it different  never even met him
Can't hate the nigga  although I hate the feelin'  I gotta
Although I hate the feelin'  I gotta face the feelin'
I gotta feel that shit
Bury the feelin'  kill that shit
The only way to heal that shit  you know
They won't hear a nigga talk that shit as trill as this
As real as this
I'm feelin' like I still got this
 I been up since 3
 I'ma keep going
 I go to bat for my niggas

Niggas can’t break bread with me (God Tiller)
Grams in a zip lock bag for the time that I spend alone
And I’m just getting stoned (Killer)
Got green like Piccolo
Ya ain't talking money
Then the convo short like Krillin though (Short)
Killer song by the bank
Its killer all (Killer)
Nigga fuck a celebrity status (Wooh)
Long as my money long
Cut me a check I'ma cash it (Cut me a check I'ma cash it)
I don’t pay these niggas no mind
Cause I can’t write that off in my taxes
Headed to the bank just laughing
Ironically I’m from the city of Cassius
I done met a lot of temporary people
Like I’m in the fuckin' temp service
If you ain't real stay away I encourage
All my niggas stay down inverted
Hey save your energy conserve it
Keep your two cents don’t insert it
Check the blueprints I’m in the building

Not to play with you and I  I

Put her guard up for my
I know them niggas watchin'
They been schemin' up and plottin’
They been big shit-talkin' and hatin'
Got a nigga cautious  thinkin' you
Would leave me  trust and believe me
I know this shit is easy  I know they want the Fiji (Want the Fiji)
All them niggas thirsty  but you would never hurt me
Not like how I hurt you  the shit I do is hurtful
You feel like a damn fool
I wish I had a manual to better understand you ('Stand you)
You say I'm a handful  I'm in your head like Cantu
I tell you what I can do
Be a better man to you  this Henny made me ramble
Called and got no answer
Wrote this fuckin' anthem  alert you like it's amber (Like amber)
Distress to my damsel
But she say I'm canceled
I just got back in touch with her
Used to talk a lot  ayy  you still down to ride?
I can't do this hi and bye
Don't see eye to eye but I know that we got time
To fix it  we not blind
Don't know what I'm implyin'
I'm missin' my friend dyin'
Without you  I been tryin'
These bitches  they been wack
Can't take 'em to get prime for dinner  we did that
Can't help it but nitpick the shit that they did lack
Like throwin' that shit back
You know that I miss that
I don't like the wig snatched
No  I like that shit natural
Big mad 'cause I heard a nigga just bagged you
Big mad 'cause you lie about it when I asked you
Fucked on her  but knew it wouldn't last
Even though she came fast  nigga  karma came faster

Why they like to meddle up in what we do?

Shout out my big brother king
Tiller quit playing boy  you got this
Turn up on these niggas  make the knob twist
You know I've been going through a lot of shit
I gotta start thinking 'bout the positives
Came up on a check  I take it to the bank  deposit it
She hate when she tell me one thing and I do the opposite
That's just how I be when I be thinking 'bout the guap and shit
Like I give a fuck 'bout a hater hypothesis
If you putting money up  put your bands on him
That's your best bet  cause the man gon' win
If shit get outta hand  I put my hands on him
Damn  Tiller you went Super Saiyan on them
I'm about that action  put the cam on him
True  nigga all hell broke loose
Live from the motherfuckin' L-O-U
Doing numbers  getting numbers in my cell phone  too
Like viewer discretion
Come through with a weapon
My crew is the shit and your newest sewer the essence
I blew through the finish  ooh but you was in second
I'd do a song or two with you if you was impressive
Cut you a deal on it if that's what you were suggesting
You getting me too congested  I think I need Mucinex
Cause you sicken me  like Can I get a freebie?
Are you kidding me?
I gave your bitch a third of my dick  she want the trilogy
She feeling me
Never met nobody real as me
That's cause most of these niggas weak
Keep the shade coming  boy  you never offending me
And you better watch your bitch  cause yo that's my way of getting even
I call it tricking season  I ball like Reggie Miller
Never been a petty nigga  don't say that for any reason
Nigga it's go time  been that the whole time
Really speaking  and niggas know I did it in no time  ay
I did it in no time ay
Trap$oul on the motherfuckin' way...
