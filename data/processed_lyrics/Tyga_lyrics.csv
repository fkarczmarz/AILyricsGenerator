"You my number one
You a one of one
I wanna go one on one with you
One on one
And I want you to want me too
You a one of one
I wanna go one on one with you
Back to the front with you
Don't let 'em make you regret it  they'll be fake if you let 'em
Don't let 'em make less out of something that means so much to you
I wanna make you feel comfortable
Girl  you know I fuck with you
Like summer school and Lunchables
We the untouchable  yeah
I was made custom for you
Only give my loving to you
You my only one
You my number one
You a one of one
I wanna go one on one with you
One on one
And I want you to want me too
You a one of one
I wanna go one on one with you

Take the thug in me  yeah
And put some in you
Now you wearing bandanas  rocking your man's flannels
Flight to Dubai  gotta pop a Xanax
Mi no love for dem batty boy antics
Gon' make me pull choppers out the attic
I'm a savage  straight savage
Yeah  they laughed at my dreams of livin' lavish
We no pretender  we both remember
All these hoes was ghost 'fore I had the Phantom
Before I rocked rings like Saturn
They ain't wanna hang out when I try to plan it
That's why I give all I have to you
They don't know I got the juice (They don't know)
They don't know I touch the money like masseuse (Dem don't know)
I was made custom for you
Only give my loving to you
You  you my only one
You  you a one of one
I wanna go one on one with you
One on one
You  you a one of one
I wanna go one on one with you
Back to the front with you
Yeah  grind and bump with you
You a one of one
I wanna go one on one with you
Back to the front with you
You a one of one
I wanna go one on one with you
One on one with you
One on one
And I want you to want me too
You a one of one
Wanna be a monument to physical perfection?
You wanna be a shrine? You should be
You wanted change  right?
All you gotta change is that fanny pack  is that what you want? Ah

All in the paper  gettin' buried by a neighbor
While your relatives spendin' all the money that you gave 'em
Fuck it  don't save 'em
Let that boy drown if he don't float  guess he wasn't made for it
My nigga hold it  hold it down
Listenin' to underground
Poppin' uppers 'cause these niggas wanna bring me down
Put your face in the dirt like fourth down
Niggas wan' test  but we'll never fail
I'm layin' low in my day clothes
Can't get a fuckin' meal at Pollo Loco without taking photos
Man  these lil' crazy niggas loco

Deep throat  till the bitch burp
Her best friend said let me at 'em-Cousin Lurch
Smoking on that turf  get your feelings hurt
At your neck like a collared shirt  ball like a Nerf
Word  more green nigga than smoking pot
When I see more  I'm that horror from that little shop
Shop  butcher shop  open up your top
All you see is gold watch  Rolls Royce  road blocks
Sun roof  fogged out  chrome grill  gold mouth

Don't cross me like a pedestrian  I'm getting head watching ESPN

Bringing these groupie bitches around you  they ain't your friends  they're foul
Swear so they tell addresses in your mail first to say: I told you so!
But first off  ain't they all alone?
Not everybody auntie know  we're supposed to be like on the low!
Remember before we've been down this road  tie your flat on the slope
Came to a stop as soon as I spoke  cause you know:
I wanna tell the world about you  but it's like we're sworn to secrecy!
Why do we sacrifice to fall in love so fast?

B-I-G  Finally Famous in this...
Always got the paycheck  never took a pay cut
Payday will be worth all the broke nights I stayed up
So in my cup  I'm mixing up whatever dreams are made of
Not too many young G's made it where I am
So I was waiting on a doctor man  patient as I am
I guess a young D-boy made it into a man
With girls half-naked around like we finna land in the sand
Red-eyes to Rome and they connecting to France
With some bomb-ass pussy  that bitch came straight from Iran
My jewelry made in Japan  I'm off California drugs
And where I made my money  huh? Nigga  all of the above
I could count my inner circle on my hands and my feet
Passing joints long as a branch cause it's family tree
Doing kush-ups man cause the weed too strong
I'm a G + 1
What's that motherfucker? That's gone
Said I'm a G + 1
 kiss me  and lick me

Yea yea love was the mark  bullets to your heart
I want to move on but my feelings too strong
I don’t wanna waste time  I don’t wanna waste time
Man I know we ain’t finished when it’s barely beginning
All the time I done put in  I put in but time was ending
So silly chasing a feeling  figured you felt different
But so many  so many girls but I just stay with ya
See love wasn’t my intention
Rather play Dominoes
Count money with my niggas  shoot dice
And when I said I love you  yeah I fuckin’ meant it
And we ain’t gotta bring your moms and your sister in it
House too big  they all trying to spend the night
You always inviting them and I don’t even be liking it
At all  and I don’t even say shit
‘Cause I just like to see you happy even when you faking it

Trying to forget someone that you love
Like trying to remember someone that you never knew
Think about it  I dream about it
My nightmares haunting me  I can’t sleep about it
The revival  all these verses is my survival
Standing at the podium  waiting on your arrival
One day but no return
Like Usher say  gotta let it burn
The hardest part of dreaming about someone you love
Is waking up to see that person gone
You know it  it it takes seconds to say hello
But forever to say goodbye
Moving on is easy  but what you leave behind
Drop  drop it on the bitch make it nasty

I just get so mesmerized when you up and against that pole
I just wanna take you home
Who are they to criticize
How you decide to make your money
Since I saw you in the corner
Had to let you know I want ya
All these bitches say you bougie
Didn't stop me from approaching
I just won't repeat this night and do it all over again
These are the thoughts in my mind
Hope you don't think I'm crazy
Just don't ever try to play me
These are rules aI'm engaging
I sit back in the back and wait for the perfect time
Seems you don't have the time
Wish I could re-reverse the time
