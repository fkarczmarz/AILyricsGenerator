lyrics
"Are we the generation we've been waiting for?
Following rules that they once disobeyed
They're now being led when they used to lead the way
Do you still believe in all the things that you stood by before?
Are you out there on the front lines or at home keeping score?
Do you care to be the layer of the bricks that seal your fate?
Or would you rather be the architect of what we might create?
Concrete solutions to slow our decay
And when they are gone who the fuck's gonna take their place?
The trusty complicit who collectively ignore
Don't you remember when you were young?
And you wanted to set the whole world on fire
And don't you remember when we were young?
How we wanted to set the world on fire
Because I still am and I still do
To bear the burden of repeating of what we're thinking anyway
Let's raise the stakes on the bet we made
Yeah we still believe in all the things that we stood by before
I know we're not the only ones and we were not the first
As we etched them with our fingers in years of wet cement
We ran like vampires from a thousand burning suns
Maybe we've outgrown all the things that we once loved
A show of hands from those in this audience of one
Where have they gone?
Identities assume us as nine and five add up
Synchronizing watches to the seconds that we lost
We froze but for a moment in empathy
You gave my emptiness a name

Maybe we've outgrown all the things that we once loved
A show of hands from those in this audience of one
Where have they gone?
We raced the sunset and we almost won
Maybe we've outgrown all the things that we once loved
Runaway but what are we running from?
A show of hands from those in this audience of one
Hands armed with broken bottles
Standing no chance to win but
There's a point I think we're missing
It's in the air we raise our fists in
In the smiles we cast each other
About the time we gave up hoping
We'd ever find these locks still open
Stumbling on stones unturned
The lines we cross in search of change
But all they see is treason
Although we have no obligation to stay alive
(Break out) I won't be left here
Behind closed doors
Bonfires burn like beacons
Guiding the lost and weakened
Flames dance on crashing waves
Guiding ships who've gone astray
We've all got better things to do
Answers {are} inches from our face

Blood drips and I let it run
Down my lips into my swollen gums
When hope is non-existent

We never turn our backs or even bite our tongues
Although we have no obligation to stay alive
(Break out) I won't be left here
Behind closed doors
Although we have no obligation to stay alive
(Break out) I won't be left here
Every warning sign ignored
And there's a muffled voice of reason
But we can't make out the words
And though the balance we struck was delicate
There was a sense of right and wrong
We tried to stem this flow with a tourniquet
But now the patient's dead and gone
When we owe more than we're worth
And they're changing the locks on the doors
We raise glasses high to thе bottom line
But on goes the show
When the city streets are barricaded
A chaos we ourselves created
When there's nothing left
When the factories are automated
Broken dreams incorporated

We are children of lesser gods
But we're holding onto this cause
Like palm trees in a hurricane
We chase every second
In clothes that we slept in

Where will you go? (Whoa-oh-oh)
When the factories are automated
Broken dreams incorporated (Whoa-oh-oh)
Nowhere to go
Was this place ever our home?
Were these lines ever our own?
Are we just reading from the pages? Yeah
Just putting on a show?
Will you steer us all to safety
So at least they know you tried?
Broken dreams

It's your buried head so deep in sand that ushered in the virus
Please don't lift a finger
Don't worry about the thoughts
Inside your pretty little head
So we stick to the script and recite your lines
But this is bullshit (Bullshit)
It's finally coming into focus (Focus)
You're lying and I think you know it
But you're too afraid to face the storm you helped create

When our summers grow longer and winters won't snow
From the banks of the ocean and the ice in the hills
To the fight in the desert where progress stands still
When we've lost our will
That's how we'll know
This is cardiac arrest
Of a world too proud to admit our mistakes
We're crashing into the ground as we all fall from grace
When the air that we breathe becomes air that we choke
When the marsh fever spreads from the swamps to our homes
When your home on the range has been torn down and paved
And the buffalo roam to a slaughterhouse grave
What more will it take
For us to know
This is cardiac arrest
Of a world too proud to admit our mistakes

This is a chance to set things straight
To bend or break the rules back into place
We've drawn the line
Glass windows break and it's all about to blow
Lights go out as we pass the torch again
In hope that it stays lit
Neutrality means that you don't really care
Cause the struggle goes on even when you're not there
Blind and unaware
That's how we'll know
This is cardiac arrest
Of a world too proud to admit our mistakes
So ashamed of our tears that we blame only ourselves
That's when they win  they keep us convinced
To lift up our chins  these playing fields are level
We all have a chance  with that they dismiss
The fast lanes they rode
On which access depends on who you know
Or where you came from
Whose daughter are you? Whose fortunate son?
We're told to stick out our thumbs
They feast from the linens while we settle for crumbs
Is this an over-reaching arm?
Or is this compassion?
Is this a handout undeserved
Or a just reparation?
(A just reparation)
All the way from the towers  high above glass ceiling tombs
Tell themselves that they've earned this
By working hard and playing by the rules
But this is only part-true
A dangerous trick played on me and you
And so  like a practical joke
We've pulled on these bootstraps so hard that they broke

And if there's a god  you better pray
That this sleeping giant never wakes
But if we just took a step back
A bigger picture we might view
Perhaps a man in the gutter
Is not so different from you

Voices die to be heard
Years we spent teaching a lesson
We ourselves had never learned
And if strength is born from heartbreak
Then mountains I could move
And if walls could speak I'd pray
That they would tell me what to do

The warning signs were all dismissed or shouted down
So it goes
The kings all failed to tell us
The madmen failed to sell us
On what would then befall the only life we'd know
Were they burning signal fires to guide us to the fields?
Or building funeral pyres? The outcome of a final appeal
The fracturing of all we relied upon
Let's shed this unclean skin and start to feel again
Cause all the shoulders on which to cry are gone
The panic set in like a cancer to our hearts
Spreading through
We bet on finite genius or prayed for gods to save us
We left bodies in the fields
So numb that we forgot how to feel

He looked at the fields and then his hands
All I need is what I have
Then fell a tear of happiness
She watched the world crumble away
Is this the end of yesterday?
All gone are the old guards
Weightless we go forth
On wings of amnesty
That's when she turned to me and said
I'm not sure anymore
And there
Amidst the waves and the cloudless skies
That blanket the year before
I watch my life wash ashore
Have you ever been a part of something
That you thought would never end?
Have you ever felt the weight inside you
Pulling away inside your skin?
And then something had to give
Now the lines are drawn
Is this feeling gone?

All this time spent waking up
Keep this line open to get this call from you
As you speak the words that keep me coming back to you
Now this time it's all different
Now something
Has kept me here too long
Or buckle from the weight
Pretend to laugh  but don't laugh too loud
Do you feel the pressure building?
The anger spilling out now
Meanwhile  the cracks have formed on the masks we've worn up 'til now
We are far from perfect
But perfect as we are
We are bruised  we are broken
But we are goddamn works of art
Works of art
Pieces of our hearts are gravitating together but

Now tell me
Tear through the cavity of my chest
Lights out because the fuse has blown
As their castles crumble slowly
We watch them fall
The crown slips from heads unworthy
As we gain control
This is the family that we crossed or never had
This is a war that was lost the day that it began
And it's the song I sung from the bottom of my heart
That's how we
Read you like a polygraph

And still we dig these trenches
To bury ourselves in them
Backs breaking under tension

Muffled by distances

Up from the dirt
We give it all

The Crescent City sleeps  while giants in the sky
Preparing to unleash  let loose a mighty cry
Can nobody save us? Will anyone try?
The bayou is burning  the cypress has died
And all alone they're saying
Help is on the way (They said  they said)
Help is on the way (They said  they said)
Help is on the way
Five thousand feet below  as black smoke engulfs the sky
The ocean floor explodes  eleven mothers cry

Her words pierce the dark night  Does anyone care?

Well  what would you say  if I said that you could?
Just carry this gun  you'll even get paid
I said  That sounds pretty good
Black leather boots  spit-shined so bright
They cut off my hair  but it looks alright
We marched and we sang  we all became friends
As we learned how to fight
A hero of war
Yeah  that's what I'll be
And when I come home
They'll be damn proud of me
I'll carry this flag
To the grave if I must
'Cause it's a flag that I love
And a flag that I trust
I kicked in the door  I yelled my commands
The children  they cried  but I got my man
We took him away  a bag over his face
From his family and his friends
They took off his clothes  they pissed in his hands
I told them to stop  but then I joined in
We beat him with guns  and batons not just once
But again and again

She walked through bullets and haze
I asked her to stop  I begged her to stay
But she pressed on  so I lifted my gun
And I fired away
And the shells jumped through the smoke
And into the sand that the blood now had soaked
She collapsed with a flag in her hand
A flag white as snow
A hero of war
Is that what they see?
Just medals and scars
So damn proud of me
And I brought home that flag
Now it gathers dust
But it's a flag that I love
It's the only flag I trust

Have you seen the world?
Well  what would you say
I'm falling overboard  in the waves
In over my head and she's a high tide
That keeps pushing me away
I thought that we would build this together
But everything I touch just seems to break
Am I your sail or your anchor?
Am I the calm or the hurricane?
I feel the ground start to shake
I hear a voice shouting  Move!
But there is no fucking way I'd leave you
So I'll just hold you like a hand grenade
You touch me like a razor blade
I wish there was some other way right now
Like a house on fire we're up in flames
I'd burn here if that's what it takes
To let you know I won't let go of you
But is the soundtrack to our lives
The bang of a slamming door?
What happens when we all start to feel like
Nothing matters anymore?
Every day like a chambered round
A trigger pulled  a hammer click
A breath we hold  a world outside I can't control

We count the days scratching lines on the wall
Wait in the wings at someone's beck and call
No longer recognize the place that I call home
No longer recognize this face as my own
We backed down
We took no for answers far too long
We felt those walls close around
I don't wanna be here anymore
I don't wanna be here anymore
I don't wanna be here anymore (Be here anymore)
I know there's nothing left worth staying for
I'm listening with one foot out the door
And something has to die to be reborn

And weathered every day like passing storms

And when night covers the sky you find yourself doing the same
It's a burden you've been burying in spite of all your prayers

What it's like to care?
Give me what's left of my life
Don't let me go
On my own I'm finally free

They told us every day
There's a land of milk and honey
And it's not that far away
But the finish line kept movin'
And the promises wore thin
And the smoke on the horizon
Was the burning promised land
And this place used to be somewhere
But they sold it out from under us
Our voices all ignored
We are the nowhere generation
We are the kids that no one wants
We are a credible threat to the rules you set
A cause to be alarmed
And we are not the names that we've been given
We speak a language you don't know
We are the nowhere generation
And yet we climb these burning ladders
Still we raise for them the hammers
Swinging low
And what exactly are we after?

Just before you go
I've watched you fly on paper wings
Halfway 'round the world until they burned up in the atmosphere
Sent you spiraling down
Landing somewhere far from here
With no one else around
To catch you falling down
And I'm looking at you now
And I can't tell if you're laughing
Between each smile there's a tear in your eye
There's a train leaving town in an hour
It's not waiting for you and neither am I
But that was a conversation you took nothing from
So raise your glass now
Let's celebrate exactly what you've done
Just put off another day of knowing where you're from

And I can't tell if you're laughing

There's a train leaving town in an hour
And the walls of my house are so thick
I hear nothing at all
I followed you out in the storm
But it carried you off
And I burned every picture of yours
Was that not enough?
My gun is bigger than yours
So let's arm the masses
And see what the bastards do then
Walking tall once set us apart
Now we're down on all fours
Do you cry my name in the dark
Like I do yours?
These storms are getting stronger now
Trusses all bend and sway
As the waves crash high
And the shoreline disappears
I will scream to the sky

May you be in Heaven before the Devil knows you're dead
May these winds be always at your back
'Cause when we're all just ghosts
And the madness overtakes us
We will look at the ashes
From the penthouse to the holy martyr
Sea to shining sea
From the coffins full of kindergartners
Is this what you call free?
From the hate that drips from all your crosses
Are your hands so clean?
There's a wildfire and it's spreading far
From sea to shining sea
When we're all just ghosts
And the madness overtakes us
I will scream to the sky

Before we packed our bags
And left all this behind us in the dust
We had a place that we could call home
And a life no one could touch

To the rhythm of the awful rusted machines
We toss and turn but don't sleep
Each breath we take makes us thieves
Like causes without rebels
Just talk but promise nothing else
We crawl on our knees for you
Under a sky no longer blue
We sweat all day long for you
But we sow seeds to see us through
'Cause sometimes dreams just don't come true
We wait to reap what we are due

And the blare of the sirens combing the streets

I think I'm at the edge now but I could be wrong
A blur is all that's seen

It all came clear to me
I found a shoulder to lean on
An infallible reason to live all by itself
I took one last look from the heights that I once loved

What the color of her eyes were and her scars or how she got them
As the telling signs of age rain down  a single tear is droppin'
Through the valleys of an aging face  that this world has forgotten
There is no reconciliation that will put me in my place
And there is no time like the present to drink these draining seconds
But seldom do these words ring true when I'm constantly failing you
Walls that we just can't break through until we disappear

The speakers gently seeped with sounds
Of ambient keyboards and light percussion
Creating a seductive soundtrack to our midnight drive
Through curtains of blackness
The windows were cold to the touch
Reflecting the icy conditions in our immediate extremity
Salt stains and fingerprints littered the glass
And streaks of melting snow cascaded down its length
Like the far away squeal of a pot of boiling water
The skyline was glowing faintly with vague hints of an impending dawn
The car raced along a painfully straight stretch of road
And she hadn't so much as turned the steering wheel
Two degrees in the last twenty minutes
Nor had we spoken
Why are you doing this? she spoke as if not expecting a response
Her voice penetrated the still air of our speechless drive
So suddenly that my heart had jumped
As a tear formed in the pit of her eye
The music poured through the speakers and
We were losing ourselves in the cadence
She looked down momentarily and closed her eyes for
A bit longer than a standard blink
Then she was crying. Then she was shouting. Then I was shouting
We barely even knew the questions

But emptiness is growing so old

They shimmer and they dance on the walls
We're lost inside these caves as the chances of escape
Grow slimmer 'til there's no chance at all

Choking on those stories I've told

What I could not do I faked
I dug  seeking treasure
Just to wake up in an early grave

Out with the old dreams I've borrowed
The path I carve from here on out will be my own

And the chorus plays like a sink that drips

To know just where you have been
But we're old enough to know that
What has been will be again
And the bravest of faces
Are the ones where we fake it
In the roles that we play
Nothing matters when the pain is all but gone
When you are finally awake
And when they see you crack a smile
And you decide to stay awhile
You'll be ready then to laugh again
Nothing matters but the pain
You see what you want to see
Nothing matters but the pain (We are misery and distant memories)
Nothing matters but the pain
We all learn to laugh again
Tell me there's a reason
To take another step
To get up off my knees and
Follow this path of most resistance
And wherever it takes us
Whatever it faces and wherever it leads
So wake me when it's through
I don't want to feel the things that you do (the things that you do)
Don't worry I'll be fine
Do you believe we'll ever make it?
Do you think we'll ever really see?
So wake me when it's through
I don't want to feel the things that you do (the things that you do)
Don't worry I'll be fine

Wake me up inside
These dreams all die if we let them
Wake me up inside
Today won't start if we just give in
(Cause you'll be anything)
Just wake me when it's through
I don't want to feel the things that you do (the things that you do)
Don't worry I'll be fine
Do you see the world in black and gray?
Wait for me now?
Take off this crown
To break all these vows
Don't you know?
Wait for me now
Air's running out
The promise of safe return I delivered
But the ocean is wider than I first guessed
When roads disappeared I followed the rivers
But somehow got in over my head
So a deep breath I'm taking
Wait for me now?
Take off this crown
To break all these vows
Don't you know?
Wait for me now
Air's running out

A lost dream of what could have been
The key turns to find the locks have changed
In time to hear the back door slam
A sound that to this day I can't forget
The colors drained to black and gray
Oh...
Wait for me now?
Take off this crown
To break all these vows
Don't you know?
Wait for me now
Air's running out
In flyover country he sings
Charmed like a snake in a basket
Should be curled up and ready to spring
We're raising our cross just to burn it
The clergy are selling their souls
Clearing a path  ignoring the facts
Intoxicated by the throne
We'll be standing here holding our ground  come what may
Like a ghost haunts from beyond the grave
Welcome to the breakdown
Welcome to the end of the road
Welcome to the breakdown
We've got nowhere else to go
When we all go deaf in the chamber of echoes
Cheering the missile parade
Agreeing to let all the banks rob the people
Together we circle the drain

Welcome to the breakdown
Welcome to the end of the road
This is a breakdown
And we've got nowhere else to go
It’s a game  you’ve been played
It’s a flock  you’re the sheep
It’s a pied-piper song that has lulled you to sleep
A hand that you shook that then gave you the finger
A fraud and a fake  a cowardly king
A lie to your face  but you still kiss the ring
This is the breakdown  this is the breakdown
This is the breakdown!
Standing here holding our ground  come what may
Like a ghost haunts from beyond the grave
Welcome to the breakdown
Welcome to the end of the road
This is a breakdown
And we've got nowhere else to go
Welcome to the breakdown
Welcome to the end of the road
This is a breakdown
And we've got nowhere else to go
It's not much  but this is home
The smoke you’ve ignored is a flame you can’t contain
We circle the walls and claw at the dirt
We growl from our guts and howl until it hurts
I told her to come with me
And I can take you from this place now
Somewhere these roads all go
Someplace so we can start again
I grabbed her hand and pulled her close
She looked at me and said
“Hey I don’t even know
Your name”
“But are you ready to explode?
Like a tiger in a circus?
Cracking whips are all I know
And searching for a sense of purpose”
We are the wolves at the gates
But you can’t fight us alone no

But now you’ve given me a purpose

Roaming in numbers
And chasing the scent
Circling in for the kill
And you are the winter
The long discontent
We won’t stop till we’ve had our fill

We are the wolves!
We are the wolves!
We are the ones in competition but claim this ain't no race
Let's go!
Take a breath and explode like bullets tearing through the wind
Cut me up with a razor blade that tries to separate the skin
Now in the
White flames of burning flags we
We've been battered so hard that we don't feel anymore
Take me
From this world
Save me
What if we all die young?
So take me
From this world
Save me
What if we all die young?
Send me off on the morning breeze so far away from here
Feel me rise in the strength I've found inside the warm embracing air
I'm moving slow
Like a glacier melting watch me dissipate
I searched for love in an empty world but all I found was hate
Now in the
White flames of burning flags we
We've been battered so hard that we don't feel anymore

In the wreckage of a job well done
And that moment I refused to close my eyes anymore
So take me
