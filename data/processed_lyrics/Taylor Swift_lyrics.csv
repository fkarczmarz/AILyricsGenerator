lyrics
"Wondered how many girls he had loved and left haunted
Like a vendetta-ta
Touch me and you'll never be alone
I-Island breeze and lights down low
No one has to know
Are you ready for it?
Knew I was a robber first time that he saw me
Stealin' hearts and runnin' off and never sayin' sorry
We'll move to an island and
Every love I've known in comparison is a failure

Touch me and you'll never be alone
I-Island breeze and lights down low (Low)
No one has to know (No one has to know)
In the middle of the night (The night) in my dreams (My dreams)
Are you ready for it? Oh
Are you ready for it?
Let the games begin
Let the games begin
Let the games begin
Touch me and you'll never be alone
I-Island breeze and lights down low
No one has to know
In the middle of the night
Let the games begin
Let the games begin
Are you ready for it?
Let the games begin
Let the games begin
But somethin' 'bout it felt like home somehow
And I left my scarf there at your sister's house
And you've still got it in your drawer  even now
Oh  your sweet disposition and my wide-eyed gaze
We're singin' in the car  getting lost upstate
Autumn leaves fallin' down like pieces into place
And I can picture it after all these days
And I know it's long gone and
That magic's not here no more
And I might be okay  but I'm not fine at all
'Causе there we arе again on that little town street
You almost ran the red 'cause you were lookin' over at me
Wind in my hair  I was there
I remember it all too well
Photo album on the counter  your cheeks were turnin' red
You used to be a little kid with glasses in a twin-sized bed
And your mother's tellin' stories 'bout you on the tee-ball team
You taught me 'bout your past  thinkin' your future was me
And you were tossing me the car keys  Fuck the patriarchy
Keychain on the ground  we were always skippin' town
And I was thinkin' on the drive down  Any time now
He's gonna say it's love  you never called it what it was
'Til we were dead and gone and buried
Check the pulse and come back swearin' it's the same
After three months in the grave
And then you wondered where it went to as I reached for you
But all I felt was shame and you held my lifeless frame

And I know it's long gone and
There was nothing else I could do
And I forget about you long enough
To forget why I needed to
'Cause there we are again in the middle of the night
We're dancin' 'round the kitchen in the refrigerator light
Down the stairs  I was there
I remember it all too well
And there we are again when nobody had to know
You kept me like a secret  but I kept you like an oath
Sacred prayer and we'd swear
To remember it all too well  yeah
But maybe this thing was a masterpiece 'til you tore it all up
Runnin' scared  I was there
I remember it all too well
And you call me up again just to break me like a promise
So casually cruel in the name of bein' honest
I'm a crumpled-up piece of paper lyin' here
They say all's well that ends well  but I'm in a new hell
Every time you double-cross my mind
You said if we had been closer in age  maybe it would've been fine
And that made me want to die
The idea you had of me  who was she?
A never-needy  ever-lovely jewel whose shine reflects on you
Not weepin' in a party bathroom
Some actress askin' me what happened  you
That's what happened  you
You who charmed my dad with self-effacing jokes
Sippin' coffee like you're on a late-night show
But then he watched me watch the front door all night  willin' you to come
And he said  It's supposed to be fun turning twenty-one
Time won't fly  it's like I'm paralyzed by it
I'd like to be my old self again  but I'm still tryin' to find it
After plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own
Now you mail back my things and I walk home alone
But you keep my old scarf from that very first week
'Cause it reminds you of innocence and it smells like me
You can't get rid of it
'Cause you remember it all too well  yeah
'Cause there we are again when I loved you so
Back before you lost the one real thing you've ever known
It was rare  I was there
I remember it all too well
Wind in my hair  you were there
You remember it all
Down the stairs  you were there
You remember it all
It was rare  I was there
I remember it all too well
And I was never good at tellin' jokes  but the punch line goes
I'll get older  but your lovers stay my age
From when your Brooklyn broke my skin and bones
I'm a soldier who's returning half her weight
And did the twin flame bruise paint you blue?
Just between us  did the love affair maim you too?
'Cause in this city's barren cold
I still remember the first fall of snow
And how it glistened as it fell
I remember it all too well
Just between us  did the love affair maim you all too well?
Just between us  do you remember it all too well?
Just between us  I remember it (Just between us) all too well
It was rare  you remember it all too well
It was rare  you remember it (All too well)

Midnights become my afternoons
When my depression works the graveyard shift  all of the people
I've ghosted stand there in the room
I should not be left to my own devices
They come with prices and vices
I end up in crisis
(Tale as old as time)
I wake up screaming from dreaming
One day  I'll watch as you're leaving
'Cause you got tired of my scheming
(For the last time)
It's me  hi
I'm the problem  it's me
At teatime  everybody agrees
I'll stare directly at the sun  but never in the mirror
It must be exhausting always rooting for the anti-hero
Sometimes  I feel like everybody is a sexy baby
And I'm a monster on the hill
Too big to hang out  slowly lurching toward your favorite city
Pierced through the heart  but never killed

I have this dream my daughter-in-law kills me for the money

Love's a game  wanna play? Ayy
New money  suit and tie
I can read you like a magazine
Ain't it funny? Rumors fly
And I know you heard about me
I'm dying to see how this one ends
Grab your passport and my hand

So it's gonna be forever
Or it's gonna go down in flames?

To cage you

I just learned these people try and save you
'Cause they hate you
Too high a horse
For a simple girl
To rise above it
They slammed the door
On my whole world
The one thing I wanted

Than listen to one more second of all this bitchin' and moanin'
I'll tell you something 'bout my good name
It's mine alone to disgrace
I don't cater to all these vipers dressed in empath's clothing
God save the most judgmental creeps
Who say they want what's best for me
Sanctimoniously performing soliloquies I'll never see
Thinkin' it can change the beat
Of my heart when he touches me
And counteract the chemistry
And undo the destiny
You ain't gotta pray for me
Me and my wild boy and all of this wild joy
If all you want is gray for me
There's a lot of people in town that I
Bestow upon my fakest smiles
We came back when the heat died down
Went to my parents and they came around
Now I'm dancin' in my dress in the sun and
Even my daddy just loves him
I'm his lady
I'll tell you something right now
You ain't gotta pray for me
Me and my wild boy and all of this wild joy
If all you want is gray for me
I'm having his baby
But you should see your faces
Fever dream high in the quiet of the night
You know that I caught it (Oh yeah  you're right  I want it)
Bad  bad boy  shiny toy with a price
You know that I bought it (Oh yeah  you're right  I want it)
Killing me slow  out the window
I'm always waiting for you to be waiting below
Devils roll the dice  angels roll their eyes
What doesn't kill me makes me want you more
And it's new  the shape of your body
It's blue  the feeling I've got
And it's ooh  woah-oh
It's a cruel summer
It's cool  that's what I tell 'em
No rules in breakable heaven
But ooh  woah-oh
It's a cruel summer with you
Hang your head low in the glow of the vending machine
I'm not dying (Oh yeah  you're right  I want it)

Another summer takin' cover  rolling thunder
He don't understand me
Splintered back in winter  silent dinners  bitter
He was with her in dreams
Gray and blue and fights and tunnels
Handcuffed to the spell I was under
For just one hour of sunshine
Years of labor  locks  and ceilings
In the shade of how he was feeling

Now  pretty baby  I'm runnin'
To the house where you still wait up and that porch light gleams (Gleams)
To the one who says I'm the girl of his American dreams
And no matter what I've done  it wouldn't matter anyway
Ain't no way I'm gonna screw up now that I know what's at stake here
At the park where we used to sit on children's swings
Wearing imaginary rings
He sent me Downtown Lights
I hadn't heard it in a while
My boredom's bone-deep
This cage was once just fine
Am I allowed to cry?
I dream of crackin' locks
Throwin' my life to the wolves or the ocean rocks
I'm seeing visions
Am I bad or mad or wise?
What if he's written mine on my upper thigh only in my mind?
One slip and fallin' back into the hedge maze
I keep recalling things we never did
Without ever touchin' his skin
How can I be guilty as sin?
I keep these longings lockеd
Only your actions talk
These fatal fantasies
We've already done it in my head
If it's make-believe
Why does it feel like a vow we'll both uphold somehow?

I close my eyes and the flashback starts
I'm standing there
On a balcony in summer air
See you make your way through the crowd
Little did I know
And I was crying on the staircase
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
So I sneak out to the garden to see you
We keep quiet 'cause we're dead if they knew
So close your eyes

You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess

Wondering if you were ever coming around

When I met you on the outskirts of town and I said
Is this in my head? I don't know what to think
I love you and that's all I really know
 we make the rules
 ah
 we make the call
 ah
 will you please stand?
 ah
We were cleaning incense off your vinyl shelf
'Cause we lost track of time again
Laughing with my feet in your lap
Like you were my closest friend
I see you every day now
And I chose you
The one I was dancing with
Looked up at the sky and it was
The burgundy on my t-shirt
When you splashed your wine into me
And how the blood rushed into my cheeks
The mark thеy saw on my collarbone
The rust that grew bеtween telephones
The lips I used to call home
When the silence came
How the hell did we lose sight of us again?
Sobbing with your head in your hands
Ain't that the way shit always ends?
You were standing hollow-eyed in the hallway
The rubies that I gave up

The voices in his head
Called the rain to end our days of wild
The sickest army doll
Purchased at the mall
Rivulets descend my plastic smile
But you should've seen him when he first got me
'Cause it fit too right  puzzle pieces in the dead of night
There was a litany of reasons why
We could've playеd for keeps this time

I felt more when we played pretend

'Cause he took me out of my box
Stole my tortured heart
Left all these broken parts
Told me I'm better off
But I'm not
I heard from everybody
You part the crowd like the Red Sea
Don't even get me started
Did you get anxious though
On the way home?
Now that we don't talk
You grew your hair long
You got new icons

Was to turn into a shrouded mystery
Just like I had been when you were chasing me
I wanna find you in a crowd just to hide from you

Cheeks pink in the twinklin' lights
Tell me 'bout the first time you saw me

Pulled him in tighter each time he was driftin' away
My spine split from carrying us up the hill

I knew I'd curse you for the longest time
Chasin' shadows in the grocery line
I knew you'd miss me once the thrill expired
And you'd be standin' in my front porch light
And I knew you'd come back to me
You'd come back to me
And you'd come back to me
And you'd come back
And when I felt like I was an old cardigan
Under someone's bed
So you could sit there in this hurt
Bustling crowds or silent sleepers
You're not sure which is worse
Because I dropped your hand while dancing
Left you out there standing
Crestfallen on the landing
Champagne problems
Your mom's ring in your pocket
My picture in your wallet
Champagne problems
You told your family for a reason
You couldn't keep it in
Your sister splashed out on the bottle
Now no one's celebrating
No crowd of friends applauded
Your hometown skeptics called it
Champagne problems
Love slipped beyond your reaches
And I couldn't give a reason
Champagne problems

Your Midas touch on the Chevy door
November flush and your flannel cure
This dorm was once a madhouse
Don't think we'll say that word again
And soon they'll have the nerve to deck the halls
That we once walked through
I never was ready so I watch you go
Sometimes you just don't know the answer
'Til someone's on their knees and asks you
She would've made such a lovely bride
But you'll find the real thing instead
She'll patch up your tapestry that I shred
And hold your hand while dancing
Never leave you standing
Crestfallen on the landing
With champagne problems
Your mom's ring in your pocket
Her picture in your wallet
You won't remember all my
Champagne problems
You won't remember all my
With his arms around your body
Laughin'  but the joke's not funny at all
And it took you five whole minutes
To pack us up and leave me with it
Holdin' all this love out here in the hall
I think I've seen this film before
And I didn't like the ending
You're not my homeland anymore
So what am I defending now?
I think I've seen this film before
I can see you starin'  honey
Like he's just your understudy
Like you'd get your knuckles bloody for me
Balancin' on breaking branches
Those eyes add insult to injury

So step right out  there is no amount
Of crying I can do for you
All this time
We always walked a very thin line
You didn't even hear me out (You didn't even hear me out)
You never gave a warning sign (I gave so many signs)

Where I used to read at Centennial Park
I used to think I would meet somebody there
Teal was the color of your shirt
When you were sixteen at the yogurt shop
You used to work at to make a little money
Were there clues I didn't see?
And isn't it just so pretty to think
All along there was some
Invisible string
Tying you to me?
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Bad was the blood of the song in the cab
On your first trip to LA
You ate at my favorite spot for dinner
Bold was the waitress on our three-year trip
Getting lunch down by the Lakes
She said I looked like an American singer

Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
A string that pulled me
Something wrapped all of my past mistakes in barbed wire
Chains around my demons
Wool to brave the seasons
One single thread of gold
Tied me to you
Cold was the steel of my axe to grind
For the boys who broke my heart
Now I send their babies presents
Gold was the color of the leaves
When I showed you around Centennial Park
Gave me the blues and then purple-pink skies
And isn't it just so pretty to think
All along there was some

And if I'm on fire  you'll be made of ashes  too
Even on my worst day  did I deserve  babe
All the hell you gave me?
'Cause I loved you  I swear I loved you
'Til my dying day
I didn't have it in myself to go with grace
And you're the hero flying around  saving face
And if I'm dead to you  why are you at the wake?
Cursing my name  wishing I stayed
Look at how my tears ricochet
We gather stones  never knowing what they'll mean
Some to throw  some to make a diamond ring
You know I didn't want to have to haunt you
But what a ghostly scene
You wear the same jewels that I gave you
As you bury me
I didn't have it in myself to go with grace
'Cause when I'd fight  you used to tell me I was brave
And if I'm dead to you  why are you at the wake?
Cursing my name  wishing I stayed

And I can go anywhere I want
Anywhere I want  just not home
And you can aim for my heart  go for blood
But you would still miss me in your bones
And I still talk to you (When I'm screaming at the sky)
And when you can't sleep at night (You hear my stolen lullabies)
I didn't have it in myself to go with grace
And so the battleships will sink beneath the waves
You had to kill me  but it killed you just the same
Cursing my name  wishing I stayed
You turned into your worst fears
And you're tossing out blame  drunk on this pain
Crossing out the good years
And you're cursing my name  wishing I stayed
I hit my peak at seven
Feet in the swing over the creek
I was too scared to jump in
With Pennsylvania under me
Are there still beautiful things?
Sweet tea in the summer
And though I can’t recall your face
I still got love for you
Your braids like a pattern
Love you to the Moon and to Saturn
Passed down like folk songs
The love lasts so long
And I've been meaning to tell you
I think your house is haunted
Your dad is always mad and that must be why
And I think you should come live with me
And we can be pirates
Then you won't have to cry
Or hide in the closet
And just like a folk song
Our love will be passed on

Before I learned civility
I used to scream ferociously
Any time I wanted
Sweet tea in the summer
And though I can't recall your face
I still got love for you
Pack your dolls and a sweater
We'll move to India forever
Passed down like folk songs
Been saying yes instead of no
I thought I saw you at the bus stop  I didn't though
I hit the ground running each night
I hit the Sunday matinée
You know the greatest films of all time were never made
I guess you never know  never know
And if you wanted me  you really should've showed
And if you never bleed  you're never gonna grow
And it's alright now
But we were something  don't you think so?
Roaring twenties  tossing pennies in the pool
And if my wishes came true
It would've been you
In my defense  I have none
For never leaving well enough alone
But it would've been fun
If you would've been the one
(Ooh)
I have this dream you're doing cool shit
Having adventures on your own
You meet some woman on the internet and take her home
We never painted by the numbers  baby
But we were making it count

Her saltbox house on the coast took her mind off St. Louis
Bill was the heir to the Standard Oil name and money
And the town said  How did a middle-class divorcée do it?
The wedding was charming  if a little gauche
There's only so far new money goes
They picked out a home and called it Holiday House
Their parties were tasteful  if a little loud
The doctor had told him to settle down
It must have been her fault his heart gave out
And they said
There goes the last great American dynasty
There goes the maddest woman this town has ever seen
She had a marvelous time ruining everything
Rebekah gave up on the Rhode Island set forever
Flew in all her Bitch Pack friends from the city
Filled the pool with champagne and swam with the big names
And blew through the money on the boys and the ballet
And losing on card game bets with Dalí

Pacing the rocks  staring out at the midnight sea
And in a feud with her neighbor
She stole his dog and dyed it key lime green
Fifty years is a long time
Holiday House sat quietly on that beach
Free of women with madness  their men and bad habits
And then it was bought by me
There goes the loudest woman this town has ever seen

I wake and watch you breathin' with your eyes closed
I sit and watch you
I notice everything you do or don't do
I wait by the door like I'm just a kid
Use my best colors for your portrait
Lay the table with the fancy shit
And watch you tolerate it
Tell me I've got it wrong somehow
I know my love should be celebrated
But you tolerate it
I greet you with a battle hero's welcome
I take your indiscretions all in good fun
I sit and listеn
I polish plates until they gleam and glistеn

If we know the steps anyway?
We embroidered the memories of the time I was away
I thought I was better safe than starry-eyed
I felt aglow like this
Never before and never since
You and I go from one kiss to getting married
Never quite buried
You said I'm the love of your life
About a million times
Who's gonna tell me the truth when you blew in with the winds of fate
And told me I reformed you?
When your impressionist paintings of heaven turned out to be fakes
A con man sells a fool a get-love-quick scheme
But I've felt a hole like this
Never before and ever since

What we thought was for all time was momentary
Never quite buried
You cinephile in black and white
All those plot twists and dynamite
You said I'm the love of your life
You shit-talked me under the table
Talkin' rings and talkin' cradles
I wish I could un-recall
How we almost had it all
Dancing phantoms on the terrace
Are they second-hand embarrassed
That I can't get out of bed
'Cause something counterfeit's dead?
It was legendary
It was momentary
It was unnecessary
Should've let it stay buried
What a bland goodbye
The coward claimed he was a lion
I'm combing through the braids of lies
Our field of dreams engulfed in fire
And I'll still see it until I die
 clink  being this young is art
 moonlit swimmin' pool
 went straight to my head
 you won't
 he's waitin' there
 that was my crime
 then he's pullin' me in
 he's a gentleman
 went straight to my head (Straight to my head)
 I guess
 this is luxury
 it's a big mistake
 It might blow up in your pretty face
 Do it anyway (Do it anyway)"
