lyrics
"Then you cut me down
A north wind on a garden growing
You made me think you were mine
Then you changed your mind
I'm lost as a feather
In a hurricane
There's no way to measure
There's no good reason why
I can't move on
I lay my heart on these tracks
When your train comes along
And it was all alright
That's just how
It goes when you're gone
You may not realize
All the lies at the time but
The truth will find you
Storm is going to come
Going to wash you away like Sodom and Gomorrah

There's no good reason why
I can't move on
I lay my heart on these tracks
When your train comes along
And it was all alright
That's just how
It goes when you're wrong
Go out in circles
Like an old golden bed
As cold as the pillow
By your empty nightstand
Then something comes over me
I lose my head
I guess god did not make me
A one woman man
I'd have a lot to give
If I still gave a damn
That's just how
It goes when you're wrong
And it was all alright
Now it's all all wrong
But that's just how
It goes when you're gone
And it was all alright
Now it's all wrong
And that's just how
It goes when you're gone
When you're gone
I guess I wish
You all the best
I wish you don't
Do like I do
And go and fall in love with someone like you
Cause if you fell
You'd probably walk around the block like a little kid
But a kid don't know
He could only guess
How hard it is
To wish you happiness
Well I guess love
Is like a Christmas card
You decorate a tree
And throw it in the yard
It decays and dies
And the snowmen melt
Well I knew love
I knew how love felt
I knew love
But I got no hate
And I got no pride
But I got so much love that I cannot hide

You all the best
I wish you don't
Do like I do

How hard it is
From across the room
If we were standin' face to face  I couldn't find the words to say
Give me one more move
I don't even know her name
I guess foolish pride's to blame
Now I'm fallin' in love as she's walkin' away
And my heart won't tell my mind
To tell my mouth what it should say
We may have lost this battle  live to fight another day
Now I'm fallin' in love as she's walkin' away-ay-ay
Wise man next to me did say  'bout the one that got away
Son  I missed my chance
Don't you let regret take place of the dreams you have to chase
Ask her to dance  go on son

Roll the dice and have some faith

Her looks can kill
She's got a red dress
Lipstick and heels
Pull me in
Get me hooked like a junkie
You got me feeling so high
You’re such a beautiful drug
I can't get enough
Addicted and I'm dying for a hit of your love
She lets her hair down
And all of mine stand up
Can't help but stare now
Gotta feel that touch
Can't quit those lips are a habit to me
Sweet intoxication and I'm never getting sober
I can tell that the effects are taking over

She's a big old bitch
Waves playing me a symphony upon the sand
As I lay drifting on the ocean with this bottle in my hand
Sat down on the boardwalk for a little while
Your memory my company
Something 'bout this place had a way to make you smile
You always loved the sound of waves
The wind whistling 'cross my bottle still can’t blow away the sorrow
That tomorrow you won't be here with me
So I raise it up and toast the day we met
You're not here but I can feel you
Every memory is on the tip of my tongue
It's bittersweet
Doctor said there's nothing we can do
To the only place half a chance to take the pain away
Let me feel alive before I go
So let's wash away our sorrow
That tomorrow I won’t be here with you
Go and live your life with no regrets
And don’t forget how much I love you
I love you
You're not here but I can feel you
Every memory is on the tip of my tongue
It's bittersweet
I brought you back just like you wanted
So you don't ever have to leave
And when I poured you across the southern sky
I couldn't help but to cry
I know you finally got your wings
Bitter-bittersweet
Bittersweet
Oh
The wind whistling across my bottle
Still can't blow away the sorrow
That tomorrow you won’t be here with me
So I raise it up and toast the day we met
We’re gonna have some fun tonight
I wanna be a castaway
And leave the world behind
Take a tropic holiday
Say goodbye to keeping time
Wasting away down by the coast
Pacifico and chasing lime
Easy living down in paradise
Pour me another one
Make it a strong one
We’re gonna have some fun tonight
Just like the other one
Make it a double rum
We’re gonna castaway tonight
I'm in an island state of mind
Don't think I’m ever gonna leave
I'd rather stay and watch the waves
Move the sand beneath my feet
Reggae on the radio
Laying low and feeling high

Cold beer on a Friday night
A pair of jeans that fit just right
And the radio up
Well I was raised up beneath the shade of a Georgia Pine
Where the peaches grow
But it's filled with love that's grown in southern ground
And a little bit of chicken fried
Cold beer on a Friday night
A pair of jeans that fit just right
And the radio up
Well I've seen the sun rise
See the love in my woman's eyes
Feel the touch of a precious child
And know a mother's love
It's funny how it's the little things in life
That mean the most
Or the price tag on your clothes
There's no dollar sign on a piece of mind
This I've come to know
Raise your glasses for a toast

All the things we love
Like our chicken fried
And cold beer on a Friday night

And the radio up
Well I've done seen the sun rise
See the love in my woman's eyes
Feel the touch of a precious child
Closes the door 'fore the winter lets the cold in
And wonders if her love is strong enough to make him stay
She's answered by the taillights shinin' through the window pane
But I'm stuck in colder weather
Maybe tomorrow will be better
Can I call you then?
And you ain't ever gonna change
You've got a gypsy soul to blame
And you were born for leavin'
The night is black as the coffee he was drinkin'
And in the waitress' eyes he sees the same old light is shinin'
He thinks of Colorado and the girl he left behind him
But I'm stuck in colder weather
Maybe tomorrow will be better

I can smell your perfume through these whisperin' pines
I'm with your ghost again
It's a shame about the weather
But I know soon we'll be together
And I can't wait 'til then
Sunshine trying to creep on through
Lost sleep but I found a tune
Stuck inside my head
Cigarettes and tank of gas
Headed off to nowhere fast
Got to find a way to make this feeling last
Because I believe that I
Was born with a song inside of me
Never question why
I just kept on chasing that melody
And as time goes by
It is funny how time can make you realize
We are running out of it
On the day that I die
I want to say that I
Was a man who really lived and never compromised
And when I have lived out my days
Until the very end
I hope they find me in my home with my guitar in my hands
A part of dawn to be ashamed of
But good people are supposed to be up
But I found peace with the path I took
As I lay down my head
Crossroads you got to choose
Which way do we win or lose
But every bone in my soul says I sing on through
Because I believe that I
Was born with a song inside of me
Never question why
I just kept on chasing that melody
And as time goes by
It is funny how time can make you realize
We are running out of it
On the day that I die
I want to say that I
Was a man who really lived and never compromised
And when I have lived out my days
Until the very end
I hope they find me in my home with my guitar in my hands
I can't see anything from mine
Flags on the side of the highway
Scripture on grocery store signs
Maybe eighteen is too early
Maybe thirty or forty is too
Did you get your chance to make peace with the man
Before he sent down his angels for you?
Mamas and grandmamas love you
'Cause that's all they know how to do
You never planned on the bombs in the sand
Or sleeping in your dress blues
Your wife said this all would be funny
When you came back home in a week
You'd turn twenty-two and we'd celebrate you
In a bar or a tent by the creek
Your baby would just about be here
Your very last tour would be up
Drinking sweet tea in Styrofoam cups

When her lips met mine
There was an emptiness in her voice
Hesitation when she smiled
She didn't have to say a word
It was just so plain to see
She'd found what she'd been looking for
And I knew it wasn't me
I saw goodbye in her eyes
I don't think I can change it
There's no way to disguise
We will never make it

Can't wash off his makeup

Bought myself a hard pack of cigarettes

Held you in my arms one time
Lost you just the same

Baby powder beach under my feet has got me rolling
And the breeze through crackling leaves like a daytime campfire burning

And the way I would lay and waste a day after day with you
We always go our separate ways
But no one can love you baby the way I do
Keep me in mind
Keep me in mind
And I pray someday that you will love me only
Find shelter in me
If there's no one else to love
Keep me in mind
I'd be a fool to let you go with someone else
I'd give it all up just to have you for myself

Come on little mama
Pretend I don't live in it
Sunshine going to wash my blues away
Had sweet love but I lost it
She got too close so I fought it
Now I'm lost in the world trying to find me a better way
Wishing I was knee deep in the water somewhere
Got the blue sky breeze and it don't seem fair
Only worry in the world is the tide going to reach my chair
Never been so happy
Never felt so high
And I think I might have found me my own kind of paradise
Wrote a note said be back in a minute
Bought a boat and I sailed off in it
Don't think anybody's going to miss me anyway
Mind on a permanent vacation
The ocean is my only medication
Wishing my condition ain't ever going to go away
Now I'm knee deep in the water somewhere
Got the blue sky breeze blowing wind through my hair
Only worry in the world is the tide going to reach my chair
Never been so happy
Never felt so high
And I think I might have found me my own kind of paradise

This champagne shore washing over me
It's a sweet sweet life living by the salty sea
One day you could be as lost as me
Change your geography
Maybe you might be
Knee deep in the water somewhere
Got the blue sky breeze blowing wind through my hair
Only worry in the world is the tide going to reach my chair
Never been so happy
Never felt so high
And I think I might have found me my own kind of paradise
Come on in the water's nice
Find yourself a little slice
You never know until you try
When you lose yourself
And we go by different names
I remember the sound of our roof in the rain
And my mind goes back in time
To a place so far gone
Where the love we left behind us
Was still new
We were listening to a record
On the end of your bed
Not giving thought to where it was all going
And I wished right then and there so badly
I could read your mind
Just so I could know the things that you were knowing
The hardest part is always leaving love behind
That everything we lose
Will be a gift in time
But the hardest part is leaving love behind
When it was time to say goodbye
Those words came down like stones
I admit for so long after
It was hard to feel at home
We would hear the highway’s song
Shifting down in the night
I was grateful that the echoes broke the quiet

We picked guitars and talked about how the glory days we missed them

Cast a sea so long ago was a message from my father
You keep your heart above your head and your eyes wide open
So this world can't find a way to leave you cold
And know you're not the only ship out on the ocean

Forgive the ones you can't

But you only get one chance at life to leave your mark upon it
You keep your heart above your head and your eyes wide open

Hair's a mess but I don't care
No makeup on and shining so bright
My old sweatshirt never fit so right
Dancing around to the radio
Humming the words that you don't know
Cross out finding an angel off my list
Thinking that it don't get no better than this
You make loving you easy
You make loving you all I wanna do
Every little smile and every single touch
Reminds me just how much it all makes

Pillow talk by candle light

Torn from his home
And destined
To be out on his own
And he waited in darkness
Hoping someone might see
From something so rough
What a treasure he'd be
Stronger than steel and wood
Seen me through the bad and good
And when I'm hanging by a string
Every little thing
Is understood
Between Martin and me
Well he's hollow in the middle
From the shape that he's in
He's either filled up with music
Or locked in his shell again
And it takes some fine tuning
To make him come around
But he's a huge piece of me
And I'll never put him down

But I was defiant
When he made me walk the line
He knew how to lift me up

She was a preacher's daughter
Never did what daddy taught her
And the rebel in her soul
Brought her to me
The river was cold
And the river was wide
She flowed from the mountain
Straight across the great divide
And her heart ran cold
But her love runs deep
She is fire on the mountain
Wrecking everyone she meets
She's like rain when she rolls in
But that sunshine in her thunder
Makes the loneliest heart wonder
If the ride is worth the pain
Might not be storm clouds in sight

She'll tear the land in two

A hurricane blowing

Under an Appalachian sunset sky
She's like rain
She rolls in
But there's sunshine in her thunder
She's coming around the bend
And the front yard needs a trim
And the telephone keeps ringing
And the bossman knows I know its him
And the bills ain''t going to pay themselves
Don't matter anyway
Cause I ain't in no hurry today
There's nothing wrong with an old cane fishing pole
And the smell of early spring
Sit down in a fold-up easy chair
On a quiet shady river bank
Let the world go on without me
Wouldn't have it any other way
Cause I ain't in no hurry today
Ain't in no hurry
I'd be a fool now to worry
About all those things I can't change

They can't believe that I just couldn't leave
And I bid adieu to my friends
'Cause my bartender  she's from the islands
Her body's been kissed by the sun
And coconut replaces the smell of the bar
And I don't know if it's her or the rum
I got my toes in the water  ass in the sand
Not a worry in the world  a cold beer in my hand
Life is good today
Life is good today
Adios and vaya con Dios
A long way from GA
When I throw pesos their way
Adios and vaya con Dios
A long way from GA
Someone do me a favor and pour me some Jaeger and
I'll grab my guitar and play
Adios and vaya con Dios
Going home now to stay
The señoritas don't care-o when there's no dinero  yeah
I got no money to stay
Adios and vaya con Dios
Going home now to stay
I'm just gon' drive up by the lake
And put my ass in a lawn chair  toes in the clay
Not a worry in the world  a PBR on the way
Life is good today
Searching for answers that I'll never find
Losing my breath as I fall
I've been trying to open my eyes
Take it all in as the world passes by
Getting lost in the twists and the turn
Finding these questions inside me still burn
Finding these questions inside me still burn
I'm gonna live
Like tomorrow never comes
There's no end in sight
Tonight we black out the sun
Better hold on tight
Before you know it's gone
And live like tomorrow never comes
I keep looking for some kind of sign
Trying to hold on in this race against time
I can't say where the next bend might be
That is the beauty in life's mystery
That is the beauty in life's mystery

I'm gonna live
Like tomorrow never comes

Tonight we black out the sun
Better hold on tight
Before you know it's gone
And live like tomorrow never comes
There's no end in sight
And her lips that taste like sweet red wine
And her pretty legs go to heaven every time
She got a gentle way that puts me at ease
You got whatever it is
You know I've never been the type that would ever wanna stay
Bring 'em home at night and they're gone the next day
But that all changed when she walked into my life
There's just something 'bout the woman makes my heart go haywire
And she's gonna be my wife
You got whatever it is

You got whatever it is
It takes away all of your big problems
But you gotta get away to where the boat leaves from
And one part shade of banana tree
And I know this is the place for me
Get away to where the boat leaves from
It takes away all of your big problems
There's a perfectly good island somewhere
Where a ride that floats and don't grab your coat
You won't need it where we are going
Get away to where the boat leaves from
It takes away all of your big problems

Pick me up
Pick me up
Pick me up
Put me down
Down in the sand where it's cool
Put me down
And when I fall off my stool
Put me down
I'll just sleep there 'til morning comes 'round
With sunshine tanned ladies and piña coladas
And Bob Marley songs that are playin'
There's a song in my ear that I want you to hear
Soft tropical lips that are singin'
Get away to where the boat leaves from
It takes away all of your big problems
But you gotta get away to where the boat leaves from
So get away to where the boat leaves from
It takes away all of your big problems

Can’t even count the days since we got away
Seen our share of ups and downs
I wish that tide could reach us now
And wash away
All the gray
If you got the time
I got the place
Let's get back to you and islands
Bahama breeze blowing through your hair
Starin’ at that blue horizon
Close my eyes and I'm right back there
I swear I feel the chair sinkin' in the sand
Listenin' to the rasta band
The love we made that last night

And all the oceans turned to dust
I heard the tide callin' us
And wash away
All the gray
If you got the will
I got the way
Let’s get back to you and islands
Kempinski and the warm salt air
Starin’ at that blue horizon
Close my eyes and I'm right back there
I swear the sun’s settin' bolder and
Made us fall in love again
I can't forget that last night
Let's get back to you and islands
Come and sit in the sun

Let's get back to you and islands
Hawaii and a hoo-wee-ho
Starin' at that blue horizon
There's so many that we still don't know
You and islands
Bahama breeze blowing through your hair
Starin' at that blue horizon
Close my eyes and I'm right back there

Listenin' to the rasta band

Everything'll be alright
Oh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Found what I’d been lookin’ for  but I couldn’t stay
But my heart was full and my eyes  they could not believe
How you wrapped your arms around me
Your majesty
I wanna slow it down where the water’s deep
Get that Northern healing washing over me
Made me better man
And it’s plain to see
The nature of your beauty puts my mind at ease
Oooh
Now I’m flyin’ in to meet you  I can hardly wait
Do you know how much I’ve missed you since I’ve been away
Bringin' all my love from Georgia  and I'm gonna lay
Under endless skies of emerald light  we can drift away
I wanna slow it down where the water’s deep
Get that Northern healing washing over me
Made me better man
And it’s plain to see
The nature of your beauty puts my mind at ease
And I’m humbled in the presence of your majesty

Oooh
Oooh
You can have it all
Burn all my things
To be at your feet
And kneel before my queen
Now I’m gonna stay out where the air is clean
‘Cause I’ve freed myself from these city streets
Found a better man waking inside of me
The nature of your beauty puts my mind at ease
And I’m humbled in the presence of your majesty
And I kneel down in the presence of
Your majesty
Ooh!
Oooh"
