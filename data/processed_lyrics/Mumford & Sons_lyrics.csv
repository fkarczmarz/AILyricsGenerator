lyrics
"I was so sure of it all
What if I need you in my darkest hour?
What if it turns out there is no other?
If this is our last hope
We would see a sign
Well I've been running from the ashes we left
Forgiveness begs for itself but how can I forget
There's a stain on it all
But what if I need you in my darkest hour?
What if it turns out there is no other?
We had it all
If this is our time now
We would see a sign
So give us a sign
I need some guiding light
I run and run as the rains come
On my knees and out of luck
I look up
Night has always pushed up day
You must know life to see decay
Not this mind and not this heart
I won't rot
And I took you by the hand
And we stood tall
And remembered our own land
What we lived for
But there will come a time
And love will not break your heart
But dismiss your fears
Get over your hill and see
What you find there
With grace in your heart
And flowers in your hair
You might also like
And now I cling to what I knew
I saw exactly what was true
But oh no more
That's why I hold
That's why I hold with all I have
That's why I hold
And I won't die alone
And be left there
Well I guess I'll just go home
Oh God knows where
Because death is just so full
And man so small
Well I'm scared of what's behind
And what's before
There will come a time
And love will not break your heart
But dismiss your fears
Get over your hill and see
What you find there
With grace in your heart
And flowers in your hair
And there will come a time
And love will not break your heart
But dismiss your fears
Get over your hill and see
What you find there
With grace in your heart
I struggle to find any truth in your lies
And now my heart stumbles on things I don't know
My weakness I feel I must finally show
Lend me your hand and we'll conquer them all
But lend me your heart and I'll just let you fall
Lend me your eyes I can change what you see
Awake my soul
Awake my soul
How fickle my heart and how woozy my eyes
I struggle to find any truth in your lies
And now my heart stumbles on things I don't know
My weakness I feel I must finally show

In these bodies we will live
In these bodies we will die
Where you invest your love

In these bodies we will die
And where you invest your love
You invest your life
Yeah
Awake my soul
Awake my soul
Awake my soul
For you were made to meet your maker
Awake my soul
Awake my soul
Awake my soul
For you were made to meet your maker
And I’ll go along with everything you say
And my ears hear the call of my unborn sons
And I know their choices color all I’ve done
But I’ll explain it all to the watchman’s son
I never lived a year better spent in love
'Cause I know my weakness know my voice
And I believe in grace and choice
And I know perhaps my heart is farce
But I’ll be born without a mask
(Woo!)
Like the city that nurtured my greed and my pride
I stretch my arms into the sky
I cry Babel! Babel! Look at me now
You ask where will we stand in the winds that will howl
As all we see will slip into the cloud
So come down from your mountain and stand where we’ve been
You know our breath is weak and our body thin
You might also like
Press my nose up to the glass around your heart
I should’ve known I was weaker from the start
You’ll build your walls and I will play my bloody part
'Cause I know my weakness know my voice
And I believe in grace and choice
And I know perhaps my heart is farce
But you've only lost the night
Present all your pretty feelings
May they comfort you tonight
And I'm climbin' over something
And I'm runnin' through these walls
I don't even know if I believe
I don't even know if I believe
I don't even know if I believe
Everything you're tryin' to say to me
I had the strangest feeling
Your world's not all it seems
So tired of misconceiving
What else this could've been
I don't even know if I believe
I don't even know if I believe
I don't even know if I believe
Everything you're tryin' to say to me

This is never gonna go our way
If I'm gonna have to guess what's on your mind
Something like you love me
'Less you wanna move away
From the noise of this place
I don't even know if I believe
I don't even know if I wanna believe
Anything you're tryin' to say to me
This is never gonna go our way
If I'm gonna have to guess what's on your mind
This is never gonna go our way
But tired
And shift a wisp of wayward silver hair
From your eyes
I'd never seen you unkempt before
As you whisper darling close the door
You ever said
And time is not on our side but I'll pretend that it's alright
She says the Lord has a plan
But admits it's pretty hard to understand
Before you leave
You must know you are beloved
And before you leave
Remember I was with you
Are you afraid
However could you not be
In this rosy light
This is strange
I feel a hand come through the mirror
Pointing at the light
Point at the light we never see
As you put your feathered arms over me
You might also like
Before you leave
You must know you are beloved
And before you leave
Remember I was with you
And as you leave
I won't hold you back beloved
We'll sit and talk the stars down from the sky
And I'll not forget the chaos in your eyes love
And as you leave
You must know you are beloved
And as you leave
I can see the wild has come for you
And as you leave
I won't hold you back beloved
And as you leave
And the light which led us from our chosen homes
And now I sleep
Sleep the hours that I can't weep
When all I knew was steeped in blackened holes
Keep the earth below my feet
Let me learn from where I have been
And I was still
But I was under your spell
So all must be well
Just give me time
You know your desires and mine
So wrap my flesh in ivy and in twine
For I must be well

Keep the earth below my feet
Let me learn from where I have been
Keep the earth below my feet
Let me learn from where I have been
 'cause I don't like the word
 my generation's stuck in the mirror
 'cause I don't like the word
Manhattan beats at the night
But you are wrapped up in wire
Curled up in fright
So I took you to the city for the night
To dance under dizzy silver lights
But for a moment you were wild
But wasn't it you who said I was not free?
And wasn't it you who said I needed peace?
And now it's you who's floored by fear of it all
These apartment walls are paper thin
And no one is trying to listen in
What to hear our doubts

Wasn't it you who said I was not free?
And wasn't it you who said I needed peace?
And now it's you who's floored by fear of it all
But when you feel the world wrappin' round your neck
Feel my hand wrapped in yours
And when you feel the world wrappin' round your neck
Don't succumb
I'll never be your chosen one
The pull on my flesh was just too strong
Stifled the choice and the air in my lungs
Better not to breathe than to breathe a lie
But I will not speak of your sin
There was a way out for him
The mirror shows not
Your values are all shot
So crawl on my belly 'til the sun goes down
I'll never wear your broken crown
So crawl on my belly 'til the sun goes down
I'll never wear your broken crown

So crawl on my belly 'til the sun goes down

We're the bandit in their eyes
And never so alive
But I know what's on your mind
God knows I put it there
But if I took it back
We'd be nowhere
You'd be nowhere again
I look at you all torn up
I left you waiting to bleed
I guess the truth works two ways
Maybe the truth's not what we need
And I know what's on your mind
God knows I put it there
But if I took it back
You'd be nowhere again
You might also like
In my cold arms
Don't hide your eyes from us
I will take this offered cup
I will sit upon your floor
That's what I came here for
And your children come and go as you weep
But what have I if I have not love?
I am a waste
My words are empty vessels if I do nothing in this place
And we can scream into the shadows
And it's good that we can
But walk with me I think we'll find a way
And walk with me I think we'll find a way
But I'll meet you at the delta
Where the rivers run into the sea
And I'll meet you at the delta
When it feels like nothing else matters
Will you put your arms around me?
When it feels like nothing else matters
Will you put your arms around me?
And does your love prefer the other?
And does your love just make you feel good?
Does my love prefer the other?
Does my love just make me feel good?

When it's all just dust to dust
And that's how it will be

That means nothing to me
Does my love prefer the other?
Does my love just make me feel good?
Does my love prefer the other?
Or does my love just make me feel good?
When it feels like nothing else matters
Will you put your arms around me?
When it feels like nothing else matters
Will you put your arms around me?
Does your love prefer the other?
This one reminds the other of a past
A life lived much too fast to hold onto
How am I losing you?
A broken house
Another dry month waiting for the rain
And I have been resisting this decay
I thought you'd do the same
But this is all I ever was
And this is all you came across those years ago
Now you go too far
And now I'm losing you
Fragile sound
The world outside just watches as we crawl
And crawl towards a life of fragile lines
And wasted time
And so I cry
As I hold you for the last time in this life
This life I tried so hard to give to you
What would you have me do?
You might also like
But this is all I ever was
And this is all you came across those years ago
Now you go too far
And now I'm losing you
Where I used to end was where you start
You were the only one
And now I see your eyes move too fast
You were the only one
Careful hands
Been wandering without that much to say
Your words are empty as the bed we made
Is there another way?
Is there another way?
But this is all I ever was
And this is all you came across those years ago
Now you go too far
And now I'm losing you
And now I'm losing you
 and the father was gone
 and no one in the field
 and another has not
 you know not what is in store
 cause I know what I've seen
 and I got my gun
The US version is somewhat longer and has slightly different lyrics
And broken glass saw the blood run from my veins
And you knelt beside my hope torn apart
But the ghosts that we knew will flicker from view
And we'll live a long life
So give me hope in the darkness that I will see the light
Cause oh they gave me such a fright
But I will hold as long as you like (with all of my might)
Just promise me we'll be all right
So lead me back
Turn south from that place
And close my eyes to my recent disgrace
Cause you know my call
And we'll share my all
And our children come and they will hear me roar
You might also like
So give me hope in the darkness that I will see the light
Cause oh they gave me such a fright
But I will hold as long as you like (with all of my might)
Just promise me we'll be all right
But hold me still
Bury my heart on the coals (next to yours)
And hold me still
Bury my heart next to yours (on the coals)
So give me hope in the darkness that I will see the light
Cause oh they gave me such a fright
But I will hold with all of my might (as long as you like)
Just promise me we'll be all right
Ghosts that we knew made us black and all blue
But we'll live a long life
And the ghosts that we knew will flicker from view
All day permanent red
The glaze on my eyes
When I heard your voice
The distance caught me by surprise again
And I know you claim that you're alright
But fix your eyes on me
I guess I'm all you have
And I swear you'll see the dawn again
Well  I know I had it all on the line
But don't just sit with folded hands and become blind
'Cause even when there is no star in sight
You'll always be my only guiding light
Relate to my youth
Well  I'm still in awe of you
Discover some new truth
That was always wrapped around you
But don't just slip away in the night
And don't just hurl your words from on high
You might also like
Well  I know I had it all on the line
But don't just sit with folded hands and become blind
'Cause even when there is no star in sight
You'll always be my only guiding light
If we come back and we're broken
Unworthy and ashamed
Give us something to believe in
And you know we'll go your way
'Cause I know I had it all on the line
But don't just sit with folded hands and become blind
'Cause even when there is no star in sight
You'll always be my only guiding light
And I know I had it all on the line
But don't just sit with folded hands and become blind
'Cause even when there is no star in sight
I came out of the woods by choice
Shelter also gave their shade
But in the dark I have no name
So leave that click in my head
And I will remember the words that you said
Left a clouded mind and a heavy heart
But I was sure we could see a new start
But you know your desire
Don't hold a glass over the flame
Don't let your heart grow cold
I will call you by name
I will share your road
'Cause I'm a hopeless wanderer
'Cause I'm a hopeless wanderer
I wrestled long with my youth
We tried so hard to live in the truth
But do not tell me all is fine
So leave that click in my head
And I won't remember the words that you said
You brought me out from the cold
You might also like
But you know your desire
Don't hold a glass over the flame
Don't let your heart grow cold
I will call you by name
I will share your road
'Cause I'm a hopeless wanderer
'Cause I'm a hopeless wanderer
To love the skies I'm under
To love the skies I'm under
Waiting for the rain
On the edge again
Don't look away
Couldn't help but note a cold disdain
In your precious face
Why do you always speak when you have no grace?
In your precious face
But even in the dark I saw you were the only one alone
At these hot gates you spit your vitriol
Though you swore you wouldn't do this anymore
And I can't be for you all of the things you want me to
But I will love you constantly
There's precious little else to me
Another fragile edge and a tender sound
And then you went aground
There's nothing here for you tonight
You might also like
But even in the dark I saw you were the only one alone
At these hot gates you spit your vitriol
Though you swore you wouldn't do this anymore
And I can't be for you all of the things you want me to
But I will love you constantly
There's precious little else to me
Let my blood only run out when my world decides
There is no way out of your only life
I never meant you any harm
But your tears feel warm as they fall on my forearm
But close my eyes for a while
Force from the world a patient smile
How can you say that your truth is better than ours?
If only I had an enemy bigger than my apathy I could have won
But I gave you all
I gave you all
I gave you all
Close my eyes for a while
Force from the world a patient smile
But I gave you all
I gave you all
I gave you all
And you rip it from my hands
And you swear it's all gone
And you rip out all I have
Just to say that you've won
And you rip it from my hands
And you swear it's all gone
And you rip out all I have
Just to say that you've won
You've won
Well now you've won
But I gave you all
I gave you all
I gave you all
Well now you've won
Like a stone
And I fell heavy into your arms
These days of dust
Which we've known
Will blow away with this new sun
But I'll kneel down
Wait for now
And I'll kneel down
Know my ground
And I will wait  I will wait for you
And I will wait  I will wait for you
So break my step
And relent
Well  you forgave and I won't forget
Know what we've seen
And him with less
Now in some way  shake the excess

'Cause I will wait  I will wait for you
And I will wait  I will wait for you
And I will wait  I will wait for you
And I will wait  I will wait for you
Now I'll be bold
As well as strong
And use my head alongside my heart
So tame my flesh
And fix my eyes
A tethered mind  freed from the lies
And I'll kneel down
Wait for now
I'll kneel down
Know my ground
Woo!
Well  raise my hands
Paint my spirit gold
And bow my head
Keep my heart slow
'Cause I will wait  I will wait for you
And I will wait  I will wait for you
And I will wait  I will wait for you
I'm sorry I could never thank you
For saving me more trouble
I didn't want any trouble
If you were given one more chance
Would you bring me back to life?
Bring me back into the light
Into the light
The innocence in your face bled out without a trace
It doesn't mean that I feel better
It doesn't mean that I feel better

Show me your hands
Are they cleaner than mine?
Show me your face
Did you cross the line?
Show me your eyes
They any drier than mine?
Your soul survives
And lift you from my mind
To cradle the weight of your love
Lay down your head on my sunken chest
Thought we were done
Young love would keep us young
I thought we were done
And young love would keep us young
I thought we fell to the ground
I see you whimper with no sound
Open my mouth to breathe some words of peace
But the silence gives nothing back to me
So I'll be a shadow of the flame
And I'll be a whisper on the wind
My hands are shakin' from holdin' so tight for so long
You might also like
The flame burnt out in our empty hands
But now I see it's got nothin' to do
It's got nothin' to do with you
You thought we were done
Young love would keep us young
I thought we were done
And young love would keep us young
(Why do I keep fallin'?) I thought we were done
(Why do I keep fallin'?) Young love would keep us young
(Why do I keep fallin'?) I thought we were done
You'll never be what is in your heart
Weep  Little Lion Man
You're not as brave as you were at the start
Rate yourself and rake yourself
Take all the courage you have left
And waste it on fixing all the problems
That you made in your own head
But it was not your fault but mine
And it was your heart on the line
I really fucked it up this time
Didn't I  my dear?
Didn't I  my—?
Tremble for yourself  my man
You know that you have seen this all before
Tremble  Little Lion Man
You'll never settle any of your scores
Your grace is wasted in your face
Your boldness stands alone among the wreck
Now learn from your mother
Or else spend your days biting your own neck

But it was not your fault but mine
And it was your heart on the line
I really fucked it up this time

Didn't I  my dear?
Didn't I  my dear?
Hah

But it was not your fault but mine
And it was your heart on the line
I really fucked it up this time
Didn't I  my dear?
But it was not your fault but mine
And it was your heart on the line
I really fucked it up this time
Didn't I  my dear?
I may watch you go
There'll be no value in the strength
Of walls that I have grown
There'll be no comfort in the shade
Of the shadows thrown
But I'd be yours if you'd be mine
Stretch out my life
And pick the seams out
Take what you like
But close my ears and eyes
Watch me stumble over and over
I had done wrong
You built your tower
But call me home
And I will build a throne
And wash my eyes out never again
But love the one you hold
And I'll be your gold
To have and to hold
A lover of the light
You might also like
Skin too tight
And eyes like marbles
You spin me high
So watch me as I glide
I know I've tried
I was not stable
Flawed by pride
I miss my sanguine eyes
But love the one you hold
And I'll be your gold
To have and to hold
A lover of the light
And in the middle of the night
I may watch you go
There'll be no value in the strength
Of walls that I have grown
There'll be no comfort in the shade
Of the shadows thrown
You may not trust the promises
Of the change I'll show
But I'd be yours if you'd be mine
But love the one you hold
And I'll be your gold
To have and to hold
A lover of the light
But love the one you hold
And I'll be your gold
To have and to hold
For a time
Now just aches
And it makes me blind
This mirror holds
My eyes too bright
I can't see
The others in my life
Were we too young
Our heads too strong
To bear the weight
Of these lovers' eyes
'Cause I feel numb
Beneath your tongue
Beneath the curse
Of these lovers' eyes
But do not ask the price I paid
I must live with my quiet rage
Tame the ghosts in my head
That run wild and wish me dead
Should you shake my ash to the wind
Lord forget all of my sins
Oh  let me die where I lie
'Neath the curse of my lovers' eyes
You might also like
'Cause there's no drink
Or drug I've tried
To rid the curse of
These lovers' eyes
And I feel numb
Beneath your tongue
Your strength just makes me feel less strong
But do not ask the price I paid
I must live with my quiet rage
Tame the ghosts in my head
That run wild and wish me dead
Should you shake my ash to the wind
Lord forget all of my sins
Oh  let me die where I lie
'Neath the curse of my lovers' eyes
And I'll walk slow  I'll walk slow
Take my hand  help me on my way
And I'll walk slow  I'll walk slow
Take my hand  help me on my way
And I'll walk slow  I'll walk slow
Take my hand  help me on my way
And I'll walk slow  I'll walk slow
Thowin' dice in the dark
I saw you dance in the devil's arms
The night kept coming
Really nothing I could do
So we come to a place of no return
And here is the name that our sons will learn
So when you're weak
When you are on your knees
I'll do my best with the time that's left
So fuck your dreams
And don't you pick at our seams

So we come to a place of no return
Yours is the face which makes my body burn
And here is the name that our sons will learn
I'll never learn to put up a guard
So keep my love  my candle bright
This ain't no sham
I am what I am
Though I may speak some tongue of old
Or even spit out some holy word
I have no strength from which to speak
When you sit me down and see I'm weak
We will run and scream
You will dance with me
They'll fulfill our dreams and we'll be free
And we will be who we are
And they'll heal our scars
Sadness will be far away
So as we walked through fields of green
Was the fairest sun I'd ever seen
And I was broke  I was on my knees
You might also like
This ain't no sham

For a cynic's mind
We will run and scream
You will dance with me
Fulfill our dreams and we'll be free
And we will be who we are
And they'll heal our scars
Sadness will be far away
Do not let my fickle flesh go to waste
As it keeps my heart and soul in it's place
Your silhouette
Through the quickening haze
So brand it on my mind
So I don't forget
Let it shine
By wandering eyes
I'm blinded by the lights
Of October Skies
These postcard memories
Evade my eyes
And in the valley I am free
But in the hills I soar
Until your silhouette
Is gone once more
The fear of what's to come
Has been crippling me
So to your silhouette
I turn once more
So brand it on my mind
So I won't forget
By my wandering eyes
By my wandering eyes
I was stuck
To the spot without a friend
Alone again
And I hunger and I thirst
For some shiver
For some whispered words
And a promise to come
And you saw me low
Alone again
Didn't they say that only love will win in the end?
In short
Made a fool out of you
And a younger heart
And I rage and I rage
But perhaps
I will come of age
And be ready for you
And you saw me low
Alone again
Didn't they say that only love will win in the end?
Didn't they say that only love will win in the end?

And you saw me low

I thought it best you didn't know
Don't see it coming
The darkness visible
But when its eyes fix mine
It's silver and it's stone
The gathering storm
And when I feel that darkness is a heartbeat away
And I
Don't know how to fight it
It's a heartbeat away
And now
You don't know me like this
It's a heartbeat away
And I
Don't know how to hide it
It's a heartbeat away
And I picture you
Soaked in light
I picture you
And in you I have no doubt
When the chaos calls me out
And it feels like there is nothing I can do
I picture you
You might also like
And the night falls fast
I know it's heavy on the skin
Will it be ever thus
Barely visible
But when your eyes fix mine
Embracing your denial
Well I hold my breath
Through the waste and the wild
When I feel it rising
And it's a heartbeat away
And I
Don't know how to fight it
It's a heartbeat away
And now
You don't know me like this
It's a heartbeat away
And I
Don't know how to fight it
It's a heartbeat away
And I picture you
Soaked in light
I picture you
And in you I have no doubt
When the chaos calls me out
And it feels like there is nothing I can do
That's not what I came here for
No it's not what I came here for
And I won't hear you cry when I'm gone
I won't know if I'm doing you wrong
I never know if I'm doing you wrong
A constant reminder of where I can find her
Light that might give up the way
Is all that I'm asking for without her I'm lost
So watch the world tear us apart
A stoic mind and a bleeding heart
You never see my bleeding heart
And your light's always shining on
A constant reminder of where I can find her
Light that might give up the way
Is all that I'm asking for without her I'm lost

And together we can see what we will find
Don't leave me alone at this time
For I am afraid of what I will discover inside
See you told me that I would find a hole
Within the fragile substance of my soul
And I have filled this void with things unreal
And all the while my character it steals
Darkness is a harsh term  don't you think?
And yet it dominates the things I seek
It seems that all my bridges have been burned
But  you say that's exactly how this grace thing works
It's not the long walk home
That will change this heart
But the welcome I receive with the restart
Darkness is a harsh term  don't you think?
And yet it dominates the things I seek
Darkness is a harsh term  don't you think?
And yet it dominates the things I seek

Stars  hide your fires!
These here are my desires

Marking its territory of this newly impassioned soul
Hide your fires!
These here are my desires
And I will give them up to you this time around
And so  I'll be found
With my stake stuck in this ground
Marking its territory of this newly impassioned soul
But you  you've gone too far this time
You have neither reason nor rhyme
With which to take this soul that is so rightfully mine
Roll your questions across the floor
I know we've been here for years
But at least we been here before
My mind finds peace in the shade of your attention
But gets tangled by the night
I didn’t know what I was thinking
But I know we'll be alright
And I will surround you
With a love too deep for words
Hold you from the world and its curse
So long as I have breath in my lungs
Long as there's a song to be sung
I will be yours and you will be mine
Ever our lives entwined
My Rose of Sharon
My Rose of Sharon
I wish I had some grand sense of occasion
But I just smile and turn away
I hope you know by now
I don't know another way

I will be yours and you will be mine
Ever our lives entwined
My Rose of Sharon

This is not the end
Live unbruised  we are friends
And I'm sorry  I'm sorry
Sigh no more  no more
One foot in sea  one on shore
My heart was never pure
You know me  you know me
But man is a giddy thing
Oh  man is a giddy thing
Oh  man is a giddy thing
Oh  man is a giddy thing
Love  it will not betray you
Dismay or enslave you  it will set you free
Be more like the man you were made to be
There is a design  an alignment
A cry of my heart to see
The beauty of love as it was made to be

Do a deal for no surprises
Cos you will never slip away
Slip away in the night
Waiting patient for the sun to rise
It reveals a stoic smile
But you will never slip away
Slip away in the night
You'll find me waiting here for you
Come and suffer here
You'll find me holding my breath for you
Come and suffer here
In the violence of a mind's eye
We had a deal for no surprises
Cos you will never slip away
Slip away in the night

 the lonely itch
 you will always be danger

 you will always be danger
 you will always be danger
 it rises slowly as you walk
Can't we be still
What makes you kind
From where comes your sparkling mind
Was it under the earth
Tied up in a knot
Which I forgot you were ever there
Do not be afraid
Do not be afraid
What’s that I see?
I think it's The Wild
Puts the fear of God in me
It was ever thus
Up from the dust
Inconceivable love
What's that I see?
I think it’s The Wild
Your eyes follow like tracers in the night
And the tightrope that you wander every time
Been wandering for days
How you felt me slip your mind
Leave behind your wanting ways
I wanna learn to love in kind
'Cause you were all I ever longed for
He wanders ever closer every night
I promised you everything would be fine
Been wandering for days
How you felt me slip your mind
Leave behind your wanton ways
I wanna learn to love in kind
'Cause you were all I ever longed for

Leave behind your wanton ways
I wanna learn to love in kind

So open up my eyes to a new light
I wandered 'round your darkened land all night
But I lift up my eyes to a new high
And indeed there would be time

Why do I keep falling?

A time to love
Why do I keep falling?
'Cause recently mine have been tearing my seams
I sit alone in this winter clarity which clouds my mind
Alone in the wind and the rain you left me
Corrupted by the simple sniff of riches blown
I know you have felt much more love than you've shown
But plant your hope with good seeds
Don't cover yourself with thistle and weeds
Look over your hills and be still
The sky above us shoots to kill

But take the spade from my hands and fill in the holes you've made
But plant your hope with good seeds
Don't cover yourself with thistle and weeds
It freezes your already cold mind
And death is at your doorstep
And it will steal your innocence
But it will not steal your substance
But you are not alone in this
And you are not alone in this
As brothers we will stand and we'll hold your hand
Hold your hand
And you are the mother
The mother of your baby child
The one to whom you gave life
And you have your choices
And these are what make man great
His ladder to the stars
But you are not alone in this
And you are not alone in this
As brothers we will stand and we'll hold your hand
Hold your hand

And I will tell the night
But I can't move the mountains
I wanna hold you in the dark
One last time
Just one last time
And oh  babe  can you tell what's on my tongue?
Can you guess that I'll be gone
With the twilight?
With the twilight
But no flame burns forever  oh no
You and I both know this all too well
And most don't even last the night
No  they don't  they say they don't
And oh  babe  I've never been so lost
I wanna hear you laugh
One last time
Just one last time
But oh  babe  I really wish you would not cry
I only ever told you one lie
When it could have been a thousand
It might as well have been a thousand
You might also like
But no flame burns forever  oh no
You and I both know this all too well
And most don't even last the night
No  they don't  they say they don't
And we can talk it 'round again  girl
'Round and 'round  'round and 'round again
Or we could leave it all tonight
Leave it all  just leave it all
I never tried to trick you  babe
I just tried to work it out
But I was swallowed up by doubt
If only things were black and white
'Cause I just wanna hold you tight
Without holding back my mind
Without holding back my mind
But no flame burns forever  oh no
You and I both know this all too well
It seems you had heard
As we walked the city streets
You never said a word
When we finally sat down
Your eyes were full of spite
I could not put up a fight
But where are you now
Where are you now?
Do you ever think of me
You were strangely less in pain
Than you were cold
Triumphant in your mind
Of the logic that you hold
You said no one would ever know
The love that we had shared
As I took my leave to go
It was clear you didn't care

I hear stories of your frown
And the darkness can descend
We can relish all the pain
But I know that's what you love
'Cause you know I love the same
But where are you now
Where are you now?
Do you ever think of me
Where are you now

Do you ever think of me
But where are you now

Do you ever think of me
 your heart
 your love
 where was my fault
 rage
 to the brink
 my affections
 where was my fault
 lead me to the truth and I
Making out what's make-pretend
And you whisper words forbidden
To see if I've been listening
We won't both get our way
So I hold you by the jaw
And kiss you to be sure
With so much more than before
It took a wild heart to tame mine
And it took a wild heart to charm
Now a wild heart's gone and floored me
With this everlasting glance
With this everlasting glance
I wouldn't have you any other way
Who wants a love that makes sense anyway
I guess I asked for the truth
I guess I asked for it brutal and untuned
Whatever has you so inspired

Now a wild heart's gone and floored me
With this everlasting glance

I wouldn't have you any other way
I don't want a love that makes sense anyway
But it took a wild heart to tame mine
And it took a wild heart to charm
Now a wild heart's gone and floored me
With this everlasting glance
You tried to tame me  tame me from the start
With that deadness in your eye  flash your flesh
Desperate for a need to rise
With a silver crystal on
How well you used to know how to shine
In the place that's safe from harm
But I had been blessed with a wilder mind
You can be every little thing you want nobody to know
And you can try to drown out the street below
And you can call it love
If you want
Beholden now  I find myself awake
Waiting on the edge again
You sleep so sound with your mind made up
Drinking from your cup of broken ends

And you can call it love
If you want
But I thought we believed
In an endless love
But I thought we believed
Was it love or fear of the cold that led us through the night?
For every kiss your beauty trumped my doubt
And my head told my heart
Let love grow
But my heart told my head
This time no
This time no
We'll be washed and buried one day my girl
And the time we were given will be left for the world
The flesh that lived and loved will be eaten by plague
So let the memories be good for those who stay
And my head told my heart
Let love grow
But my heart told my head
This time no
This time no
This time no

Was the same that sent me into your arms
And if your strife strikes at your sleep
Remember spring swaps snow for leaves
You'll be happy and wholesome again
When the city clears and sun ascends
And my head told my heart
Let love grow
But my heart told my head
This time no
And my head told my heart
Let love grow
But my heart told my head
This time no
Caught behind those burning eyes
Tangled up in morning white
Do you ever really know?
Can you ever really know?
Woman
Watch her take me by surprise
When she lets me call her mine
Do you ever really know?
Can you ever really know?
And I don't know the loneliness you've known
I don't hear the frosty words echo inside
When you're gone again
I am left in awe of the woman I adore
Woman
I never had such a sight
Burn itself onto my mind
Do you ever really know?
Can you ever really know?

Then why don't you take a different line
Don't have to be cruel to be kind
You don't have to lose your mind
You don't wanna suffer for your art
You don't wanna vivisect your heart
And then if you're falling apart
You're probably trying too hard
In the dawning light I found you breathless
But I won't deny I love you helpless
You don't wanna say what you don't mean
You still want to paint a figure scene
You hide in the wings with a lamp
And cast the shadows on a screen
You don't wanna sing what you can say
Well that's quite a hard game to play
But I have fallen for your ways
In spite of myself I don't want you to change
