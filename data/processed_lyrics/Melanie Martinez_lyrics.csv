"Ah ah ah  buh-buh-buh-buh-buh
Ah ah ah  buh-buh-buh-buh
Buh-buh-buh-buh  buh-buh-buh
Buh-buh-buh-buh
Always aiming paper airplanes at me when you're around
You build me up like building blocks just so you can bring me down
You can crush my candy cane but you'll never catch me cry
If you dangle that diploma and I dead you  don't be surprised
I know my ABC's  yet you keep teaching me
I say fuck your degree  alphabet boy
You think you're smarter than me with all your bad poetry
Fuck all your ABC's  alphabet boy
I'm not a little kid now  watch me get big now
Spell my name on a fridge now  with all your alphabet toys
You won the spelling bee now  but are you smarter than me now?
You're the prince of the playground  little alphabet boy
Ah ah ah  buh-buh-buh-buh
Ah ah ah  buh-buh-buh-buh-buh
Ah ah ah  buh-buh-buh-buh
Buh-buh-buh-buh  buh-buh-buh
Buh-buh-buh-buh

Apples aren't always appropriate apologies
Butterscotch and bubblegum drops are bittersweet to me
You call me a child while you keep counting all your coins
But you're not my daddy and I'm not your dolly
And your dictionary's destroyed
I know my ABC's  yet you keep teaching me
I say fuck your degree  alphabet boy
You think you're smarter than me with all your bad poetry
Fuck all your ABC's  alphabet boy
I'm not a little kid now  watch me get big now
Spell my name on a fridge now  with all your alphabet toys
You won the spelling bee now  but are you smarter than me now?
You're the prince of the playground  little alphabet boy

Liquor it jumps off your tongue
You used all your words for a quick game
Blew it all before you won
There's musical chairs in my teeth
I'll smile as you fall to your feet
And they talk without thinkin'
They bark while they're shakin'
With teeth that are round and dull
And they yell while they're chasin'
While I'm steady-pacin'
My syllables hit the floor
Don't you battle with my larynx tonight
I'll wreck you if you chase me
But I'll be silent 'til you cross the line
Don't you battle with my larynx tonight
So crude and selfish baby
Don't you battle with my larynx tonight

 in the temporal lobe
 sweat raindrops down my silky flesh
 time's an illusion
 push my head into my chest
 forever wed
 they said
 neither can fuel us alone
 passion bloomin' through my bones
 dreams
 red rivers connect all of me
 don't you disappoint me
 push my head into my chest

Your kiss is sugary sweet
Your fingers feel like cotton
When you put your arms around me
I feel like I'm just missin'
Somethin' whenever you leave
We've got all the ingredients
Except you lovin' me
And respectfully
I'm not a piece of cake
For you to just discard
While you walk away
With the frosting of my heart
So I'm takin' back
The slice of heaven that I gave to you last night
You smell just like vanilla
You taste like buttercream
You're fillin' up my senses
With empty calories
I feel like I'm just missin'
Somethin' whenever you leave
You've got all the ingredients
Except you needin' me

Will I catch up to love? I can never tell
I know chasin' after you is like a fairy tale
But I feel like I'm glued on tight to this carousel
You must be this tall
To ride this ride
At the carnival
And run through playland

Kelly  had a fat ass and trouble was cookin'
She  had a boy wrapped around her finger tight
The teacher gave me notes to go out and give Kelly
I  wanted to be in her shoes for one day
I just waited 'til recess to make her pay (Make her pay)
Should I give him away or feel this bad?

Analyze my every move  what current state I'm in
'Cause you are colder (brrr) than ice on my skin
'Cause I am little  right? I won't call you out
Teachers saying you'd get credit  (good job!) why would you stop now?
You are so desperate  craving that spotlight
Shine it on the ones who do that shit  'cause it's their life
But I know the people around you say
Just do what it takes to make it all the way
You're a copy cat
And you take it then you leave it
You're falling flat
You find someone like me to bring you up right back
Up right back
(Copy cat  copy cat)
Obsessed with power  you want it for yourself
Feeding on misogyny
But still  you call yourself a feminista
If that were really true
You wouldn't feel as if I were a current threat to you

College estate and all your savings
My blood's for me  so no more taking
Anything you can do  I can do better
Imprisoned for stealing  gon' write you a letter
Courageous and clever  creative director
I'm hot as peppers  my words are in leather
They wanna build like their first name is Hector
From the projects  don't check on my ex
Think you're the boss  then I'll break broken necks
Wish you the best  won't show you my next move
So  I guess you'll be upset
Think for yourself  it'll all be okay

And it felt like bliss  used to miss your kiss
Throwing all your stuff into the abyss

How you like my spit?
That's for all the piss that you left me in
See the horns on my head? They're from goddesses  goddesses
On God
No  I never knew what it meant

It nеver quite made it through
Said it's all in my hеad  all in my head

No  I won't defend you to all my friends
This time I refuse
If you bite my hand again
I will never feed you

Why do you act that way? Why aren't you just like me?
So is that what you really wanna say to me?

Tellin' me if I'm unkind  still you abandon me

Livin' in a fake world  full of facades and chaotic behavior

Getting  high off helium
We paint white roses red
Each shade from a different person's head
This dream  dream is a killer
Getting drunk with the blue caterpillar
I'm peeling the skin off my face
'Cause I really hate being safe
The normals  they make me afraid
The crazies  they make me feel sane
The craziest friend that you've ever had
You think I'm psycho  you think I'm gone
Tell the psychiatrist something is wrong
Over the bend  entirely bonkers
You like me best when I'm off my rocker
Tell you a secret  I'm not alarmed
So what if I'm crazy? The best people are
All the best people are crazy

Until I prove you wrong like I've done time and time before  and
All your idle teachings and your criticism lack
The potential to penetrate my solid golden path
To decide what my future is  I'm my own clairvoyant
There’s no controlling me  imagination on ascend
Take me to Venus  let me explode
I’m ready to pop like a volcano
Jump over me like you're playing hot lava

Shake me like soda creme? But of course

Of where all the growth on the paper happens

I wish I never did 'cause she's the only one who sees me

They ain't getting no more

Oh  where's the principle?

Complicated  overrated
You're fixated and elated
By the separation
In this place that you've created
Fuck all of your rules and guidelines
You shouldn't even be on the sidelines
Can't you see that we're all hurtin'?
If you're not teachin'  we're not learnin'
Excuse me  how much are you earnin'?
I've tried to make you listen
But you won't  it's your way  right?
Killin' kids all day and night
Prescription pills and online fights
Shootin' at the angels while
Claiming you're the good guy
All you want is cash and hype
Fuck our dreams and that's not right

You don't know the pain that you are causin'
Yeah  your actions hurt  so do your words
The more you try to fuck us over
We will be there yelling at your front door
I've tried to make you listen
My hand on your seat
The whole way round
I carry band-aids on me now
For when your soft hands hit the jagged ground
Wheels aren't even touchin' the ground
Scared to take them off  but they're so worn down
Promise I won't push you straight to the dirt
If you promise me you'll take them off first
I love everything you do
When you call me fuckin' dumb for the stupid shit I do
I wanna ride my bike with you
Fully undressed  no trainin' wheels left for you
I'll pull 'em off for you
I love everything you do
When you call me fuckin' dumb for the stupid shit I do
I wanna ride my bike with you
Fully undressed  no trainin' wheels left for you
I'll pull 'em all off for you
Lettin' go  lettin' go
Tellin' you things you already know
I explode  I explode
Askin' you where you want us to go
You've been ridin' two-wheelers all your life
It's not like I'm askin' to be your wife
I wanna make you mine  but that's hard to say
Is this comin' off in a cheesy way?

Lay all your burdens to rest
Watch as you're put to the test
How I bend my body
I'm not just anybody
Caught in a haze and hypnotized and you're too thirsty
Open your view and you will find
Stop searching
Eyes on the prize
Thought the cherry would be better than the pie
That's your demise
But your focus is empty
Honeysucklе and fresh meat
Playing house to distract me
But you're no good at acting
Obvious what you're after

They always hustle for the pussy so they'll never get it
I saw that trick fall out your sleeve and I'm so certain

Baby
I'm spinnin’ 'round the corner
It's tasting kinda lonely
And my mind wants to control me
E-e-e-empty
There’s rotten things left in me
Injected by society
No one here but me to judge me
Pipe down with the noise  I cannot bear my sorrow
I hate who I was before
I fear I won't live to see the day tomorrow
Someone tell me if this is Hell
I gotta escape that void
There is no other choice  yeah
Tryna turn down the voices
The void ate me
Look at the mess I've done
There is nowhere to run  yeah
Holdin' a loaded gun
The void
Like a priest behind confession walls  I judge myself
Kneeling on a metal grater
Bloody like a body that has died and it's myself
Tangled in my own intestines
I gotta escape the void
There is no other choice  yeah
Gotta escape the void

So strange
I'm tryna find a doorway
My eyes are starin' at me
And they seem so damn unhappy
C-c-c-collect
My fickle insecurities
And turn them into beauty
Alchemize the dark within me (Ah)
Pipe down with the noise  I cannot bear my sorrow
I hate who I was before
I fear I won't live to see the day tomorrow

There are two boys yelling behind me and I'm terrified
Counting trees as they pass me by
And I'm trying not to look across the aisle
'Cause Maya's letting Dan put his hand up her skirt
And she's got her hand down his pants
I know the driver sees it
I know he's peeking in the rearview mirror
He says nothing
I'm quietly observing‚ I'm saying nothing
No one's watching us‚ don't give a fuck
Wheels on the bus
I'm holding it down up in the front
Wheels on the bus
Wheels on the bus
Puff‚ puff and pass it
Counting cars as they pass me by
And I'm trying not to look a row behind me
'Cause Jason's got his ass on the glass
And I hate him‚ driver hit a bump fast
