"Ahh  yeah-yeah (Wow)
We got London on the track
Hunnid and twenty  come catch me
Forties inside of my belly
Rock that Nirvana  my favorite
Damn  I forgot what her name is
Speaker system bumpin'  fuck your fuckin' block up (Fuck your block up)
Used to mock him  now it's custom Bentley mock-ups (Mock-ups)
Killer drop  a call from lockup
If you buy that Echo  why you lyin'? You broke
Got a nine in my tote  get you smoked like a stoge
Keep on ridin' my coat  your new shit is a joke
Why you bitin' my flows? What you tryna be  Post?
Yeah
When my whip stop  then my wheels keep spinnin' (Skrt)
When my whip stop  then my wheels keep spinnin'

She used to shoppin' at the mall (Ooh)
I'll teach lil' baby how to ball
I hit Rodeo  spent like 40 G's (Wow)
Four hunnid bands on Gucci socks (Socks)
I lost all my friends  made a lot of foes
Made a lot of M's  made a lot of O's
Open up the safe (Ooh)  I'm just with the bros
Cop the 458  cost me 2-5-0 (Yeah)
Man  look at all my ice (Ice)
I hit your main thing twice (Your main thing twice)
Take a word of advice (A word of advice)
Break up with that ho (Ho)
When my whip stop  then my wheels keep spinnin' (Skrt)
When my whip stop  then my wheels keep spinnin'
Cold wrist frozen
Got sacks  Goldman
Bought the bar  Roseanne
No joke  deadpan
When my whip stop  then my wheels keep spinnin'
Ooh (Ooo-ooo)

Said you needed a ride  but you wanted my car

I really like you  despite who you are  oh (Who you are)
You see me on TV  you know I'm a star
You say you don't know me  but I know that's false
I'll pay the price  girl  whatever that cost  oh (What it cost)
You make my life so hard
But that's what gets me off
I had a thousand bad times
So what's another time to me? (What's that to me  yeah)
You try to burn my house down
But what's another house to me? (What's that to me  yeah)
'Cause I can take anything that you give me (What you give me)
It's gonna take a lot more to kill me  bitch
So thank you for the grave (Yeah)

Erase you on Monday
Gave in by Friday
Went straight back to sideways
I took your pills and your drugs just to feel something else
'Cause I can't feel you no more
You're friends with all my demons
The only one that sees them
Too bad for you
Gave a hundred million reasons
But why can't you believe them?
Too bad for you
And now we're soberin' up but never sober enough

Coulda been a seamstress  still wouldn't cut him slack

But I'm still droppin' jaws
Got 'em lookin' like James Harden at the awards (Oh-oh-oh)
Back to you  I'm so into you
For real  breh like I'm kin to you
If you a 10  I add 10 to you
They be mad when I tend to you

Twenty candles  blow 'em out and open your eyes
We were lookin' forward to the rest of our lives
Used to keep my picture posted by your bedside
Now it's in your dresser with the socks you don't like
With my brothers like it's Jonas  Jonas
Drinkin' Henny and I'm tryna forget

Grew into a savage and that's why they gave this verse to me

Brought some strangers in our beds
And now you lost your right to privacy
Spilling all our secrets

Know you fucking love it on the low

You reach for a shake  I'ma hold out a fist
Giving a nigga a quarter pound without the fries

Just to show a nigga I don't really need him
Pass a man a plate and he can make it shake
It's guaranteed he'll fold and bite the hand that feed him
And I know you think that I ain't see it

Don't make me go and buy a bitch a lil' Prius
Fuck on the camera  we can call it even

Nobody left but us
Tryna chase a feelin'  but we'll never feel it
Ridin' on the last train home
Dyin' in our sleep  we're livin' out a dream
We only make it out alone
I just keep on hopin' that you call me
You say you wanna see me  but you can't right now
You never took the time to get to know me
We're scared of losin' somethin' that we never found
We're runnin' out of reasons  but we can't let go
Outside  the winter sky turnin' grey
City up in smoke  it's only ash when it rains
Howl at the moon and go to sleep in the day
Love for everybody 'til the drugs fade away
In the mornin'  blocking out the sun with the shades
She gotta check her pulse to tell herself that she okay
It seem like dyin' young is an honor
But who'd be at my funeral? I wonder
I go out and all they eyes on me
I show out  do you like what you see?
And now they closin' in on me
Let 'em sharpen all they teeth
This is more than I can handle  blood in my Lambo'
