lyrics
"I wait for freedom soon  can't take much more
I feel the whole Earth shake (I feel the whole Earth shake)
Brought to my knees (Brought to my knees)
I shall be free (I shall be free)
I shall be free (I shall be free)
I hear the sweetest sound (I shall be free)
Blowing from the north (I shall be free)
It’s says  Don't panic now (I shall be free)
What's mine is yours (I shall be free)
I hope 10 000 times (I shall be free)
You tell me the truth (I shall be free)
’Cause now there's much to do (I shall be free)
I trust in you (I trust in you)
I shall be free (I shall be free)
I shall be free (I shall be free)
I shall be free (I shall be free)
I shall be free (I shall be free)
I shall be free (I shall be free)
We shall we free (We shall be free)
Truth be free as the sparrow
Come join me  come join me
Come by all
Oh  what dreams I've been dreaming
Of a sweet  sweet march to freedom
Freedom  freedom
Sojourn it will be  sojourn it will be
In the dead of night
But then came angels
'Til you said
There were sirens
Out to get me
I just pray
You choose to catch me
But either way
You were always worth the fall
So I said
You might also like
Hate all the things that they say
Love 'cause the things they choose to hate
It's just a love that they're afraid of
Not afraid to get too deep
Singing long live the angels
Things aren't as dark as they may seem
Remember fear is in no way truthful
And I say what luck to find you in this life
I've been around so many times
And never found someone so beautiful
 I'm gonna steal it
Cause it's a miracle I'm here
Guess you could call me spiritual
Cause physical is fear
And it's safe to say the storms gone away
And I’m dancing on the morning after
And I miss the love and laughter
Something like flying
Hard to describe it
Every moon and every star
You never are alone
And it's safe to say you surrender your days
To pay back all the love you borrowed
And today is jealous of tomorrow

Hard to describe it
'Cause from over here I missed the joke
Clear the way for my crash landing
I'd be smiling if I wasn't so desperate
I'd be patient if I had the time
I could stop and answer all of your questions
As soon as I find out how I can move from the back of the line
Selling out tonight
I'd be less angry if it was my decision
And the money was just rolling in
If I had more than my ambition

Selling out tonight
I touch on you more and more every time
When you leave I'm beggin' you not to go
Such a funny thing for me to try to explain
How I'm feeling and my pride is the one to blame
Just how your love can do what no one else can
Got me lookin' so crazy right now
Your love's got me lookin' so crazy right now
(Your love)
Got me lookin' so crazy right now
Your touch's got me lookin' so crazy right now
(Your touch)
Got me hoping you page me right now
Your kiss's got me hoping you save me right now
When I talk to my friends so quietly
Who he think he is? look at what you've done to me
Tennis shoes don't even need to buy a new dress
It's the way that you know what I thought I knew
It's the beat that my heart skips when I'm with you
Just how your love can do what no one else can

Got me hoping you page me right now
Your kiss's got me hoping you save me right now
You got your family back and you got your smile
And you promised your sister that you'd never go back again
But friends keep telling you what he did last night
How many girls he kissed  how many he liked
And you try to remember that
There's no way you could ever be friends
And now you're feeling like you miss him  miss him
You're speaking like you really love him  love him
And now you're dancing like you need him  need him
Put it in your pocket  don't tell anyone I gave ya
It will be the one you run to  the one that saves ya
Daddy  daddy
He kissed you on the lips and opened your eyes
You had to catch your breath  got such a surprise
And you almost forgot how it feels to live in his light
He pulled you closer  said he'll never let go
You couldn't trust him  but you never said no
In that moment he made you forget how it feels when he's gone

You are what God imagined  you are a true perfection
You are a lot of soul  mixed with a lot of magic
Look how the sky turns gold every time you're dancing
You deserve all the love  why don't you let it in?
Don't punish who you are for who once you have been
You've got a heart of fire  it's gonna take you higher
That you're an extraordinary being
Yes  you're an extraordinary being
See  your anatomy is made up of those before you
Gold is your history  you're standing upon their shoulders
Look how you're flying now  check out your super powers
You deserve peace of mind  you deserve all the laughter
You are one of a kind  you deserve happy ever after

Spread your wings like an eagle
Raise your hand to the sun
And know that you are someone
Yes  you're an extraordinary being (That's right)

I've been kicking down the doors
I've been burning all the boxes
'Cause I'm a slave to only truth
I'm as wild as a wolf
You can't keep me from the mountains
I'm replacing all my demons
For the sweetest songs of freedom
Last night I had a dream that I could fly
I'm as free as a bird
I'm as free as a bird
I don't know if you've heard
I don't know if you've heard
But I taught my heart to sing
And I found me a pair of wings
I'm as free as a bird
I'm as free as a bird

The light began to enter
Last night I had a dream that I could fly
I'm as free as a bird
I'm as free as a bird
I don't know if you've heard

But I taught my heart to sing
And I gave me a pair of wings
Let me love  let me touch  let me love
Baby  give it up  let me drink from the fountain
In the car  on the street  in the dark
Baby  on the beach  in the back of the garden
Oooh ooh ooh  I'm ready
Oooh ooh  don't stop
Oooh ooh ooh  I'm ready
Oooh ooh  don't stop
You're in the club  how you dance  how you touch
How you offer up all your love and devotion
Roll it up  spark it up  let it burn
On the balcony  and we can fly to the ocean

No place I'd rather be than the back of the garden
Oooh ooh ooh  I'm ready
Oooh ooh  don't stop
Oooh ooh ooh  I'm ready
Oooh ooh  catch up
Once upon a time ago
I threw my cautions to the wind  my friend
And yelled  Geronimo!
And rode the wings of love to outer space
But then I fell a thousand miles to Guantanamo
Euphoria to torture
I left a note that had a rhyme  it go:
Love is like a ferris wheel
Love is like a roller coaster
Love is at a standstill
Body after body after body
It's a landfill
And I just caught a body
In the lobby and got my hands filled
I'm a serial lover
I set up all the dates
That rang up fate and got my friends killed
I barely knew my dad  sometimes I feel like my mother
I love that Purple Rain love
That have a fight  that scratch my face
That fuck outside and ride my motorcycle in the rain love
Love is like a garden  love is like a death sentence
Love is like a pardon  I'm free again and ready
Once outside these prison walls  to believe again is scary
Your garden is my sanctuary
Back of the garden
Oooh ooh ooh  I'm ready
Oooh ooh  don't stop
Oooh ooh ooh  I'm ready
Oooh ooh  don't stop
Yeah oooh ooh ooh  I'm ready
Oooh ooh  don't stop
Oooh ooh ooh  I'm ready
Oooh ooh  don't stop
Oh yeah  yeah
Mmh
I guess I got caught up
In the rough and tumble
Didn't mean to cause no trouble
At all  at all
I'm just so sick
Of the dream they're selling
It doesn't feel like heaven
At all  at all
Give me something
Give me something
Give me something
I can believe in
Give me something
Come on  give me something
Please  give me something

I fell in love with fear
Oh God  forgive me
Have mercy on me
Oh  it's not easy here
And please excuse the mess
See  I just wanna feel
It all  it all

But people change their minds
And people change their hearts
With the seasons
And then the songs
They too must end
So tell me now  my friend
Where does that leave us?
Give me something
Oh please God  give me something
I can believe in
Give me something  anything
Give me something

I'm not really sure what I'm about
But with you I'm sure that I could work it out
I'm not certain who it is I'm praying to
But I know they gon' listen if you ask them to

We may live again  but hey now  maybe not
So if you love someone  give it all you've got
Time is easy spent  but it can’t be bought
So stop acting as if tomorrow's promised
Stop acting as if you can't be honest  honest
Honest with yourself
Never let the tide of change wash away the dream you’ve dreamt
Don't get left wondering where the summer went
'Cause if not now  then come on darling  tell me when
Stop acting as if tomorrow's promised
Stop acting as if you can't be honest  honest
Honest with yourself
Stop acting as if tomorrow's promised

Breathe in  breathe out  don't hold it in
Let fear fall down  let love begin
Be brave  be bold with no regrets
Try something that scares you a bit
Write your own song and sing it loud
Love who you are  stand tall  stand proud
Keep the good and lose the rest
If you know your truth  say it with your chest
Don’t care so much what people think
Most wouldn’t care if you float or sink
Just know the ones who love you most
Treat them right and keep them close
And savour every breath and cherish every day
'Cause the sun’s here now  but the moon is on the way
Don't get too caught up dwelling in your yesterday
Stop acting as if tomorrow's promised
Stops turning its back on the young
I hope that we can fix all that we’ve done
I really hope Martin can’t see this
I hope that we still have a dream
I’m hoping that change isn’t hopeless
I’m hoping to start it with me
I just hope I’m not the only one
I hope we start seeing forever
Instead of what we can gain in a day
I hope we start seeing each other
Cause don’t we all bleed the same?
I really hope someone can hear me
That a child doesn’t bear the weight of a gun
Hope I find the voice within me to scream at the top of my lungs
I just hope I’m not the only one
How can things be better left unsaid?
But it seems that dreams are all that we’ve got left

I hope that you take it with me
I just hope I’m not the only one

Loving you the way I do  it hurts
Hold tight  it's a sing-along
I know you remember me
5'3 in the back of the library  come on
You could at least try  look at me
Bang  bang  there goes paradise
Ah shit  why we always have to roll the dice  la-la
Hearts beating irregular
Two seats in the back of the cinema  hazy
Ah yeah  you forgetting that
And all the mad shit we did after that  crazy
Your heart's a cold November
I swear you're giving me shivers  shivers
Baby  I'm not made of stone  it hurts
Loving you the way I do  it hurts

Baby  I'm not made of stone  it hurts
Loving you the way I do  it hurts
When all that's left to do is watch it burn

It hurts the way that you forget our times together

Imagine there's no countries

Nothing to kill or die for
And no religion too
Imagine all the people living life in peace
You
You may say I'm a dreamer
But I'm not the only one

And the world will live as one
Imagine no possessions

No need for greed or hunger
A brotherhood of man
Imagine all the people sharing all the world

I pray you get home safe
I pray your date of birth  to come boat to those cold gates
I pray you don't lose faith  pray you don't lose faith
Life begins at 40 momma  I pray you see old age
I've seen you go to work and come home and go to work
And not moan about your worth
Because there's nothing in your purse
But that money don't define you
Plus  you hate being lied to
That's probably why there's no fella beside you
But besides that  I'm beside you
Hospital bedside  thinking how the fuck can I 
There's no quittin'  there's no quittin'
What good's a fire in the booth if I could burn with those lyrics
Clock's tickin' and it's getting hard for me
They just said my mother's got heart disease
Man  I swear I felt that in my artery
If we could swap I'd give you every part of me
Every lesson that you taught me was priceless
I mean it's funny how you add value when you're a minus
Corned beef sandwich for dinner when we were rice -less
Had that shit time after time  I guess it's timeless
The candles stayed lit when the electric gave in
I kept our fire burning  mom  we never gave in
And if the kingdom's coming man it's best waiting
'Cause I ain't leaving your side  it's gonna be a long night

Well  sometimes I get lonely
And some days  you don't know me
And to try explain why I'll be gone by morning
Is like expecting spring to understand the autumn
So come on  let’s stop wasting all our energy
Let’s stop wasting summer on our knees
And don't lie to me  I know you felt the changes
And nothing's new  it's been this blue for ages
So baby  I'm outta here
Baby  I'm outta here
Sometimes  I get lonely
And I wish you'd just hold me
And to try explain why some days hurt more than others
Is like asking rain to sing above the thunder
So come on  let’s stop wasting all our energy
Let’s stop wasting summer on our knees
And don't lie to me  I know you felt the changes
And nothing's new  it's been this blue for ages
So baby  I'm outta here

Sometimes I get lonely
Couldn’t keep hands off each other
We used to laugh until we cried
You used to look at me and smile
And all the signs seem to say love is lost
But I don’t wanna give up what we’ve got
Maybe you could stay a bit longer
I could try and bit harder
We could make this work
But maybe we should stop pretending
We both know we’re hurting
Maybe it’s time to go
We broke up last Sunday night
Keep on thinking 'bout the fight
Rest my head against the wall
Your bags are by the door
Then your key turns in the lock
You see me on the stairs and stop
Have you had a change of heart?
Can we go back to the start?

And that we’re going to build a house with lots of windows
I’d never work these hours if I didn't love you
My hands are always red and sunshine I sleep through

But don’t ever question if my heart beats only for you  it beats only for you
Cause when you’ve given up
When no matter what you do is never good enough
When you never thought that it could ever get this tough
That’s when you feel my kind of love
And when you’re crying out
When you fall and then can’t pick your heavy off the ground
When the friends you thought you had haven’t stuck around
That’s when you feel my kind of love
You won’t see me at the parties  I guess I’m just no fun
I won’t be turning up the radio singing  “Baby You’re The One.”
But don’t ever question if my heart beats only for you  it beats only for you

I know I keep my heart protected  far away from my sleeve

I mean what I say  I say what I mean
My heart’s on my sleeves  I threw all my tank tops away
And if it’s meant to be you will feel the intensity
She said she’d rather twerk than turn the other cheek
The key is to discern the pure from the tainted
I may look like a fool to you but soon you’ll understand
The power in God’s plan
You’re treading on troubled waters  well I was once told when it
Feels like hell then
Heaven’s around corner  the weather is fair
But tomorrow will bring rain
So when you cryin out and nobody's around  I’ll be there
Don’t question that yea
My heart beats only for you
My heart beats only for you
My heart beats only for you yea
My heart beats only for you yea yea
So don’t ever question
(Chorus – part 1)
(Chorus – part 2)
 still  I'm not gonna lie
 nothing like your entourage
 I won't promise you the stars
 it's never good enough
 I guess I'm just no fun
 and I say what I don't mean
 far away from my sleeve
 it's never good enough
 it's never good enough
Enticed by the glamorous ice  I wanna
Unite with the Hollywood twice  my concert'll look like yours
And I wanted more than I could ever imagine  even a kicked-down door
Struck by the fame bug  been fighting the same drug
The feeling that caned us in vain  it's tough love
Please help me  please help me
Ain't nothing bigger than you  I thought a Benz'd do
But nothing bigger than you  ain't nothing bigger than truth
And truth be told  the totem pole
Of non-believers just made the cattle blow
But I can see ya  even when my vision's impaired
You're many moons away  but still you're right here
You won't find him drinking under tables
Rolling dice and staying out 'till three

I wonder what I did to you to make you hate me

You never even got to see me rap
I just wish you woulda reached out
I wish you woulda been round when I been down
I wish that you could see me now
Wherever you are I really hope you found peace
But know that if I ever have kids
Unlike you I'll never let them be without me
I wanna sing  I wanna shout
I wanna scream till the words dry out
So put it in all of the papers  I'm not afraid
I write songs I can't listen to
Everything I have I give to you
In every one of these lines I sing to you
My job's more like public service
My life just became yours to read and interpret
If you heard it will come across a lot different at times
I throw fits when I read how they word things
You see me smile
Now you're gonna have to see me hurt
Coz pretending everything is alright when it ain't  really isn't working
I wanna sing  I wanna shout
I wanna scream till the words dry out
