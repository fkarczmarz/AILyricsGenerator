Paralyzed and possessed by crusaders deceased
Lost to the sirens that call from the turbulent tides
Bound by the science that lives on the lips of the wise
The beating of a million drums
The fire of a million guns
The mother of a million sons
Civilization
The beating of a million drums
The fire of a million guns
The mother of a million sons
Civilization
Tantalized and seduced by the demons released
Ears to the ground by the whim of the merciless sky
Onto the fire that burns in the all seeing eye
The beating of a million drums
The fire of a million guns
The mother of a million sons
Civilization
The beating of a million drums
The fire of a million guns
The mother of a million sons
Civilization
The beating of a million drums
The fire of a million guns
The mother of a million sons
Civilization
The beating of a million drums
The fire of a million guns
The mother of a million sons
Civilization
The beating of a million drums
The fire of a million guns
The mother of a million sons
Do the D.A.N.C.E

Get ready to ignite

Catching all the lights

It's always the same
Always ashamed storytelling
When I can't come in
To a hopeless troglodyte
But one more time my answer stands
I swear I mean no offense
But you better learn to read
It's all 'bout membership
I spell it for the young and old
Ugly girls and boys
I put you on my list
And make you clap to this
Is it mayhem or just an ego trip
Only one can win
And soon you'll say that's him

And as it broke there was one
The winter battle was won
The summer children were born
And so the story goes on'n'on
Come woman if your life beats
Those we buried with the house keys
Smoke and feather where the fields are green
From here to eternity
Come woman in your own time

Rising up from the dead leaves

It's time that you listen up and hear the call
Bail out the water
Backed against the wall
And make your mind up
Got to get it up to make it better
Step outside and find yourself a lover
When you know you've arrived
Aim it high
When you know you've arrived
Shoot it high
Hold on to what you've got
Those days are good and gone

After picking the right clothes for about an hour
I'm gettin' ready for my night out on the town
I'm lookin' hot cause you know we are holdin' it down
Rockin' high tops and sayin' no to stilettos
Cause I might get drunk off my ass and I don't wanna fall
Out on the streets all the taxis are showin' me love
Cause I'm shinin' like a princess in the middle of thugs
And at the club the bouncers recognize my face
So while you waitin' in the line we just enter the place
Let's get this party started right
Let's get drunk and freaky fly
You with me so it's alright
We gonna stay up the whole night
Let's get this party started right
Let's get drunk and freaky fly
I'm callin' all my ladies at the table three
Throwin' back a couple bottles and the tab's on me
Having some big ones then we startin' to get crazy
Now we all ready to head out of the VIP
I'm lookin' good and I can feel that all eyes are on me
It's time to show how 'em how we do on the floor
So while the DJ play my track I want my girls on the floor
Now you know I made an anthem for all my hot chicks
I got the surround sound so why ya wanna see me fall?
I'm just tryin' to have a blast and I ain't takin' your call
