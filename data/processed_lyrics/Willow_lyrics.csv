lyrics
"Ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-woo-ooh
The sun falls over the mountain
It feels like a lifetime ago
And so were you
I can't imagine ever going back now
And I never want to see you turn your back now
But I know you wanted to
Wow
This can't last forever
This can't last forever
 I’m talking low for me
 that’s where I climb so high to see you
 see the stars and then I smell your kiss
 show me your galaxy
 you put me here
 inside your mind
 you took me there
 when they roll on by
 that’s where I climb so high to see you
 see the stars and then I smell your kiss
 show me your galaxy
 all the MSFTS are foster kids
 we kinda like sausages
 what I will do is offer this
 my extension to enter that
 yeah I like to look at all the women
 when the sun is on I’m summer sun in summer
 forgot our teams
Take the money  take the fame
All I want is truth
You talk their language  play their games
Act as they want to
Look at you  look at you
Who are you? Who are you?
You walk the streets aimlessly
The density is rain
The thoughts you think just cause you pain
And don't make you more free
What to do? Woe is you
What to do? Who are you?
You criticize behind those eyes
No hatred  you're just jealous
Your subconscious is not conscious
To poison your ingestin'
Woe is you Who are you?
It's your choice  just make the move
Burning bridges  burning bridges
Posies all fall down
Now consciousness is all there is
And nothingness as well
What are we? What to see?
My third eye is opening
I'm burning bridges  burning bridges
Posies all fall down
Are consciousness is all that is
But nothingness is well

What are we and who are you?
Did we just go down the drain?
And I just go with my flow
The pavement seems too cold
And now my feet turn purple
(Hey  Willow? What?)
Take the money  take the fame
All I want is truth
You talk their language  play their games
Did you forget 'bout who you were?
In the stars
Lets go back home
This Earth is hard
This Earth is all up in the stars
The Ursa's hungry
He's just lookin' for a brotha to get started
Burning bridges  burning bridges
We just fallin' down
Our consciousness is nothingness
And nothingness is well
Who are you?
Who am I? Who am I?
Where is me? Where is I?
There's no I
It's just all
You don't have to walk another road or walk the road alone
I can see sky from here
I can see God from here
Yes I'm all alone
'Cause baby you
Got me tied up in this love thing it's tough 'cause I

What took you so long to finish your swan song?
Moments to savor
And as I walk these roads throughout my life
I find the subtle reasons
There has to be a reason I'm alive
I know there'll be a reason that I die
And as I walk these roads throughout my life
I find the subtle reasons
No heart
No no heart
You'll find your reason
You'll find your reason
You'll find a reason
Maybe there's no reason for existence
But I believe it doesn't til we make one
We create our own reason
Kill them all
Your thoughts won't help you anymore
Free your heart
It's the only thing that breaks but still can be taught
Love every day that comes into your life
It's just a test
Shed your skin
Realize that water and fire are just your kin
You might also likeI know there is a reason I'm alive
I know there'll be a reason while I die
But as I walk this path throughout my life
Gratitude's a reason
Embrace the subtle reason
Make your own reason
Do you see this?
Are you scared?
Or you're angry based in fear
Do you want out easy way?
Do you see this?
Are you scared?
Or you're angry based in fear
We all want out easy way
And again and again and again
'Til we learn what we have to
Learn what we have to
Come from zero comparison
Life gets so wild and so
Free and auras channel through me
Source energy
Ooo baby girl
Your heart is like a tree
Damn baby girl
You gotta shed your leaves
My sword is up
And my heart is down
But you would never know
My heart is broken
Don't make a sound
That's why you never know
Baby girl
There's so much love in your eyes
So baby girl
Don't let em' turn it into ice
Happiness and contentment
Come from zero comparison

I'm just a caterpillar in its cocoon
Waiting to see the world again
And when I wake from eternal sleep
Inside my skin
And  using the flames to make a new me
He plays guitar
He likes Quentin Tarantino
And really sad songs
Anxiety attacks when he wakes up in the morning
And I can't help the thought he thinks I'm boring
'Cause I come from a cluster of super bright stars
And probably to him it feels scary to reach that far
But down on Earth there's so much pain
But way up here we explore galaxies
Hey mom  I met a boy
He's super sad
But I think that I love him
Is that bad?
Anxiety attacks when I wake up in the morning
Dude  how come? This is wack
Is love just torment?
But they say life has a silver lining
And I say I will find it my way
'Cause down on Earth theres so much pain
And way up here there's galaxies
Hey God  are you there? I need to talk
I'm feeling love is here and then is not
We hysterically cry when we wake up in the morning
 you’re my stars and sun
 I just want you back
 you were cool with that part of me
 I feel so alone
 baby won’t you come home?
 baby won’t you come home?
 far away
 I feel so alone
 won’t you come home?
 it all leads back to you
 I been doing well
 I feel so alone
 baby won’t you come home?
Ain't tryna step on no toes
Ain't tryna bust no bowls
But I'm just trying to get home
A person to talk to
I'm lost in the light
I'm feeling really bright
I don't wanna spend the night
Lost in the night
I really wanna cry
I don't sleep at night
We do what is wrong
But what is right?
Please explain to me what is wrong
We do what we feel
We make our own path
Our path now
Not tryna find another name
Not tryna get in another body
You cannot stop me

A person to talk to
I'm lost in the tide
I don't think I can get out
I'm swimming from that shark mouth
And that island of undal is really far away
I don't think I will make it at all
But I fall
What happens when we fall?
We go down in consciousness and we rise into a life like
What the heck is happening?
Why am I here? Why can I sing?
Why am I across the seas? This is crazy
You'll find something waiting
Right there where you left it
Lying upside down
When you finally find it
You'll see how it's faded
The underside is lighter
When you turn it around
Everything stays right where you left it
Ever so slightly
Daily and nightly
In little ways
How you feelin'?
I've been goin' all week doin' my class now
I'm just gettin' so weak
I'm just climbin' on trees and skippin' my class now
Don't place your blame on me
I don't want it to get bad
I've been goin' all week doin' my class
How you feelin'?
How you feelin'?
After I give you that amethyst crystal under your pillow now
How you feelin'?
I saw you walkin' down the hall
I knew it was you but my mouth didn't call
I thought that I wasn't the one that you wanted
Until I went onto your inspir and done it
I just done it
You might also like
I'll tell you right now
I've been climbin' in trees and jumpin' in creeks
 anymore
 but I
 but I
Not surprised to see the sky and only think of you
Tell me  how am I to feel?
Tell me how
I don't know if I can deal
I need to scream it loud
Oh  and I'm falling into the arms of naked truth
Not surprised to see the sky and know what I must do
Tell me  how am I to feel?
Tell me how
Oh  and I'm falling into the arms of naked truth
Not surprised to see myself reflecting the universe
Am I to feel bolder 'cause
All of my pumping blood?
I am human  I am woman
Drifting down my life
Light up this time  light up this time
 in a stain steel sphere
 Where did I come from?
I come from that planet that hit Tiamat
 let's save the world like this
 but I don't know how to stop you
 whatever I guess whatever
 get dressed whatever
 whatever
 but I do not want to stop you
 let me love you
 can we get the party started  yeah
 can we get the party started
 fire  fire
 check it  I walk with a slur
 now watch me put her on
 L.A. to UK
 to the extreme
 didn’t I just see you in China?
 you’re gully kinda
 call me Chun-Li
 yea  that mean to step your weight up
 hater
 burn
 burn
 burn
Saw the mother snap back and now you're where you started
My heart aches when I see your face
That's the story of this life but my soul saw it twice
Never had a problem but my soul seems to fight through the artifice of life
But it's the flower
We were walking on clouds but the greys came down and they wiped us all out
But it's the flower
We were walking on clouds but the greys came down and they wiped us all out
But it's the flower
I wanna be an atlantean
We'll see what they've been hiding
Let me tell you bout the story of Poseidon
The government is tryna drown us out then not help them
Remembered how we can all shift the weather
The realization that were all in unity
We're the flower

We were walking on clouds but the greys came down and they wiped us all out
But it's the flower
Still got room to grow
I've been really searching emotional wealth
Every time I look at my face
'Cause no one ever truly knows just who they are
And I feel closer knowing I don't have to hide my scars
I hope you know you're not alone
Being confused ain't right or wrong
You'll find that you're your own best friend
I've been putting work in healing myself
Still got room to grow

I've been putting work in healing myself
Still got room to grow

And love me instead
It's not official but I think it's common sense
Or am I insane?
I blew out the gaslight  now I feel a different way
I'll just love me instead
Love me instead
Love me instead
I like you  you like me
That's why I'm confused  I can't read the signs
So why you gotta treat me like this?
I just need to breathe so I don't go apeshit
When I wake up  I see you
At night in my dreams
Yeah that too and I
I had to tell her  Just stop messing with my head
And love me instead
It's not official but I think it's common sense
Or am I insane?
I blew out the gaslight  now I feel a different way
I'll just love me instead

 oh  ah
 oh
 I won't stop
 amnesia
 when I roll with you
 maybe climb some trees
 or maybe...swing on vines
 oh
 I won't stop
 amnesia
 I do not know  I do not know
 I do not know  I do not know
 I do not know  I do not know
 I do not know  I do not know
Dripping down my moon
Your smile like the wind
I only met you once
But how do I begin?
The Kong Lung market and your flower of life T-Shirt
You said you'd fallen and just how much it hurts
So you blew the clouds and you walked around
Asked Pele to take you away from me
A guy pulled a knife and life will suffice
Then fell asleep under the Noni tree
The Kong Lung market and your flower of life T-Shirt
(Away away away away)
Your caramel eyes and signature sly smirk
(Away away away away)

So you smoked the ice and you dodged the knife
Those kids kept on fooling you
You asked to die but you stayed alive
And got lost in Anna's eyes
(Away away away away)
Please finish your story
 just happened
 but not the millions of times
 when we die but
 back in the density
 if you can unlock your mind
 get something to eat
 for you and me
 and see who we are
 for you and me
 why isn't it
 why isn't it
As it perched in a tree
Feel like a knife
As it burrows into me
Love is not a game
Love does not explain
Feel like a bird
With a broken wing
Feel like a knife
As it cuts into me
Love is not a game
Love does not explain
Feel like a bird
Saying who you wanna be
Vision gets dimmer
The room is closing in on me
Looking at life through a blue bird's eye
Tell me why I couldn't ever find cloud nine
I spread my wings
The song they sing
It's just smoke and mirrors
They said it's gonna take some time
I think we live in a labyrinth
That was created by my mind

I never wanted to just suffer inside
Hurt don't heal when I'm always tryna hide
And I'm looking at pain like my old close friend
Open arms for her when I see her again
I spread my wings
The song they sing
Flying
Went up so—
Went up so far
I want to see the world through divine eyes
Cross the lake and fly into the sky
I might may be crazy or this world is shady
But I hope that you don't mind
'Cause I'll breathe alone
And I'll sleep alone
And I'll eat alone
And I'll laugh alone
'Cause I'm in the zone
With my lovely bones
And you'll cry alone
On the lonely road
'Cause I'll breathe alone
And I'll sleep alone
And I'll eat alone
And I'll laugh alone
'Cause I'm in the zone
With my lovely bones
And you'll cry alone
On the lonely road

It looks so peaceful when I'm watching you
At night I can see
Will you stay with me
Until the earth runs dry?
Ice in our veins
Love in our still hearts
I'm not playin' games
And I'm not gonna go off
Ice in our veins

And I'm not gonna go on

Tonight
It's your fault that I'm this way
I go through all that pain
Just to be alone at the end of the day
Spend another time
I can't spit another rhyme on Gaia
Guns and wars won't stop the fights
Not inside your mind
Your cheeks get redder
There's nothing better
Even in rough weather
It's raining knives like all the time
Oh
What's up with your dad up in the nightosphere?

I think I'm getting started
Us humans we don't know one thing
About ourself or anything
And I for one know nothing
But you can tell me something
You can whisper something
You think I'm coming undone
You think I'm going crazy
Us humans we don't know one thing
About ourself or anything
And he for one knows everything
And she won't tell you nothing
We want our freedoms without responsibility
And we are so scared to see

I said it
But they're on their phone and I'm on a roll
And I do not care cause I am the oldest one
I'm just a... teenager
But I feel angrier than a swarm of hornets
They call us whores but it's just because
We do just what we want and don't look back once
I am free
We are the children that sing the ancient song
And we can sing it very well
But there's still so much to learn
There's still so much to earn
But I yearn
Who am I scared
Who cut us open
Tiyawn
Organization and classification is ruining the hearts of our generation
I said it
True made the map
True took us to the forest to the top of the mountain
He told me to get on the mic and spit what's in my lung
They tried to talk about who
But they just wake me up
They just try to tell me the things I know already
In my cerebral capacity
Maybe we go to a lake that I found
Maybe we go right now
And it's snowing but it's warm outside
Write a letter on the beach at night
Go to bed and then I see those lights
Telling me about atomic structure
The ocean rolls around and 'round and 'round
And 'round and 'round and 'round and 'round and 'round
And the Taurus goes around and down
Never rock
I'm in the spot
You don't want to walk around on the hot coals of self-acceptance
We'll do this together
Organization and classification is ruining the souls of our generation
We said it
And the kids know very well
And the kids will dig the well

They want the girls in the movies
Want the girls with the prettiest smile
Want the girls with the lips
And the cascading hair
Little do we all know that the vanity we see
Can I play inside your pretty curls?
Because you're such a fucking pretty girl
I want a girl who's got a light
That makes me squint when I look in her eyes
She doesn't give a fuck when emotions run amuck
Want a girl who knows herself
Like her favorite book right on the shelf
That she's read a million times
And still find the design

Baby I've seen you before
You're dancing softly  oh what do I know?
Oh yeah I'm dancing for sure

I don't see you often  what do I know?
Needing you in the astral realms
I can call your dorm room right from my labradorite

It's a hoax to trick your mind into thinking perfection exists
Or absence of suffering
Stop leading girls to the clouds above
It's so distracting
We can focus on self-love
Morality doesn't exist
It's a construct we breed into children who see
We create our paradigms
We create all our lives
Ancient biology
Evolving psychology
Is all here in this moment
I want to know you like I know myself
But it would be just as confusing and hell
I'm imagining a different history
Imagine us in a field
Feasting on mountains that stretch very high
With the sky is the color of bruises and cuts
Oozing and bleeding all over the Sun

But it would be just as confusing and hell
I'm imagining a different history
Where man and women stay equal
In the eyes of society
Where we don't condemn different people
For exercising their freedom
Where sex stays sacred
And an act of divine love
And not perverted into violence and lust
Where we still honor our mother
In all of her burgeoning light
Where we do not kill our brothers
Or rape our sisters
Not especially
I'm alone
You make me feel
You make me wonder why I am feeling this way
When she sees him come into the bar she's lurking at

You had to be there to see

Hidden with our bodies and earth  herself
To raise our brothers and sisters

And nobody ever handled it  the way our ancients did

Talking of digits‚ I handle my business
Botanical wrist when I throw up
Make everything golden

I'm in the kitchen  they know it
These young boys snoring
I'm 'bout to get 'em up going
Up early in the morning

And all the things that she would also
Tell me one thing
Is it really bad to have experience?
Then you know for yourself
Rather than sit home and believe in this
I looked and walked and then I went and touched it
I took off running and was not near stopping

Broken
Two shards that fit together
Hoping
More come together
To make a piece of art
Bigger than anything we could imagine
To make a piece of art
That's raising the whole vibration of gaia
Going right back to the ropes

It tastes like warm honey
My self seems never enough
To me only it's funny
But now I open up my eyes big enough to cry
The universe is too bright
Light beams in the sky speaking to my third eye
Speaking through my third eye
Your heart melts into my cup
It tastes like warm honey
I know it's never enough
Only to us it's funny
But then we fall back to earth
But then we come back to us
Trying to find myself

Refract the wisdom to heal the abyss
