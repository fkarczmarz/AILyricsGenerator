lyrics
"Big old pie in the sky  hopes are high
Crazy dreams  y'all (talk about it)
Bucket list full of ignorance is bliss
Hoping that I live to see it all before I die
I heard about the power of intention
Did I forget to mention  I just wanna get paid
A million dollars a day  hey
A million dollars a day  hey
Said I just wanna get paid  'cause I'm worth it
A million dollars a day  I deserve it
A million dollars a day
Hey
I got needs  y'all (talk about it)
I'm in debt to my knees from tuition and fees
From my degrees  y'all (talk about it)
And my skills should pay the bills
But I still got a couple mouths to feed  y'all
And they ask me all the time:
(Daddy  why do we always gotta stand in this line?)

I heard about the power of intention
Did I forget to mention that I hope it works out for me?
Give me please a million dollars a day  hey
A million dollars a day  hey
Said I just wanna get paid  'cause I'm worth it
A million dollars a day  watch me work it
A million dollars a day
Hey  hey
Hey  hey
In my wildest imagination (imagination)
My whole life is just a vacation (just a vacation)
If I believe in it (If I believe in it)  I can achieve it (I can achieve it)
Put it in the air  and wait to receive it
'Cause I'm worth it
I deserve it
And an extra zero for me
Hey
'Cause I'm worth it
Watch me work it
Hey
Ooh
Is it just me?
Or do you think about me like I think about you?
Is it just me?
Or does the world stop spinnin' when you step into the room?
'Cause I don't need no money when I'm walkin' with a diamond
Lookin' like a million bucks and you ain't even tryin'
That's how it be with you and me
It's like all love everything
I wanna wake up in the morning with a wedding ring
Doing anything with you is my favorite thing
Ooh
Yeah
Ooh
All love everything

I wanna wake up in the morning with a wedding ring
Doing anything with you is my favorite thing
Ooh
Yeah

All love everything
Long as you're with me
I ain't worried 'bout time

This kind of feeling's hard to find

Doing anything with you is my favorite thing
Ooh
Yeah

That this one's a challenge you won't overcome
I know your dreams are bold
Keep going  you'll find that you're not on your own
So don't give up
And don't give in
You've gotta keep on and see it through
No matter how hard that is to do
You've gotta believe to find the firе that's inside you  ooh
You've gotta beliеve
So here we are
With billions of prayers out there floating like stars (Mm-mm  mm)
I know it seems hard
Just hold onto hope 'cause you've made it this far
Soon  you'll be out of the dark
And don't give in (Never give in)

 yeah

 hey
 but the kid is not my son
 no
Underneath that waterfall  nobody else ever saw
I packed up everything except those memories
That only I can see  and can't get rid of
I still remember the first  your body hit every nerve
Used to wake up in my shirt  that's the one I had to burn
Trying not to stare  but you are everywhere
You're everywhere that I've ever known
You feel like Brooklyn in the summer
Been hiding  half awake for so long
And it's the subtleties only you've ever seen
Bringing the mess of me back together
You feel like Brooklyn in the summer
Been stumbling  half awake for so long
Gotta forget that feeling  give into something real
I've got  I've gotta let you go
Gotta let you go
This morning I walked to the train  just like you did every day
Everyone else is the same  I wonder if you're the same
And do you lay your head in someone else's bed
To help you bury it? Just like you always did
And now you're in all of my words  only way I can return
Memories fade in reverse  but you will always be heard
Wherever I can sing  you'll be right there with me
In ghosts and melodies that only I can see

Gotta forget that feeling  give into something real
I've got  I've gotta let you go
But maybe I'm not really ready to give up you
'Cause nobody ever mattered to me like you do
'Cause you're so appealing  I caught that feeling
And touch the ceiling  ooh
I wish I could describe it but words just ain't enough
And nothing that I could say would ever measure up
But what I can't stand is you're outta my hands
And I'm outta your plans  ooh
You feel like Brooklyn in the summer
Been hiding  half awake for so long
And it's the subtleties only you've ever seen
Bringing the mess of me back together
You feel like Brooklyn in the summer
Been stumbling  half awake for so long
Gotta forget that feeling  give into something real
Shoot the sun until the sky is black
Now I shall hope that the sun got rhythm
Cause he gon’ dance when that music hit him
In the nighttime I’m camouflage
But girl I wanna know if you can move like this
But I wanna know what your name is
And you gonna make me fall in love with you  with you
Keep on shakin’ your hips
Now can you do this? (Yea  I can do that)
Can you do this? (Yea  I can do that)
Can you do this? (Yea  I can do that)
Can you do this? (Yea  I can do that)
I know you think that you can move
But can you groove the way I groove?
Grab your slingshot  find a stone
Shoot the moon until the night is gone
Now I should hope that moon got rhythm
Cause he gon’ rock when my stone hit him
He should know that the day is mine

Now why you standing on the wall
Did you come to dance at all?
I’m watching you girl  watching me
You got moves  then let me see
Can you do this? (Can you do this lady?)
Can you do this? (Can you move like I do?)
Can you do this? (Can you shake  shake it mama?)
Can you do this? (Can you break it on down?)
Cause dreams are meant to come true so dream as big as you wanna be
Remember that love is sacred and happiness is the key
And if you wanna change the world then be the change that you wanna see
Make a friend of someone  someone you don’t already know
Plant a flower in the ground and watch it grow
Just take it easy  take it slow
Don’t rush through life  just let it flow
Let your imagination run wild
See the world through the eyes of a child
Live again
Live again
I tell you what I know  I know the world is round
And when a tree falls in the forest  I know it has to make a sound
Now why I can’t I believe in God and still believe there’s other life?
Because I bet one day we’ll all look up in the sky and see their light
Now I don’t think the world is gonna explode but it’s comin’ to an end
It’s the day we’ve all been waiting for when we get to start over again
Until then…
Did you take it easy? Did you take it slow?
Did you rush through life or just let it flow?
Did you let your imagination run wild?
And did you see the world through the eyes of a child?

 I was the wildest one of three
 Don't back down when you know that you're right
 Always use your heart to rise above
 I know it's a long road but all I need
 I know it's a long road but all I need
 don't let go of me
 I know it's a long road but all I need
This is sweatin' through my shirt before the sun's up
Thought that I was shook  thought that I would stop
And now  I got 'em waitin' for the other shoe to drop
I'm just gettin' started
I been makin' moves before the dawn
Cuttin' through the darkness
Pray nobody say it don't be long
I'll be the first shot heard  then you run for cover
Take my word  ain't no other
Now  I'm just gettin' started
I'ma drink from a winner cup  mixin' hard work with beginner's luck
I'ma turn the tables  from the cradle to the grave
Heavyweight leg day  steady pray
Heavy head  wear his crown way down every day
Breakin' out the crazy house  or whatever them people was sayin' 'bout me

Hey girlfriend  understand

And ever since you've been gone

It's been a lot of good things going my way
Now what can I say
The clouds done rolled away

'Cause you had me all confused and twisted up inside

I got green lights all the way
With no big red sign to stop me
No traffic jam delay
See I was driving over the moon
In my big hot air balloon
Floating high into the darkness
I hope I get there soon
It's so many things to do
So many people I need to talk to
And they've all been waiting for me
Well I gotta make it through
Thank my stars for every green
You have no idea what it means
To a man who's always traveling
Who's seen the things that I've seen
I don't know what's yet to come
Not sure if anything that I've done
Really makes that much a difference
Well I hope it has for some

Little park bench under the shade
Of a sweet gum tree whose leaves were red and brown
I looked up and I saw her face
That was full of fortitude and grace
See I've been working since the morning
When the sun starts settling in
That's when I walk across the town to where my second job begins
The counselors keep on telling me my boy's got special needs
But don't we all got issues?
It's just the stuff we live through
Everybody's got their coffee stains
That I ain't been to Harvard
And I ain't got no big degrees
But only real love comes for free
And some days my head's up in the clouds
But I'm allowed to dream

As she got up and walked away
And watched that lady fade into the crowd
We both cry and we feel shame
And we both know there still some things
We've yet to figure out
See I've been writing since the morning
When the sun starts settling in
I cross the town to check the sound
Where my second job begins
I pray that I provide a life for everything they need
But don't we all got issues?
It's just the stuff we live through
Everybody's got their coffee stains
That I ain't been to Harvard
And I ain't got no big degrees
But only real love comes for free
And some days my head's up in the clouds
But I'm allowed to dream
Her shift is probably ending now
And I'll be on a plane this time tomorrow
Some folks are on an uphill climb
Some coast along on borrowed time
Still others need a little time to borrow
But don't we all got issues?
It's just the stuff we live through
Everybody's got their coffee stains
That I ain't been to Harvard
And I ain't got no big degrees
But only real love comes for free
And some days my head's up in the clouds
But I'm allowed to dream
But I'm allowed to dream
I ain't been to Harvard
I've been waiting for this moment to come my whole life
Hello world  the past is over
It's time for us to come together and make the future right
I had an epiphany one night
Looking at the endless star-filled sky
The world is ours
The world is ours
Seven billion stars
We're all we are  We're all we are)
The world is ours
Hello world  the sun is rising
It doesn't matter who you are  the sun still sets the same
Hello world  undivided
Don't matter if you win or lose  it's how you play the game
The world is ours
The world is ours
Seven billion stars
We're all we are  We're all we are)

Seven billion stars

And I’m lookin’ for a place where it feels alright to be wrong
Chip off the old block with a chip on my shoulder that weighs a ton
All I know for sure is that nothin’ is forever
And all that matters is how we get along together
Life gets harder every day that I get older
Hope I figure out why I’m here before it’s over
'Cause we’re here today and gone tomorrow
We’re here today and gone tomorrow
I been stuck at home alone on nights when no one calls
And I’ve had nights where I can take my pick or have them all
And I had those days where I search my pockets for a nickel and a dime
And I’ve had those days where tryna make money was a waste of my time
I’ve had shiny brand new leather patent loafers
And I’ve had torn up bruised old teddies handed over
All I know for sure is that nothin’ is forever
And all that matters is how we get along together

And rode day-whole drive retails to thrift store re-sales
I’ve had chauffeured town cars to an old broken down car
It ain’t what happens to you it’s what you do about it
'Cause we’re here today and gone tomorrow
We’re here today and gone tomorrow
Here today (hey)

 song  would you sing with me?

 go  would you leave with me?
 would you laugh with me?
 would you change for me?
That they don't really mean
They just might call you names
To lift their self esteem
That it'll never work
Because inside they're trying to hide
How much they really hurt
But as long as you know who you are
And what you're about
Nothing they say can shake your pride
And make you doubt
The beauty you have in you
And when they give attitude
You can tell them like this
And I think it's about time to tell you this
I'm gonna be the best me
That I know how to be
One day you learn how much it means
To believe in yourself
So take these words and share these words
To help somebody else
You never know. Anything's possible
You just might make a friend
So when they try to make you cry
Tell them again and again
Say it like this-

I'm beautiful and spiritual
And I think it's about time to tell you this

To tell you this. I'm gonna be the best me
That I know how to be
And I think it's about time to tell you this
I'm gonna be the best me
I told you before
A king is born
I told you before
A king is born
Like a beast in the jungle
In the heat of the rumble
I ain’t got nothing to lose
I’ve been fighting these hard times
In the ghettos of my mind
Now it’s victory that I choose
Ain’t no one like me
I’m a legend
Ain’t no one like me
'Cause I been down so long
Ain’t no one like me

Made it through the dark  now it's time to let your light shine
When the stakes are high and you know you've got so much to lose
Then it all becomes very clear
You were born to be here

Dont it make you wanna scream
When you find out that your dream
Ain't really what it seems
Is the money
Some say that it's the root of all evil 
Brings wars and other cells of upheaval
Leaves family in the streets with nothing to eat 
Little baby boys and girls
No shoes on their feet 
All the men who leave home dying in the war zones
And the women do it all they own
It reminds me of the ghettos right here
And the hoods that I see
Everywhere that I've been in the is country
Stop bailing out the banks and give the Franklins to me
Can you feel me?
Ooooh

And the list goes on and on and on and on....
And toast a cheer

Cause I feel my life has just begun
So many many things I wanna do before I'm done
I don't wanna die young
And I don't wanna die alone
I wanna be around my family and my home
I want someone to miss me dearly when I'm gone
I don't wanna die alone
I don't wanna die poor
But all I need is just some shelter and a floor
Seeing places that I've never been before
I don't wanna die poor
I don't wanna die ashamed
I apologise for all that I'm to blame
I don't wanna die ashamed

Ever since
It's been a long time coming
It's been too hard living
But I'm afraid to die

Beyond the sky
It's been a long time coming

Somebody keep telling me don't hang around

Love is the answer to the questions in your mind

It's the only thing that makes us truly free
Friends nowhere to be found
To help you when you are down
But you know that you're the one to blame

When I would go out to play
And I would wonder so far from home
That I would lose my way
Then I’d call on my mama to help me
And she’d come right away
To help me get back home where I wanna be
And here’s what I’d say
Momma hold my hand
I don’t think I can cross this road by myself
Mama hold my hand
I don’t think I can cross this road by myself
And when I was a young man
I would go astray
Didn’t want nobody to hold my hand
Wanted to make my own way
And my mama would come out to help me
But I’d push her away
Cause I just wanted to be on my own
And here’s what I’d say
You might also like
Mama leave my hand
I’ve been waiting to cross this road by myself
Cross this road by myself
Well now that I’m a grown man
I done moved away
Got a kid on the way
Mama told me that life’s gonna get rough
Take it day by day
But every once in a while I get scared
And I wish I could say
Momma hold my hand
I don’t think I can cross this road by myself
Mama hold my hand
I don’t think I can cross this road by myself
Now my mama is near the end of her years
And her hair is grey
Sometimes I call her to ask her
If she would like to spend the day
Mama used to be strong but she ain’t now
And she can’t make her way
That’s why I’m always around when she needs help
And here’s what I say
Mama hold my hand
I don’t think you can cross this road by yourself
Mama hold my hand
Her daddy was a very rich man
If you wanna take my little girl's hand
See money that I have might be good for some
And down right danger to another
And little Miss Fortune is sure to become
Unfortunately just like her mother
Between riding in a bus or driving a new Rolls Royce yeah
Now Miss Fortune is a spoiled little debutante
And it's my fault so I suggest you take my heed
So you met my little girl Miss Fortune
And you know that I'm a very rich man
I told you to precede with caution
If you wanna take my little girl's hand
You might also like
Well I thanked Miss Fortune's father
Said I understand
But you're trying to talk me down
Yes you are
Listen here
You ain't have to bother
Cause I'm a real strong man
I'm sure I can turn your daughter around
See what she needs is someone who can take control
Let the girl know her place and how to play her role
Tell her all the money in the world cannot replace her soul
Hell she needs is stop acting like twelve years old
Well she put the ring on her finger
Everything started to change
And I looked at myself in the mirror
You know I was looking strange
She had me out every day spending money
On all kinds of ridiculous things
See I forget what life was all about
Little Miss Fortune was to blame
So I married this girl Miss Fortune
Whose daddy was a very rich man
And even though he told me take caution
I still took his little girl's hand
See money don't do everybody the same
And it's down right danger to a brother
And little Miss Fortune surely became
You gotta watch out for Miss Fortune
Brothers you must proceed with caution
And might as well give good grace a try
All I wanted was a little dance with lady luck
But she won't give me a chance
What I could use is some good old grace
But she refuses to show her face
I've been down and out and lonely  hey
I've been suffering at a job in a world that tries to own me
But when I wake up every morning there's an image of a better place  hey
'Cause the harder that we grind
Then the sweeter is the glory
People say I'm foolish
People say I'm blinded by faith
But if I run out of air
If I crash I don't care
I'm gonna do it my way
I can make it through this
You can throw the world in my face
But the fear gives me life
And I swear 'til I die
I'm gonna do it my way
Gonna do it my way
Gonna do it my way
You might also like
So put me down and criticize me with your lies and with your parody  hey
In the darkness I don't hide 'cause I got pride that gives me clarity

People say I'm foolish
People say I'm blinded by faith
But if I run out of air
If I crash I don't care
I'm gonna do it my way
I can make it through this
You can throw the world in my face
But the fear gives me life
And I swear 'til I die
I'm gonna do it my way
Gonna do it my way
Gonna do it my way
Every time they build a wall around me
I will tear it down and say
I'ma live my dreams
Gotta live my dreams (Ayy-ayy)
Even when the floods rush 'round to drown me
I just hold my breath and pray
Let me live my dreams
Every single one of my
I ain't quitting none of my dreams
People say I'm foolish
People say I'm blinded by faith
But if I run out of air
If I crash I don't care
I'm gonna do it my way
I can make it through this
You can throw the world in my face
But the fear gives me life
And I swear 'til I die
I’m gonna do it my way
Let me fly through the air
If I crash I don't care
I'm gonna do it my way
'Cause the fear gives me life
And I swear  'til I die
'Cause you don't like your teeth
Hide your body under your clothes
So no one can see
Just give me your finesse with the flaws in it
You put on a good show
That's not what I need
What does it for me?
The way you look when we're at home
What does it for me?
The words you say when we're alone
And when you take your bow
I'll be waiting in the wings
When you've given them everything

If you was going to stick around  to let it go
But you never left my side  so now I know

Some pictures of days gone by to remind
Of the joy in your smile
If you're ever around  would you please give me a sign
And I'll look after your things like they were mine
All of the things you left behind
Picking up the pieces of an impossible puzzle
Sealed all the secrets  the signs were so subtle
Maybe you were too shy or your pride was too high
Or you'd lie and deny to try and hide all your trouble
Now only questions remain with no easy answers
 the pain  the harm you hear after
The pressure and the strain every day you had to have sustained maybe made you feel in a way there were no second chances
I wish you would have opened up
Opened up just enough
Just enough to see how much
How much you were truly loved
I wish you would have opened up

Just enough to see how much you were truly loved

All of the things you left behind
I still hear an echo of your voice in your laughter
And I do still remember the moments you captured
Flame you spark lit up the dark and burned brighter and faster
The story ain't over  we've just closed the chapter
Now forever after the whole world is inspired
A billion little candles with light from your fire
Shining like the stars where you're up
I hope that you can see now how much you were loved
These are the things you left behind
An old record player  half a bottle of wine
Some pictures of days gone by to remind

The question ain’t if but when
The sea will boil and the sky will fall
The sun may never rise again
The silent war has begun
We’re staring down a loaded gun
No refuge found on solid ground
This human race can’t be won

Don’t wait to say goodbye
You’re running out of time
Whatever you believe
It’s easy to see
The whole world’s sitting on a ticking bomb
The whole world’s sitting on a ticking bomb
So keep your calm and carry on
The whole world’s sitting on a ticking bomb
And it’s about to explode
And it’s about to explode
(The whole world)
The whole world’s sitting on a ticking bomb
The whole world’s sitting on a ticking bomb
And it don’t care what side you’re on
The whole world’s sitting on a ticking bomb
So keep your calm and carry on
They say the mountain is so hard to climb
And the valley steep to go
Together is better than one
La la la-la laaaaa
Hand in hand we will get to the top
Hand in hand we will run down the valley
Hand in hand we shall overcome
Together is better than one
 2x
Every man needs a hand to hold
No matter how strong he may be
Lean on me and I'll lean on you
Together is better than one
 + 
 2x
Guided by a beating heart
I can't tell where the journey will end
But I know where to start
They tell me I'm too young to understand
They say I'm caught up in a dream
Well life will pass me by if I don't open up my eyes
Well that's fine by me
So wake me up when it's all over
When I'm wiser and I'm older
All this time I was finding myself
And I didn't know﻿ I was lost
So wake me up when it's all over
When I'm wiser and I'm older
All this time I was finding myself
And I didn't know﻿ I was lost
I tried carrying the weight of the world
But I only have two hands
I hope I get the chance to travel the world
But I don't have any plans
I wish that I could stay forever this young
Not afraid to close my eyes
Life's a game﻿ made for everyone
And love is a prize
So wake me up when it's all over
When I'm wiser and I'm older
All this time I was finding myself
And I didn't know﻿ I was lost
So wake me up when it's all over
When I'm wiser and I'm older
All this time I was finding myself
And I didn't know﻿ I was lost
I didn't know I was lost
I didn't know I was lost
I didn't know I was lost
I didn't know I was lost
So wake me up when it's all over
When I'm wiser and I'm older
All this time I was finding myself
When I wake up in the morning  I ask myself
Is there somewhere else I’d rather be?
And the answer to the question I asked myself
It doesn’t matter long as you’re with me
Cause I wanna be with you  you know that it’s true
I wanna be with you and not by myself
I wanna be with you  don’t wanna be with nobody else
Now when I’m looking up at the stars I often wonder why
You’re sittin’ here with me and not up in the sky
But I ain’t gonna complain got myself a good thing
You’re an angel but I ain’t givin’ back your wings
That’s cause I
I wanna be with you  I like your style
I wanna be with you and not by myself
I wanna be with you  don’t wanna be with nobody else
You might also like
There ain’t no doubt about it I’m addicted to your drug
No I can't go without it  I’m a fiend for your sweet love
I wanna be with you and not by myself
I wanna be with you  don’t wanna be with nobody else
When I’m driving in my car I don’t wanna get too far
Cause I always wanna be right next to you
So I put your pretty picture on my steering wheel
Now when I’m rollin’ I’m enjoyin’ the view
I wanna be with you to the very last day
I wanna be with you when I’m old and grey
I wanna be with you until the pigs learn to fly
I wanna be with you til the politicians learn to stop tellin’ lies
I wanna be with you until hell freezes over
I wanna be with you until tiger blood gets sober
I wanna be with you and not by myself
I wanna be with you and nobody else
I'll be there  I'll be there  I'll be there for you

You make me smile
You make me smile
I think its safe to say
Things just haven’t been going my way
And I still got bills to pay
But all in all you been right here with me
When I’m sinking low you come through and lift me
It’s nothing more than the love that you give me
Keeps me from drowning in tears
You make me smile (You Come through and save the day)
You make me smile (You make me smile!)
You make me smile (In a very special way)
Everywhere I go people seem to ask me
In these trying times when a frown is the fashion
See the answer to the query is very simple
I’m always grinning from dimple to dimple
Because you love me unconditionally

You make me smile (Feel like I've been walking the sky)
You make me smile (When I can't see the light here you come shining bright)
You make me smile (When everything's bad and I'm feelin' real sad)
You make me smile (When I don't have the answers you always give me a chance to smile...)
You make me smile...
Smile!"
