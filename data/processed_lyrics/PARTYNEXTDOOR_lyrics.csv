She call me like she can't wait  she want it now now now
I give it to her that way  right now now now
We pop and roll to the strip  grind on that dick
I brought her back to the crib  skipped the foreplay
She's laying down edge to edge
Right on my bed  blonde bitch with her blue eyes
Like butter the way she spread
Oh man  I love my lil' chicka
She want the anaconda right? (yah)

Thumbin' through them bands busting checks more
Found herself now she demanding respect more
