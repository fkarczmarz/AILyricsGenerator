lyrics
"I don't know yet
Was it just by chance? Could this be Kismet?
Something in my consciousness told me you'd appear
Now I'm always touched by your presence dear
When we play at cards you use an extra sense (it's really not cheating)
When you sent your messages whispered loud and clear
I am always touched by your presence dear
Floating past the evidence of possibilities
Coming into contact with outer entities
We could entertain each one with our theosophies
Stay awake at night and count your R.E.M.'s when you're talking with your super friends
Levitating lovers in the secret stratosphere
I am still in touch with your presence dear
I am still in touch with your presence dear
Sidewalk social scientist don't get no satisfaction from your cigarette
It's ten to ten and time is running out
Today can last another million years
Today could be the end of me
Pumping like a fugitive in cover from the night
Take it down the freeway like a bullet to the ocean
Today can last another million years
Today could be the end of me
Hanging on a frequency and burning like a fire

Today can last another million years
Today could be the end of me
I had to make good time to see you but you had to pay the fine
All the boys on my side knew that you were the shark
If you were found on the borderline you'd be shot in the dark
The love you brought shaking up my bones and crawling through our veins
We always met at the edge of a blade and we left at the end of the fight
No I don't believe in circumstance no more
Accidents never happen in a perfect world
So I won't believe in luck
I saw you walking in the dark
So I slipped behind your footsteps for a while
Caught you turning round the block
Precognition in my ears
Accidents never happen in a perfect world
Complications disappear
Now you love me
Like the Magi on the hill
I can divinate your presence from afar
And I'll follow you until
I can bring you to a perfect world

November pushed us to the floor
When our last rain fades
We can still radiate
Remember all the time it took
Remember how you gave me that look
And it's not too late
And it's not too late
Are you getting dizzy?
Cause there's something in the water
Feels like we could be dancing

A stylising interlude
But we'll be okay
In the frozen rain
The richer ups in town will see
The bed is there for you and me

Feels like we could be dancing
Hey yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah

Are you getting dizzy?
Cause there's something in the water
Feels like we could be dancing

The door is open and the lights are cold
The children come in here and they dare the ghost
Like a fire burning in a stone
Ah
Silent light in the theatre's sky
Phantom cigarette and a silent cry
The door swings open and it's cold outside
They can still see him singing on the corner singing songs
Memory in a silent seat
Melody on a long retreat
Like an angel on a balcony
Like an angel on a balcony
Tonight  make it right
Uh-huh  make me tonight

Urban grey takes breath away  he wants to push his pedal to the ground
And the night's what's right  puts him at the wheel
Feel hot to go like Jimmy O  dodging flying objects at the show
And the lights make me fight
This town's a concrete factory and Dad and Mum look just like me
I'm on the plant assembly line. Too late now. Too far behind
You said you want to hang around  no-one really cares where you go
Take your time. Things never change
Die young  stay pretty
Deteriorate in your own time
(Deteriorate in your own time)
Tell them you're dead and wither away
Are you living alone  or with your family?
A dried-up twig on your family tree?
Are you waiting for the reaper to arrive?
Or  just to die by the hand of love?
Love for youth  love for youth
So  die young and stay pretty
Leave only the best behind
Slipping sensibilities
Tragedy in your own dream  oh

Dearly near senility

Clear as a pane of glass
As clear as a big blue sky
Through and through it all
You're trying to stall
It's clear as a crystal ball
As the facets are bold in platinum and gold
Clear as a flawless diamond
I'm hitting the wall
I know I'm gonna fall for you
Is it my fate or fatal attraction?
Could it be a fait accompli?
Dark as a winter's moonless night
Dark as a velvet cape
It's dark as the other side
I can recommend but I can't defend
It's dark as a deep sea trench
Dark as an angry inch

And it's the closest I can be to egocentricity
This overwhelming sense of rejection will sneak up behind and tear at me
And it'll slam me to the ground into reality
And I'll deal with my disparity

Mercurys and Subaru
And you don't stop  you keep on eatin' cars
Then  when there's no more cars you go out at night
And eat up bars where the people meet
Face to face  dance cheek to cheek
One to one  man to man
Dance toe to toe  don't move too slow
'Cause the man from Mars is through with cars
He's eatin' bars  yeah wall to wall
Door to door  hall to hall
He's gonna eat 'em all
Rap-ture  be pure
Take a tour through the sewer
Don't strain your brain  paint a train
You'll be singin' in the rain
Said don't stop to punk rock

Man to man  body muscular
Seismic decibel  bite the jugular
Wall to wall  tea time technology
And a digital ladder
No sign of bad luck in rapture
Well now you see what you wanna be
Just have your party on TV
'Cause the man from Mars
Won't eat up bars where the TV's on
Now he's gone back up to space
Where he won't have a hassle with the human race
And you hip-hop  and you don't stop
Just blast off  sure shot
'Cause the man from Mars stopped eatin' cars
Oh  you know her
Would you look at that hair?
Yeah  you know her
Check out those shoes
She looks like she stepped out of the middle of somebody's blues
She looks like the Sunday comics
She thinks she's Brenda Starr
Her nose job is real atomic
All she needs is an old knife scar
Ew  she's so dull  come on
Rip her to shreds
She's so dull  come on
Rip her to shreds
Oh  you know her  Miss Groupie Supreme
Yeah  you know her  Vera Vogue on parade
Red eye shadow  green mascara
Bleh  she's too much
She looks like she don't know better
A case of partial extreme
Dressed in a Robert Hall sweater
Acting like a soap opera queen

Always looking to create a scene

She's so dull
Yeah  she got the nerve to tell me
Huh  she's so dull
Hey  there she goes now
She making out with King Kong
She take her boat to Hong Kong
Well
Bye bye  sugar
She wasn't history — she's just a number
And she goes far away
Green trees call to me
Scenery is still outside of me
Shayla turned to run away
To leave in peace and end her stay
Years of fear were in her way
Some cosmic energy brushed her like shadows

The boy in the back on his second attack
Wants his baby back (wants his baby back)
What's all that commotion that you hear?
The girl in the back who was doing the quake
Catch me if you can is what she said with her hands
Come on and take me back (can you take her back?)
When she gives you the beat and you get the shine
The world slows down and she stops on a dime
Got a number when you close your eyes
Like a real magician
Still she knows she'll never lose a thing
She can put you up on a shelf until she wants to pull the string
Still you know she'll never slip away
I can keep today but tomorrow's fine
Stop and look at the pictures rolling in your head
You can leave her today but tomorrow's fine
Stop and live in your dreams at night
Rolling in your bed

Cold as ice cream but still as sweet
Looks like he's in another world
I stay away all week and still I wait
What your loving means to me
She can't catch up with the working crowd
The weekend mood and she's feeling proud
If I go with you my folks'll get uptight
Ooh

When I saw you again in the summertime
If your love was as sweet as mine
I could be Sunday's girl

Inside the armored car ride two big armed guards
Twenty five tons of hardened steel rolls on no ordinary wheel
The hardest part of the armored guard
Big man of steel behind the steering wheel
Nitro and acetylene open la machine
The hardest part of the armored guard
Big man of steel behind the steering wheel
In a wire mesh cage with a twelve gauge. Radio - we're coming fast
Of the armored guard here's what I heard
I'll tell you that he will no matter what you feel

I always knew that someday you'd go far
Will I see you again?
You said you'd be through here again
Please don't forget I'm here waiting
You always said that you would never change
Like the people that you've met and the places that you've been

You looked so big and fine
I really wanted to go out with you
So when you smiled
I laid my heart on the line
You read me my rights
And then you said
Let's go and nothing more
I thought of my nights
And how they were
They were filled with
I know you wouldn't go
You'd watch my heart burst
Then you'd step in
I had to know so I asked
You just had to laugh
We sat in the night
With my hands cuffed at my side
I look at your life and your style
I wanted nothing more

Perpetrate love with you
I'll be sex offensive to you
