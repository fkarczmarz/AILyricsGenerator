lyrics
"You stay a little while then you do a little walk on home
I hear you downstairs smoking cigarettes
I hear you talking -
'Cause you ain't got nothing to talk about at all
So you took me to the party and got me to notice
That you wanna feel good and you feel like you're gonna explode
I don't give a - about your intentions at all
Pass me whatever there's drink left in
Well I don't care if it's seven in the morning
For all I care it could bе the second coming
Well you say you can't takе it anymore
And I don't give a - about your intentions at all
We're alright
We're always alright
We're alright
We're always alright
We're alright
We're alright
We're always alright
We're alright
You stay a little while then you do a little walk on home
I hear you downstairs smoking cigarettes
I hear you talking shit
'Cause you ain't got nothing to talk about at all
So you took me to the party and got me to notice
That you wanna feel good and you feel like you're gonna explode
And I don't give a damn about your intentions at all
Pass me whatever there's drink left in
Well I don't care if it's seven in the morning
For all I care it could be the second coming
Well you say you can't take it anymore
And I don't give a fuck about your intentions at all
We're alright
We're always alright
We're alright
We're always alright
We're alright
'Cause all the world is in the dark
Oh yeah!
And all them ladies can't change your mind
And all them girls won't turn your head
And all them lions in the jungle at night
I don't worry 'bout my baby
'Cause I know why I don't worry
I sing me no sad songs
I know...
All them girls might wanna rip us apart
They got another thing comin'
Or I'll be a dead woman
I'd do it for you

'Cause all them girls don't know you like I do

That's why I call you my baby
Oooh
So be mine
So be mine
So be mine
So be mine
So be mine
So be mine
Be my... ooh ooh ooh
They say a friend ain't to be
Between a girl and a boy
I don't know who said it
Or why it got to be so wrong
Oh why don't you call?
Don't you care anymore?
It's not fair
Don't let 'em get you
It took us both and now I got to fix you
Why
Is an awful lot of question
And I can't give me no answer
I keep wondering on
No kind of bother I'm just trying
To save what was left between you and me
And where we left it before they took it
And took it all
And took off
Oh why did I let them drive a wedge between?
And now I'm crying when I sleep

Put in your hands the fruit of all my grief
Lying down ain't easy
When everyone needs pleasing  and I can't get no relief

We were born together
Suckled on the honey of the Tennessee
Where we would sleep in the soft sunshine
I smile at you and you to me
Shine in your eyes

That's the growing up
We've come to love
On this planet not so far away
We wouldn't stay together
Rolling in a dream
Like honeysuckle tangled up in kudzu vine

And when people tell us we need to straighten out
I'm gonna walk right across this town
Yelling your name and I'll wait for you to come on down
Have you had yourself a good time for a while lately now
I just can't understand what you're so worried about
You're goin' to the party by the end of tonight
There's gonna be dancing and there's gonna be a fight
Guess who's gonna be there for you
When you're too drunk to know what the heck ya doin'?
I'm right here to carry you on home
And it won't be long
Gotta take me home now
I know you ain't drinking water
You gotta take me back
You're goin' to the party by the end of tonight
Those things they say can't get to me  but they do
I don't see the sky as blue  as you do
Should I fantasize? There must be some way to love all things
It's been so hard for a girl like me  it's true
People say I look just like my daddy  'cause I do
All I really want is peace of mind
Why is everything so complicated?
Why is everyone so infatuated?
I gather myself safely in
Until life on Earth looks warm again
Feeling all these feelings all the time
Don't you ever worry 'bout a thing
Put them worries on the shelf
Learn to love yourself
Don't be your own worst enemy
Hang loose  hang loose
Let the ocean worry 'bout being blue
Hang loose  hang loose
Go with the tide and I'ma take care of you
Well come with me  sweet darlin'
I got a seat ticket for the plane
We gonna fly to Waikiki  it'll just be you and me
And we'll let the sun melt our cares away
Hang loose  hang loosе

Because I do not know your name
I don't know nothin' about none of you

But there's still one thing left that I would like to know from you
I hope you really loved me
I hoped you like them too
I was supposed to come out here an' say somethin' smart
But I didn't know what to say to you

An' it could be the best night God ever gave me
But I like to say oo-oo-oo

Then they took you higher and

It wasn't me  why wasn't it was me?
Strong
So i climbed to the mountain
And I don't know what I did wrong
Did you think of me?
On your way to Heaven
Did you say I'll see you again?
On your way to the promised land
Then they took you higher

That I was the rain
Free to fall any time
Free to fall any place
Or a penny in the pocket
In a pair of tattered jeans
Meant it back in nineteen-sixty-three
But that penny undoubtedly
Has seen much more scenery
I caught myself starin'
At cars in passing lanes
Waitin' for a glimpse
Of their lives at play
I caught myself wishin' I was graffiti on a train
Their role in the play stays the same
Before that old twisted being
Woo!
I caught myself wishing I was a suitcase on a plane
Intercepted by a flight attendant who came to see it had no name
Possessions did no longing to return me home again

All I believe in is a dream
I haunt the Earth  though I am fully seen
In all my years  I've never felt more sure than now
Well  I got to get off this rock  somehow
I feel so homesick
Where's my home
Where I belong  or where I was born?
Now I was told to go where the wind would blow
But it blows away
Away
Well  my eyes are full of stars
But I just see oh  how high they are
I gotta believe what I'm see
Ooo  when it could come true  ooo
But in a modern world  that can be so hard to do
I feel so homеsick
Where's my home
Whеre I belong  or where I was born?
Now  I was told to go where the wind would blow
But it blows away
Away

That's when the fun really begins
My brain cools off when that day is done
And then I'll tuck myself in
The hours of night are too lonely
And I begin to realize that
Why can't I?
Let's go make memories
Precious and temporary
Of all the people I meet
I wanna take you all with me
The hours of night are too lonely
And I begin to realize that

Try'na play nice
And fight my way here
See  I've been having me a real hard time
But it feels so nice to know I'm gonna be alright
It wa'n't very hard
I spent all this time
Try'na figure out why
Nobody on my side
See  I've been having me a real good time
But it feels so nice to know I'm gonna be alright
So please don't take my feeling
I have found at last
So please don't take my feeling
I have found at last
That if I wanted to
I'd be alright
