lyrics
"You suffer in a thimble
And there's nothing coming next
Your mom smokes in the kitchen
Her voice a cutting drone
Your father's second home
That leaves you on your own
Nights I'd often watch you
Float across the grounds
Out the gate to the motorway
What secrets have you found?
You had to know I wanted
Something from you then
Too young to know just what it was
Something more than a friend
Is that you at the end?
Where you play in the street at night
You're blown like a broken kite
Are you gonna let these Americans
Put another dent in your life?
You might also likeMy mother says you're dirty
They're gonna find you dead
But have you got that final chapter
Written in your head?
Cause every single story
Is a story about love
Both the overflowing cup
And the painful lack thereof
You got the heart of a dove
But you play in the street at night (The street at night)
You're blown just like a broken kite (A broken kite)
You'll have to lose all them childish notions
If you're gonna let these American boys
Put another dent in your life
You play in the street at night (The street at night)
You're blown just like a broken kite (A broken kite)
You'll have to lose all them childish notions
Are you gonna let these Americans
Some uber-man I'd make
I'm barely a vapor
They shone a chlorine light on
A host of individual sins
Let's carve my aging face off
Fetch us a knife
Start with my eyes
Down so the lines
Form a grimacing smile
Close your eyes to corral a virtue
Is this fooling anyone else?
Never worked so long and hard
To cement a failure
We can blow on our thumbs and posture
But the lonely are such delicate things
The wind from a wasp could blow them
Into the sea
With stones on their feet
Lost to the light and the loving we need
Still to come
The worst part and you know it
There is a numbness
In your heart and it's growing
You might also likeWith burnt sage and a forest of bygones
I click my heels
Get the devils in line
A list of things I could lay the blame on
Might give me a way out
But with each turn
It's this front and center
Like a dart stuck square in your eye
Every post you can hitch your faith on
Is a pie in the sky
Chock full of lies
A tool we devise
To make sinking stones fly
And still to come
The worst part and you know it
There is a numbness
No!
La-la-la-la!
La-la-la-la!
La-la-la-la!
(Born to) Born to multiply
Born to gaze into night skies
All you want's one more Saturday
They gonna buy your life's time
So keep your wick in the air and your feet in the fetters
Till the day
We come in doing cartwheels
We all crawl out by ourselves
And your shape on a dance floor
Will have me thinking such filth to gouge my eyes
You'll be damned to be one of us girl
Faced with the dodo's conundrum
I felt like I could just fly
You might also like
A duotone on the wall
Selfless fool who hoped he'd save us all
Never dreamt of such sterile hands
You keep 'em folded in your lap
Or raise them up to beg for scraps
You know he's holding you down with the tips of his fingers
Just the same
Will you be pulled from the ocean
A-just a minute too late?
Or changed by a potion
To find a handsome young mate for you to love?
You'll be damned to pining through the windowpanes
You know you'd trade your life for any ordinary Joe
Your nightmares only need a year or two to unfold
Been alone since you were twenty-one
You haven't laughed since January
You try and make like this is so much fun
But we know it to be quite contrary
La-la-la-la
Facing the android's conundrum
I felt like I should just cry
But nothing happens every time I take one on the chin
Watching the lantern dim
Starved of oxygen
So give me your hand and let's jump out the window
And how she got in  I'm not sure that I know
But two weeks on and my spine was in traction  my eyes in a basket
My gut and my heart are so out of phase
And that kind of girl  she ain't nobody's daughter
I'm just not used to these powerful waves
She's shining the brass and I’m taking on water
What am I to do now?
I call on a beautiful witch with a moral compass
Bait and switch
Hide from my psychic derailleur
Drive this car to the sea
Spend the night as high as I can in a towering hemlock
But it's no use  it can always be found
A creature of habit has no real protection
I tell her I'll leave if she don't settle down
She sees it's a lie on closer inspection
Like everyone else does
Been rubbing a terrible charm
Holding smoke in my arm
I'm just a simple man
Cursed with an honest heart
Why she go and tear it all apart?
You might also likeBeen rubbing a terrible charm
Holding smoke in my arm
I’m just a simple man
Cursed with an honest heart
But looking on the brighter side
There's far less to which I'd be obliged
In the meadow where the black breeze blows
Where underneath the waves  you were most alone
Can you hear a subtle  aching tone?
Looking on the brighter side
Looking on the brighter side
Looking on the brighter side
Before I cram it down my throat
Has broken up into bits in my moat
Rip the mattress off the floor
Walk the cramps off
Go meander in the cold
Hail to your dark skin
Hiding the fact you're dead again
Underneath the power lines seeking shade
Far above our heads are the icy heights
That contain all reason
It's a luscious mix of words and tricks
That let us bet when you know we should've fold
On rocks I dreamt of where we'd stepped
And of the whole mess of roads we're now on
Never betray the way you've always known it is
One day I'll be wondering how
I got so old just wondering how
Never got cold wearing nothing in the snow
This is way beyond my remote concern
Of being condescending

Never got cold wearing nothing in the snow
This is way beyond my remote concern
Of being condescending
All these squawking birds won't quit
 all is fair
 out the door
 I knew I would regret it too
 sailing in the night
 but sometimes I can fly off the handle
 but I've done the crime of wanting
What are they hiding under there?
On a walk in a fragile state
Weird angles coming over the wire
Back home we got girls in braids
And they're on roller skates and they roll any way they like
From my town I can always look down
Down my nose at the fish in the barrels
But in the wilds of human life
So tonight
Dance and cry
The dead alive
Monuments for awful events
I float by in a daze on the freeway
He can whine about different times
For the mills in the valley to function
Rain gonna fall on the hills where we hide
Wash the blood and the guts to the ocean

But I didn't go through what you must have in those early days
You had to be strong at such a very young age
A new life on Ilima Lane
So won't you listen to me now?
You moved back in with us in the Fall of '82
I fell into dark times and you were there to help me through
You told me that a downturn will eventually improve
So won't you listen to me now?
Footholds eroding
Had you never been my friend
I wouldn't be quite what you see
I wouldn't be the man I am

October chill in that old dusty town
Halloween came I was still feeling down
Your boy is losing count
I dine like an aging pilot
And where are they now  the money and the crowd?
Must I really come back down?
It's like I never was a kid
The big math just wasted youth on me
Making impressions like I did
Your friends never thought that much of me
But now I want to fall into something else
An origami plane to a distant island
And I don't want to show you my feelings
I don't want to force you to deal
I just want to crash through the ceiling
Before it gets too real
All my life  compromise on wings of resignation
Big grey eyes staring from the sky
Am I humble enough now?
I've always had something to hide
My skinny arms  my evil intentions
And back at school  hitting the fire alarms
Desperately wanting attention

Wishing I could fly  fantasy Island
And I don't want to show you my feelings
I don't want to bore you to death
I just want to crash through the ceiling
Get it off my chest
It's like I never was a kid
The big math  it wasted youth on me
Making impressions like I did
Your friends never thought that much of me
Well I was just a boy  out there on my own
Wishing I could fly  fantasy Island
And I don't want to show you my feelings
I don't want to force you to deal
I just want to crash through the ceiling
Before it gets too real (oh)
Before it gets too real (oh)
Before it gets too real (oh)
Real (oh)
Real
As we all sail along
Soaking our feet
Had it nailed to my forehead again
To keep this boat afloat
There are things you can't afford to know
So I save all my breath for the sails
But you'll find those lingering voices
Are just your ego's attempt to make it all clean and nice and make a moron out of you
Walking a bridge on weakening cables
Huddled up in fear and hate because we know our fate and it's a lot to put us through
Most ideas turn to dust
As there are few in which we can all trust
Haven't you noticed I've been shedding all of mine?
So let's abandon that track
And leave our fathers fighting in a sack
Cause we're way too wiseassed for that
You might find some fools at your doorstep
Hustling the latest changes to the book that's the strangest
In an attempt to multiply
Marionettes on weakening cables
Huddled up with fear and hate because they know their fate and it's a lot to put them through
You might also like
We've taken on a climb
And it's long enough to put the best of us on our backs
Walking up a slide
And there are those we know who'd have us five miles off the track
You'll find those lingering voices
Are just your ego's attempt to make it all clean and nice and make a moron out of you
Crossing a bridge on weakening cables
But now just a dim light
Off in the distance
A fallen stone
Following the path
Of least resistance
Afraid I'll slide under that spell again
Taken for a fool
Tell me what you do
I lost my way and she took me to school
So many times
Caught up in my head at night
With a leash and a label
If I can learn

Afraid I'll slide under that spell again
The way we used to carry on
Is stuck in my head like a terrible song
Taken for a fool
I'm following their rules (Following their rules)
Guess I was a very honest tool
Taken for a fool (taken for a fool)
Some backwards purpose
It's enough to make me nervous
But your lips when we speak
Are the valleys and peaks of a mountain range on fire
So let me walk these coals 'til you believe
I can cut the mustard well enough
Cause you know as soon as we breathe we scrutinize
How else could you tie my head to the sky
This new convection has left me wondering why
I can't concern myself with ordinary tripe
Like what's this morning's paper got to say
And which brand of coffee to make
This is no umbrella to take into the wind
But before we begin is there nothing to kill this anxiety
But your lips when we speak
Are the valleys and peaks of a mountain range on fire
So let me walk these coals 'til you believe
I can cut the mustard well enough
Cause you know as soon as we breathe we scrutinize
You're the girl on the wing of a barnstormer
The tidal rabbit who came of age before her time
Could've been so good-natured
If I'd relented when you insisted
But we've been backed against
All nature's walls far too long
You felt abandoned by me
I recall the sunshine as you were melting
And though the comedy softens the fall
They still hear us with their ears to the wall
I sold all my evil motives
No icicles stuck in my hide
Just help me feel warm inside
Before we take this ride and let it slide
Into the cracks where fall and winter collide
I surrender all my gall in a song of modern love
Remember you're the one who summoned me above any other kind
Any other kind
You might also likeCould've been so good-natured
If you'd relented when I insisted
And let the gluttons fill themselves with all the worst of the gory nineties
Before we take this ride and let it slide
Into the cracks where fall and winter collide
I surrender all my gall in a song of modern love
But there are just so many of
You out there for rent
A stronger girl would shake this off in flight
And never give it more than a frowning hour
But you have let your heart decide
Loss has conquered you
You've won one too many fights
Wearing many hats every time
But you won't win here tonight
You've made it through the direst of straits alright
Can you help it if plain love now seems less interesting?
You haven't changed an ounce in my eyes
And I cannot lecture you
And does anything I say seem relevant at all?
You've been at the helm since you were just five
While I cannot claim to be more than a passenger
Wearing all of your clothes at the same time
Let the good times end tonight
This time
You might also likeJust a moment or two from now
Not a mind will retain even a trace
Of the thoughts that I struggled to tell
And how our stack of cards just fell
So settle this once and for all
The light no longer shows the cracks around my door
And I have no lantern to light your way home tonight
You are not some saint who's above
Giving someone a stroll through the flowers
You've got so much more to dream of
This time
This time
The train is getting way too loud
I gotta leave here my girl
Get on with my lonely life
Just leave the ring on the rail
For the wheels to nullify
Until this turn in my head
I let you stay and you paid no rent
I spent twelve long months
On the lam
That's enough sitting on the fence
For the fear of breaking dams
I find a fatal flaw
In the logic of love
And go out of my head
You love a sinking stone
That'll never elope
So get used to the lonesome
Girl  you must atone some
Don't leave me no phone number there

It took me all of a year
To put the poison pill to your ear
But now I stand on honest ground  on honest ground
You want to fight for this love
But honey you cannot wrestle a dove
So baby it's clear
You want to jump and dance
But you sat on your hands
And lost your only chance
Go back to your hometown
Get your feet on the ground
And stop floating around
I find a fatal flaw
In the logic of love
And go out of my head
You love a sinking stone
That'll never elope
So get used to used to the lonesome
Girl  you must atone some
I'm feeling loose and life don't make no sense
I use my brains to build a fence 'round the claim I stake
I take the drugs but the drugs won't take
I took a pledge to grow up
Then drank enough to make me throw up
On all my dearly disappointed friends
I'm just too lazy to make amends with you anyway
That's why the pattern still remains
There's half a million things that I'm supposed to be
Shelter in the nighttime  a punk running free
And if it gets too deep  I reach for my guitar
And if I try hard
I find something I could really drop into
And everything that was is just a thing that I can sing
Everything is something next to nothing
As crazy as it seems  you give it up and you are free
Another candle to blow out  new set of dark thoughts to shut out
And everybody's got their remedies
But nothing works like chemistry  so raise a toast
No more sipping from the fire hose

 I guess I’m just here to test your patience
 in between the lines I’m reading
 but I had it wrong
 you gonna do me harm
 won’t you be still for a moment?
Cornered by your natural desire
You wanna hop along with the giddy throng through life
But how will you learn to steer
When you’re grinding all your gears?
You've been talking for hours
You said time will wash every tower to the sea
And now you've got this worry in your heart
Well I guess it's only life  it's only natural
We all spend a little while going down the rabbit hole
And the things they taught you
They're lining up to haunt you
You got your back against the wall
Call you on the telephone
Won't you pick up the receiver?
I've been down the very road you're walking now
It doesn't have to be so dark and lonesome
Takes a while but we can figure this thing out
And turn it back around
You used to be such a lion
Before you got into all this crying on my lap
Back when you thought I’d never get this far
But did you really think I’d shut an open door?
The future’s calling and I'mma answer her
The wheel’s in motion  I never drank your potion
And I know it breaks your heart

Open up your parachute
Something's gotta stop the freefall!
I've been down the very road you're walking now
It doesn't have to be so dark and lonesome
Takes a while but we can figure this thing out
If your back was still aligned
And your sheets
Were growing grass all on the corners of your bed
But you've got too much to wear on your sleeves
It has too much to do with me
And secretly I want to bury in the yard
The grey remains of a friendship scarred
You told us of your new life there
You got someone coming around
Gluing tinsel to your crown
He's got you talking pretty loud
Your ailing heart and your criminal eyes
You say you're still in love
If it's true what can be done
It's hard to leave all those moments behind
Called to see
If your back was still aligned
And your sheets
Were growing grass all on the corners of your bed
But you've got too much to wear on your sleeves
It has too much to do with me
And secretly I want to bury in the yard
The grey remains of a friendship scarred

You tested your mettle
Of doe's skin and petals
While kissing the lipless
Gave up on trying to make 'em
I figured it'd take 'em too long to look up
And besides
It was undeniably clear to me I don't know why
When every other part of life seemed locked behind shutters
I knew the worthless dregs we've always been
Lying in wait at the Birmingham mall
The songs that I heard
The occasional book were the only fun I ever took
And I got on with making myself
But when they're parking their cars on your chest
You still got a view of the summer sky
To make it hurt twice when your restless body
Caves to its whims
And suddenly struggles to take flight
Three thousand miles northeast
I left all my friends at the morning bus stop
Shaking their heads
What kinda life you dream of? You're allergic to love
Yes I know but I must say in my own defense
You might also likeIt's been undeniably dear to me I don't know why
When every other part of life seemed locked behind shutters
I knew the worthless dregs we are
The selfless loving saints we are
Dad was stationed at an RAF base they called Mildenhall
Black moss on a busted wall
The cobblestones made it hard to skate
I thought my flattop was so new wave
Until it melted away in the Suffolk rain
Then a kid in class passed me a tape
I guess my shoes said I might relate
Somehow she knew I'd like to stay up waiting with her in the cold
For cheap beer and rock 'n' roll
Which in time put lots of things in my mind
A kid in class passed me a tape
We saw some bands down at the Corn Exchange
I wonder where my sister was that night
Back at home under the tanning bed lights
I can still see the glow
Strange rays from her window
Started messing with my dad's guitar
Taught me some chords just to start me off
Whittling away on those rainy days
And that's how we get to where we are now

And that's how we get to where we are now
You left me wringing my cold hands
We shared some information
We might not recover from
And I watch your convictions
Melt like ice cubes in an ocean
You were so poorly cast as a malcontent
You've got them all on your side
That just makes more for doubt to slaughter
I never knew he thought that
Don't ask for his opinion
They ought to drown him in holy water
Will you remember my reply
When your high horse dies?
We'd like to go the distance
But not a one of us is going
You see nobody is wise enough
To turn the ancient boat around
These are the muddy waters
I'm swimming in to make a living

Rolling down the ancient high street you'll find
In the mirror reflects a woman in her prime
Can you make your way out in a world dearly won?

Gonna take it one sip at a time
Somebody with an antique notion
Come along to tighten the line
He's just afraid of you speaking your mind
They've got a name for you girls
What's in a name? (Blah blah blah blah)
They got a name for everything
All of the clothes that you wear
And all of your bits and pieces  yeah

Gold teeth and a curse for this town
Were all in my mouth
Only I don't know how they got out  dear
Turn me back into the pet
I was when we met
I was happier then with no mindset
And if you took to me like
A gull takes to the wind
Well  I'd've jumped from my trees
And I'd've danced like the king of the eyesores
And the rest of our lives would've fared well

I was born with blood on my hands
And have all the signs of a bleeding heart
Living high on a giant hog
On a mountain so steep
Keep your head in a hollow log
As the ruling fog are about to creep
What have we done?
How'd we get so far from the sun?
Where a tiny few catch all of the rays
Out beyond the western squalls
In an alien land
They work for nothing at all
They don't know the mall or the layaway plan
Dig yourself a beautiful grave
Everything you could want
Maybe those invisible slaves
Are too far away for a ghost to haunt
What will we charge?
Letting go of a claim so large
But a tiny few are having all of the fun
You might also likeGet used to the dust in your lungs
Is there no way down
From this peak to solid ground
Without having our gold teeth
Pulled from our mouths?
Make me a drink strong enough
To wash away the dishwater world they said was lemonade
Walk with me after the show
Maybe we can find a way through the minefield in the snow
What will they charge?
Letting go of a claim so large
But a tiny few are having all of the fun
Apologies to the sick and the young
Wiping the eastbound dust from his sunburned brow
A life before doubt
I smell the engine grease and mints the wind is blending
Under the moan of rotting elm in the silo floor
Down a hill of pine tree quills we made our way
To the bottom and the ferns where thick moss grows
Beside a stream
Under the logs are snails and we can fill our pocket
Let them go one by one all day in a brand new place
You were no ordinary drain on her defenses
And she was no ordinary girl
Oh  Inverted World
If every moment of our lives
Were cradled softly
In the hands of some strange and gentle child
The doors on the oven wide enough to make us all kin
Psychotic boy scout  let it all gush out
You're shopping your brains out now in the bargain bins
So many germs to avoid
Thinking about it just nurtures them
Baby  return to your toys
A little mental hideaway
You're painting a hole
Can you crawl up inside it?
You're painting a hole
On everyone in your way
You're painting a hole
To magical violence
You're painting a hole
But it keeps fading away
Morning dove  one thing I'm sure of
Kisses ain't near enough to reign the vultures in

White girls of the north
They are the fabled lambs
Of Sunday ham
The EHS norm
And they could float above the grass
In circles if they tried
A latent power I know they hide
To keep some hope alive
That a girl like I
Could ever try
Could ever try
So we just skirt the hallway sides
A phantom and a fly
Follow the lines
And wonder why
There's no connection
A week of rolling eyes
And cheap shots from the trite
And we're off to Nemarca's porch again
Another afternoon
Of the goat-head tunes
And pilfered booze

We wander through her mama's house
The milk from a window lights
This is that foreign land
With the sprayed-on tans
And it all feels fine
Be it silk or slime
Two zombies walk in our stead
This town seems hardly worth the time
And we'll no longer memorize or rhyme
Too far along in our climb
Stepping over what now towers to the sky
With no connection
Two zombies walk in our stead
This town seems hardly worth the time
And we'll no longer memorize or rhyme
Too far along in our crime
Stepping over what now towers to the sky
With no connection
As cold as a winter pole
You held a warm stone out
New flowing blood to hold
To the brutes in the halls
My timid young fingers held
A decent animal
Over the ramparts you tossed
The scent of your skin and some foreign flowers
The years have been short but the days were long
Cool of a temperate breeze
From dark skies to wet grass
A thousand summers passed
When our kite lines first crossed
We tied 'em into knots
But to finally fly apart
We had to cut them off

Since then it's been a book you read in reverse
So you understand less as the pages turn
Or a movie so crass and awkwardly cast
That even I could be the star
I don't look back much as a rule
And all this way before murder was cool
But your memory is here and I'd like it to stay
Over the ramparts you tossed
The scent of your skin and some foreign flowers
The years have seemed short but the days go slowly by
Two loose kites fallen from the sky
Fly in fear from the raptor come to take its life
And as it closed in for the capture
Funneled the fear through my ancient eyes
Under my hat it reads the lines are all imagined
A fact of life I know to hide from my little girls
I know my place amongst the bugs and all the animals
And it's from these ordinary people you are longing to be free
My hotel and on the TV
A preacher on a stage like a buzzard cries
The cyanide of an almond
I saw a photograph: Cologne in '27
And then a postcard after the bombs in '45
Must've been a world of evil clowns that let it happen
That you were there and so was I
Under my hat I know the lines are all imagined
A fact of life I must impress on my little girls
I know my place amongst the creatures in the pageant
Nurtured all year then pressed in a book
Or displayed in bad taste at the table
Problems arise and you fan the fire
While there's a wild pack of dogs loose in your house tonight
Cut from bad cloth or soiled like socks
Add it up and basically people never change
They just talk and make plans in the dark
Or make haste with ideas that can't help
But creep good people out
As you talk to me too much you're assuming
We don't always want what's right
Did I strike the right set of chords? You're annoyed
The goal is to ignite you then move on
And the wise cracks don't make you more stable
You've learned your lines to scale and to time
Why must I remind you now I'm only less able
Cut from bad cloth or soiled like socks
We're ordinary people we can't help but to change
As we walk and make plans in the dark
Or make haste with the boy who can't help
But creep good people out
As you talk to me too much you're assuming
We don't always want what's right

 who makes the call
Drinking a minimum wage
I fell in with a girl so vastly superior
She wore Mardi Gras beads in her hair
And I just can't get her out of my bed
Wish I'd gone with her sister instead
Can't get her out of my bed
I know
If she gave a fuck then it would show
And she wouldn't have me stabbing other boys
Like it's just a bit of sweetness she enjoys
Devil's daughter
So much for Simon's 50 Ways...

No come-along will pull me away

Slow down
I don't know what I'm hoping for
So silently I'm opening the latch
 evidently there's still so much that hides
 uneventful state of apathy releases me
These two are opening now
For the thing carries every hope
I invest in a single light
The choice is yours to be loved
Come away from an emptier boat
Cause when the dead moon rises again
We've no time to start a protocol to hem us in
And when the dog slides underneath the train
Throw all consequence aside
In a cheerless pyre we will set alight
Of all the intersecting lines in the sand
I routed a labyrinth to your lap
I never used a map sliding off the land
On an incidental tide
And we got sea legs and we're off tonight
Can I've that to which they've no right?
You belong to a simpler time

Pontus kindly gave up a pearl
Of his eternal stone and mud
And ain't she lovely bone and blood
Born of the sea
A thousand miles away from me
Under our softly burning lamp she
Takes her time
Telling stories of our possible lives
And love is the ink in the well when her body writes
I've been selfish and full of pride
And she knows deep down there's a little child
But I got a good side to me as well
And it's that she loves in spite of everything else
A song in the tree has distracted her mind
Some other curious form of life
Has made its presence to her known

On tiny raindrops that fall in a veil
Over our city like notes from above
Its not that the darkness can't touch our lives
And now when the sun goes down she sheds her darling light
I've been selfish and full of pride
But she knows deep down there's a little child
And I got a good side to me as well
To say what you done
I told you 'bout all those fears
And away they did run
Your shore must be strong
And you feel like an ocean
Made warm by the sun
When I was just nine years old
I swear that I dreamt
Your face on a football field
And a kiss that I kept
Under my vest 
Apart from everything
But the heart in my chest
I know that things can really get rough when you go it alone
As this little home
My life in an upturned boat
Marooned on a cliff
You brought me a great big flood
And you gave me a lift
And you tell me with your tongue
And your breath goes in my lungs
And we float over the rift

Made warm by the sun
Remember walking a mile to your house
Aglow in the dark
I made a fumbling play for your heart
And the axe struck a spark
You wore a charm on the chain that I stole
Especial for you
Love's such a delicate thing that we do
With nothing to prove
You low animal
Collect your novel petals for the stem
Melt and flow
Eviscerate your fragile frame
And spill it out in the ragged floor
A thousand different versions of yourself
And if the old guard still offend
They got nothing left on which you depend
So enlist every ounce
Of your bright blood
And off with their heads
Jump from the hook
You're not obliged to swallow anything you despise
And they got no right
As sure as you have eyes
They got no right
Just put yourself in my new shoes
And see that I do what I do
Because the old guard still offend
(Their pudgy hearts and shiny heads)
They've got nothing left on which we depend
So enlist every ounce
Of your bright blood
And off with their heads
Jump from the hook
You're not obliged to swallow anything you despise
Somehow we'd coast to the end
Change lies in every direction
Seems so long ago
It's hard not to imagine
The lives we used to have
When the nights were ours alone
So now what?
I had this crazy idea
Somehow we'd coast to the end
Change lies in every direction
I think you know you're my best friend
It's sort of an unspoken rule
That things will not turn out the way you plan
You know that I
I can handle all of that
If I can still take your hand
Will you still think I'm strong
If I admit that I was wrong?
So now what?

I was strumming on a stone again
Pulling teeth from the pimps of gore
When hatched a tragic opera in my mind
And it told of a new design
In which every soul is duty bound
To uphold all the statutes of boredom
Therein lies the fatal flaw of the red age
Because it was nothing like we'd ever dreamt
Our lust for life had gone away with the rent we hated
Because it made no money
Nobody saved no one's life this time
So we burned all our uniforms
And let nature take its course again
And the big ones just eat all the little ones
Sent us back to the drawing board
In our darkest hours
We have all asked for some
Angel to come
Sprinkle his dust all around

And if it's far enough in sight and rhyme

Poly-morphing opinion here
And your vague outline
Find myself another burning gate
And this is get what you get for pulling pins
Out of the hole inside the hole you're in
It's like I'm perched on the handlebars
Of a blind man's bike
On a rolling mind
They'll want you to decide
Some gather on one side
With all their pearlys snapping
They close the basement door
That sets our teeth to chatter
You never saw it before
But now that hardly matters
Too many summers you've enjoyed
With some odd convictions
It's like I'm perched on the handlebars
Of a blind man's bike
The gold plated legs of my rival
Whose eyes had no reason to fall
You led no celibate life
No skirt while chemicals danced on your head
You stole the keys to this ride and your fables are falling tonight
Because of your struggle to make them
The taste for your past time is fading
Remember the girls in the middle
Are always the first to fall off
You've learned to live like a mouse
Searching the cracks in the walls to remember
All the dregs in the crowd
You barely recall
You led no celibate life
No skirt while chemicals danced on your head
You stole the keys to this ride
I feel fear
Of all the stupid things
A man could feel
While his freedom ring
He squanders the deal
What took me this long?
Can we hit rewind
On somebody's magic bong? Oh
Come back and touch my face
Feel for fever in the night
You look into my eyes
But you don't really recognize me anymore
We're past another pointless year
Foaming at the mouth
I with my hands ever up
And yours stretching out
I know I've run out of luck
This fear is a terrible drug
If I only had sense enough
To let it give away to love

Trail of white blood betrays the reckless route your craft is running
Loiter the whole day through and lose yourself in lines dissecting love
Your name on my cast and my notes on your stay
Offer me little but doting on a crime
We've turned every stone and for all our invention
Trail of white blood betrays the reckless route your craft is running
Lose yourself in lines dissecting

Your clerics fog will recede right before your eyes
So long to this wretched form
Them gray eyes on the subway
Long before you were born
You were always to be a dagger floating
Straight to their heart
But you're gonna tell the world
This whole life ain't been any fun
Now your viscera unfurls
You've thoroughly blown their minds
And now I must have passage
Only life's two veins from your heart

 a modern girl
 still prone to care
 the coming night
 twist and cry
 absurdly
Bite your tongue and smile
Like every mother does her ugly child
But it starts to leaking out
Like spittle from a cloud
Amassed resentment pelting ounce and pound
You entertaining any doubt
Cause you had to know that I was fond of you
Fond of Y-O-U
Though I knew you masked your disdain
I can see the change was just too hard for us
Hard for us
You always had to hold the reins
So affections fade away
Or do adults just learn to play

Cause you had it in for me so long ago
I don't know why and I don't care
If you'd only seen yourself hating me
Hating me
When I'd been so much more than fair
But then you'd have to lay those feelings bare
One thing I know has still got you scared
And never once aired on a dare
You had to know that I was fond of you
Fond of Y-O-U
So I took your licks at the time
And a change like that is just so hard to do
Hard to do
Don't let it whip-crack your life
And I'll bow out from the fight
Those old pious sisters were right
The worst part is over
The mile to my house
And had me do a stroll with you
Far below a furry moon
Our purposes crossed
The weird divide
Between our kinds
(Ooh
Ooh
Ooh)
The silver leaves of ailing trees
Took flight as we passed
So long ago
But a short time I know
It pleases me this memory
Has swollen up with age
Even time can do
Good things to you

Fly the whole mess into the sea
Another slow train to the coast
Some brand new gory art from way on high
I sink and then I swim all night
I watch the ice melt on the glass
While the eloquent young pilgrims pass
And leave behind their trail
Imploring us all not to fail
Of course I was raised to gather courage from those
