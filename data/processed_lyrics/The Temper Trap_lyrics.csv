lyrics
" we just running round in circles
 oh
 feels so good
 feels so good
 I got an education
 oh
 feels so good
 feels so good
 ahhh
 feels so good
 feels so good
Under your spell
I'm told that people go
But still the night suffers
Your flame smaller
That face I just had to know
Know for sure
So what's the point in starting
Something that will crash and end
I could never tell
Once awhile
Burn just to feel alive
They broke your crown
Set loose their hounds
On your tattered bones
Not a sound drew from your lips
As you got your fix
What holy pleasure of the damned
Is this?
You might also like
And our repentant heart's
Breaking on its knees again
We are drowning men
Once awhile
Burn just to feel alive
How can we know light without
Walking in the dark
There would be no spark
Singing burn
There would be no spark
Singing burn
There would be no spark
Once awhile
You got to burn and burn
A silent witness to the dying seconds of a wasted life
A trail of events marches upwards where the sun shines bright
And she won’t make it out
But she will free her heart
She will free her heart  x 2
I used to live and breathe for the rage
Until the rage subsides
There’ll be a reckoning ??? pain?  is going down in style
And now it’s looking for stranger zones in the midnight hour
No he won’t make it out
He can free his heart
He can free his heart
 some dreadfully bad
 wash the blood off our knees
 our ship will sail
 feelings this time take you)
 put the pieces back together)
 we have seen some things
 cast our hopes out to sea
 feelings this time take you)
 put the pieces back together)
 don't stop
 wanna walk alone forever
 wanna walk alone forever
Catching birds in the sun
You have surrendered life's better hours
In the deep lies your freedom
In the stars is your home
As we gather to see you go
Flowers scatter to let you know
Sons of the mountains cry in the vials
Warm and tender in her arms
So you'll stay though you're gone
As we gather to say goodbye
Until we see your face again
But seasons come you're going soon
Everybody leaves in the end
All the names left behind
Are standing mirrors of your eyes
Shall replace the wars that came
Everybody leaves in the end
 stranded on this boat
 sweet sun's comin' down hard
 it burns the bones
 hold a hand for cover
 don't change a thing
 they swims
 that's all that we can do
 hold a hand for cover
 don't change a thing
 they swims
 don't change a thing
 they swims
Maybe we'll never know
You and me are worst enemies
Cause we don't believe anymore
Out on the streets
Our colors bleed
Nobody speaks to me
So I can find my way out from the shadows
Raise your voice cause the time is now or never
Shallow dreams tell me everything
Pulling strings
And you'll do anything to keep me hanging on your every word
Out on the streets
Our colors bleed
Are you the one to speak to me?

So I can find my way out from the shadows
Raise your voice cause the time is now or never
We're miles off coast from where we're headed
To break our fall
It's the final call
It's the final call
It's now or never
So I can find my way out from the shadows
Raise your voice cause the time is now or never
So I can find my way out from the shadows
Raise your voice cause the time is now or never
They don't know what they're on about
Those fools
Don't get my dreams
All
You can't wait to watch me fall
Singin' stories on a wrecking ball
Colliding fast
To bring you down

So might aswell do some dying
Was-Ting
Wat-Ching
On small screens
Oh I see you coulda been
Eyes so open
And when you see it walking in the distance
Don't stop nothing
Don't stop for me
You're slowly dying
For absolutely nothing
So say nothing
This will pull your hearts
So Cold sooo
This will pull your hearts
So cold sooo
Sooooo Cooold your hearts
Still frames remembering the way we were
Way down see reflections in the well
A distant haunting bell
Resounding every time I touch you in my mind
Nor ever change the mind
Left to our wrong device we set this bridge alive
This you won't forget
I was the one who came running back again
My arms are reaching out for you
Each time I think of you
Flood gates open and I'm left drowning
May you return to me
Not to possess but to hold you in my keep

And so the last page shall remain
Empty until you write the rest
A fool for waiting for you
Built up castles made of sand
Don't let them say
Dreamin' of way back when
In and out your door
We were all someone else before
Leavin' shadows on each other's walls
So don't let them say
Dreamin' of way back when
Don't break the spell
I'm leavin' the heartbreak hotel
Catch you in my sleep
Catch you in my sleep
Catch you in my sleep
Catch you in my sleep
Catch you in my sleep
Catch you in my sleep (I'm leavin' the heartbreak hotel)
Catch you in my sleep (I'm leavin' the heartbreak hotel)
Catch you in my sleep (I'm leavin' the heartbreak hotel)
Catch you in my sleep (I'm leavin' the heartbreak hotel)
Catch you in my sleep (I'm leavin' the heartbreak hotel)
I had my favourite toys
But I grew up way too fast in the world
I was a little boy
I met a little boy
But I'm so tight in a hole
He had his favourite toys
And all the weight of the world
I knew this little boy
I was a little boy
But I grew up too fast in the world
I had my favourite toys
But I grew up way too fast in the world
I was a little boy
Ooooh
I was a little boy
But I grew up too fast in the world
I had my favourite toys
But I grew up way too fast in the world
I was a little boy
As police clash with youths in several cities
You went to the stores that you had applied for a job at?
You didn't want to reply back to my e-mail?
And what about you? Any bad feelings at all?
Have you ever thought about it at night when you've been
Sleeping in your bed?
Seems like Christmas came early (came early)
Payback innit
Heavy is the hand
Pressing down again and again
We all came to play the game
Will tomorrow come
For the men stuck in the line
There's a rumor circling
London's burning from within

And it doesn't matter how hard we try
Ideology
Isn't nothing on the streets
No one cared and no one looked
Til she threw the judge's book
Now who's the one to blame
When the children go insane
Dancing on their broken dreams
While London's burning from within
And it doesn't matter how hard we try
The streets are burning up from end to end
Climb each other and we'll fall again
The streets are burning up from end to end
End to end
And it doesn't matter how hard we try
You don't have to worry  baby
Let's get lost
Slip away  it's just us
You don't have to worry  baby
Let's get lost
And when the well is drying up
To the bones  to the very last drop
There's no one left that's on our side
Nothing in the world can tear us apart
Nothing in the world can tear us apart
When it all comes crashing down
And our lives are buried underground
Still nothing in the world can tear us apart
Break away  let's get lost
Something's in me calling lately
I hear it loud
So give tonight one more try
Because nothing lasts forever  baby
So let's get lost

And when the streets are emptied out
We lose our way walking into the dark
The cross we bear is all we've got
Nothing in the world can tear us apart
Nothing in the world can tear us apart
When it all comes crashing down
And our lives are buried underground
Still nothing in the world can tear us apart
Times can get lonely
Out in the cold
As long as you're near me
I need you to know
Tear us apart
Tear us apart
Nothing in the world can tear us apart
Nothing in the world can tear us apart
When it all comes a-crashing down
And our lives are buried underground
Still nothing in the world can tear us apart
Fade away  let's get lost
You don't have to worry  baby
Let's get lost
But now we've found it
And hope was gone
Our love was lost
But now we've found it
I won't deny it
I promise
I promise
Your walls are up
Too cold to touch it
Too high to climb
I know it's hard
But I can still hear it beating
So if you flash your heart
I won't mistreat it
I promise
I promise
I promise

Our love was lost
In the rubble are all the things
Keep me in mind
When you're ready
I am here to take you every time
Our love was lost
 who on Earth can know?
 tiny hands bound for greatness
 and always be a crutch
 you're a living miracle
 you hold a new forever
 we rarely see
 little miracle
My sun  you are the only one
Like a bullet  through the barrel of a gun
You keep me on the run
You keep me on the run
My sun  you are the only one
My sun  you are the only one
Like a gun  your night has just begun
You keep me on the run
You keep me on the run
Say you will  say you won't
Say you'll never never ever leave me
If you will  then I won't never never never need nobody else to believe in
Never need nobody else to keep me running
Keep me running from you

The silhouettes behind the dust clouds call me friend
But even fools know here they’re far and few between
She has abandoned me on highways and desert plains
Of lonely creatures singing for the summer rain
And at the end of all your knees fall down to kneel
Yet something in you always yearns for someone real
She is my salvation in the dark
But at night with lips of honey calls the devil’s horn
And I am a war of flesh and heart that’s left undone
Between the person that I was and have become
There’s no resting in my heart
There’s no resting in my heart
There’s no resting now
There’s no resting in my heart
There’s no resting in my heart
Be left abandoned by these hands
No  never again will I scale
The sleeping tower where your heart lays
You're walking out the way you came in
No  never again will you draw
Down your bridge to let their horses in
Dead or alive  the captives I thought I had freed
Made their bed in mine to haunt me when they please
You're walking out the way you came in
Oh  I came to let you try once again
It's the end
No  never again
It's the only friend we have
To look forward to
Space was a hold that groove
Climbing out us deeper in
Try to get to you
'Cause it feels like we are always
We are on the run
And it feels like we are always
We are on the run
Home was a place I knew
What a burning desire
To get back to you
When I am full of years
Wash my sins away my dear
Can you tell the night is through
'Cause it feels like we are always
We are on the run
'Cause it feels like we are always
We are on the run
'Cause it feels like we are always
We are on the run
We are on the run

Down by the old sugar mill
Everything but the wind
Is oh so still
Left behind until
The rust blended in
But once upon a time
You were here
Because everyone we know is gone
Everything we lost and found
We were just walking through an ordinary world
And all our favourite things are gone
And the last dance is done
We were just lovers in an ordinary world
What are we if not our memories
Well it’s been years since 2051
Yeah that was when I last heard you call my name
But if someone’s out there please give me a sign
Because everyone we know is gone
Everything we lost and found
We were just walking through an ordinary world
And all our favourite things are gone
And our last dance is done
We were just lovers in an ordinary world

All is quiet down by the old sugar mill
Flying on a paper plane
Standing on the shoulders of giants
To be seen by every man
And the good folks know I'm a sinner
My intentions were always on time
With a slap on the wrist
A kiss on the cheek
Come in
What's mine
Yeah come in
Strip down open and naked
No one really seems to care
Apparently you know the difference
Between the money and a millionaire
Now the good folks know I'm a sinner
My intentions were always on time
With a slap on the wrist
A kiss on the cheek
Come in
What's mine
Yeah come in

I used to want to be a hero
Until I found out even heroes die
I'm Peter Parker's alter ego
Waiting on the telephone line
The devil made me a sinner
But the good Lord's gonna save me this time
As you turn your head you go walking in the den
Come in
And take what's mine
To keep
I'll tell you the sorrows of tomorrow's dreams could be
Standing with my back to where I'm from
Feeling like my feet are made of stone
Desolation sinking in my bones
Down on the ground
I can see a trace of who I was
Underneath a hundred miles of dust
Everything I love will turn to rust
We were just hunters in the wilderness
Bound by our hunger to be more than what we are
In our blood runs a hope in all of us
The only part that still belongs
Caught in a storm
In the shadows of our innocence
Darkest state of providence
If you find me
Will you pull me out?
In the shadows of our innocence
Darkest state of providence
If you find me
Will you pull me out?

Days will go on

Living in a world that's bought and sold
Every day we pray in vain for gold
Where is my head
Who will come and save me from myself
Running through a field of burning beds
Looking in my soul to find some rest
We were just hunters in the wilderness
Bound by our hunger to be more than what we are
In our blood runs a hope in all of us
The only part that still belongs
Caught in a storm
In the shadows of our innocence
Darkest state of providence
If you find me
Will you pull me out?
In the shadows of our innocence
Darkest state of providence
If you find me
Will you pull me out?
We were just hunters in the wilderness...
(Will you find me and pull me out?)
Come to get you if you make another sound
Make you an example send you crawling home
Anyone who listens is gonna get theirs when the water floods down
Into the rabbit hole
Hands up if you think you're gonna save us now
Before we shoot the messenger for talking too loud
We'll keep you on the run
We get what we want
Every which way you go they're gonna hunt you down
Making you believe a lot of sticks and bricks can get you stoned
Cause anyone who listens is gonna get theirs when the water floods down
Into the rabbit hole
Think we gone around
Just feeding the flame
Arresting the fire
And it's a cold day in hell
It'll be a cold day in hell
Growing up
Just feeding the flame
Arresting the fire

Has stopped

House where the bleeding did fall
A mother is crying outside

If living means I'm dead here
Come hurry and resurrect me
Oh-oh-oh

And die until the resurrection of the things we believe
Driving out to nowhere
Days have lost their magic
And I just don't care

It plagues my mind

Little girl wakes dressed in mud
Arms reaching out touching God
She told me a story
In our father's house we gather
Where there is so much sky
In the distance is forever
Where there is so much sky
Where all the wild ones are born
And heaven stretches on and on
We run free we run strong
So much sky
And if the clouds
Should gather hope
Well just let it rain
Make it pour

She is killing time with her brush
That's the way she likes it Yeah
She lighting up a cigarette
It's hanging on the side of her mouth
But beside that cloud of smoke

Look and see

 it never is the best
 it leaves me feeling less
 in a room full of people
 lips move but the words don't come out
 it never is the best
 it leaves me feeling less
 it leaves me feeling less
 no
 it never is the best
 it leaves me feeling less
Truth can be lies and the devil
Don't want you free
Can anybody be
My minds wanders around
Though i'm caged oh let me out
Unmarked are the tombstones
But the family still cares
There were so many words
I should have never kept
And oh you got stuck in a spider's web
But I'll cut you free
ANd I'll cut you free
And oh as we stare at your wounds
We're howling
We're howling
We're howling for you
We're howling for you
You might also like
I saw what you saw
But there was something else
You know your love
Has bound your feet
And you're casting shadows
To deceive me
I never knew how it could be
I took a lot
I took once more
I want to do something
To show you to me
Because you know that no one
Really knows me
And oh you got stuck in a spider's web
But I'll cut you free
And I'll cut you free
And oh as I stare at your wounds
We're howling
We're howling
We're howling for you
We're howling for you
Unmarked are the tombstones
But the family still cares
There were so many words
I should have never kept
I'll cut you free
I'll cut you free
I'll cut you free
I'll cut you free
And oh you got stuck in a spider's web
But I'll cut you free
I'll cut you free
And oh I stare at your wounds
We're howling
We're howling
We're howling for you
We're howling for you
Unmarked are the tombstones
But the family still cares
There were so many words
I once used to know
People are strangers
The same as before
The streets look familiar
I remember the park
Where I buried my head
So deep in my hands
All around me was dark
This here city
Is for the lonely ones
You won't find no angels
Selling maps to the lost
This here place
Is too small for two
It took one to realise
When dreaming’s this hard
It's not meant to come true
So throw me a line
Somebody out there help me
I'm on my own
I'm on my own
Throw me a line
Afraid that I have come here
To win you again
With trembling hands
You might also like
Passing the days
Looking over the buildings
Time seemed to stop
While the millions keep moving
Now here I am
I'm a drop in your ocean
A noise in the crowd
Pushing through your halls of reason
So throw me a line
Somebody out there help me
I'm on my own
I'm on my own
Throw me a line
Afraid that I have come here
To win you again
With trembling hands
Whole
Whole
So throw me a line
Somebody out there help me
I'm on my own
I'm on my own
Throw me a line
Afraid that I have come here
To win you again
With trembling hands
With trembling hands
There goes the ending
It left me in want
Sound of their breath fades with the light
I think about the loveless fascination
Under the Milky Way tonight
Lower the curtain down on Memphis
Lower the curtain down  all right
Got no time  private consultation
Under the Milky Way tonight
Wish I knew what you were looking for
Might have known what you would find
And it's something quite peculiar
Something shimmering and white
It leads you here  despite your destination
Under the Milky Way tonight
Wish I knew what you were looking for

I want to be the one you treasure deep inside
I want to be the one to make you laugh each time
I want to be the only one you come home to at night
Stay in my heart
You can't always get what you want this time
Two wanderers have set their course to collide
I want to be the one in my father's eyes
I want to be the one in my mother's arms
Stay in my heart
You can't always get what you want this time
Two wanderers have set their course to collide
I want to be where you are
Where you are
Where you are

Where you are
To a different kinda wall
I feel nano sense skipping
Tangled up in my own thoughts
Try to look into the mirror
Scared of what I may find out
I must believe
I must bel-ie-ve
I need to live
Not just exist
What if I'm wrong
What if I'm wrong
Wha' did I know
What if I'm wrong
Why must I live in inside
I wrestle with my raging ailing

Hold-a my hand
Is the water so cold?
What if I'm wrong
Is the water so warm?
It's all that I know
What have we sold?
What if I'm wrong
What if I'm wrong
What if I'm wrong
 the dust has long set in
 where do we go from here?
 where do we go from here?
 and many chances pass us by
 how can I let you in again?"
