lyrics
"Because I wasn't invited to it anyway
You said I tasted famous so I drew you a heart
I've got an F and a C and I got a K too
And the only thing that's missing is a bitch like U
But now I'm too perfekt for someone like you
I was a dandy in your ghetto with a snow white smile
What's my name? What's my name?
Hold the S because I am an AIN'T
What's my name? What's my name?
Hold the S because I am an AIN'T
Your sell-by date expired so you had to be sold
I'm a suffer-genius and vivi-sex symbol

Hold the S because I am an AIN'T
I've got an F and a C and I got a K too
And the only thing that's missing is U
I've got an F and a C and I got a K too
And the only thing that's missing is a bitch like U
I've got an F and a C and I got a K too
And the only thing that's missing is a bitch like U
I am a dandy in the ghetto with a snow white smile
I am a dandy in the ghetto with a snow white smile
What's my name? What's my name?
Hold the S because I am an AIN'T
What's my name? What's my name?
Hold the S because I am an AIN'T

Hold the S because I am an AIN'T

Anti choice and anti girl
I am the anti-flag unfurled
Anti white and anti man

There will never be enough of anti more
I can't believe in the things that don't believe in me

Anti things I fucked and ate
Anti cop and anti fun

Red roses fell to the floor
And the world stood still
My mouth was a crib and it was growing lies
I didn't know what love was on that day
Burned all the good things in the Eden eye

I'd kill myself to make everybody pay

Already died and went away

Behind her smile
She's standing on an overpass
In her miracle mile
'Cause you were from a perfect world
A pill to make you anybody else
But all the drugs in this world
Won't save her from herself

And she was waiting to fall
Just bleeding like a polaroid
That lost all her dolls

An angel dies and falls from heaven (But when they get to you)
When the boy is still a worm
It's hard to learn the number seven
I feel my back is changing shape (But when they get to you)
When the worm consumes the boy
But when they get to you (I wish I had my balls)
First thing that they do (I wish I had my balls)
But when they get to you...

Pound me the witch drums
Pound me the witch drums  the witch drums
Better pray for hell  not hallelujah
I'm the curled up fists
Dead and hardened spiders
Like two mangled crowns
On the white heads of the meanest coiled snakes
Folks say that I look like death
Lived in the hotel of my eyes
Blinds wide open like a whore
Paid in spit from that hearse between her thighs
Keep your halos tight
I'm your god or your guardian
Keep your halo tight
One hand on the trigger  the other hand in mine
Because now
Cupid carries a gun

It's no wonder our stage clothes have dreams to be famous
The trees in the courtyard are painted in blood
So I've heard she hangs the headless upside down to drain
Eat me  drink me
This is only a game
This is only a game
I was invited to a beheading  today
I thought I was a butterfly next to your flame
A rush of panic and the lock has been raped
This is only a game  this is only a game
But then our star rushes in
Feeling like a child and looking like a woman
She's been forecast with an attempt to kill herself
But the ending didn't test well

No shadows  no reflections here
Lying cheek to cheek  in your cold embrace
So soft and so tragic  as a slaughterhouse
You press the knife against your heart
If I was your vampire  certain as the moon
Instead of killing time
We'll have each other until the sun
If I was your vampire  death waits for no one
Hold my hands across your face
Because I think our time has come
Digging your smile apart with my spade tongue
And the hole is where the heart is
We built this tomb together  I won't fill it alone
Beyond the pale
Everything's black  no turning back

Instead of killing time
We'll have each other until the sun

Gonna use you and abuse you
I've got to get away
From the pain you drive in the heart of me
The love we share seems to go nowhere
And I've lost my light
For I toss and turn  I can't sleep at night
This tainted love you've given
I'll give you all a boy could give you
Take my tears and that's not nearly all
Tainted love (Oh-oh-oh)
Tainted love
Now  I know I've got to run away
I've got to get away
You don't really want any more from me
To make things right
Need someone to hold you tight
And you'll think love is to pray
But I'm sorry  I don't pray that way

I made this psalm into my dirty bomb
Racing to a red light
I'm un-scabbed and un-regretted
I got tattooed in reverse
Hold your breath and just wait

This ain't my goddamn cup of tears

Kill everyone that wasn't beautiful
And I don't want you and I don't need you
It's not your fault that you're always wrong
The weak ones are there to justify the strong
It's all relative to the size of your steeple
You can't see the forest for the trees
And you can't smell your own shit on your knees
There's no time to discriminate
Hate every motherfucker that's in your way
Something beautiful or something free?
The worms will live in every host
It's hard to pick which one they hate the most
It's all anatomic as the size of your steeple

Old-fashioned fascism will take it away

And when we were good
You just closed your eyes
