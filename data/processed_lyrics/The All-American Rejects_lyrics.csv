lyrics
"And the doors are cell block tight
And the clock's about to strike
Did it call you down? Are you back just yet?
And the only sound is a minute left
It's a chance to fix mistakes
One more for the last time
Don't you throw our dreams away
Don't waste this chance with your smile
Ten seconds left on this dial
This could be the last time
In a whisper-quiet room
But the echoes sound like you
But the time is right and it only flies

It's a chance to fix mistakes
One more for the last time
Does it throw our dreams away?
Don't waste this chance with your smile
Ten seconds left on this dial
This could be the last time
This could be the last time
Now I've made our last mistake
One more for the last time
Does it blow our dreams away
Don't waste this chance with your smile
Ten seconds left on this dial
This could be the last time
 you're so far away
 baby
 affection
We were just two kids that took the moment when it was there
Do you remember you at all?
Another heart calls
Just as soon as I see you
As deep as I need you
You wanna leave it all
What can I do?
Say it's true
Or everything that matters breaks in two
Say it's true
I'll never ask for anyone but you
But this could be the last mistake that I would ever wanna do
It's time you see my point of view

So you never really found your way?
Stay true
Did you ever make it through today?
(You never make it through the day)
I know that when I think about a day without it
Everyday's the same
You wish that you could find someone
But I'm the only one to blame
Can't you see I beg and plead?
'Cause when your eyes light up the skies at night
I know you're gonna find your way back to me
No  don't
Don't you ever let a piece of me down
(Ooh-ooh ooh-ooh  ooh-ooh ooh-ooh)
'Cause time won't
Get back when I'm never around

If it's me that you don't need

And when your eyes light up the skies at night
 I think so
 that’s all you need to see
 that’s all you need to see
 I know you’ll wait for me
And wrap your arms around me 'til your
Knuckles are burning white
And all your tears (All your tears)
They couldn't match the bitter taste
Of all these wasted years
And all tou take take
Everything that wasn't even yours
Wait wait
You don't got a hold of me anymore

I know this will be temporary
You ask to leave
But I can tell you that I've had enough

Leave you trapped off at all sides

To shape and shake the room we were standing in
And I remember then the silence made me weightless
In the tonic of you once again
Where ignorance was bliss
Ignorance was this place we could exist and then surrender
Do you remember?
The day you said it
I'll never forget it
The day you said it
I'll make you regret it
Now I'm staring at the ceiling wide awake
Man  shit gets real when you're alone
(I wonder if you'll ever know)
There's these voices in my head
They're screaming words I should've said
But I don't know
I can't let go
And you are down
Your taste was in my mouth
The lipstick on the window
You were gone

You know I'd understand
It's easier to give it away
When on the other hand
You know I

I don't wanna make you cry

You stole my heart and then you kicked it aside
And I used to think that I was all you would need
(Nah nah nah) And there you go again
You lift me up and then you throw me back down
You stole my heart and then you kicked it aside
You stole my heart and then you kicked it aside (Damn that girl)
And I used to think that I was all you would need
You don't have to speak
Lips for biting
You're staring me down
A glance makes me weak
Eyes for striking
Now I'm twisted up
When I'm twisted with you
Brush so lightly
And time trickles down
And I'm breathing for two
Squeeze so tightly
This moment seems so long
We'll dance inside the song
What makes the one to shake you down?

Say now you want to shake me too

Got a broken heart and a busted nose
Because I'm running from my demons
Is this the real life? Feels like a museum
Am I even here? Is it still even me?
Am I some of the man that I still claim to be?
You come to fix me
I'm running from my demons
But is this the real life or a mausoleum?

Yeah i could dig myself a grave
But even 6 feet down i know
I'll be found feeling this way
If only i could find
Yeah just a reason to believe
That there's nothing that's up your sleeve
Even though you're wearing that tank top
Love me or leave me but just not behind
We don't need money the way we spend time
You go fast. I'll go slow
Meet you in the middle just to let you know
If it's me and you tonight (if it's me and you tonight)
Light my fuse and your body explodes
It's going to be alright (it's gonna be alright)
Are you ready now? I'm ready now
If only i were bright (if only i were bright)
Then i could let go of my brain
Put a tourniquet on and your sweet injection into my vein
And i say that you're the drug

When we started out
The beat of the drum
A face in the crowd
It's better this way
It's better this way
How far we've come now
Not a soul can change
Remember the road
Running under our feet?
We'd shoot for the stars
But we'd aim at the trees
It's better this way
It's better this way
Gambling with life
It was our turn to play
It's time
Only when you look forward
Can you see behind

Every trial
And every test
We'd drive to the east
And we'd fly to the west
Just running away
Just running away
We can't be different
'Cause they're all the same
Every night
That we'd ever start
And every beat
Of every heart
Is running away
Just running away
Catching our breath
At the end we could say
It's time
Only when you look forward
Can you see behind
Every taste we could get
Was just sweet sublime
Holding onto the moment
We let go of life
We bought the ticket
So we'll take the ride
Day after day in the light
We're glowing in the dark
Standing was the sketch
Where falling was an art
We lost ourselves to find
That somewhere down the line
It's time
Day after day in the light
We're glowing in the dark
Standing was the sketch
Where falling was an art
We lost ourselves to find
That somewhere down the line
It's time
For some it's a god
For me it's a fact
We'd make a mistake
And try to take 'em all back
It's better this way
It's better this way
Out of the grind
And then into the grave
It's time
Only when you look forward
Can you see behind
Every taste we could get
Was just sweet sublime
Holding onto the moment
We let go of life
We bought the ticket
So we'll take the ride
We bought the ticket
You took the pictures but you left the frames
Something that i had to do
You're every single shade of blue
I'm staring right in front of you
I can hear your heartbeat slowing down
I can hear your heartbeat turn me around
You can take my life
I can't sleep with your heartbeat slowing down
Here you left scattered
Like wishes i led to your room
I bury my face in your pillow
Just to smell your perfume
Outside i'm hungry
But inside i'm just consumed
Tell me how am i supposed to breathe
When losing you is choking me?

Say them on another day
Fragile words like these will cut your tongue
But nobody's gonna try for you
Nobody's gonna do like I for you

And those dresses you made look like gowns

And nobody's going to try for you
And nobody's going to lie for you

For my talents are renowned far and wide (Wide)
When it comes to surprises in the moonlit night
I excel without ever even trying
With the slightest little effort of my ghost like charms
I have seen grown men give out a shriek
With the wave of my hand  and a well-placed moan
I have swept the very bravest off their feet
Yet year after year  it's the same routine
And I grow so weary of the sound of screams
Have grown so tired of the same old thing
Oh  somewhere deep inside of these bones
An emptiness began to grow
There's something out there  far from my home
A longing that I've never known
I'm a master of fright  and a demon of light (A demon of light)
And I'll scare you right out of your pants
To a guy in Kentucky  I'm Mister Unlucky
And I'm known throughout England and France (We'll see)
And since I am dead  I can take off my head
To recite Shakespearean quotations
No animal nor man can scream like I can
With the fury of my recitations

But who here would ever understand
That the Pumpkin King with the skeleton grin
Would tire of his crown  if they only understood
He'd give it all up if he only could
Oh  there's an empty place in my bones
That calls out for something unknown
The fame and praise come year after year
We'd steal ourselves away and hold on tight
We'd get so high  we got lost coming down
When we were kids in the street  kids in the street
When we were kids in the street  just kids in the street
Remember when we
We used to laugh  we used to cry
Live and die by the forty-five
Take me back  I'll go there
Who could stop us  and who would care?
Always keep  to the kids in the street
We were dreams  we were american graffiti scenes
And the songs  with the words we'd sing wrong
Yeah we'd drive until that jealous sun fell down
Just to wash ourselves in the moonlight summer sounds
When we were kids in the street  kids in the street
When we were kids in the street  just kids in the street

Who could stop us  and who would care?
Always keep  to the kids in the street
Just (you and I)
Candles burn  cause the world will always turn
And I'll burn both ends until my fire's out
Lost in the darkness  I can still scream out (aaah)
We used to laugh  we used to cry
Say goodbye to i-35
Take me back  down a dirty road
Where it went  we didn't care to know
A glory night is a story saved
Mark the chapter  but turn the page
Always keep  to kids in the street
When we were kids in the street
Just kids in the street

That is weighing you down
Think I'm holding you back
Because I’m always here
Like a fool with a crown
And we were under attack
And you were running scared
You need me just to keep on
It's me versus the world  and I
I don't need a reason to

Because me and mine  and she and I
Have got a pretty big house
Up in the sky  oh
Versus the world and I
And I'm doing just fine
When all I wanted was a fair shake baby  now
All I needed was the lion’s share  hear me roar
'Cause it's a jungle out there
See  they got tigers and bears
My God is calling
She said  Run 'cause the sky is falling
Me myself and I
We’re all gonna do just fine
Eatin' my piece of pie up in the sky
You ought to give it a try
So say goodbye to that Peter Pan
He's all grown up now  he's a man
Maybe one day you'll understand
He had to leave never-ever-never-neverland
It's me versus the world  and I

If we can burn a city
In futures and in past

You can sit beside me when the world comes down
We don't need our bags and we can just leave town
You can sit beside me when the world comes down
What can we do better?

Time goes by  secrets rise
One more  sad song  tears shed  she's gone

And all the perfect words they seem so wrong

What can I do  I cannot breathe
My heart is torn  for all to see

Someone worth walkin' on when you ask me to go
