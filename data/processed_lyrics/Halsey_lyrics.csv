lyrics
"He said one day I'd realize why I don't have any friends
Why I find myself alone at night unless I'm having sex
But he can make me golden if I just showed some respect
But I don't let him touch me anymore
I said  I'm not something to butter up and taste when you get bored
'Cause I have spent too many nights on dirty bathroom floors
To find some peace and quiet right behind a wooden door
He said  Please don't go away
He said  Please don't go away
I said  It's too late
I said  It's too late
He said  Please don't go away
He said  Please don't go away
I said  It's too late
I said  It's too late
And now I can't stop thinking that I can't stop thinking
That I almost gave you everything
And now the whole thing's finished and I can't stop wishing
That I never gave you anything

You wrote a hundred letters just for me
And I find them in my closet in the pockets of my jeans
Now I'm constantly reminded of the time I was nineteen
Every single one's forgotten in a laundromat machine
But I don't let him touch me anymore
I said  I'm not something to butter up and taste when you get bored
'Cause I have spent too many nights on dirty bathroom floors
To find some peace and quiet right behind a wooden door
He said  Please don't go away
He said  Please don't go away
I said  It's too late
I said  It's too late
He said  Please don't go away
He said  Please don't go away
I said  It's too late
I said  It's too late
And now I can't stop thinking that I can't stop thinking
That I almost gave you everything
And now the whole thing's finished and I can't stop wishing
That I never gave you anything
And I can't stop thinking that I can't stop thinking
That I almost gave you everything (I said  It's too late)
And now the whole thing's finished and I can't stop wishing
That I never gave you anything
He said  Please don't go away
He said  Please don't go away
I said  It's too late
I said  It's too late
He said  Please don't go away
He said  Please don't go away
I said  It's too late
And I've misplaced all my credit cards
My self-preservation and all of my reservations
Are sittin' and contemplating what to do with me  do with me
Think I took it way too far
And I'm stumblin' drunk  getting in a car
My insecurities are hurtin' me
Someone please come and flirt with me
I really need a mirror that'll come along and tell me that I'm fine
I do it every time
I keep on hanging on the line  ignoring every warning sign
Come on and make me feel alright again
'Cause it's 3 AM
And I'm callin' everybody that I know
And here we go again
While I'm runnin' through the numbers in my phone
And yeah  I'll take fake moans and dial tones
Let 'em spill right down the microphone
I end up alone  end up alone

I end up alone  end up alone
And every night  I wanna live in color through a white-blue screen
I got a technicolor vision going vivid in my white-blue jeans
I know it's complicated
'Cause everyone that I've dated says they hate it
'Cause they don't know what to do with me  do with me
Know that my identity's always getting the best of me
I'm the worst of my enemies
And I don't really know what to do with me
Yeah  I don't really know what to do with me
I keep on hanging on the line  ignoring every warning sign
Come on and make me feel alright again
'Cause it's 3 AM
And I'm callin' everybody that I know
And here we go again
While I'm runnin' through the numbers in my phone
And yeah  I'll take fake moans and dial tones
Let 'em spill right down the microphone
I end up alone  end up alone
I end up alone  end up alone
I'm reckless  treat it like a necklace
Take a different version and I try it on for size with everybody that I know
And will you please pick up the fucking phone?
'Cause it's 3 AM
And I'm callin' everybody that I know
And here we go again
While I'm runnin' through the numbers in my phone
And yeah  I'll take fake moans and dial tones
Let 'em spill right down the microphone
I end up alone  end up alone
I end up alone
Your  your best song is a song that's currently on the radio
How many people can say that?
That their best song is the one that's currently about to be a massive hit?
It's already a hit  it's just gonna get more massive
How many people can say it? Not very many
 I'm being dead serious (I gotta see this birth certificate)
 you gotta promise us that you won't die
 I think that she lied
If I
So I fill it with strangers so they keep on the lights
She asked if I recognized her and I told her I might
I got a million different people tryna kick it
I know you're dying to meet me
But I can just tell you this
You'll wish that you never did
(You'll wish that you never did)
I stayed a night out in Paris where they don't know my name
And I got into some trouble with that drink in my veins
I got a problem with parties 'cause it's loud in my brain
And I can never say sorry 'cause I won't take the blame
I know I always go missing and you're lying awake

Slip under my armor
Slip under my armor
I got a million different people tryna hit it
But I'm still alone in my mind
I know you're dying to meet me
But I can just tell you this
You'll wish that you never did
(You'll wish that you never did)
You'll wish that you never did
(I know you wanna slip under my armor)
Broken bottles all around my feet
They came again in the night under crescent moon
Didn't wake me in my sleep
'Cause they talk and drink and laugh 'bout things
And fall in love in my backyard
I hide and cower in the corner
Conversation's getting hard
'Cause nobody seems to ask about me anymore
And nobody seems to care 'bout anything I think
And nobody seems to recognize me in the crowd
I'm standing in the ashes of who I used to be
I used to be a darling starlet like a centerpiece
Had the whole world wrapped around my ring
I flew too closely to the sun that's setting in the East
And now I'm melting from my wings

'Cause I'd laugh and drink and talk 'bout things

Now it´s my own anxiety
That makes the conversation hard
'Cause nobody seems to ask about me anymore
And nobody ever cares 'bout anything I think
And nobody seems to recognize me in the crowd
I'm standing in the ashes of who I used to be
And I can't remember why the decision wasn't mine
But it seems I'm only clingin' to an idea now
Took my heart and sold it out to a vision that I wrote myself
And I don't wanna be somebody in America just fighting the hysteria
I only wanna die some days
I'll leave you the dust  my love
Hope a bit of it'll be enough to help remember the
Days when we came to this place
I told you I'd spill my guts  I left you to clean it up
I'm bursting out of the
Seems like now it's impossible to work this out
I'm so committed to an old ghost town
Is it really that strange if I always wanna change?
And if only the time and space between us wasn't lonely
I'd disintegrate into a thousand pieces
Think I'm makin' a mistake  but if I decide to break
Who will fill the empty space? So...
Now  if I figure this out
Apart from my beating heart
It's a muscle  but it's still not strong enough to carry the
Weight of the choices I've made
I told you I'd ride this out
It's gettin' harder every day
Somehow  I'm burstin' out of myself

Too many guys think I'm a concept  or
I complete them  or I'm gonna make them alive
I'm just a fucked up girl who's lookin' for my own peace of mind
And he tastes like Jack when I'm kissin' him
So I told him that I never really liked his friends
Now he's gone and he's callin' me a bitch again
There's a guy that lives in the Garden State
And he told me that we'd make it 'til we graduate
So I told him that the music would be worth the wait
But he wants me in the kitchen with a dinner plate
Always make the same mistakes 'cause
I'm bad at love (Ooh-ooh)
But you can't blame me for tryin'
You know I'd be lyin' sayin'
You were the one (Ooh-ooh)
That could finally fix me
Lookin' at my history
I'm bad at love

Got a girl with California eyes
And I thought that she could really be the one this time
But I never got the chance to make her mine
Because she fell in love with little thin white lines

Both got way better things to do

Always make the same mistakes 'cause

All of this is temporary
Watch as I slip away for your sake
All of this is temporary
You won't even notice me depart
Secondhand thread in a secondhand bed
With a second man's head
Leavin' through the door without a word
It's not a happy ending
It's not a happy ending

I've been sеarching for a fortified defense
Four to five reasons
I don't really mean it 'cause who the fuck would choose this?

You said your mother only smiled on her TV show
You're only happy when your sorry head is filled with dope
I'll hope you make it to the day you're 28 years old
You're drippin' like a saturated sunrise
You're spilling like an overflowin' sink
You're ripped at every edge but you're a masterpiece
And now you're tearin' through the pages and the ink
Everything is blue
And now I'm covered in the colors
Pulled apart at the seams
And it's blue
And it's blue
Everything is gray

He don't know what it means

I found him in a lover
When his hair falls in his face
And his hands so cold they shake
I found the devil
I found him in a lover
And his lips like tangerines
In his color-coded speak
Now we're lost somewhere in outer space
In a hotel room where demons play
They run around beneath our feet
We roll around beneath these sheets
I'm such a fool for sacrifice
I've got a lover and I'm unforgiven
I'm such a fool to pay this price

Now we're lost somewhere in outer space

They run around beneath our feet
We roll around beneath these sheets
I'm such a fool for sacrifice
I've got a lover and I'm unforgiven
I'm such a fool to pay this price
Every single night pray the sun will rise
Every single time make a compromise

Every single night pray the sun will rise
Every single time make a compromise
A chest filled with diamonds and gold
And I tried to hold these secrets inside me
My mind's like a deadly disease
I'm bigger than my body
I'm colder than this home
I'm meaner than my demons
I'm bigger than these bones
I can't help this awful energy
Who is in control?

 bouncing off the exit signs I missed
 I was just wondering if you wanna like… never mind. Thank you. Bye...

 would it really kill you if we kissed?
And you make me more and more a villain every day
It's in your image I'm made
One eye open and one eye closed
'Cause I'll hang myself if you give me rope
I lost all my faith and lost all hope
That everything means anything at all
One eye broken and one eye bruised

Sour apple baby  but you taste so sweet

Your voice is velvet through a telephone
You can come to mine  but both my roommates are home
Think I know a bar where they would leave us alone
And I wonder if you'd take it slow
Oh  we're dancin' in my living room  and up come my fists
And I say I'm only playing  but the truth is this
That I've never seen a mouth that I would kill to kiss
And I'm terrified  but I can't resist

Used to think that loving meant a painful chase
But you're right here now and I think you'll stay

And I cursed the ground for growing green
I spent a long time substituting honest with sarcastic
And I cursed my tongue for being mean
Motionless and absolute
Now fifty thousand war cadets
Would cower at this small brunette
Who'd reach and grab the moon if I
Should ask or just imply
That I wanted a bit more light
So I could look inside his eyes
And get the colors just right
'Cause I could never hold a perfect thing and not demolish it
What am I thinking? What does this mean?
How could somebody ever love me?
Been in pain like me?
Bought a hundred dollar bottle of champagne like me?
Just to pour that motherfucker down the drain like me?
Would you use your water bill to dry the stain like me?
Are you high enough without the Mary Jane like me?
Do you tear yourself apart to entertain like me?
Do the people whisper 'bout you on the train like me?
Saying that I shouldn't waste your pretty face like me?
And all the people say
I think there's a flaw in my code
These voices won't leave me alone
Well my heart is gold and my hands are cold
Are you deranged like me?
Are you strange like me?
Lighting matches just to swallow up the flame like me?
Do you call yourself a fucking hurricane like me?
Pointing fingers 'cause you'll never take the blame like me?

Let that sink in
You can think again

Where a boy lives behind bricks
He's got an eye for girls of eighteen
And he turns them out like tricks
I went down to a place in Bed Stuy
A little liquor on my lips
I let him climb inside my body
And held him captive in my kiss
And there's a storm you're starting now
And there's a storm you're starting now

Keep your heart 'cause I already—
Every day  I got a smile where my frown goes
A couple bodies in the garden where the grass grows
I take 'em with me to the grave in a suitcase
Maybe I could be a different human in a new place
Oh
I just wanna feel somethin'  tell me where to go
'Cause everybody knows somethin' I don't wanna know
So I stay right here 'cause I'm bеtter all alone
Yeah  I'm bеtter all alone

And I promised myself I wouldn’t let you complete me
Is there somewhere you can meet me?
'Cause I clutched your arms like stairway railings
And you clutched my brain and eased my ailing
Your girl's got red in her cheeks
'Cause we're something she can't see
And I try to refrain but you're stuck in my brain

Big brain like I'm teachin' it a lesson
You got me thinkin' that I was too mean
Tuck a knife with my heart up my sleeve
And change like a season  reason for nothin'
I am disruptive  I've been corrupted
And by now  I don't need a fuckin' introduction
I been gone 'cause I been on this road too long
You know I get too caught up in a moment
I can't call it love if I show it
I just fuck things up if you noticed

I get too caught up in a moment
I can't fall in love if I show it

'Cause you'd let anybody with a body control you
And you know it too
You got me feelin' like I been too mean
And everything that I say  I believe
Tuck a knife with my heart up my sleeve
And fuck like a demon  do it like nothin'

Finding God  and lose Him too
Wanna scream  but what's the use?
Lyin' awake  and I stare at the door
I just can't take it no more
They told me it's useless  there's no hope in store

I stole a bit of my mother's perfume?
'Cause I remember when my father put his fist through the wall
That separated the dining room
And I remember the fear in your eyes
The very first time we snuck into the city pool
And the clouds of my breath
Didn't know where we were running to
But don't look back
'Til our wide eyes burn blind
We'll be lacing the same shoes that we've worn through
To the bottom of the line
And we know that we're headstrong
And our heart's gone
And the timing's never right
But for now let's get away
On a Roman holiday
Could you imagine the taste of your lips if we never tried to kiss on the drive to Queens?
'Cause I imagine the weight of your ribs if you lied between my hips in the backseat
I imagine the tears in your eyes
The very first night I'll sleep without you
And when it happens I'll be miles away
And a few months late
Didn't know where I was running to
But I won't look back

Don't realize how mean I can be
'Cause I can sometimes treat the people
That I love like jewelry
'Cause I can change my mind each day
I didn't mean to try you on
But I still know your birthday
And your mother's favorite song
So I'm sorry to my unknown lover
Sorry that I can't believe
That anybody ever really
Starts to fall in love with me
Sorry to my unknown lover
Sorry I could be so blind
Didn't mean to leave you
And all of the things that we had behind
Ooh ooh oooh
I run away when things are good
And never really understood
The way you laid your eyes on me
In ways that no one ever could
And so it seems I broke your heart
My ignorance has struck again

I can't decide
If I love you more in morning

With its luminous lux tides
Maybe in the daylight
All its pretty madness
And the complicated status
'Cause the moon don't pick sides
And the sun won't resign
Until you're by my side
Because the longing leads to leaving
And the loving leads to bleeding
And your beauty is a blessing
And I never got to tell you how
I lovе the way my eyes makе yours look green too

That you crawled inside my head
And set a fire there instead?
Letting all my insecurity
Devour me with certainty
That love is just a currency
Take my life and take my soul
Wrap me in a wedding ring
You know I swear I'd give you anything
And I think we could live forever
In each other's faces 'cause I'll
Always see my youth in you
And if we don't live forever

'Cause you can't love nothing unless there's something in it for you
And I had no warning about who you are

Wish I could see what it's like to be the blood in my veins
Do the insides of all of my fingers still look the same?
And can you feel it too when I am touchin' you?
And when my hair stands on ends  it's saluting you
The blush in your cheeks says that you bleed like me

She's on the tip of my tongue  she's on the top of my thighs
And if I searched a thousand miles  I'd be dyin' to find
Between my fingers  she leaves  then she lingers
If she's gonna go  well  then I'm goin' with her

Lookin' for honey
 I'm killing boys
 they come and they go
 and I wanna help you
 have you ever keyed a Ferrari before?
 I don't anymore
 I won't take it
 woah
 woah
 the only fuckin' numbers you don't hide in your phone
 'cause I don't wanna Uma Thurman your ass
 I won't take it
 woah
 woah"
