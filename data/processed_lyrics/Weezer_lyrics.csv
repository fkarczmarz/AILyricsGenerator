"You know where this is heading  uh-huh
Just a couple lovebirds
Happy to be singing  uh-huh
Girl  we got a good thing
And I don't see this ending
Do you want to fly? Do you want to flee?
Do you want to get away with me?
Do you want to face the great unknown?
Jingle  jingle
We're as happy as a couple Hare Krishnas
We'll crush the scene together
Marching onward
Oblivious to all the hate around us
We can self-publish a book of our philosophy
And hand it to the tourists
Girl  we got a good thing
You know where this is heading  uh-huh
Just a couple lovebirds
Happy to be singing  uh-huh
Girl  we got a good thing
And I don't see this ending
Do you want to fly? Do you want to flee?
Do you want to get away with me?
Do you want to face the great unknown?

Puerto Rico
Would be perfect for a destination wedding
Or driving to Ventura on the 101
It sounds like fun  to me
You scare me like an open window
Let's chalk it up to Stockholm syndrome
I want to crawl in  crawl into a hole
Girl  we got a good thing
You know where this is heading  uh-huh
Just a couple lovebirds
Happy to be singing  uh-huh
Girl  we got a good thing
And I don't see this ending
Do you want to fly? Do you want to flee?
Do you want to get away with me?
Do you want to face the great unknown?

Your Slayer T-shirt fit the scene just right
Through smeared mascara
I looked into your eyes and saw a light
You told me stories about your chickadees
They didn’t like BB guns or stupid archery
You charmed the lifeguard
He let them use the pool all day for free
I was next to you and you were right there next to me
(I want you to) I want you to (I want you to)
So make the move (make the move)
Cause I ain’t got all night
The rest of the summer was the best we’ve ever had
We watched Titanic and it didn’t make us sad
I took you to Best Buy
You took me home to meet your mom and dad
Your dad was silent
His eyes were fixed to what was on TV

So much pain may come our way

You heard me on the radio about one year ago and you wanted to know
All about me and my hobbies
My favorite food and my birthday
Why are you so far away from me?
I need help and you're way across the sea
They don't make stationery like this where I'm from
So I sniff (So I sniff)
And I lick (And I lick)
Your envelope and fall to little pieces every time (Your envelope and fall to)
I wonder what clothes you wear to school
I wonder how you decorate your room
I wonder how you touch yourself and curse myself for being across the sea
Why are you so far away from me?
I need help and you're way across the sea

I thought the older women would like me if I did
I gotta live on an island to find the juice
So you send (So you send)
Me your love (Me your love)
From all around the world (From all around the world)
As if I could live on
Words and dreams and a million screams
Why are you so far away from me?
Why are you so far away from me?
But she hears only whispers of some quiet conversation
The moonlit wings reflect the stars that guide me towards salvation
I stopped an old man along the way
Hoping to find some old forgotten words or ancient melodies
He turned to me as if to say
It's gonna take a lot to drag me away from you
There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do
I bless the rains down in Africa
Gonna take some time to do the things we never have
The wild dogs cry out in the night
As they grow restless longing for some solitary company
I know that I must do what's right
As sure as Kilimanjaro rises like Olympus above the Serengeti
I seek to cure what's deep inside
Frightened of this thing that I've become
It's gonna take a lot to drag me away from you
There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do

All my favorite people make me mad
All my favorite songs are slow and sad
Then I feel bad when I stay home
'Cause I need a friend when I take a walk
I like spacin' out when somebody talks
I fall in love with everyone who hates me
All my favorite songs are slow and sad
All my favorite songs are slow and sad
Dreamy morning
Walkin' alone by myself
Thinkin' about life
And tryin' to find my way through hell
Sometimes I wish
I was on an island
But then I'd miss
The sound of sirens

Look at all those movie stars

With my mama's mason jar
Caught a lovely butterfly
When I woke up today
Looked in on my fairy pet
She had withered all away
No more sighing in her breast
I'm sorry for what I did
I did what my body told me to
I didn't mean to do you harm
Every time I pin down what I think I want  it slips away
The ghost slips away
Smell you on my hand for days
I can't wash away your scent
If I'm a dog  then you're a bitch
I guess you're as real as me
Maybe I can live with that
Maybe I need fantasy
Life of chasing butterfly

And stay for the rest of our lives

Just for holding your chopsticks wrong

And Uncle Sam dropped an atom bomb
And just weep on my breast
And cover me with your tenderness

That I remember
Sometimes I wanna go back to school
An East Coast college with some history
In the simple things
Longtime sunshine

With a woodstove or a fireplace
And in the middle of the living room
An old piano
Sometimes it don't seem so bad
To settle down with a good woman
And leave this lonely life behind
Forever and ever
Longtime sunshine
Longtime sunshine upon me

Longtime (time) sunshine upon me

Santa Monica and 7th Street
The salesman tried to get my attention
To sell me a Mexican Fender
Hang out with her boyfriend
But I was only trying to get to know her
So I took her out to the ocean
But she only went in up to her knees
She didn't want to take off her jeans
'Cause that would be insane
She got a bachelor's degree in physics
And a job in computer programming
That's pretty cool for a singer in a band
So I knew we would end up jamming
Later that night we went to her gig
And she asked for some advice
What do you do with your hands when you're singing
Do you just hold onto the mic?

And the trash overflowed out on the street
The heartbreak DJ stepped to me
But I just couldn't get enough
Gonna fly so high
To a place that we have never seen
Ever since you came 'round
I got a cozy pad around the corner
Slide a little closer
Thanks for all you've shown us  but this is how we feel
Come sit next to me  pour yourself some tea
Just like Grandma made when we couldn't find sleep
Things were better then  once but never again
We've all left the den  let me tell you about it
The choo-choo train left right on time
A ticket costs only your mind
Of course we were willing to pay
My name is Wepeel  got a box full of your toys
Tell me what to do  now the tank is dry
Now this wheel is flat  and you know what else?
Guess what I received in the mail today
Words of deep concern from my little brother
The building's not goin' as he planned
The foreman has injured his hand
The dozer will not clear a path
The driver swears he learned his math

With which she blabbers a lot
She laughs at most everything
Whether it's funny or not
I want a girl who will laugh for no one else
I want a girl who laughs for no one else
My girl's got eyeballs
In the back of her head
She looks around and around
I want a girl who will laugh for no one else

She's all I've got
And I don't wanna be alone
My girl don't see me
When she's with my friends
She's all I've got
And I don't wanna be alone
I can't have any other one
All of the drugs she does
Scare me real good
She's got a tattoo and two pet snakes
Nobody knows me like her
Nobody knows her like me
We're all we've got
And we don't wanna be alone

She is your marrow  and your ride home
You can't avoid her  she's in the air (In the air)
In between molecules of oxygen and carbon dioxide
Only in dreams  we see what it means
Reach out our hands  hold onto hers
But when we wake  it's all been erased
And so it seems  only in dreams
You walk up to her  ask her to dance
You say  It's a good thing that you float in the air (In the air)
That way  there's no way I will crush your pretty toenails into a thousand pieces
Only in dreams  we see what it means
Reach out our hands  hold onto hers
But when we wake  it's all been erased
And so it seems  only in dreams

Why am I so obviously insane?
In a perfect situation
I let love down the drain
All I have to do is swing and I'm a hero
But I'm a zero
Now it's getting unbelievable
'Cause I could not have it better
But I just can't get no play
From the girls all around
As they search the night for someone to hold onto
I just pass through
Get your hands off the girl
Can't you see that she belongs to me?
And I don't appreciate this
Excess company
Though I can't satisfy
All the needs she has and so she starts to wander
Can you blame her?
Tell me there's a logic out there
Leading me to better prepare
For the day that something really special might come
Tell me there's some hope for me
I don't wanna be lonely
I start to look around for love
See a sweet in floral print
My mind begins the arrangements
But when I start to feel that pull
Turns out I just pulled myself
She would never go with me
Were I the last girl on Earth
I thought I had found the one
We were good as married in my mind
But married in my mind's no good
Might have smoked a few in my time
But never thought it was a crime
Knew the day would surely come
When I'd chill and settle down
When I think I've found a good old-fashioned girl
Then she put me in my place
Everyone's a little queer

Let me know the truth
Working out at the gym to fit my underwear
Oakley makes the shades that transform a tool
You'd hate for the kids to think that you lost your cool
I'ma do the things that I wanna do
I ain't got a thing to prove to you
I'll eat my candy with the pork and beans

Somebody's cold one
Is giving me chills
Guess I'll just close my eyes

Dear daddy  I write you
In spite of years of silence
You've cleaned up  found Jesus

Awakens ancient feelin's
Like father  stepfather
The son is drowning in the flood
Say it ain't so
Your drug is a heartbreaker
Say it ain't so
 but I ain't got no fear
 so that I'll go real fast
 because it's really a blast

Hair is making a cannoli for you to
Take on your hiking trip in the woods with your
Bros that you've known since second grade and you
May encounter dragons or ruffians and be
Called upon to employ your testosterone
In a battle for supremacy and access to
Females glued to the TV
And even if you are victorious you may receive
And you will require band aids and antiseptic ointments
And tender loving kisses on your stab wounds
And when you come home she will be there
Waiting for you with a fire in her eyes
And a big fat cannoli to shove

I'm so glad I got a girl to think of
Even though she isn't mine
I think about her all the day and all the night
It's enough to know that she's alive
In real life would 'cause the illusion to shatter
I carved her name into all the trees
Sang a song down on one knee
Looking at the underwear page of the Sears catalog
Like when I was 14
I'm levitating like a magnet turned
The wrong way around
I'm like an Indian Fakir tryna meditate on a
Bed of nails with my pants pulled down
Thank God for girls

God took a rib from Adam
Ground it up in a centrifuge machine
Mixed it with cardamom and cloves
Microwaved it on the popcorn setting
(Going off into the tundra)
So pissed at God
Messing with the bees who were trying
I'ma smite you with loneliness
And break your heart in two!
And Adam wept and wailed
Tearing out his hair
I'm looking for you every way
No sign of you when I wake up
I'm on an island with no sun
I feel like I've known you my whole life
You got me cryin' like when Aslan died
Now you're gone
The melody can't find you
I'm incomplete without you
I guess we've reached the end of the game
Ooh  hit me
I know that you would crank this song
Air-guitaring with your headphones on
We dig the same type of melodies
The ones to get you next to me
I was Mick and you were Marianne (Marianne)
You would harmonize when I felt bad (I felt bad)

Tell me  who's that funky dude
Staring back at me?
Broken  beaten down  can't even get around
Without an old man cane  I fall and hit the ground
Shivering in the cold  I'm bitter and alone (Woo)
Excuse the bitching
I shouldn't complain
I should have no feeling
'Cause feeling is pain
As everything I need is denied me
And everything I want is taken away from me
But who do I got to blame? Nobody but me
