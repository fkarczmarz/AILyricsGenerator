lyrics
"All is calm  all is bright
Round yon Virgin  Mother and Child
Holy Infant so tender and mild
Sleep in heavenly peace
Sleep in heavenly peace
Silent night  holy night
All is calm  all is bright
Round yon Virgin  Mother and Child
Holy Infant so tender and mild
Sleep in heavenly peace
Sleep in heavenly peace
Your revolution is a deathbed and the music is your maid
When someone comes a-knockin' with a needle on a tray
Only your lonesome lies beside you for you told me not to stay
You are somebody's baby  some mother held you near
There is no distraction that can make me disappear
No  there's nothin' that won't remind you I will always be right here
I'm amazed that you're alright
I won't be home with you tonight
We're both very sick  our muscles all worn down
It's as if we are one hundred  know I won't still be around
Long before I reach one hundred  I'll have fallen to the ground
Or much less than ever was before  the Chelsea and the floor
Make us stand before the masses like two speakers for the poor
When there was no revolution  nothin' we were fighting for
You might also like
I'm amazed that you're alright
I won't be home  I won't be home
I won't be home with you tonight
And you can call the service bell
When we stay at the Chelsea Hotel
And I'll stay out of my own hell
I won't be home  I won't be home
I won't be home with you tonight
Pretending to be myself
Why would somebody do this on purpose
When they could do something else?
Drowning out the morning birds
With the same three songs over and over
Hum along 'til the feeling's gone forever
Took a tour to see the stars
But they weren't out tonight
So I wished hard on a Chinese satellite
I want to believe
You know I hate to be alone
I want to be wrong
You were screamin' at the Evangelicals
They were screamin' right back from what I remember
But you know I'd stand on the corner
Embarrassed with a picket sign
If it meant I would see you when I die
You might also like
It's just a matter of time before I'm hearing things
Swore I could feel you through the walls
But that's impossible
I want to believe (I want to believe)
Coming to take me to where I'm from
Full of good food and lousy beer
This winter's so dry and the dirt road so dusty
You don't have to be alone to be lonesome
It's easy to forget
The sadness comes crashin' like a brick through the window
Tethered to a table
With that happy holiday crowd
But the merest hint of waves could capsize you
You don't have to be alone to be lonesome
It's so easy to forget
The sadness comes crashin' like a brick through the window
The desire for annihilation
Is as common as it is unkind
And it's hard to recognize the situation
When you're desperately tryin' to have a good time
You might also like
You don't have to be alone to be lonesome
It's so easy to forget
The sadness comes crashin' like a brick through the window
 together we drowned
And I miss you all so much here
I can't wait to see you all
And I'm counting the days here
I still believe that there's gold
At the end of the world
And I'll come home to Illinois
On the day after tomorrow
And it's so hard and it's cold here
And I'm tired of taking orders
And I miss old Rockford town
Up by the Wisconsin border
Shoveling snow and raking leaves
And my plane will touch down
On the day after tomorrow
I close my eyes every night
And I dream that I can hold you
They fill us full of lies everyone buys
About what it means to be a soldier
You might also like
I still don't know how I'm supposed to feel
About all the blood that's been spilled
Will God on his throne get me back home
On the day after tomorrow?
Don't want to die any more than we do
To the same God that we do?
Tell me how does God choose
Whose prayers does he refuse?
Who turns the wheel? Who throws the dice
On the day after tomorrow?
I am not fighting for justice
I am not fighting for freedom
I am fighting for my life
And another day in the world here
I just do what I've been told
We're just the gravel on the road
And only the lucky ones come home
On the day after tomorrow
And I know we too are made
Of all the things that we have lost here
I'll be twenty-one today
I been saving all my pay
And my plane will touch down
On the day after tomorrow
(Ooh)
I can't sleep and I miss your face
In my hands and in my knees
Tell me what you wanna do to me
I don't wanna be alone
Don't wanna be alone anymore
(Ooh)
(Ooh)
It got quiet on the other line
Laughed until I couldn't breathe
Now I'm too tired to go to sleep
Now I can't breathe and I can't sleep

Sunday always comes too late
Dressed up to the eyes
It's such a wonderful surprise
To see your shoes and your spirits rise
As sleek as a shriek spinnin' 'round and 'round
To see you eat in the middle of the night
I don't care if Monday's blue
Tuesday's gray and Wednesday too
For a kid a year older than me
And I have this dream where I'm screamin' underwater
While my friends are all waving from the shore
And I don't need you to tell me what that means
I don't believe in that stuff anymore
And that's just how I feel
Always have and I always will
I always have and always will
I have a friend I call
When I've bored myself to tears
And we talk until we think we might just kill ourselves
But then we laugh until it disappears
And I woke up in my childhood bed
When I remembered someone's kid is dead

And that's just how I feel
Always have and I always will
I always have and always will
And it's 4AM again
And I'm doing nothing
In your house up on the hill
And when your skinhead neighbor goes missing
I'll plant a garden in the yard  then
They're gluing roses on a flatbed
You should see it  I mean thousands
I grew up here 'til it all went up in flames
Except the notches in the door frame
I don't know when you got taller
See our reflection in the water
Off a bridge at the Huntington
I hopped the fence when I was seventeen
Then I knew what I wanted
And when I grow up  I'm gonna look up
From my phone and see my life
And it's gonna be just like my recurring dream
I'm at the movies  I don't remember what I'm seeing
The screen turns into a tidal wave
Then it's a dorm room  like a hedge maze
And when I find you
You touch my leg and I insist
But I wake up before we do it

I don't know how  but I'm taller
It must be something in the water
Everything's growing in our garden
You don't have to know that it's haunted
The doctor put her hands over my liver
She told me my resentment's getting smaller
No  I'm not afraid of hard work
I get everything I want
They found her in a small grove of trees
Lonesome was the place where Georgia was found
She's too young to be out on the street
Why wasn't God watching?
Why wasn't God listening?
Why wasn't God there for Georgia Lee?
Ida said she couldn't keep Georgia from dropping out of school
I was doing the best that I could
But she just kept runnin' away from this world
These children are so hard to raise good
Why wasn't God watching?
Why wasn't God listening?
Why wasn't God there for Georgia Lee?
Close your eyes and count to ten
I will go and hide but then be sure to find me
We'll play all over
We'll play all over again

Wild flowers on a cross by the road
And somewhere a baby is crying for her mom
As the hills turn from green back to gold
Why wasn't God watching?

Why wasn't God there for Georgia Lee?
Why wasn't God watching?
Why wasn't God listening?
And when he gets older  he might be the one (Oh)
He might be the one
Georgia  Georgia  he has beautiful bones
And he never lies or picks up his phone
And sometimes in the pouring rain
He'll fall in the mud and get back up again
And if you find me  will you know me?
Will you take me or will you fall? (Fall)
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Here is my day plan  here's my new machine
He's a fine new addition  so young and so clean
So young and so clean
He came up through the water without a sound
With my back to the shoreline  I dreamt that he drowned
I dreamt that he drowned (Oh)

And sometimes  when he looks at me
I know he needs you  you're all that he sees
And if I breathe you  will it kill me?
Will you have me or watch me fall? (Fall)
If I fix you  will you hate me?
And would you fuck this and let us fall? (Fall  fall)
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
No one ever cared if I should live or die
Time and time again the chance for love has passed me by
And all I know of love is how to live without it
I just can't seem to find it
So I've made my mind up
I must live my life alone
And though it's not the easy way
I guess I've always known
I'd say goodbye to love
There are no tomorrows for this heart of mine
Surely time will lose these bitter memories
And I'll find that therе is someone to beliеve in
And to live for something I could live for
All the years of useless search
Have finally reached an end
Loneliness and empty days will be my only friend
From this day love is forgotten
I'll go on as best I can

What lies in the future
Is a mystery to us all
No one can predict the wheel of fortune as it falls
There may come a time when I will see that I've been wrong
But for now this is my song
And it's goodbye to love
She made up her mind and laced up her shoes
So she walked outside without an excuse
She can do anything she wants to
She can do whatever she wants to do
Turns up the music so thoughts don't intrude
Predictably winds up thinking of Elvis
And wonders if he believed songs could come true
I'm asking for it if they do
Doesn't know what she wants or what she's gonna do
A rebel without a clue
So we spent what was left of our serotonin
To chew on our cheeks and stare at the moon
Said she knows she lived through it to get to this moment
Ate a sleeve of saltines on my floor and I knew then

I will do anything you want me to

Whatever she wants (Whatever you want)
The sirens go all night
I used to joke that if they woke you up
Somebody better be dying
Sick of the questions I keep asking you
That make you live in the past
But I can count on you to tell me the truth
When you've been drinking and you're wearing a mask
And we can be anything
We can be anything
Always surprised by what I do for love
Some things I never expect
They killed a fan down by the stadium
And we can be anything
We can be anything
There's a last time for everything
We can be anything

Let your heart be light
Will be out of sight
Have yourself a merry little Christmas
Make the Yuletide gay
Will be miles away
Once again as in olden days
Happy golden days of yore
Faithful friends who were dear to us
Will be near to us once more
If the fates allow
Man  I hate this part of Texas
Close my eyes  fantasize
Three clicks and I'm home
When I get back  I'll lay around
Then I'll get up and lay back down
Romanticize a quiet life
There's no place like my room
Like a wave that crashed and melted on the shore
Not even the burnouts are out here anymore
Out in the park  we watch the sunset
Talkin' on a rusty swing set
After a while  you went quiet
And I got mean
I'm always pushin' you away from me
But you come back with gravity
And when I call  you come home
A bird in your teeth
You might also like
When the sirens sound  you'll hide under the floor
But I'm not gonna go down with my hometown in a tornado
Drivin' out into the sun
Let the ultraviolet cover me up
Went looking for a creation myth
Ended up with a pair of cracked lips
Windows down  scream along
To some America First rap-country song
A slaughterhouse  an outlet mall
Slot machines  fear of God
Windows down  heater on
Big bolt of lightning hanging low
Over the coast  everyone's convinced
It's a government drone or an alien spaceship
Either way  we're not alone
I'll find a new place to be from
A haunted house with a picket fence
To float around and ghost my friends
No  I'm not afraid to disappear
The billboard said The End Is Near
I turned around  there was nothing there
Yeah  I guess the end is here
The end is here
The end is here
The end is here
I'm tired of trying to get in the house
I'm thinking out loud
I've been playing dead
My whole life
And I get this feeling whenever I feel good
It'll be the last time
But I feel something when I see you now
I feel something when I see you
If you're a work of art
I'm standing too close
I can see the brush strokes
I hate your mom
I hate it when she opens her mouth
It's amazing to me how much you can say
When you don't know what you're talking about
But I feel something when I see you now
I feel something when I see you

I used to light you up
Now I can't even get you to play the drums
'Cause I don't know what I want
Until I fuck it up
But I feel something when I see you now

I'll climb through the window again
Then I'll leave it wide open
 I know
 we'll be fine
 I know
 we'll be fine
She had eyes so blue they looked like weather
There were times apart and times together
I was pledged to her for worse or better
It'll all work out eventually
Better off with him than here with me
The water's rising in the levee
Scared you in your house
Even scared myself by talking
About Dahmer on your couch
But I can't sleep next to a body
Even harmless in death
Plus I'm pretty sure I'd miss you
Faking sleep to count your breath
Can the killer in me
Tame the fire in you?
Is there nothing left to do for us?
I am sick of the chase
But I'm hungry for blood
And there's nothing I can do
But when I'm sick and tired
When my mind is barely there
When a machine keeps me alive
And I'm losing all my hair
You might also like
I hope you kiss my rotten head
And pull the plug
Know that I've burned every playlist
And given all my love
Can the killer in me
Tame the fire in you?
I know there's something waiting for us
I am sick of the chase
But I'm stupid in love
And there's nothing I can do
And there's nothing I can do
Nothing ever comes like it did when you were in it
Just a pain-in-the-ass Johnny Cash middle finger
Nothing ever comes like it did when you were in it
Keeping nothing for yourself like a stone cold killer
Now you're passing your people like a ship in the night
Looking to every stranger for a fight
Relying on the kindness of strangers that you will be forgiven
Open up your mouth
Open up your mouth if you want it
I scared you in your house
I even scared myself by talkin'
About Dahmer on your couch
But I can't sleep next to a body
Even harmless in death
And faking sleep to count your breath
Can the killer in me
Tame the fire in you?
Or is there nothin' left to do for us?
I am sick of the chase
But I'm hungry for blood
And there's nothin' I can do
But when I'm sick and tired
And when my mind is barely there
When a machine keeps me alive
And I'm losin' all my hair
I hope you kiss my rotten head

Got bored at the temple
Looked around at the 7-Eleven
The band took the speed train
Went to the arcade
You called me from a payphone
They still got payphones
It cost a dollar a minute
To tell me you're getting sober
And you wrote me a letter
But I don't have to read it
I'm gonna kill you
If you don't beat me to it
Dreaming through Tokyo skies
I wanted to see the world
Then I flew over the ocean
And I changеd my mind
Sunset's been a freak show
I've been driving out to the suburbs
To park at the Goodwill
And stare at the chem trails
With my little brother
He said you called on his birthday
You were off by like ten days
But you get a few points for tryin'
Remember getting the truck fixed
When you let us drive it
Twenty-five felt like flying
You might also like
I don't forgive you
But please don't hold me to it
Born under Scorpio skies
I wanted to see the world
Through your eyes and then it happened
Then I changed my mind
I guess I lied
I'm a liar
Who lies
Looked around at the 7-11
The band took the speed train  went to the arcade
I wanted to go  but I didn't
It cost a dollar a minute
To tell me you're sober and you wrote me a letter
But I don't have to read it
I'm gonna kill you
If you don't beat me to it
Dreaming through Tokyo skies
I wanted to see the world
'Til I flew over the ocean
And I changed my mind
Sunset's been a freak-show on the weekеnd
So I've been driving out to the suburbs
To park at the Goodwill and starе at the chem-trails
With my little brother
He said you called on his birthday
But you get a few points for trying
Remember getting the truck fixed when you let us drive it

Who lies
But I had to carry you
And you pushed me in
And now my feet can't touch the bottom of you
Stuck your tongue down the throat of somebody
Who loves you more
So I will wait for the next time you want me
Like a dog with a bird at your door
Mmm
We hate Tears in Heaven
But it's sad that his baby died
And we fought about John Lennon
Until I cried
And then went to bed upset
And I've never seen you smiling so big

And if I could give you the moon

You are sick and you're married and you might be dying
But you're holding me like water in your hands
And I miss you like a little kid
I can hardly feel anything
I hardly feel anything at all
You gave me fifteen hundred
To see your hypnotherapist
Fell on hard times a year ago
Was hopin' you would let it go and you did
I have emotional motion sickness
Somebody roll the windows down
There are no words in the English language
I could scream to drown you out
I'm on the outside looking through
You're throwing rocks around your room
And while you're bleeding on your back in the glass
I'll be glad that I made it out
And sorry that it all went down like it did
I have emotional motion sickness
Somebody roll the windows down
There are no words in the English language
I could scream to drown you out
I guess it's too late to change it now
You know I'm never gonna let you have it

Forever trusting who we are
Like the sound of a distant gun
Over all the damage I have done
And the shadows filling up this land
Are the ones I built with my own hand
There is no comfort from the cold
Of this valley of sorrow in my soul
There's a river of darkness in my blood
And through every vein I feel the flood
I can find no bridge for me to cross
No way to bring back what is lost
Into the night it soon will sweep
Down where all my grievances I keep
But it won't wash away the years
Or one single hard and bitter tear
And the rock of ages I have known
Is a weariness down in the bone
I used to ride it like a rolling stone
Now I just carry it alone
There's a highway risin' from my dreams
Deep in the heart I know it gleams
For I have seen it stretching wide
Clear across to the other side
You might also likeBeyond the river and the flood
And the valley where for so long I've stood

And walk right by
The house where you lived with Snow White
I wonder if she ever thought
The storybook tiles on the roof were too much
If your favorite thing's Dianetics or stucco
The drugstores are open all night
The only real reason I moved to the east side
I love a good place to hide in plain sight
What if I told you
I feel like I know you?
But we never met
Hear so many stories of you at the bar
But never not sweet to the trust funds and punishers

'Cause even if I could
Wouldn't know where to start
Edward's house and rock 'n roll
Walkin' home was easier with you  ooh
Let me speak  I'm losin' steam
Listen to The Second Gleam
And you're more than I can take
Can't you see I'm fallin' through?
The way your muscles move  drivin' in your car
You're a flashin' light on my radar
Jump the garden wall tonight  run until you're outta sight
Each morning I get dressed for you
Heart-sick feeling right on cue
You've got me like a walk in the park  whoa
Take my hands as they shake
Why can't you hear me callin' you?
The way your veins pop out  playin' your guitar
You're a flashin' light on my radar

Sweating through the sheets
You're gonna drown in your sleep for sure
Wake up and start a big fire
In our one room apartment
But I'm too tired
To have a pissing contest
All the bad dreams that you hide
Call me when you land

Spending money and I earned it
When I'm lonely  that's when I'll burn it
Do you feel ashamed
When you hear my name?
I asked you  How is your sister?
I heard she got her degree
And I said  That makes me feel old
You said  What does that make me?

Said  It's too much shit to carry

We spent a week in the cold
Just long enough to Walden it with you
Singin' Ace of Spades when Lemmy died
I'm sleepin' in my bed again and gettin' in my head
Burning trash out on the beach
One of your eyes is always half-shut
Somethin' happened when you were a kid
I didn't know you then and I'll never understand
Why it feels like I did
How Soon Is Now in an 80s sedan
You slept inside of it because your dad
Lived in a campground in the back of a van
You said that song will creep you out until you're dead
And you must've been looking for me
Burning trash out on the beach

I wanna live at the Holiday Inn
Where somebody else makes the bed
We'll watch TV while the lights on the street
Put all the stars to death
It's been on my mind since Bowie died
Just checkin' out to hide from life
When you threw all your clothes in the snow
When you burnt your hair and knocked over chairs
I just tried to stay out of your way
But when you fell asleep with blood on your teeth
I just got in my car and drove away
There's only so much wine
That you can drink in one life
And it will never be enough
To save you from the bottom of your glass
And I got out and stared up at the stars

There's only so much wine
That you can drink in one life
And it will never be enough
I feel it when I wake up
And it just stays bad
It hits me like a sickness
Or a steamroller
Makes me wanna lay down
And get run over
But then I see you
Always smiling
Makes me wanna touch you
Keep from dying
You're a brother to me
You're my partner in crime
You're the feeling I get
When I'm feeling fine
Part of me wants you
But most of me needs you
So I won't fall unless you ask me to
We talk for hours
Until finally
Sleep takes over
The amphetamine
In the darkness
I feel your fingers
They don't touch me
But there's a danger

 I missed your birthday yesterday  I'm sorry

 but I can see it snowing
 the windows are wide open
 I can see that you can't win for tryin'
 you don't have to be alone

 seven more to go
 a mass shooting at the mall
 going for a drive
 fully out of your mind
 hating what you find
 what can you say?

I'm on my toes
At the edge of the world
And my mind feels like an empty room
The inside black as coal
And it hurts to want something so bad
That you lose all self control
And I know
How you are sometimes
And I know
You're just a little turned around
And my body is getting tired
But there's no point leaving before the game
When my mind feels so wired
No one else could understand
You know I'm lost but I'll be fine
And you know
How I am sometimes
And you know
I'm just a little turned around

It's so hard to watch it burn
Burn
Take it over and over till you noticed me
If you were a waiting room. I would never see a doctor
I would sit there with my first-aid kit and bleed
I wanna be the power ballad that lifts you up and holds you down
I wanna be the broken love song that feeds your misery
And I can wish all that I want  but it won't bring us together
Plus I know whatever happens to me  I know it's for the better
When broken bodies are washed ashore
But you're brеathing in my open mouth
You're the gun in my lips that will blow my brains out
I wanna makе you drive all night just because I said  maybe you should come over
I wanna make you fall in love as hard as my poor parents teenage daughter
She'll be the best you ever had if you let her
I know it's for the better
Know it's for the better

Have another drink to cloud my mind and my judgment
I don't wanna go out unless I found a pick-me-up
I was playing this bar a couple times a month
Now these bands just keep gettin' younger
Like I was before time slipped through my fingers
Now I'm wasted  wastin' all of my breath
Wasted again
Standin' in a parking lot in the glow of a Rite-Aid sign
Everyone I know is staying in tonight
I've been here before  just screamin' at a cell phone
Seems like a couple of months went by  but it's years ago
I used to be reckless  throw it all on black
Hoping I'd find better days  but now I'm back
With none of that
Now I'm wasted  wastin' all of my breath
Wasted again

Playing down at the Silver Lake Lounge
I made that joke 10 years ago  now it's goin' down
Goin' down  yeah it's goin' down
Goin' down  yeah it's goin' down
I'm wasted  wastin' all of my breath
Wasted
Wasted  wastin' all I had left
Wasted  oh no

When it comes to fire
You always say that you'd prefer to drown
You were still in the ambulance
When the cop suggested you're the one
Who tried to burn it down
Come to find out
We found our way out
Of the suicide pact of our family and friends
We have the same face
I laid awake as someone shoved you up against a wall
Quarantined in a bad dream
He's half the man and you're twice as tall
Come to find out
We found our way out
Of the suicide pact of our family and friends

Drinking coke and whiskey in her bra and underwear
Saw him in the kitchen  hangin' up the phone
I asked him nicely once to pack his things and go
He gave her a reassuring look  said he wouldn't leave
But I asked him one more time  this time pulled out my sheath
Stuck him in the back and I pulled it out slow
And I watched him fall down and as the morning sun rose
He looked at me  he said
You missed my heart  you missed my heart
You got me good  I knew you would
But you missed my heart  you missed my heart
Were his last words before he died
Lookin' out the window  up at the blue sky
Listening to her scream  listening to her cry
A feelin' of relief came over my soul
I couldn't take it any longer and I lost control
I chased her up the stairs and I pinned her to the ground
And underneath her whimpering  I could hear the sirens sound
I rattled off a list of all the things I miss
Like going to the movies with her and the way she kissed me
Drivin' into downtown Wheeling  showin' her off
Backyard barbecues and reunions in the park
I said I missed her skin when she started laughin'
But there's one thing you missed
You might also like
You missed my heart  you missed my heart
That's quite a list  but what you really missed
You missed my heart  you missed my heart (You missed my heart)
That's quite a list  but what you really missed
Runnin' through the parking lot  runnin' through the fields
Policemen on my back  somethin' hit my skull and cracked
They dragged me off to jail  set a million dollar bail
Where I tried to tie a noose  but I failed and I broke loose
I went racing through the prison yard  shot down by a tower guard
He got me in the shins and he got me in the arms
They strapped me in the gurney  took me off to the infirmary
Where the priest read my last rites
And just before everythin' went dark  I said
He missed my heart  he missed my heart (You missed my heart)
He got me good  I knew he would
But he missed my heart  he missed my heart (You missed my heart)
And just before everything went dark
The most poetic dream came flowin' like the sea
Laying there  my lifeblood draining out of me
A childhood scene  the night sky and moon beams
Fishin' with my friends  sittin' in the wild reeds
Watching the Ohio river flow at night
Waitin' for the bullheaded catfishes to bite

In your house up on the hill
And when your skinhead neighbor goes missing
I'll plant a garden in the yard  then
They're gluing roses on a flatbed
You should see it  I mean thousands
I grew up here  'til it all went up in flames
Except the notches in the door frame
I don't know when you got taller
See our reflection in the water
Off a bridge at the Huntington
I hopped the fence when I was seventeen
Then I knew what I wanted
And when I grow up  I'm gonna look up
From my phone and see my life
And it's gonna be just like my recurring dream
I'm at the movies  I don't remember what I'm seeing
The screen turns into a tidal wave
Then it's a dorm room  like a hedge maze
And when I find you
You touch my leg  and I insist
But I wake up before we do it

I don't know how  but I'm taller
Must be something in this water

The doctor put her hands over my liver
She told me my resentment's getting smaller
Yeah  she said I'm getting stronger
I get everything I want
 not being broke again
 nothing makes me cry
 but I'll try again
 now I'm talking to my house plants"
