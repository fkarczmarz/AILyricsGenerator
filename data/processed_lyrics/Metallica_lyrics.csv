lyrics
"Power wolves beset your door  hear them stalking
Soon you'll please their appetite  they devour
Hammer of justice crushes you  overpower
The ultimate in vanity
Exploiting their supremacy
I can't believe the things you say
I can't believe  I can't believe the price
You pay
Nothing can save you
Pulling your strings  justice is done
Seeking no truth  winning is all
Apathy their stepping stone  so unfeeling
Hidden deep animosity  so deceiving
Through your eyes their light burns  hoping to find
Inquisition sinking you with prying minds

Lady justice has been raped  truth assassin
Rolls of red tape seal your lips  now you're done in
Their money tips her scales again  make your deal
Just what is truth? I cannot tell  cannot feel
The ultimate in vanity
Exploiting their supremacy
I can't believe the things you say
I can't believe  I can't believe the price
We pay
Nothing can save us
Pulling your strings  justice is done
Seeking no truth  winning is all

Thankless little bitch  for the tears I cried
Take her down now  don't want to see her face
All blistered and burnt  can't hide my disgrace
Twenty-seven  everyone was nice
Got to see them  make them pay the price
See their bodies out on the ice
Take my time
Am I evil? Yes  I am
As I watched my mother die  I lost my head
Revenge now I sought  to break with my bread
Taking no chances  you come with me
I'll split you to the bone  help set you free

Believer  deceiver
Pushed onto me what's wrong or right
Hidden from this thing that they call life
Dear mother  dear father

Curator  dictator
Always censoring my every move
Children are seen but are not heard
Tear out everything inspired
Innocence  torn from me without your shelter
Barred reality  I'm living blindly

Your silence for your confidence
Do you hear what I hear? Doors are slamming shut
Do you feel what I feel? Bittering distress
Who decides what you express?
Do you take what I take? Endurance is the word
Moving back instead of forward seems to me absurd
Doesn't matter what you see
Or into it what you read
You can do it your own way
If it's done just how I say
Independence limited
Freedom of speech is words that they will bend
Freedom with their exception
Do you fear what I fear? Living properly
Truths to you are lies to me
Do you choose what I choose? More alternatives
Energy derives from both the plus and negative
Do you need what I need? Boundaries overthrown

Drifting further every day
Getting lost within myself
Nothing matters  no one else
I have lost the will to live
Simply nothing more to give
There is nothing more for me
Need the end to set me free
Things not what they used to be
Missing one inside of me
Deathly lost  this can't be real
Cannot stand this hell I feel
Emptiness is filling me
To the point of agony
Growing darkness taking dawn
I was me  but now he's gone
No one but me can save myself  but it's too late
Now I can't think  think why I should even try
Yesterday seems as though it never existed
Death greets me warm  now I will just say goodbye
(Goodbye)
As they've done to you
But what the hell is
This world coming to?
Blow the universe
Into nothingness
Nuclear warfare
Shall lay us to rest
Fight fire with fire

Son  your life's an open book

We're scanning the scene in the city tonight
We're looking for you to start up the fight
There's an evil feeling in our brains
Say goodbye to the world you live in
You've always been taking and now you're giving

Our brains are on fire with the feeling to kill
And it won't go away until our dreams are fulfilled
There is only one thing on our minds
Come unto me and dedicate
Come unto me and terminate
Bleeding through your fragile skin
Remove your thought 'cause it's only for deceiving
Deceiving thoughts destroy within
Disappear like man was never here
Long live machine
The future supreme
Man overthrown
Spit out the bone
Plug into me and dedicate
Plug into me and I'll save you from emotion
Plug into me and terminate
Finally cure the Earth of man
Set on course a master plan

Better just stay down
Mouth so full of lies
