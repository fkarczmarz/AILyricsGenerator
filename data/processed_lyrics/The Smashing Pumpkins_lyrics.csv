lyrics
"Cool kids never have the time
On a live wire right up off the street
You and I should meet
Junebug skippin' like a stone
With the headlights pointed at the dawn
We were sure we'd never see an end to it all
And I don't even care
To shake these zipper blues
And we don't know
Just where our bones will rest
To dust I guess
Forgotten and absorbed into the earth
Below
Double-cross the vacant and the bored
They're not sure just what we have in store
That we don't even care
As restless as we are
We feel the pull
In the land of a thousand guilts
And poured cement
You might also like
Lamented and assured
To the lights and towns below
Faster than the speed of sound
Faster than we thought we'd go
Beneath the sound of hope
Justine never knew the rules
Hung down with the freaks and ghouls
No apologies ever need be made
That we don't even care
To shake these zipper blues
And we don't know
Just where our bones will rest
To dust I guess
Forgotten and absorbed into the earth
Below
The street heats the urgency of now
You’ll always be my whore
You’ll be the mother to my child
And a child to my heart
We must never be apart
We must never be apart
And I’ll pull your crooked teeth
You’ll be a lover in my bed
And a gun to my head
We must never be apart
We must never be apart
Dressing coffins for the souls I've left to die
Drinking mercury to the mystery
Of all that you should ever leave behind
In time
You might also like
We must never be apart
Drinking mercury
To the mystery of all that you should ever seek to find
Dressing coffins for the souls I’ve left behind
In time
We must never be apart
And you’ll always be my whore
'Cause you’re the one that I adore
And I’ll pull your crooked teeth
Of a simple life of need
Come into my life forever
The crumbled cities stand as known
Of the sights you have been shown
Of the hurt you call your own
Love is suicide
Love is suicide
Love is suicide
Love is suicide
The empty bodies stand at rest
Casualties of their own flesh
Afflicted by their dispossession
But no bodies ever knew
No bodies
No bodies felt like you
No bodies
You might also like
Love is suicide
Love is suicide
Love is suicide
Love is
Now we drive the night
To the ironies of peace
You can't help deny forever
The tragedies reside in you
The secret sights hide in you
The lonely nights divide you in two
All my blisters now revealed
In the darkness of my dreams
In the spaces in between us
No bodies ever knew
No bodies
And no bodies felt like you
No bodies
No bodies ever knew
No bodies
No bodies felt like you
No bodies
Love is suicide
Love is suicide
Love is suicide
Sent to drain
Secret destroyers
Hold you up to the flames
And what do I get
For my pain?
Betrayed desires
And a piece of the game
Even though I know
I suppose I'll show
All my cool and cold
Like ol' Job
Now I'm naked
Nothing but an animal
But can you fake it
For just one more show?
And what do you want?
I wanna change
And what do you got!
When you feel the same?
You might also like
Even though I know
I suppose I'll show
All my cool and cold
Like ol' Job
Tell me I'm the only one
Tell me there's no other one
Tell me I'm the chosen one
Tell me I'm the only one
Tell me there's no other one
And I still believe that I cannot be saved
And I still believe that I cannot be saved
And I still believe that I cannot be saved
And promise to be your one and only
I'll make you feel happy
And leave you to be lost in mine
And are you just like me?
Just to belong
By starlight I know you
As lovely as a wish granted true
My life has been empty
My life has been untrue

And does she really know who I really am?
And does she really know me at last?
And are you just like me?

And are you just like me?

Doesn't matter what you believe in
Stay cool
And be somebody's fool this year
'Cause they know
So I'm told
Who wants honey?
As long as there's some money
Who wants that honey?
Hipsters unite
Come align for the big fight to rock (For you)
But beware
All those angels with their wings glued on
'Cause deep down
They are frightened and they're scared
If you don't stare
Who wants honey?
As long as there's some money
Who wants that honey?

Let me out
Tell me all of your secrets
Cannot help but believe this is true
Tell me all of your secrets
Should have listened when I was told
Who wants that honey?
As long as there's some money
Who wants that honey?
Let me out
To cast divine arrows into her soul
To grab her attention swift and quick
Or morrow the marrow of her bones be thick
With turpentine kisses and mistaken blows
See the Devil may do as the Devil may care
He loves none sweeter as sweeter the dare
Her mouth the mischief he doth seek
Her heart the captive of which he speaks
So note all ye lovers in love with the sound
Your world be shattered with nary a note
Of one Cupid's arrow under your coat
And in the land of the star-crossed lovers
And barren-hearted wanderers
Forever lost in forsaken missives and Satan's pull
Our hopes dead gathering dust to dust
And cut you like you want me to
Cut that little child
Inside of me and such a part of you
I used to be a little boy
So old in my shoes
And what I choose is my choice
What's a boy supposed to do?
I send this smile over to you
Disarm you with a smile
And leave you like they left me here
To wither in denial
The bitterness of one who's left alone
I used to be a little boy
So old in my shoes
And what I choose is my voice
What's a boy supposed to do?
I send this smile over to you

I can still hear you when you drown
You've traveled very far
Just to see you I'll come around
When I'm down
All of those yesterdays
Coming down
No matter where you are
I can still hear you when you dream
You traveled very far
And you are
All of those yesterdays
Coming down
Is it something someone said?
Was it something someone said?

Yesterday the sky was you
And I still feel the same
Nothing left for me to do

Is it any wonder I can't sleep?
All I have is all you gave to me
Is it any wonder I found peace through you?
Turn to the gates of heaven  to myself be damned
Turn away from light
It's not enough  just a touch
It's not enough
I taste  I love
I come  I bleed enough
I hate  I'm not
I was  I want too much
Is it any wonder I can't sleep?
All I have is all you gave to me
Is it any wonder I found peace through you?
Turn to the gates of heaven  to myself be damned
Turn away from light
It's not enough  just a touch
It's not enough  just a touch
It's not enough  just a touch
It's not enough  just a touch
It's not enough  just a touch
Sleep tight  may it hold you through the winter of a
Long night  and keep you from the loneliness
Of yourself
Heart strung  is your heart frayed and empty 'cause it's
Unsung  and I say
Goodnight  my love
To every hour in every day
Goodnight  always
To all that's pure that's in your heart
Goodnight  may your dreams be so happy and your
Head light with wishes of a Sandman and a
Night light  be careful not to let the bedbugs
Sleep tight nestled in the covers
The sun shines  but I don't
A silver rain will wash away
The sun shines  but I don't
A silver rain will wash away

I disconnect the act  I disconnect the dots
I disconnect the me in me
And you're mistaken  it's you that's fakin'
Livin' breathin'  dyin' too
This message is for anyone who dares to hear
A fool
You can't bring me back  you can't bring me back
'Cause I give it all back to you
Wreak their havoc upon this world
The disenchanted  the romantics
The body and face and soul of you is gone
Down that deep black hole  oh
Destroy the mind  destroy the body
But you cannot destroy the heart
Destroy the mind  destroy the body
But you cannot destroy the heart

And you
You make me so I need to disconnect
And you make it so real
I don't need your love to disconnect
To runaround kids in get-go cars
With Vaseline afterbirths and neon coughs
Galaxies full of nobodies
Givin' us the farewell runarounds
And I took a Virgin Mary axe to his sweet baby Jane
Lost my innocence to a no-good girl
Scratch my face with anvil hands
And coil my tongue around a bumblebee mouth
And I give it all back to you
I give it all back to you  yeah
I give it all back to you
And for you
No way  I don't need it
I don't need your love to disconnect
And you make it so real
I don't need your love to disconnect
No way  no way
And you make it so real
I don't need your love to disconnect
No way  no way
How we pretend we're still a child
Softly stolen
Under our blanket skies
And rescue me from me
And all that I believe
I won't deny the pain
I won't deny the change
Will you leave me too?
Carve out your heart
For keeps in an old oak tree
And hold me for goodbyes
And whispered lullabyes
And tell me I am still
The man I'm supposed to be

We're born as innocents
Cast into the world with apple eyes
To wish  wish dangerous
My dear delirious
To try and leave the rest of us behind
Shot full of diamonds
And a million years
The disappointed disappear
Like they were never here
Oh
Kiss  kiss all of this
The hiss that we had missed
And understand what can't be understood
Sear those thoughts of me
Alone and unhappy
I never liked me anyway
If by chance
Or circumstance
We should fail
Don't be so sad

Shot full of diamonds
And a million years
The disappointed disappear
Like they were never here
In a dream we are connected
Siamese twins  at the wrist
And then I knew we'd been forsaken
Expelled from paradise
I can't believe them
When they say that it's alright
Words can't define what I feel inside
Who needs them?
Caught with this virus of my mind
I give in to my disease  of my needs
To my disease  of my needs
Yeah!
She really loves to break
Her dad says it's okay
She really loves to break
And give it all away
Her ma says she's afraid
What more can she fake?
She really needs to break
And give herself away
She gave it all away
She gave it all away
She gave it all away
The endless drags of a death rock boy
Mascara sure and lipstick lost
Glitter burned by restless thoughts
Of bein' forgotten
And in your sad machines
You'll forever stay
Desperate and displeased
With whoever you are
And you're a star
Somewhere
He pulls his hair down over a frowning smile
A hidden diamond you cannot find
A secret star that cannot shine
Over to you
May the king of gloom
Be forever doomed
And in your sad machines
You'll forever stay
Burnin' up in speed
Lost inside the dreams
Of teen machines

The lonely towers of long mistakes
To forgotten faces and faded loves
Sittin' still was never enough
And if you're givin' in
Then you're givin' up
'Cause in your sad machines
You'll forever stay
Burnin' up in speed
Lost inside the dreams
The ways of sin
I chased the charmed
But I don't want them anymore
Take me away from you
And shame my tongue
Fat with promise all along
When I woke up from that sleep
I was happier than I’d ever been
When you decide
That your life is a prize
Renew and revive
Happiness will make you wonder
Will I feel okay?
Away

Love is real?
Peace will not come to this lonely heart
There are some things I'll live without
But I want you to know that I need you right now
I need you tonight
I steal a kiss from her sleepin' shadow moves
'Cause I'll always miss her wherever she goes
And I'll always need her more than she
But sometimes a someone is so hard to find
And I'll do anything to keep her here tonight
And I'll say anything to make her feel alright
And I'll be anything to keep her here tonight
I need you tonight
She comes to me like an angel out of time
As I play the part of a saint on my knees

Nothing but memories
Of what never was
We're nowhere to be
We're nowhere to see

Down in the belly of the beast
I can't lie

I can hardly wait 'til I see her
Silly  I know I'm silly
'Cause I'm hangin' in this tree
In the hopes that she will catch a glimpse of me
And through her window shade
I watch her shadow move
I wonder if she...
Lily  my one and only
Love is in my heart and in your eyes
Will she or won't she want him
(Well) No one knows for sure
But an officer is knockin' at my door
And through her window shade
I watch her shadow move
I wonder if she could only see me
And when I'm with her I feel fine
If I could kiss her I wouldn't mind the time it took to find my

Oh Lily  I know you love me
'Cause as they're draggin' me away
I swear I saw her raise her hand and wave
To my mistakes of cowardice
She shimmy shakes
The jimmy jakes of consequence
Born of the airs and dues
My airs of madness do declare
It's what you wanted to see
It's who you wanted to be
For what you needed to need
She'll make it up
Machine gun blues
Her vacant rush is so steel
I'm unaware
Lost inside your visions
I got mine too over now
I got mine and I got you

Can I feel in to you as you felt in to me
Do you sing your babies?
What sunshine do you bring?
Who belongs?
Who decides who's crazy?
Who rights wrongs where others cling?
I'll sing for you
If you want me to
I'll give to you
And it's a chance I'll have to take
And it's a chance I'll have to break
I go along
Just because I'm lazy
I go along to be with you
And those moonsongs
That you sing your babies
Will be the songs to see you through
I'll hear your song
If you want me to

Cool enough to not quite see it
Doomed
And run away with me tomorrow
June
We'll try and ease the pain
Where our secrets go
I send a heart to all my dearies
Dream
I'm rumored to the straight and narrow
While the harlots of my perils
Scream
And I fail

All our time can't be given
Back
Shut my mouth and strike the demons
That cursed you and your reasons
Out of hand and out of season
Out of love and out of feeling
So bad
Words defy the plans
Fool enough to almost be it
And cool enough to not quite see it
And old enough to always feel this
No longer will I follow
Can anybody hear me?
I just want to be me
Try to understand
Just like everyone
To lie here and die among the sorrows
Adrift among the days
For everything I ever said
And everything I've ever done is gone
And dead
As all things must surely have to end
And great loves will one day have to part
I know that I am meant for this world
My life has been extraordinary
Blessed and cursed and won
Time heals but I'm forever broken
By and by the way
Have you ever heard the words
I'm singin' in these songs?
It's for the girl I've loved all along
Can a taste of love be so wrong?
As all things must surely have to end
And great loves will one day have to part
I know that I am meant for this world

And in my mind as I was floating
Far above the clouds
Some children laughed I'd fall for certain
For thinkin' that I'd live forever
But I knew exactly where I was
And I knew the meaning of it all
And I knew the distance to the sun
And I knew the echo that is love
And I knew the secrets in your spires
And I knew the emptiness of youth
And I knew the solitude of heart
And I knew the murmurs of the soul
And the world is drawn into your hands
And the world is etched upon your heart
And I knew the silence of the world
And I knew the silence of the world
And I knew the silence of the world
And I knew the silence of the world
Perfect
I know we're just like old friends
We just can't pretend
That lovers make amends
We are reasons so unreal
We can't help but feel
That something has been lost
Perfect
Perfect
Perfect strangers down the line
Lovers out of time
Memories unwind

We'll always be good friends
The letters have been sent on
Perfect
Perfect strangers when we meet
Strangers on the street
Lovers while we sleep
We always were so free
We promised that we'd be
Perfect
Perfect
The realm of soft delusions  floatin' on the leaves
On a distant shoreline she waves her arms to me
As all the thought police are closin' in for sleep
The dilly dally of my bright-lit stay
The steam of my misfortunes has given me the power to be afraid
And in my mind I'm everyone
And in my mind
Without a care in this whole world
Without a care in this whole world
Without a care in this life
It's what you take that makes it right
Porcelina of the oceans blue (Porcelina)
Porcelina  Porcelina
In the slipstream of thoughtless thoughts
The light of all that's good  the light of all that's true
To the fringes gladly I walk unadorned
With gods and their creations  with filth and disease
Porcelina  she waits for me there
With seashell hissing lullabyes and whispers fathomed deep inside my own

I am sleeping

Helpless

Boys to the bone

Cover up everything you know

Trees and balloons
Ice cream snow

And on and on
I torch my soul to show
The world that I am pure
Deep inside my heart
No more lies
A crown of thorns

A mark of scorn to you
Consume my love  devour my hate
Only powers my escape

When God sleeps in bliss

Taste me

Taste my need
Spinning 'round my head

Watch me
Death defy
Defile my life
I don't need

That's when a lover breaks
I wanna go home

He ends up just masturbating himself
And I end up feeling very alienated and unsatisfied
Meant to be
Immutable
Impossible
It’s destiny
Pure lunacy
Incalculable
Inseparable
But for the last time
You’re everything
That I want and asked for
You’re all that I dream
Who wouldn’t be the one you love?
Who wouldn’t stand inside your love?
Protected and the lover of
A pure soul
And beautiful

Don’t understand
Don’t feel me now

Traverse the skies

Who wouldn’t stand inside your love and die for?

No matter what you say he'll be back for more
Mommy's in the manger with the little kids
So fake it
And make you me
You might also like
Won't you take me down  to the underground
Why oh why  there is no light
And if I can't sleep  can you hold my life?
And all I see is you
And take my hand  I lost where I began
In my heart I know all of my faults  will you help me understand?
And I believe in you  you're the other half of me
I'll be there if you need me  whenever I hear you sing
There is a sun
It'll come  the sun
Hear them call me down
And you're all I see
And you're all I see  and you're all I'll need
The void that cries through you
Relive the pictures that have come to pass
For now we stand alone
The world is lost and blown
And we are flesh and blood disintegrate
With no more to hate
Is it bright where you are?
Have the people changed?
Does it make you happy you're so strange?
And in your darkest hour
I hold secrets flame
We can watch the world devoured in its pain
Delivered from the blast
The last of a line of lasts
The pale princess of a palace cracked
And now the kingdom comes
Crashing down undone
And I am a master of a nothing place
Of recoil and grace

Time has stopped before us
The sky cannot ignore us
No one can separate us
For we are all that is left
The echo bounces off me
The shadow lost beside me
There's no more need to pretend
Cause now I can begin again
Is it bright where you are?
Have the people changed?
Does it make you happy you're so strange?
And in your darkest hour
I hold secrets flame
We can watch the world devoured in its pain
Strange
Strange
The heavens spit me out
From ethers tragic I am born again
And now I'm with you now
Inside your world of woe
To move in desires made of deadly pretends
Until the end times begin
Is it bright where you are?
Have the people changed?
Does it make you happy you're so strange?
And in your darkest hour
I hold secrets' flame
You can watch the world devoured in its pain
Strange
Climb my ribcage to
The replays run for you
Unhook my lights to peek behind the flash
For I am crystal chrome
I am shatter dome
I am kremlin king of angels avenged
To destroy the end

The guns of love disastrous

 you know I’m not dead
 you know I’m not dead
 you know I’m not dead
 you know I’m not dead
Humor me before I have to go
As the cluttered streets greet me once again
I know I can't be late
Supper's waitin' on the table
Tomorrow's just an excuse away
The earth laughs beneath my heavy feet
At the blasphemy in my old jangly walk
Steeple guide me to my heart and home
The sun is out and up and down again
Graceful swans of never topple to the earth
Can make it last
Wrapped up in the pleasures of the world

I've journeyed here and there and back again
But in the same old haunts I still find my friends
Mysteries not ready to reveal
Sympathies I'm ready to return
Graceful swans of never topple to the earth
And drag me in with maybes
Your innocence is all I have
Breathin' underwater
And livin' under glass
And if you spin your love around
The secrets of your dreams
You may find your love is gone
And is not quite what it seemed
To appear to disappear
Beneath all your darkest fears
I believe in never
I believe in all the way
And faith can't help you to escape
And with this ring I wed thee true
And with this ring I wed thee now
And with this ring I play so dead
'Cause no one's askin' for the truth
So let me tell you

If you spin your love around
The secrets of your dreams
You may find your love is gone
And is not quite what it seemed
To appear to disappear
Beneath all your darkest fears
To the revelations of fresh-faced youth
No one will come to save you
So speak your peace in the murmurs drawn
But youth is wasted on the young
My love for you just can't explain why
Forever lost inside ourselves
The night has come to hold us young
The night has come to hold us young
The night has come to hold us young
The night has come to hold us young
The night has come to hold us young
I forget about where it all began
Bastard son of a bastard son of
A wild-eyed child of the sun
Holdin' back the fool again
Holdin' back the fool again
I sensed my loss
Before I even learned to talk
And I remember my birthdays
Empty party afternoons won't come back
Holding back the fool again
Holdin' back the fool again

I forget to forget me
Nothing is important to me

Before I even learned to speak
Holdin' back the fool again
Through blistered avalon
The sky’s cruel torch
On aching autobahn
Into the uncertain divine
We scream into the last divide
You make me real
You make me real
Strong as I feel
You make me real
Sheila rides on
Crashing nightingale
Intake eyes leave passing vapor trails
With blushing brilliance alive
Because it’s time to arrive
You make me real

Strong as I feel

Discard my friends to change the scenery
It meant the world to hold a bruising faith
A summer storm
Graces all of me
Highway warm
Sing silent poetry
And I could bring you the light
And take you home into the night

You make me real
Strong as I feel
Discard my friends to change the scenery
It meant the world to hold a bruising faith
Day I've ever known
Can't live for tomorrow
Tomorrow's much too long
I'll burn my eyes out
Before I get out
I wanted more
Than life could ever grant me
Bored by the chore
Of saving face
Today is the greatest
Day I've ever known
Can't wait for tomorrow
I might not have that long
I'll tear my heart out
Before I get out
Pink ribbon scars
That never forget
I tried so hard
To cleanse these regrets
My angel wings
Were bruised and restrained
My belly stings

You can never ever leave
Without leaving a piece of youth
And our lives are forever changed
We will never be the same
Tonight

And you know you're never sure
But you're sure you could be right
If you held yourself up to the light
And the embers never fade
In your city by the lake
The place where you were born

 to break my fall
 my sweet thing
 dark prince of death
 in a lover's breath
 in young need
 her black beauties roam
 so far from home
 a faded picture
 to ink the lavender skies
 get back where you belong
 get back where you belong
 get back where you belong
She couldn't run away 'cause she was crazy
She gave it all away  she saw her baby break
And in the air it hung that she was dull razors
And I said  I wanna fill you up
I wanna break you  I wanna give you up
From one another  another one should come
To one another  no one should come between us
My one and only knows that she could never hide
I couldn't feel her  and it was just a game
'Cause I was lonely and she was crazy
Rat-tat-tat  ka-boom-boom!
Now take that  and just a bit of this
'Cause I'm a watcher  and I'm a doer of none
Come to save you  'cause you're all mine

A rat-tat-tat  and some good ol' bliss
'Cause I'm a sister  and I'm a motherfuck
I am made of shamrocks
I am made of stern stuff
I am never enough
I am the forgotten child
And I said  I wanna fill you up
I wanna break you  I wanna give you up
From one another  no one should ever come
In between us  between us and our love
Mary had a little lamb
Her face was white as snow
And everywhere that Mary went
I was sure to go
Now Mary's got a problem  and Mary's not a stupid girl
And this is how
Mary's garden grows
And this is how
Mary has her ghosts
Now we begin descend to where we've never been
There is no goin' back  this wasn't meant to last
This is a hell on earth  we are meant to serve
And she will never learn  she will never learn!
Bye-bye!
Stop!
There's no connection to myself
I'm your lover  I'm your zero
I'm the face in your dreams of glass
So save your prayers
For when we're really gonna need 'em
Throw out your cares and fly
Wanna go for a ride?
She's the one for me
She's all I really need  oh yeah
She's the one for me
Emptiness is loneliness
And loneliness is cleanliness
And cleanliness is godliness
And God is empty just like me
Intoxicated with the madness
I'm in love with my sadness
Bullshit fakers  enchanted kingdoms
The fashion victims chew their charcoal teeth

You blame yourself for wanting more

She's the one for me"
