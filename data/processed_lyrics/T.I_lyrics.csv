" that’s right
 I race Porsches
 as fresh as Air Forces
 I'm doing 'bout a hundred but the track still bumping
 Straight Outta Compton
 buy an onion of good and throw the deuces
 I'll get the rest
 I want the best
 I'd rather flip my keys
 tryna get my cheese
 they know it's me
 it's T-I-P
 like a baby do a binky
 what the hell you niggas thinking?
 I got a strong mind
 fuck around with the clique
 nigga y'all soft
 I got the
 well who's strapped right now
 I'll lay you on your back right now
 get smacked right now
 that shit to me ain't nothing
 end up dead from the K
 paid heavy from the yay'
 I make 11 every day
Woah
To the max with it
Racks
I count six shots
Bustin' out the bando (Woo)
A nigga jewelry real metal like a can opener (Bling)
I went from rags to riches to a feature with Tip (Woo)
I went from Smart Card to a bitch with some smart lips (Skrrt)
And the F&N make my hip limp (Gah)
I'm goin' fishin' with these little bitty shrimp dimps (Woo)
And my bank roll got a big dip (Woo)
And she just wanna have a good day (What?)
Smoke way more weed than a guy in L.A (Damn)
Never let 'em fly away (What?)

Learned that from UGK back in Pocket Full of Stones

Buy a stolen car while he bang that AK
On your best behavior when addressin' me
But not interested in shit you say

All that flexin and that poppin you be doin' for them hoes

Bunch of bad bitches with him looking like Aaliyah
Buy the whole bar  pop bottles go hard

Okay it must be your ass cause it ain't your face

Okay now do you wanna kick it with a nigga with a meal ticket?
Broke niggas looking mad  they just gotta deal with it
Get right ho  roll the dice ho
And you ain't gotta be a dyke cause you like hoes
For every day I spent behind the wall

Ain't no problem  where you runnin' to?
We do it for the block  that's why ain't nobody stoppin' me
I do it for my pop and my cousins too  they watchin' me
I did it nonstop  now see how these niggas copy me

Or I did it cause I thought he was a Muslim
My message to America  felon or death here
The liquor we die  we just substances left here
First you put us in a small hood
And then you beat us and you treat us like it's all good
And then shoot us and you screw us economically  mentally
Bet I can make that ass think 'fore you shoot
You kill me  man there gon' be more of some riotin' and lootin'
We say black lives matter  you say all lives
But y'all ain't the ones gettin' hogtied
Hope you don't ever see your son in an institution

You doin' wrong just to run shit
One day the time gon' run out for the dumb shit
Ain't no deception  tryna get in Heaven

And what you really felt  he gon' deny the opportunity to unify

But it's so empty living behind these castle walls
These castle walls
If I should tumble if I should fall
Would anyone hear me screaming behind these castle walls
Observing the estate through the gate from the outside looking in
The belief is that I'm living out a millionaire's fantasy
With Phantoms and Ferraris in the driveway
Your vision jaded by the Grammys on the mantelpiece
Just switch your camera lenses you would see the agony
Encounters overshadows his extravagance
While it surely seem like King's life seem glamorous
As seen through the eyes of untrained amateurs
Because the camera doesn't see beyond the walls of the smiles
Only counts until it falls in the pile

These castle walls
If I should tumble if I should fall

If my kids never win at shit
Be more important to me than the persons I have raised
I guess I'm saying that to say that opportunity
But they just don't equate to all the time they take away
From the kids all the shit I did right is a mistake
If Deyjah end up a stripper and Major slinging yay
How could I ever consider myself a great
If Messiah ain't paid and Nique Nique ain't straight
So me being the G.O.A.T. shouldn't mean more to me
Than seeing to it King go
From a badass kid to a man with some dough
Otherwise I may as well have stayed poor
So while they stay focused on me beefin with Flip
Or if I'm fucking with a ho
Did I snitch when I got arrested or will I die over nonsense
Internally I'm dealing with this conflict
So excuse me if I don't get the chance to kiss the hand
If they saying I ain't the best at making hit records
It's cause this my life these ain't just rapping
See you can't see the castle through the walls till it falls
Cause see you can't see the castle through the walls till it falls
Everyone thinks that I have it all
But it's so empty living behind these castle walls
These castle walls
If I should tumble if I should fall
Would anyone hear me screaming behind these castle walls
Nobody knows I'm all alone
Living in this castle made of stone
And while I sit so high up on a throne
I wonder how I can feel this low
But there's no place to fall
My career was meant for me to come and tell it
Honest interpretation of how affected I'm faced with
Matters most rappers used to keep locked away in the basement
But the day that I walk away I ain't saying that I'm amazing
Downplaying the way I kept fellas from catching cases
Won't take into consideration how much it mean what I'm saying
And when I say what I mean even when I'm surrounded by the fakest
Who made his way amongst the greatest from the grimiest places
While all the critics was looking for Prince Charming
Disregarded the king of the south raised doubt
Even though he made a castle out of what used to be a house
He did shit that all your favorites rappers only rap about
But most of y'all don't see the castle through the walls
And the smiles till it falls in piles so while
Everyone thinks that I have it all
But it's so empty living behind these castle walls
These castle walls
If I should tumble if I should fall
Would anyone hear me screaming behind these castle walls
 I'm on the way
 I had to pick up the new car
 I'll be there in a minute
 you dressed
 blue bikinis
 blue bikinis
 that's her outfit
 they real high
 she still fly
 her shoes on
 her toes too
 bumpin' that old school
 I move so super fast
 I’m going super fast
 my windows black
 can they see her while she's layin' in her
 blue bikinis
 blue bikinis
 the night young
 the stars out
 it’s written all on her face
 I sure want a taste
 blue bikinis

 I just let her get it right on
 I just might buy her one

Ever had one of them days wish you woulda stayed home
Run into a group of niggas who gettin' they hate on?
You walk by  they get wrong
You reply  then shit get blown
Way outta proportion  way past discussion
Just you against them  pick one  then rush him
Figure you get jumped  hell  that's nothin'
They don't wanna stop there  now they bustin'
Now you gushin'  ambulance rushin' you
To the hospital with a bad concussion
Plus you hit four times  bullet hit yo' spine
Paralyzed waist-down  now you're wheelchair-bound
Never mind that now  you lucky to be alive
Just think  it all started  you fussin' with three guys
Now your pride in the way  but your pride is the way
You could fuck around  get shot  die any day
Niggas die everyday  all over bullshit
Dope money  dice game  ordinary hood shit
Could this be ‘cause of hip hop music?
Or did the ones with the good sense not use it?
Usually niggas don't know what to do when
Their back against the wall  so they just start shootin'
For red or for blue or for blow  I guess

Now think about  damn  what a life I had!
Most of that shit  look back  just laugh
Some shit  still look back  get sad

Had I not hit the nigga in the mouth that time
I won that fight  I lost that war
I can still see my nigga walkin' out that door
Who'da thought I'd never see Philant no more?
Got enough dead homies  I don't want no more
Cost a nigga his jaw  cost me more
I'da took that ass-whoopin' now for sure
Now  think before I risk my life
Take them chances to get my stripes
A nigga put his hands on me  alright
Otherwise  stand there  talk shit all night
'Cause I hit you  and you sue me

Mixed with Eric B. and Rakim  shawty hell on the scale

Do anything for 'em cause you truly do adore 'em
Like dedicate songs  write poems
But they be on that bullshit and you try to ignore 'em
But you feel like they feel like you ain’t right for 'em
Therefore your heart’s torn
Between bein' with 'em forever  leavin' 'em never
But it seem like you arguin'  fightin' over whatever
Maybe we can leave  find someone better
Even though you know you’ve never known none better
Been head over heels since the very day I met her
Fell so deep in love I ain’t been able to get up
Sometimes I want some peace of mind and she won’t shut up
Love her to death  don’t know whether to kiss her or kill her
Should’ve known it
From the start it was already over
We were just too dumb to notice
And we'd pray but
Even love couldn’t save us
We'd wake up
On a bed of guns and roses
And we don’t know which one to choose
When either way  we’re gonna lose
Still we'd pray but
Even love couldn’t save us
We'd wake up
On a bed of guns and roses

I guess I’d rather suffer with her than be miserable without her
I buy a lot of Prada  Gucci and Balenciaga
To keep her content  and keep down the nonsense
But every corner we turn around's a conflict
Mostly dumb shit  like who she run with
Where the fuck you been? Your pants – they don’t fit
No matter how much she try she can’t make it make more sense
Therefore  here we go again
Saying the kind of shit I be like if you was a man
But I love her so much that I can’t forget
That the feel of a kiss  it could heal when I’m sick
Still  I don’t like to feel like this
If I didn’t miss her  I would try to get her killed right quick
Should’ve known it
From the start it was already over
We were just too dumb to notice

When either way  we’re gonna lose
Still we'd pray but
Even love couldn’t save us
We'd wake up
On a bed of guns and roses
Every time we say our goodbyes
A little piece of my heart breaks off inside
I don’t really ever know why
If I could live without you I’d try
Should’ve known it
From the start it was already over
We were just too dumb to notice
And we'd pray but

This I know
For the Bible tells me so
It seems like satan want my soul and he refuse to share me

(Yeah) Yeah yo quiero grande mota
Okay (Huh?)
Cocaína? (Hell yeah)
Mucho (We want that)
Ahahahahaha
I'd like to dedicate this song to anybody who done ever lost somebody
To the grave  to the streets  to the jail cell...
I done been in situations where I done had to cope with all three  you know what I'm sayin?
I feel the only thing I ain't done yet is die  you know?
But it ain't how I live while I'm here  it's how I live when I leave  ya dig?
(Life's ups and downs  they come and go)
But when I die  I hope I live in the sky
All my folk who ain't alive  I hope they live in the sky
Pray to God when I die  that I live in the sky
(It's true what goes around  comes back you know)
So when I die I hope I live in the sky
All my folk who ain't survive  may they live in the sky
Tell God  I wanna fly  and let me live in the sky
My cousin Toot ain't have to die right in front of his son
And his wife  he lost his life struggling over a gun
Give a damn what he done  that's my muhfuckin' folk
And I love that nigga to death  no muhfuckin' joke
I can feel my eyes fillin'  the Lord is my witness
If I catch him  I'ma kill him  I made it my business
Back in the day  you stayed in my business
Taught me I ain't have to incorporate yay in my business
Coincidentally  that's why today you not with me
My cousin died over some yay  and I miss him
Plus he at his family house  let's say she the eyewitness
But her boyfriend did the shootin'  judge gave a life sentence
I heard that  now I'm dressed up in all black
Shot up the whole apartments  he still ain't brought back
The best friend I had in Tremell  I lost that
Guess your death was a lesson in life  it taught me that

You ever seen a nigga go to jail and sleep 'til day 2?
Well  that's how sick I was when Jay-Ru
Found out the hard way  that wasn't powder that they were tootin'
Overdosed on heron  died at 22
If you ain't heard about your daughter  she smile just like you
So cute  even resorts to violence like you
You know your baby momma loose  but ha  what can you do?
And I got four myself  yuh  it's been a few
Tell the Lord they all I've got  so please don't take them from me
From me standin' in the trap  with carryin' this here cap
Laughin' at the niggas who serve with no strap
Tell them niggas  man  y'all trippin' with no maps
Get robbed and ask to borrow my pistol ain't gon' happ'
Me  you  the crew just fell out over dough and a lil crack
Never could apologize  you died  that's why they say that
(Life's ups and downs  they come and go)
But when I die  I hope I live in the sky
All my folk who ain't alive  I hope they live in the sky
Pray to God when I die  that I live in the sky
(It's true what goes around  comes back you know)
So when I die I hope I live in the sky
All my folk who ain't survive  may they live in the sky
Tell God  I wanna fly  and let me live in the sky
I bet you niggas think I'm livin' it up
Til you see polices laughin' as they pickin' me up
Went from seeing how many bitches I could fit in the truck
To three hots and a cot  is you kiddin' or what?
Fuck how many millions I got  nigga  so what if I'm hot?
When I got prices on my head  Feds rushin' my spot
A million haters want me dead  forced to carry a gat
But you's a seven-time felon  what you doin' with that?
It's a catch-22  either you lose or you lose
That's the way the game structured  for real niggas to suffer
And I ain't never been a buster  always stood on my feet
Like a man prepared to take whatever coming for me
A pussy nigga or polices with a warrant for me
I'm a G  prepared to die for what's important to me
Look anybody in the eye who say he want it wit' me
Put up the house and bet the odds if it's comin' from me
OG's say I need to learn to be patient
You telling me with these seven years of probation
Pistol charges and a host of other open cases (Oh that Punk’d shit wasn’t funny by the way)
If niggas only knew the kind of time I was facin'
I try to keep it to myself  but sometimes I couldn't take it
Got four kids  the smiles on they faces
Mean more to me than my crown and my bracelet
Take that away from me  and my life is butt naked
(Life's ups and downs  they come and go)
But when I die  I hope I live in the sky
All my folk who ain't alive  I hope they live in the sky
Pray to God when I die  that I live in the sky
(It's true what goes around  comes back you know)
So when I die I hope I live in the sky

Hey man  I'd like to dedicate this song to my cousin Toot

What you need to do is be thankful for the life you got  y'knowmsayin?
Stop lookin' at what you ain't got
Start bein' thankful for what you do got
Let's give it to 'em baby girl  hey
You're gonna be  a shinin' star
In fancy clothes  and fancy cars
And then you'll see  you're gonna go far
'Cause everyone knows  just who ya are-are

Hey  never mind what haters say  ignore 'em 'til they fade away
Amazing they ungrateful after all the game I gave away
Safe to say I paved the way for you cats to get paid today
You'd still be wastin' days away now had I never saved the day
Consider them my protege  homage I think they should pay
Instead of bein' gracious  they violate in a major way
I never been a hater  still  I love 'em in a crazy way
Some say they sold the yay' you know they couldn't get work on Labor Day
It ain't that black and white  it has an area the shade of gray
I'm Westside anyway  even if I left today and stayed away
Some move away to make a way  not move away cause they afraid
I brought back to the hood  and all you ever did was take away
I pray for patience but they make me wanna melt they face away
Like I once made 'em spray  now I could make 'em put the K's away
Been thuggin' all my life  can't say I don't deserve to take a break
You'd rather see me catch a case and watch my future fade away
You're gonna be  a shinin' star
In fancy clothes  and fancy cars
And then you'll see  you're gonna go far

I'm the opposite of moderate  immaculately polished with
The spirit of a hustler and the swagger of a college kid
Allergic to the counterfeit  impartial to the politics
Articulate  but still I'll grab a nigga by the collar quick
Whoever havin' problems with their record sales just holler Tip
If that don't work and all else fails then turn around and follow Tip
I got love for the game  but ay I'm not in love with all of it
Could do without the fame  and rappers nowadays are comedy
The hootin' and the hollerin'  back and forth with the arguin'
Where you from  who you know  what you make and what kind of car you in
Seems as though you lost sight of what's important when depositin'
Them checks into your bank account  and you up out of poverty
Your values is a disarray  prioritizin' horribly
Unhappy with the riches cause you're piss poor morally
Ignorin' all prior advice and forewarnin'
And we mighty full of ourselves all of a sudden  aren't we?
You're gonna be  a shinin' star
In fancy clothes  and fancy cars
And then you'll see  you're gonna go far

And see the way I'm livin' if you really want to
Got my mind on my money
And I'm not goin' awayyyyyyy
So keep on gettin' your paper  and keep on climbin'
Look in the mirror  and keep on shinin' (shinin')
Until the game ends  'til the clock stop
We gon' post up on the top spot
Livin' the life  the life

Anything you could ask  do it for you
Drop Jags  Birkin bags  Louboutin heels
Summer homes in Miami  Hollywood hills
Vacationin' in Monaco  Ibiza
On the French Riviera with our feet up
A lifestyle so rare
You know you ain't going nowhere
I knew a bad bitch  but she was kinda slow
Still gave it up when it's a few of us
She let me finger-fuck her on the school bus
We used to cut school with her and run train
She wanted to hang with us  we wanted one thang
Just penetratin' that throat  dawg
She choked on it like smoke  dawg
But whenever I fucked up my re-up
In a dice game I go see her
She'll give me enough to buy a quarter ounce
And then blow a blunt of that reefer
She used to buy a nigga new sneakers
Pay the bill on my beeper
Just so she can page to put a 69
And I know it time to go freak her
Then one day I just asked her
Why you always give your ass up?
All you do is get laid—this shit don't add up.
Even if I know it ain't real love
Even if I know a nigga only finna hit it
And then never call back  I still fuck.
And that's fucked up  but she so trill
I need somethin'  she go steal
When the trap hot and police ride
Nigga  guess where we go chill?
For 'bout four years she held dope
And my four pounds 'til it go down
I remember shawty  she stayed down
I won't say her name ‘cause she married now

And I'm in my bed
I think of all the madness in my head
All of the things that I did back then
When I'm in my bed
I think of all the memories I've had
All of the things I did back then
She would always turn heads when she'd fall through
She would always make moves how a boss do
And she never gave any nigga time of day
But she the chick all the niggas tried to talk to
But when it came to me  she had a thing for me
When we kicked it she roll up the weed for me
And we'd both cut class post up in the cut steady
Watchin' just to see if the police comin'
We got close over time  her and I
Right around the time that I first got signed
Come to think about it I was 'bout 17
I ain't even have a license  couldn't even drive
I was goin' back and forth with each flight
Another show after show  each night
She became so suspicious of these other bitches
She'd go through my phone and we'd fight
Talk about torn between the two
Wasn't really much more that we could do
Wasn't really much space for us
But she stayed down with every tour she seen me do
But I guess one night I had a few
Huh  one night I had a few
Yeah  this little chick that caught my eye
I told her: Hurry up  meet me at the room!
And no  I didn't have a contraceptive
What my common sense neglected
And two months later  next thing I know
I got a text that said I'm pregnant
And you can almost bet she kept it
And that's the reason why you left me
On top of all that  it wasn't even mine
I went and got paternity tested—damn!
When the lights go out
And I'm in my bed
I think of all the madness in my head
All of the things that I did back then
When I'm in my bed
I think of all the memories I've had
All of the things I did back then
With them big ol' thighs after school?
Jay 305 had gave me high five
When I said I’m in hot pursuit
You said  I won’t ride until Kendrick drive
A new Monte Carlo that cruise
And that shot my pride  I tried to improv
But no freestyle I never do
You lookin' for the nigga with the tallest 'fetti
You overlookin' every nigga that ain’t quite ready
To make it rain on you like I'm about to break a levee
Hol' up  that pussy petty
Your cell phone is selfish
It only got numbers that come with a Hummer
Her new prima donna I smelt it
Tried to make you mine  ho!
Tried to make some time  ho!
But I ain’t got the time or the patience
To stop and wait in line  ho!
Her dreams holds Versace
She fall for Armani
Only deal with rich niggas—fuck you and Mick Romney!
I’m grown now  I’m on my own now
I’m po-o-o-oppin'
Change my phone now when I get home now
I got o-o-o-options
With them big ol' thighs after school?
And your three kids and three baby daddies
Same car note that’s overdue? I know
When the lights go out
And I'm in my bed

Save the glass for guys who balling on a budget
Fuck it  let your glasses rise

Ask any ho who know me  all I do is smash and ride
Buckets of bubbly  shake it up and let it splash in the eyes
Ain't no subtraction  only cash to divide

Lame niggas  these niggas talk too much (Uh-yeah)
Even though my head in the clouds  I'm planted on the pavement
How I'm walking 'round  people staring at amazement
I play a lot of games on where I be  and I ain't playing with it
They so judgmental  maybe they don't understand:
If your life was in jeopardy e'ryday  is you telling me
You wouldn't need weaponry  just because of your felony?
Consider this  at least: I got e'rybody sweating me
On the streets  it's people who won't rest unless I rest in peace
Paranoia stressing me  ain't nobody protecting me
I'm dealing with the pressure from my partner dying next to me
Think 'cause no one's arrested  they coming for me eventually
This was all the things I was going through mentally
This could be the reason I ignored the penitentiary
Not mentioning New Orleans niggas coming in the city
Killing all summer long  ain't nobody pay attention
Now  is it that hard to understand if you listen?
Either die or go to jail—that's a hell of a decision

When you gone on half a pill
Don't know why  but that's how it is
Then you take a flight back to the crib
Y'all make love like college kids
And you say all the shit you gon' do better
We can try this shit again
'Round the time the dope wear off
You feel stupid  she feel lost
That's that dopamine  I mean dope—
I mean  you think Cupid done worn off
Waiting in the hallway with her arms crossed
Baby boy face full of applesauce
Maybe should have stayed but it ain't yo fault
Was young and had to choose between you
And what the rest of the world might offer me
Shit  what would you do? (I was 21)
Well  I'd prob'ly do it differently if second the chance
Only if some cool-ass older man
Would've let me know in advance

When he feel that he's broken up his nest
And he figures  shit—he was just doing the best that he could
Which end up being the worst that he could

It's boring? Boring?
Really? Hahahaha

Then go and reward all the ones who mistreat us
And leave us in projects and give us these poisonous products
On top of narcotics to push to our sisters and brothers
Like them ain't our sisters and brothers
See what happen when athletes'll no longer play for you
Tell them accountants to pray for you
On respect or just respect what that paper'll do
Turnin' them profits to loss when we won't go shop in the mall
Showin' these folk we just won't take whatever
Or else they just roll up and shoot up whatever
Just like they've been doin' forever
The niggas swear they hard be huffin' and puffin'
They wait behind enemy lines
Why you tryna be so friendly now? Handle your business now
And we won't fear nothin' but judgement from God
Standin' there lookin' at me sayin' you ain't do nothin'
I bless you when you ain't invested in nothin'
Just kept up the cycle of death and destruction
Ignornin' your neighbor won't help him but helpin' yourself
Promote all that fornication
Now they trapped in systems cause incarceration
Was inevitable due to education
Substandard institution never cared
GDP and whatever else separate us
What you get for bein' hard headed? God damn nigga
Might as well gon' and go to hell nigga
Cause I tried as hard as I can nigga
I know you only a man but God damn nigga

Although I knew you was special when you was smaller
That’s why I was so much harder on you  knew you were smarter

Great to see you doin better than me  even as a father
Taking care of yo mama  overcoming the drama

Be thankful for all this beauty  when it’s over with forget it

What up  Phil? So good to hear from you  we missing you (f'real)
Remembering all of our conversations  daily reminiscing you
The hood  today they lost  can tell they don't know who to listen to
Today I watch over Jeanette like she was my own and that could missing you
I swear it’s so unfair that I’m right here and you up there
I miss you so much now to the point I call your name but you not there
Now I can’t rest and I can’t do shit off my mind  I’m so upset
It wasn’t your time to beat me there  broke my heart to see you dead
Shot with bullets that were meant for me  familiy's never forgiving me
I know  but all I could do was follow your memory
But pops I thank you so much for leaving  I had to grow up
Slanging crack on the corner ain’t quite the future you wanted for me
Was it? And this pain I feel it never goes away
Does it? This load I carry get no lighter
I grew up all on my own with a broken heart and a broken home
Taught me everything I’ve known  owe you everything I own
I must admit you raised a warrior  my life could be a story book
Hope you proud of me  didn’t graduate from college but
Thanks for listening to me  so long  had this bottled up
Til we meet in person let’s keep speaking through my verses for life"
