Tryna see the Zoo vision  it'll leave you eyeless

I pull up in my beamer  hop out and start to flexing
Used to stay in the trap house  was serving fiends their breakfast
All I do is count money  my lil brother stretch it
Don’t get shit on my hands now  my shit’s too fucking special
Big ZooWap from the bando  I’m sending you a message
Everything that I land on  I swear to God I smash it
And my whole damn camp on  I heat it up and pass it
Every beat that I Wap on  I put it in a casket
Hit the gas on my spaceship  I hate waiting in traffic
Like they all at a standstill  watch ZooWap fucking pass ‘em
Khaos pull out that forty  he doing too much yapping
I am GMOB  we folk can get it cracking
How you stand on your block without your pistol  boy you lacking
Pillow talk to them bitches bout me  boy I find out faster
How you stand on your block without your pistol  boy you lacking
Bands all in my Robin jeans  niggas tryna rob me
Fuck nigga better duck ‘fore I get the tommy
Riding in the drop top with a mami
Hundred bands I’ma drop soon on my time piece
Tints all on my beamer boy  ZooWap I’m so special
Came up off of nothing  now it’s money in my dresser
Only jeans I rock got wings  five hundred just to dress up
Stupid loud in the woods  ZooWap roll it faster
ZooWap from the trap  I swear my sack is a disaster
Different color twelve  twelve skinnies in a plastic
You gon' need a fucking phantom if you tryna match it
Gritt and Dice on twenty-eight  trapping out the mansion
Old school days  Box Chevy for my grandma
All I wanna do is whip  put ZooWap on the landmark
Thru these streets I’m movin' quick like big ZooWap a landshark
Talking shit  can’t leave your block
That’s how you get your land marked
Heavy cheese  my neck gon' freeze and Gucci Mane my role model
Every time I hit the club  we pop at least ‘bout four bottles
Every time we leave the club  you see all the hoes follow
If that nigga acting crazy  he gon' get the whole hollow
All they gotta do is cut the check  I go get four Robins
ZooWap I’m the motherfucking best  compared to nobody
Laser tips will beam you up but baby we don’t know Scotty
ZooWap I’m the motherfucking best  compared to nobody
