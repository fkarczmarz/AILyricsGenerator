" not my spirit (No!)
 can't you hear it?
 we playin' tonight
 this is our church of The
 you know
 couple Irish kids
 gotta fight for this
 goin' undefeated
 uh huh
 uh huh
 put my spirit in the stars
 not my spirit (No!)
 can't you hear it?
 I'd be the best dressed
 but
 player
 all layups
 I made it to courtside
 I said that I won't sign
 I turned that to my leverage
 not my spirit (No!)
 can't you hear it?
 but I'd die for this W
 I'll re-write these rules
 I will not lose
 not my spirit (No!)
 can't you hear it?
My name is Aberdeen Washington
And I'm a proud American
And a terrorist fighter
That's right
Hey gimme another beer bitch!
Now when the day Bin Laden comes to town
I'mma drop a duece
Wipe it up with his towel
Imma watch some football
I pray to the Lord the Cowboys win
And beat the hell outta them damn Redskins
Call up the boys
Get drunk as shit
God damn right I'm an American
That's right
I'm American
Got a picture of Reagan above my fire
Next to the deer I shot with my rifle
NRA hell yeah I support 'em
No pro choice
No abortion
Ride on home to Samoa
Or wherever they come from
They're takin' our jobs
Eatin' our hamburgers
Takin' our jobs
They takin' our jobs!
I see them in the field
I'm takin' their head off
I hate my job
And I hate my boss
But I love my country

And I pray to God
That the Cowboys win
Fuck yeah Romo!
And the Cowboys win
Just clap your hands
If you love our country
If you love our land
That's right
And if you're not clapping your hands
You're a terrorist
And you eat sand (sandwiches)
The day Bin Laden comes to town
I'mma drop a deuce
Wipe my poop with his towel
Mow my lawn
Sit on the couch
And I'mma watch some football
And I pray to the lord the Cowboys win
And beat the hell outta them damn Redskins
Call up the boys
Get drunk as shit
God damn right I'm American
I'm Ameri-fuckin-can
And John McCain and Sarah Palin
I know you lost out there
It was a tough one
But you're still two mavericks in my book
Don't worry about it
And listen Palin
I don't have a 6 pack
But I got a beer bong in my pants
What do ya' say we go get shit faced
In a helicopter and kill a moose
You don't like it? We exploit you!
Hell yeah
Tony Romo
Man that guy is so damn cute
I wanna sack his boner
And ride him broke back
All the way to Wyoming
Hey I said no homo
Fuck terrorists!
Guys I'm kidding!
I like Romo
I don't like Romo
You wouldn't? if you caught Bin Laden
You wouldn't give him one in the butt?
For America?
If you said no homo right after you did it?
It doesn't count if it's terrorists
Hey little Aberdeen
Come in here
Yeah?
Hey come sing the national family anthem
Come on
USA! USA! USA! USA! USA! USA! USA!
Hey hey!
USA! USA! USA! USA! USA! USA! USA!
Hey hey!
That's right
I'm an American citizen
Aberdeen Washington
This is my country
And just because Barack Obama
Won the presidential election
Does not mean that half the country
Doesn't feel the same way I do
Man I came to America (yeah)
And I live in America (c'mon)
And I live in America
I do too dad
Lemme get em
And I live in America
Dad and I live in America
Shut up!
Little Aberdeen shut the fuck up!
My bad
Lemme tell 'em
That's right
As soon as I wake up
I'm gonna change my ways
'Cause the music's my savior
And no one can take my pain
Except for this paper
The page  it flows like rain
As soon as I wake up
I'm gonna change my ways
Instead of staying the same
'Cause I see better days ahead of me
I paint them on the page
Then I save them for the rainy ones
When anger and the anguish want to hang around
I say 'em outloud and complain to them
I figure I'm made to live and haven't gone that far
But I made it here  so if there is a God I give thanks to him
Then I take the pen and make amends again
The only way I know to repent
I know somebody's listenin'

Dear God  I'm so thankful for you keeping my plate full
The struggles  heartache  pain  the progress and the breakthrough
Every single track has made who I am to this day
Through this page is the only way to paint you
But lately it's like my soul feels counterfeit
Scared to pick up the pen to see what the hell might come out of it
So God  grant me the serenity without giving me the christening
Because all I ever needed was a beat and people listening
Step Cousins
As soon as I wake up
I'm gonna change my ways
'Cause the music's my savior
And no one can take my pain
Except for this paper
The page  it flows like rain
As soon as I wake up (Good Morning)
I'm gonna change my ways
Instead of rotting away and plotting my grave  hiding in a bottomless shame
I found a way to fight my way out and see the light of day
And proud to say I took the safe route  but there's a price to pay
They like to keep my name in they mouth and tell lies on me
What you see is what you get  truth in the flesh  homie
You can do the rest  I'm through with trying to prove myself to you
I'll see you when you wake up  hope the feeling is mutual
Now for artists and musicians  you see the target's to listen
To the heart and then script it  with no margin  no limits
To make to pain  strengths  sun rays a part of the picture
And convey it in every shade and take it farther and vivid
They're gonna say what they say  to barge in the vision
And whatever the DJ plays  they market the gimmick
But I've got a path to follow and the longer the distance
I realize I'm already awake
I'm just starting to live it
My language
As soon as I wake up
I'm gonna change my ways
'Cause the music's my savior
And no one can take my pain
Except for this paper
The page  it flows like rain
As soon as I wake up
 B-girls
 not only to top charts
 wanting to blow rap
 B-girls
 especially
 flow
 we get a car
 please stand up
 and I'm going to do a rap for ya'll
 selling their tacos
 I'll cut off your asshole
 don't even talk about the faggots
 alright I admit it I hate him
 tell 'em I got up on that
 plotting on oil profits
 the economy's in a ditch
 the economy's in a ditch
 cause all of sudden
 really great strategy
 counted
 what matters in the end
 and those are my dad's friends
 and please remember
 I'll see you back in November
 the economy's in a ditch
 the economy's in a ditch
 sit down  stand up again
 are you listening?
 no response shows the opposite
 some said I'm faithless
 how the fuck would you know if nobody came back and said I'm telling you  bro?
 amen
 but see that something was off
 I found God  it wasn't Jesus
 voice of reason  just me and my Adidas
 I put my hand over my heart  pledge allegiance
 that's hip-hop's Egypt
 don't look too far it's right here  us human beings
Saying If you don't believe  then the prayin' don't work
With the beatbox I got free on the pavement  I'm first
Music brought me to my knees  I found faith in a verse
So dear Spirit  I know I gotta take a chance
And my mistakes and shortcomings finally made a man
I watch my daughter giggin' in the kitchen to the safety dance
This shit right here  we call love
You can't put that into words  but feel that in your gut
The goosebumps on my arms  I watch the fallin' sun
Kiss my daughter and say Thank God as I wake up
And I'm up  but I'm aware that it goes down
Travelled 'round the globe  I needed to slow down
And no better feeling riding 'round in my hometown
Hope I'm feeling this good when it's Monday mornin'
Been doing my own thing  can't say that I'm sorry
And I can only pray someday that we'll all be
More than just okay  we can be so free

Oh my God  oh my God
No other person on this earth could ever take my job
My mistake  my mistake
Karma waits  karma waits
But I'll be brave  I'll be brave
The pain seems more than I could take  I could take
I learn more from loss than the gain  than the gain
New state of mind  I feel like taking my time
And that laidback reclines  still pushing that '85 Lac
We came so far  just some kids in the city tryna make some art
Leave some change in the fountain  hope to make my mark
You see I was given a role  never played my part
Hope I'm feeling this good when it's Monday mornin'
Been doing my own thing  can't say that I'm sorry
And I can only pray someday that we'll all be
More than just okay  we can be so free
 you know?
 but I'm a resident
You don't stop and look around once in a while you could miss it
Babies still playing in ditchy forgotten corners
The city's forgotten its warriors
Who died young
Eyes hating the sun that's shining before us
How rotten bodies fertilizing the forest of concrete and glass
Foul hearted police aiming their gats
My head hang over beats
I hope my ghosts stay in the past
And days I couldn't play to the pad
We the same kids they'd be sending to invade Iraq
And make it safe with crack
I got that Gray Goose and OJ in a glass
The last day before my cousin hit the pen
Down to swing
I came back to the town just to be down with the king
And loving surroundings it seems
Just then he find out his baby cousin fell off a balcony
Images of a violent paradise is drowning me
Lost souls and I can't let go or tell no
The same scenario that rules South Othello
Southsiders tell the devil hello
And heaven bye
And it hurts too much to ask why

I grew up on Capitol Hill
With two parents and two cars
They had a beautiful marriage
We even had a swing set in our yard
Money that we could live comfortably and he could support us
But then I realized everybody looked just like me in my neighborhood
And my friends ate the free lunch
I didn't understand the fact was
There's something called a social status
And my black friends weren't in my financial bracket
And then my city's divided
From neighborhood to neighborhood
We're polarized but we claim that we're progressive
The police shoot in the hood but never once in my residence
Has a white person been shot or even stopped in a Lexus?
And to think that we claim that so much has changed
Since Brown versus the Board of Education and Roe versus Wade
But around my way it all stays the same
They just figured out a way to separate the black and white face
From the places with plenty
To the space with no pity
The forces changing our city
One day at a time
If I don't change what's been given
What can I say to my children
Who gonna be claiming this city

Images of Tent City in the shadows of Amazon's office site
In the jungle down the slide in Jose Rizal's park
Called development? They kicked them folks out
And moved them around every chance they can since
And tearing down the 'jects ain't gonna make your ass safer
For all that paper wasted just to build up Safeco
While Garfield High School still remains like a slave boat
Mind racing like a child torn in war zones
With every side challenged
Needing to manage and understand this balance
I can't fall or falter
And no amount of words offered has ever been enough to alter this system
Swallowing souls broke
My own folks roam upcoast
Holding dreams close of what America was supposed to be
But works for the rich only
This Southend in reality
Took my family back to what they was running from before
When they left that war
Home don't exist anymore
Home don't exist anymore
All those moments
All those moments
I'm like Yo  let's get on some angry MC showmanship and hit 'em
Rocked all the cocky songs and not too many soulful lyrics
Ran into a familiar face  a female who comes in and supports us
I said Peace! She said Wait! Let me talk to you for a minute
I know it's none of my business  but I wasn't impressed by your performance.
I said Word? Shit  I love feedback and criticism.
She said I miss the passionate spirit  your political vision
Quite honestly I wasn't offended by those references to women
But you're only continuing society's conditioning.
It hit the heart of me
I told her that this was part of me
I stand up for human rights  and treat others how I would wanna be treated
But every song can't be seepin' with freedom
'Cuz the other side of me is sexist then people will feel that I'm preachin'
Everything's peace and love? uhh  that's somewhat misleading
Because this world is fucked-up and I'm a pro-duct to what I'm seeing
Not to justify  but just to touch on my being
I learn from these verses and my purpose gets surfaced with demons
She said she heard that perspective  but before she turned around
She said We have a flame  your fire's ignited with sound
Are you building the empire up  or using your fire to burn it down?

Consumption  contradiction. I'm conflicted with being a hypocrite
And through these songs you can witness it
Walking a fine line between saying and living it
Light it up to burn it down  light it up to burn it down
Light it up to burn it down  light it up to burn it down
Now one thing that I've always struggled on
Is how to incorporate drugs and alcohol into my music outside of sober songs
'Cuz on that perspective  that's all over my records
But the other side isn't represented unless it sessions with XP
How can I admit that I love to smoke weed
Knowing the kids are listening and many of them look up to me?
Not to say that I'm a role model  but I know that words are power
And if I condone bottles and chronic  I am sending out the
Message It's okay  hey I believe that it is
Chronic can be medicine  but it's all about your relationship with it
See I'm either off in the wagon riding and everyday with the spliff
Constantly looking for a balance but habit turns to addiction
And hip-hop music and weed: they're inseparable
It proves how much people just want to be accepted
And not seem straight-edge to their audience  so keeping it real is neglected
'Cuz when I'm smoking  I wouldn't wanna bump a song like this
Put on some Dev and break out the Swishers  and a bong and some licks
See that's a part of me too
And I know that I would make more money if I wasn't as true
To all the struggles of the blunted consumption I'm going through
Make music for the party  and the people support you
I burn Brother Ali and buy 50  what does that say to you?
Bring it back around
Am I building the empire up or using my fire to burn it down?
Consumption  contradiction. I'm conflicted with being a hypocrite
And through these songs you can witness it
Walking a fine line between saying and living it
Consumption  contradiction. I'm conflicted with being a hypocrite

So God grant me the serenity to accept the things I can not change
Courage to change the things I can
And the wisdom to know the difference
And the wisdom to know the difference

Good lookin' out for this one  man
I love hip-hop music  I just hate the ego
The politics that follow it  getting caught in it can be lethal
See I love the community  'cause a community will embrace you
But you turn it back the community is the people that will hate you
See everybody's striving for that same shit
When someone makes a move watch that person next to you
Cause I'll warn ya
I love Hova but jealousy's The Takeover

I can't do what he does
And where does that lead us?
To the ego that feeds us
I wish that I could just do what I do
But when a door opens for him I'm afraid there won't be enough room
Comparison's a mother fucker
Like MLK said
We all want that band leader syndrome and it won't stop

Of the music or the ego that is killing hip-hop?

It's the ego that makes me not give respect in dap
It's the ego that makes me talk shit behind people's back
You know that it's the ego that's constantly polluting my consciousness
So ingrained in my brain that I can barely even acknowledge it
It's the ego that makes the present moment jet lagged
I said it's the ego that has me trippin' about the next man
You know that it's the ego that makes me not go to the front
Of the show cause the performers have exactly what I want
I'm so cool
For real?
You know dude  I'm serious spit it different and if you just flow too
I'll listen lookin' for glitches and rip 'em to shove improve
That my rhythm's a little bit more intricate  just to boost
My ego  it's so evil
Threatened by so many different kinds of people
It seems that if you're going through somethin' and life is feeling uncomfortable
The immediate place you go is to your ego to comfort you
When Boom Bap got signed I hated on him
When Grayskul got signed I hated Onry
And that's hard to admit  but since I'm really being honest
I wanted to be one of the first to make it as a Northwest rap artist
Instead of taking it as a plus for my region
I took it as a cut to my dreams of makin' it out of this political scene of
Northwest haters to be next  I guess I'm just like them
Jealous of who's taking that step
It's the ego that makes me not give respect in dap
It's the ego that makes me talk shit behind people's back
You know that it's the ego that's constantly polluting my consciousness
So ingrained in my brain that I can barely even acknowledge it
It's the ego that makes the present moment jet lagged
I said it's the ego that has me trippin' about the next man
You know that it's the ego that makes me not go to the front
Of the show cause the performers have exactly what I want
Now everybody got one but people trying to front
Claiming that they on the humble but cocky
Now it comes up when we judge
Or are threatened by someone
But everyone still be like man that's not me
Now let me break it down son
It's only a lack of love for ourselves
Cause we're submerged in I gotta be
The best or number one
But it's just that we don't trust
In our heart and that's what stops me
Crack my window  shed my shadow  excavate my pain
If I could read the world my notebook and these thoughts in it
Would they judge me or love me for what I've written?
Tryna get closer to spirit that enters the body
It's the vessel like I'm not in it
In fifty-something years  I won't be here
There'll be a kid with some headphones coverin' his ears
Walkin' 'round a hallway  dreamin' of ideas
Find himself in the sound 'cause music is a mirror
What you looking for? What you headed towards?
What's your name worth when they mention yours?
When you leave here  are you stepping forward?
Can you remember your intention when they question yours?
They're gonna question yours  they're gonna question yours
I've been to rock bottom and I'm headed North
If you don't love yourself  what's the respect for?
If you don't love life  the check won't correct yours
Excavate
Fill my lungs up  pour my heart out  peel my bones away
Crack my window  shed my shadow  excavate my pain

In the baby blue Cadillac hearse
Pullin' me 'round the block that I rep

Or did I leave a better life for the rest?

When I was seventeen I was staying in NYC
And my homie told me where I could get a fake ID
Ayo  son  you better get that shit when you in NY (okay)
So I hopped on the subway and I gave it a try
To my pleasant surprise the ID looked fine
5'9  blues eyes  born in nineteen-seventy-nine (just right)
Nervous as hell  I went to the store with my homie
Came out and yelled Dawg  they sold me a 40
Yeah  you know that I was the man
Buying liquid contraband with a fake ass hologram
No more looking for bums  standing in the rain
Stranded on Broadway and giving 'em all my change
For the rest of the summer man I was on fades
Seventeen  had it made  getting drunk everyday
Ayy  I got treated a whole new way
Because of a piece of plastic that proved I was of age
You know what I'm saying  all of a sudden you get this little piece of plastic and you're in the club. Seventeen like bah! Check it out  it's like this  yo
Now for the next three years I had so much fun
Getting drunk in hip-hop clubs where you had to be twenty-one
Then one day I was walking and I saw a sign
That said KRS-One twenty-one up and live
That's hella tight
Ayo I heard he always ripped it
So I hopped up in my Civic and went out to buy a ticket
When I got up the the door the bouncer checking ID's
Looks at mine and he's like Nah  we don't take these
I tried to reach and grab my shit back
But the mother fucker was tougher than Shaq  on crack
I should've punched him  but I would have reached his knee cap
And that probably wouldn't have hurt him very much
He kept laughing and smilin'  he called me a dumb shit
And if I would've let myself I would have cried in public
Oh no  I'm like Give it back  bro!
But no  my ID was jacked by the Caucasian Deebo

Ha I'm laughing right now but at the time it really was not funny and it's still not very funny. Fucker
Bitch why you got to take my ID?
Why do I have to be 21 to drink a Long Island Iced Tea?
I hate bouncers with their bald heads and ten foot tall legs
And shirts that they outgrew when they were like ten
*Get 'em*
Your mother is dumb for having you
You're a bouncer because you have a small dick and as a kid everyone laughed at you
*Get 'em*
You're too big and you never seemed to listen
You look injected with the shit they give to KFC chickens
*Get 'em*
I don't like ya  at all I despise you
If I was tall I would fight you
If I was a dog I would bite you
Every single day you make people cry
And your job is to go and ruin teenager's lives
Ok I'm going too far bouncers aren't all bad
I'm sure they make great husbands and really strong dads
But hopefully you learned a lesson from me
Never take an MC's fake ID
Yup  I said never take an MC's fake ID
You could be buff and tough  it don't matter to me
Inside my chest is a thorn  it's been torn from the start
The picture painted is warped  the hearts aching and scarred
Music’s the band-aid I’m too afraid to take this shit off
Another drink at the bar  but I’m not drunk enough
Each shot burns less but the chest isn’t numbin' up
A voice keeps talkin’ in my head and I’ma fuck him up
Fill the gun with lead and bust until the pump shuts him up
Emos and rockers and rockers and emos
Another shot of some vodka to get myself up off of my ego
There’s a door to my conscience  I can’t unlock it or see the peephole
This angel held my baggage and then vanished like where did she go
I was beside her but I was walking by myself though
Break the silence with my cell phone it doesn’t help though
I can’t believe this is happening  sinking into depression
I’ve been here before and now I’m back again
6 am hung over leaving my booty call watch the sunrise
Head over I-5 headed North but there’s no sign of sunshine
Empty brandy bottles spilled on the forgotten memories
Know I gotta let her go I’m just to selfish to set it free
Life forced release  two hours later I just got up and bounced
If she could only see me now head lost swallowed and drowned
The path is up but I followed it down
A man gone and hollowed out because you opened it up
You can’t start over now
What’s to keep going for?
Validated by drunken whores
Bloody knuckles so numb and sore from punching these rusty doors
Freeway signs underpasses man stranded dusty mattress
This world is bipolar  beautiful for some for others the fuckin’ saddest
So sick of lugging baggage
All I got is drugs and alcohol and these cuts of passion
Brain serenade razorblade  punk madness
Pain is love plug the drain but the rain keeps crashing like
Just being honest  I just thought that shit looked cool
Hold up  do you know who I am?
Turn the block to Woodstock
Retire? Don't think that I could stop
Jet-ski the way I ride the beat
And fuck your wave  I'ma die knowing that I did me
I got some words and I cannot let them die in me
This is arena status
Our bones end up in the ground  does it even matter?
Make some good music  get what you put in
Get out and go and leave the planet
Now what the hell did you think this is?
Chain looking like Orion's Belt
Jacket looking something like a lion pelt
Had to take a break and find myself
They put me in a box by myself
The same writers criticizing my rhymes
Are the same writers that gentrifyin' Bed-Stuy
I can't even see the hate  I should probably check my eyes
I got 50 000 phones pointed at me in the sky

Between a rock and a hard place
Cold blunted with a stone face

Born under a blood moon

What the fuck you think I'm doing it for?
Hungry like it's my rookie year  and I'm new to the sport
The game is tied up  they looking at you in the fourth
Do you take the shot or pass it  this is ten-thousand hours
There's no father to my style  I'm just a freckle-faced bastard
Abracadabra that motherfucker is magic
It's '81 and Madonna is on me dancing
I'd probably go double-platinum if I could think of an ad-lib
I'm jazz Prince  I rap a lot

Another sprint  another step (Another step)
Another day  another breath (Another breath)
Been chasing dreams  but I never slept (I never slept)
I got a new attitude and a lease on life and some peace of mind
Seek and I find  I can sleep when I die
Want a piece of the pie  grab the keys to the ride
I heard you die twice  once when they bury you in the grave
And the second time is the last time that somebody mentions your name
So when I leave here on this earth  did I take more than I gave?
Did I look out for the people  or did I do it all for fame?
Trudging through the mud to find the present  no ignoring us
Got 20 000 deep off in the street like we some warriors
My mama told me never bow your head  woo
I feel glorious  glorious
Got a chance to start again
I was born for this  born for this

Someday  these will be the good old days
All the love you won't forget
And all these reckless nights you won't regret
Someday soon  your whole life's gonna change
You'll miss the magic of these good old days
I was thinkin' 'bout the band
I was thinkin' 'bout the fans
We were underground
Loadin' merch in that 12-passenger van
In a small club in Minnesota
And the snow outside of 1st Ave
I just wanted my name in a star
Now look at where we at
Still growin' up  still growin' up
I would lay in my bed and dream about what I'd become
Couldn't wait to get older  couldn't wait to be some
Now that I'm here  wishing I was still young
Those good old days
I wish somebody would have told me  babe
That someday  these will be the good old days
All the love you won't forget
And all these reckless nights you won't regret

Wish I didn't think I had the answers
Wish I didn't drink all of that flask first
Wish I made it to homecoming
Got up the courage to ask her
Wish I would've gotten out of my shell
Wish I put the bottle back on that shelf
Wish I wouldn't have worry about what other people thought
And felt comfortable in myself
Rooftop open  and the stars above
On the grass dreamin'  figuring out who I was
Those good old days
I wish somebody would have told me  babe
That someday  these will be the good old days
All the love you won't forget
And all these reckless nights you won't regret
'Cause someday soon  your whole life's gonna change
You'll miss the magic of the good old days
Never thought we'd get old  maybe we're still young
Maybe you always look back and think it was better than it was
Maybe these are the moments
Maybe I've been missin' what it's about
Been scared of the future  thinkin' about the past
While missin' out on now
We've come so far  I guess I'm proud
And I ain't worried 'bout the wrinkles 'round my smile
I've got some scars  I've been around
Those good old days
You don't know what you've got
'Til it goes  'til it's gone
You don't know what you've got

It goes against what our country is funding

(Hey) Block the barricade until Palestine is free
Actors in badges protecting property
And a system that was designed by white supremacy (Brrt)
But the people are in the streets

Who gets the right to defend and who gets the right of resistance
White supremacy is finally on blast

To uphold an occupyin' violent
History been repeating for the last seventy-five
If students in tents posted on the lawn
Occupyin' the quad is really against the law
And a reason to call in the police and their squad
Destroyin' every college in Gaza and every mosque
Pushin' everyone into Rafah and droppin' bombs
Undecided
Never be defeated when freedom's on the horizon
What happened to the artist? What d'you got to say?
I'd be fine with it 'cause the heart fed my page
What you willin' to risk? What you willin' to give?
What if you were in Gaza? What if those were your kids?

I know you're fed up  but you must try to survive
Each moment's precious  don't let life pass you by

Each moment's precious  don't let life pass you by
Keep focused  keep your eyes on the prize
A friend of mine once told me  We have many paths in this journey
They act in different directions  so when you question don't be worried
It's not a wrong one  beauty can be found in all of them
You'll meet people whose paths intersect  but you don't know how long you'll walk with them
How long we'll continue with our loved ones down this rugged road
The path veers and it's clear that we must steer alone
I've learned if you can't hold on to that moment that exists- let it go
Cause freedom is God
Freedom is acknowledging the mask you have on and possessing the strength to take it off
Freedom is accepting every step of the path
And when it's hard having faith in the ability to embrace it  that's where you are
And this is it
The same shit that we work towards  but go against in the same sense
And since I'm on cliche terms  knowing is half the battle
But I don't know  so I just go with what was destined
Life can be a burden or a blessing
The choice is yours to be connected

I feel like I have nothing to give right now
But where's the up? I'm stuck with the broken smile
No joking now  wanting to grab a swish and smoke this out
The moment of a man choosing what path I will go down
With a split gut pick myself up and spit my style
This is the only thing that can hold my ground
You're born into this world alone  and alone you'll go out
All I have is myself and everyone else I doubt
You can only trust yourself and depend on the help of the pound
Inside of the chest that beats with the breath of the now
No sunshine when she's gone  I can only see clouds
No homies can hold me down  the spirit's testing me now
But I can withstand this world  but it seems so foul
Flood of emotions  it's like I'm being held down to drown
Hell's right around the corner  but I can turn it around
You always have a choice  no matter the situation you're not bound
This is your life  you can't escape this bitch when it's hard
Just know that it passes  but you'll collect scars
They never go away  but they will make you who you are
This is a beautiful struggle  I share it in song cause
I can't control this  remember: the moment's beyond us

The first time I heard Digital Underground I was in the first grade
I would do the Humpty Hump and perform to his verses
I loved Hammer I can't front he taught me how to dance
Along with Bell Biv DeVoe I had Jay-O's and a pair of zebra pants
But this was the foundation
Some people ask me what it means
I dont know where to start
Its the deepest connection between my soul and my heart
When I first stepped to do a cypher in a jam at the park
I got served No for real I got served
But see I learned something observed others
And watched an urge hungered
Verse studier earned a turn on that block
I dont care who you are or where you're from or what you believe in
But if you love Hip Hop I bet
Its more or less for the same reason
This is it when you spit you exist in that moment
And if you're sick with that gift you then rip it when you perform it
Then all the shit that you live begins to lift off your shoulders
And the audience well they get to experience where your soul is
The most amazing feeling rocking a crowd to your anthem
To the front to the back with their motherfucking hands up
Cause I'm an MC won't be the first won't be the last
Just another B-Boy and I'ma die in my stance

But if you're not speaking the truth you might as well not be saying shit
I said Who's going to teach the kids?
You wanna blow up and get famous so you can get some new rims
All the money in the world can help you look like a star
But money can't buy you the heart to go and put inside your bars
And I like nice shit too
Fitted white Tees and an Icy earrings like the whole youth population of hip-hop
But look beyond it when I record to these beats
But if I don't speak me
What's the difference between my lyrics and what you hearin' on MTV
People fear that if they're steering away from the mainstream
I'm just gonna freestyle and spit what's inside my gut
And if you want to you can go and label me conscious
But just remember there's a kid at a bus stop beatboxing
Whose life's will be affected by what's inside of his Walkman

Thinking about all the places that my heart's been
I mean it's crazy right  this is maybe wife
The one that found me in a drought  pulled me out  and made me right
Through the ups and downs we stuck it out and now you're leaving town
Another couple thousand miles south  which leads to crazy fights
And I don't know how to deal with it
I gotta be real with ya
Each day I get filled with the
Feeling of realer love  we wanna continue it  but
This ain't the same old love song
'Cause we been through the depths where all the trust is gone
For months on end all we have is phone calls
But you know what makes it worth it?
To watch someone progress  to have them watch you
Someone that you respect and value and cry to
It's something so comforting  'cause it could bring so much truth
But then magic can be stagnant and the relationship doesn't move
The commitments to yourself  and that you're always learning
To acknowledge you're both perfect and still wanna keep working
To progress as a person  but as an individual entity
And then come together as a unit but still maintain that identity
It sounds so elementary  but it's so complex
The most delicate balance to get away from attachments
To keep defining and redefining what love and commitment is
Sing that  come on

But the lump in my throat builds as the heart rips open up
And not even your voice alone can shift to go and close it shut
So I just let it flow through me
Feeling lifted from the spirit like the bag in American Beauty
And if your life truly flashes in front of you
When you die just know the best time of my life has been loving you
I love you  you know
Let's get 'em  come on
We been together
But in my head
We would break apart
I would hold my heart  tied inside
But you knew that my soul
Could not be
Given to anybody
Easily  woah-oh-oh
Woah-oh-oh
Woah-oh-oh  woah-oh-oh

The L.A. County Coroner's office ruled the rapper's death accidental and attributed it to a combination of...
Apnea?
Yes
And syrup  and we know that syrup on the streets usually has codeine?
Absolutely  we have a problem now with the cough syrup epidemic...
He rolled up  asked him what he was sippin' on
That's the same stuff Weezy's sippin'  huh?
And tons of other rappers that be spittin' hard
Yup  he had five up on
Then went and passed him that Styrofoam
The Easter Pink  heard a rhyme before
Finally got to see what all the hype was on
And then he took a sip  sittin' in the Lincoln
Thinking he was pimpin' as he listened to the system
Little did he know that it was just as addictive as base
Not the kind of hit from the kick drum
Hotbox  let the bass bump
Take it to the face  gulp
Months later the use went up
Every blunt was accompanied by the pink stuff
But goddamn  he loved that feeling
Purple rain coated in the throat  just so healin'
Medicine alleviate the sickness
Liquid affix and it comes with a cost
Tryna escape the skin that barely fit him
Gone  get another bottle just to get a couple swallows
Headed towards the bottom couldn't get off it
Didn't even think he had a problem
Though he couldn't sleep without gettin' nauseous
Room spinnin'
Thinkin' he might have sipped just a little bit too much of that cough syrup
His eyelids closed  shut
Sat back in the chair clutchin' that cup
Girlfriend came and a couple hours later
Said his name  shook him but he never got up
He never got up  he never got up
We live on the cusp of death thinkin' that it won't be us
It won't be us  it won't be us  it won't be us
Nah  it won't be us

Follow the formula: violence  drugs  and sex sells
So we try to sound like someone else
This is not Californication
There's no way to glorify this pavement
Syrup  Percocet  and an eighth a day
Will leave you broke  depressed  and emotionally vacant

No music made  feelin' like a failure
And trust me  it's not dope to be twenty-five
And move back to your parents' basement

I've seen what they can be denied
And weed's not a drug  that's denial

Growing up nobody ever does
Until you're stuck

Hollywood  here we come
Is it changing the music?
Um  I can only speak for myself personally  you know what I'm saying?
Um  we had been taking down  toning down the content of certain things in the music lately
My new album  of course  probably won't have any references to cough syrup in it
But  uh  it's a little bit more than the music

Back to that lying deception  back to the self-will
The dirt that you've done and the secrets that we swept up under the rug that are gonna die with us

That I finally gave up on the scissors

Numb to it all and ignoring it

The Penis Song
(Oh no  he didn't) (Honkey dick)
This is my penis song
I wish that I had a bigger shlong
One that was quite a bit more thick and way more long
One of those porno king kong dongs
I'm above average on inches but I wanted damn double digits
If I had a big ol' cock what would I do?
I'd probably go to Florida and show it to Trina and screw
Get butt naked and start streaking at my school
And get arrested but at least the girls would be impressed
With my third leg and  and then I'd go to a keg and
Do a keg stand  get drunk and do the running man
With no clothes on just to show off
My dick's bigger than yours when mine is cold and soft
Haha  oh yeah
I forgot that's not really the cock that I have
I went out and party-bagged 'em and quickly opened the package
And it fit me like Kriss Kross's old school starter jackets
Tryna convince myself like  Size doesn't matter
Anyways I'd probably just put it on backwards  I mean
I know that God made us all different and special
But shit did he really have to invent lopsided testicles?

I promise  I'm so self conscious
That's why you never see me skinny dippin' in August
Always walkin' around with my hands in my pockets
Tryna pump blood into my guy Alfonso
I mean  goddamn I don't think you girls understand
I've had a complex since that song Short Short Man
And even though girls have told me that I'm big
When I watch a porno I feel like a little kid
I mean  let's take Ron Jeremy
Now if a girl sees him she'll compare him to me
And every MC in hip-hop has got a huge cock
Or at least talks about it in every song that they drop
I mean  shit
If I was really hung I'd make a whole album called Me and My Dick
With interludes of all the girls that I'd been with
And talk about my package and multiple orgasms
'Cause all that I see is that size does matter
But when it all adds up you can't really change it
I'm not a porno star  I just gotta face it
This is my penis song
I wish that I had a bigger shlong
One that was quite a bit more thick and way more long
With that dude who thought he was so cool
Walking around like everybody should know who  he is
Like he was some superstar in the biz
Just because he had a Japanese car and some rims
It's silly ain't it?
It goes to show how tainted
Cause these hoes jocked him like he was somebody who supposedly made it
And I'm not hating man  the dude was my boy
But I watched girl after girl get their world destroyed
Now when a squirrels a squirrel and a nut is a nut
And I seen a lot of girls cut so they could get stuffed
Or at least be cool in the high school soap opera
Cause kids do anything to be popular
Guys get their hair cut so girls can jock ya
But if girls get with guys their known as a trick
But if a dude does the same shit  he's known as a pimp
And the question is: Is there really a difference?
Remember that girl in high school that everyone wanted to hit?
She wore them dresses with the bestest breasteses the size of Texas
And she sat next to you in third period
She powdered her face but her skin had no flaws
Her tits looked like she wore three wonderbras
Thank God for that math book you put on your lap to
Cover up your jeans when your dick got hard
I mean she was amazing I'm not playing
You were like 14 but she was still the kind of girl you wanted a baby with
And I could tell the way that she would rock them pants
That a lot of dudes hit it but she wanted a chance
You talked to her  but she gave you the shoulder
She was the type of girl that was cold as Boulder
She'd only mess with ya if you drove a Rover
What I push? Well fuck it
Let's just say a bucket. OK
Anyway one day I rocked a show
And I see her right there chilling up in the front row
Next time I go to my math class for sho' she's talking about
Hey yo bro  I didn't know that you flowed
Hey yo what's up with that CD? Maybe we could eat lunch after P.E
Ah hee hee hee hee hee

The one that never stuck out  she kind of looked like whatever
Kinda nerdy  never came to the parties
She went home after school and never really chilled with nobody
She was in one of your classes and used to wear glasses
With braces that accented her pimples that weren't really attractive
But she was good in Spanish and let you cheat off her answers
But when you'd see her in the hall you would walk right past her
You acted like a bastard and never treated her right
Cause her body wasn't buckling and her face wasn't tight
Well guess what
See that beautiful girl with the big butt
Standing at the incense shop reading the poetry that she writes
That's her. Oh hell nah  I know that's not her
Take off the overalls and the baggy sweatshirt
Yeah there she is  reading about her words
Shit  man I'mma go spit some game
Wait I see some resemblance from like way back in the day
I rememeber that girl that only liked me cause I rhymed
And now I'm really only talking to this girl cause she looks fine
Back when she was normal I wouldn't give her my time
Shit that's crazy
I kinda feel sleezy
If I could flip the scenario
I'm the same as these hoes
 my uncle was
 tears rushing down my face
 like
 I'm good at little league
 that's gay gets dropped on the daily

So much that I have no choice but to die from the drugs or blow out my fucking brain

Hit the booth and I’m well aware of what I’m doin’
If I confuse you with the humor I’m preparing them for the movement
I’ve been alive before and every person’s got a purpose
Most don’t observe it or know what they’re striving towards
Only you can light the torch
Cause you won’t survive the war if you don’t know what the fuck it is you’re fighting for

Combined with being tempted to just accept it

Now if you contain anything in a cage
Its natural tendency is going to try to be escape right?
When these kids get out of the gates and face life
If you raised them as a criminal what do you estimate they’ll behave like?
The ratio is 80 something percent of kids who get locked up again or go straight to the pen
And that’s strange right
So they can make sure that America remains white
Most of the neighborhoods are like cages they try and escape and
If the American dream is to make it
Take it

Started to use my sentences as reflections
And what I saw was God was in all of us
And we'd all come to be interconnected
And all that was depended on all of us

So  turn my sound up
Ricochet off our mountain
It's Good Medicine that Chief Sealth would've been proud of
And never will be stopped
They tryin' to shut down the clubs that my city rocks
Now Mr. Mayor why would you enforce an ordinance?
Music it saves lives  these kids out here are supporting it
And through the art form we've learned the importance of community
Truth to the youth so they know what's up
Yup  and as a public school student
I learned from my teachers  but became through my music
Take that away  that's a vital
My greatest teachers: B-Self and Vita
Wordsayer was my mayor and things have changed
But I carry the torch and what I do with that flame
Is lit every time that I step on the stage
The skyline is etched in my veins
You can never put that out  no matter how hard it rains

Northwest  making you feel the vibe
Check how Seattle do  coming to my side
I mean I like how y'all do
Thank you  but we onto new
Put it down for the town with music
Making you feel the vibe
Check how Seattle do  coming to my side
When my peeps know my crew bring the flame
Put it down for the town
Wearing that Seattle blue
That's right  when you put on a show
And watch the people seat in between the creases and the doors
Hitting up Meli or sneaking in 'cause they're broke
Not leaving in between sets because of needing to smoke
The reason being whatever
The scene from Beacon to Everett
Is in need of less ego when we kick it  alright?
Try to reach 'em at the bar where they're drinking Miller Lite
Make noise throughout the show and not only when we ask 'em to
I watch the older cats jaded in the back
Hatin' at the concert
I know it's not the same  it never will be
And we've been truly dope
Since Supreme was up on Broadway in the dookie rope
Mean muggin' in Sir Mixalot's video
Back when Scene was rockin' house parties on the floor
Back when Marc introduced Geo to Sabz
So much has changed here  so much has not
I was just a kid hopin' I could earn my spot
Try to get some props
Meet a promoter who'll give me a shot
To let me get up on stage and get the crowd to rock
Read a page out my notebook
What I thought would be respected  they would connect with it
Now looking over the city's the only thing that keeps me calm
Scattered thoughts jotted down by this pen in my palm
It's like my city stands still  the world looks on
Flag wavin'  flag wavin' at a patriot's house
Lookin' for change on the couch
Imagine tryna keep your head
While your daughter sleeps in bed
And when she wakes up  will the world be the same?
Will my girl be afraid in the home of the brave?
But what a hell'uva a night
Humanity is a privilege  we can't give in
When they build walls  we'll build bridges
This is resistance  we're resilient
When they spread hate  we shine brilliant
March by the millions 'til they hear the children
We found ourselves at a distance
Open up the jails and the overcrowded cells
When we oppress anyone  we oppress ourselves
Greatest gift I ever learned is helpin' someone else
You feel fully fulfilled 'cause you forget about yourself
Love everyone regardless of the God they worship
This isn't the apocalypse
We can't address the hate 'til we acknowledge it
If Jesus was alive  would he let Mohammed in?
This isn't nature  my daughter hugs strangers
We teach fear and preach hatred
Put up a fence  scared to meet our neighbors
Think that if we let them in  they'll take advantage of us later
There's so much anger in this world as I raise her
My daughter  hope it's a dream when I wake up tomorrow

Bad taste  bad taste in my mouth
Flag wavin  flag wavin' at a patriot's house
Lookin' for change in the couch
Imagine tryna keep your head
While your daughter sleeps in bed
And when she wakes up  will the world be the same?
Will my girl be afraid in the home of the brave?
But what a hell'uva a night
And we fight for the people that haven't had a voice
Fight for the first amendment  fight for freedom of choice
Fight for women's rights  if she does or doesn't carry
We ride for all the queer folk and fight for all to get married
I'm not moving to Canada  not fleein' the nation
No time for apathy  no more tears and no complainin'
Gotta fight harder for the next four and what we're faced with
Got my daughter in my arms and he is not gonna raise her
Bad taste  bad taste in my mouth
Glad wave  I'm glad wavin' at a Patriot's house
Lookin' for change in the couch
Imagine tryna keep your head
While your daughter sleeps in bed
And when she wakes up  will the world be the same?
Will my girl be afraid in the home of the brave?
But am I just another white boy who has caught on to the trend?
When I take a step to the mic is hip-hop closer to the end?
'Cause when I go to shows the majority have white skin
And white rappers' albums really get the most spins
The face of hip-hop has changed a lot since Eminem
Where's my place in a music that's been taken by my race
Culturally appropriated by the white face?
And we don't want to admit that this is existing
So scared to acknowledge the benefits of our white privilege
'Cause it's human nature to want to be part of something different
Especially when your ancestors are European Christians
And most whites don't want to acknowledge this is occurring
Of being black in a system that really wants you to rock
'Cause all you need is a program and you can go and make hip-hop
And we hate the mainstream 'cause we're the ones that took it
Now we listen to Aesop Rock and wear t-shirts that say Brooklyn
I mean good music is good music regardless of what you look like
But when you don't give them props isn't that selfish?
That's like saying rock was actually started by Elvis
So where does this leave me?
I give everything I have when I write a rhyme
But that doesn't change the fact that this culture's not mine

This is something that's effortless and shouldn't be hard
But we still owe 'em 40 acres now we've stolen their 16 bars
Hip-hop started off on a block that I've never been to
To counteract a struggle that I've never even been through
If I think I understand just because I flow too
Hip-hop started off on a block that I've never been to
To counteract a struggle that I've never even been through
If I think I understand just because I flow too
But I don't rap about guns 'cause I wasn't forced into the projects
See I was put in the position where I could choose my options
Blessed with the privilege that my parents could send me to college
Or the white people with dough that can relate to my content?
What happened to jazz and rock and roll is happening right now
Where's my place in the music that's been taken by the media
With white corporations controlling what they're feedin' ya?
And I speak freely when I write this
And this is so true
And we got good at it so we should be rappin'
But only supporting them is like burning Jimi and buying Clapton
So here comes history and the cultural appropriation
White kids with do-rags trying to practice their accents
But hip-hop is not just memorizing words
This is something that's effortless and shouldn't be hard
Hip-hop started off on a block that I've never been to
To counteract a struggle that I've never even been through
