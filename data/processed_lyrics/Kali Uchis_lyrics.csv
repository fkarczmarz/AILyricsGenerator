"Eventually comes back to you
So you gotta be careful  baby
And look both ways before you cross my mind
What he might be going through on his own  and
The demons that he's facing alone
(Sometimes it hurts  baby)
I hate that sometimes I can't go home
And it just ain't the same on the phone  no
But everybody's gotta go on  don't they?
So if you need a hero (If you need a hero)
Just look in the mirror (Just look in the mirror)
No one's gonna save you now
So you better save yourself
And everybody's hurting
Everybody's going through it
But you just can't give up now
'Cause you gotta save yourself

The sun'll come out
Nothing good ever comes easy
I know times are rough
But winners don't quit  so don't you give up
The sun'll come out
But we've been struggling endlessly
Someday we'll find the love
'Cause after the storm's when the flowers bloom
Kali  what you mean? I take it offensive
'Cause I'm the hottest flower boy that popped up on the scene
Feeling better  better than ever
'Cause your umbrella  -brella (-brel-la)
Sun is beaming on me like headlights beaming on Bambi
Now let's pretend the street is the room and you are a Camry
'Cause you drive me candy  the Tito to my Randy
The sun'll come out
Nothing good ever comes easy
I know times are rough
But winners don't quit  so don't you give up
The sun'll come out
But we've been struggling endlessly
Someday we'll find the love
'Cause after the storm—
I know it's hard
But did you even really try?
Maybe you could understand
When all you had to do was ask
And just open your mind
When everything is passing by
And all you had to do was try
Yeah  all you had to do was try
And all you had to do was try
Half a love never meant shit to me
If your heart never could yield to me
It's all or nothing
Cause I would much rather be lonely
Please don't bring your lips so close
Don't smile or I'll get lost
My heart might grow dizzy and fall
And if I fell for the spell of your call
I'd get lost in the undertow
And that's why I gotta say no
All or nothing
Half a love never meant shit to me
If your heart never could yield to me
It's all or nothing
Why cry for somethin' that might have been?
If it's love there is no in between
See I've been runnin' from reality
But now I just need some stability
I only speak out of sincerity
And now it's clear that your case is charity
So please don't ask me why I gotta leave

All or nothing
Having love never appealed to me
If your heart never could yield to me
Mmm-mmm-mmm
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
I wanna know if you want to
I wanna go if you want to go
I'm sick and tired of talking
Told you everything you need to know
'Cause the rest is in the body language
Do you hear me? Can you feel me now?
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Didn't wanna have to do it
Didn't wanna be the one to say
Never wanted to go through it
I think about it most every day
There's no tracking where I'm going
There's no me for them to find
(I wanna know who you are)
 just call me (call me  call me)
 I'm evolving

 I'ma give it to you
 I wanna give it right to you

Varias veces en el día  como agua y el sol
Escúchame cuando te digo porque esto es importante
Desde que yo despierto quiero sentir mi amante
Dame  dame besos cuando yo abro mis ojos
Dame  dame besos pa' decir buenas noches
Sin amor  soy una flor que está a punto de morir
Es una vista triste  no me dejes así
Lo que quiero es besitos  algo bien simple y sencillo
Dame  dame besitos from my head down to my toes

Cintura como Shakira  ven y muévelo así
Vuela mosquita muerta
Que anda celosa en la puerta
Está más tensa que una faja
Con esa cara de envidiosa

Gracias por venir

Your cigarette burnt holes all through my t-shirt
They say don't blame the player but he played the game
It's no fun to feel like a fool
When you learn your baby don't belong to you
When you learn your baby don't belong to you
Love you for being sick and twisted
But pussy is a hell of an addiction
My heart went through a shredder
The day I learned about your baby mothers
But I still run all my errands in your sweater
They say don't blame the player but he played the game

But you're much better in my dreams
I wanna spend the day in bed
Gotta get up and get me something
Gotta get up and get me something real
 cuando eso no pasó? (Wow)
 you must've really lost it
 livin' like a queen
 you're so sorry
 but not me
 but not me
 whatever makes you feel better
 she'd eat my pussy if I let her
 she'd trade lives with me if God let her
 whatever makes you feel better

 everybody hates me
I wish you love  I wish you well
I wish you roses while you can still smell 'em
With pretty flowers can come the bee sting (Ooh  never thought I would be without you)
But I wish you love  I wish you well
I wish you roses while you can still smell 'em
I was a rose in a garden of weeds
My petals are soft and silky as my sheets
So do not be afraid to get pricked by the thorns
While I'm here  I'm someone to honor
When I'm gone  I'm someone to mourn
But if you and my heart should someday drift apart
I'll make surе to give you these blеssings because they're all I've got
My love's deep as the ocean  don't you drown on me
Just know  any love I gave you's forever yours to keep
Ooh  I wish you roses and roses and roses and roses and roses
Ooh  I wish you roses and roses and roses and roses and roses
Ooh  never thought I would be without you
I wish you love  I wish you well

I'm a dream girl
I'm never stressing my bills  nobody ever gets killed
It's the dream wo-wo-wo-world
My mama's never on coke  this isn't my way to cope
Washin' my mind out with soap (Ooh-oh-oh  ooh-oh-oh)
Everything is just wonderful here in my dreams  here in my dreams
Every day is a holiday when you're living inside your dreams
Why would anyone stay awake after being so sound asleep?
Everything is just wonderful in my dreams
He's never messing around  he's always holding it down
He's my dream boy
We bought a house in the clouds  so we can only look down
It's the dream wo-wo-wo-world
Don't ever worry or care  except to pick what to wear
Why isn't everyone here? (Ooh-oh-oh  ooh-oh-oh)

Is your heart a gaping hole?
How come I didn't see that in you?
How come I can forgive you?
And if you loved me  you'd never do this
Forever is for dreamers (for dreamers)
And it's foolish to not know you're a schemer
It's silly I think of our unborn children
'Cause all I'm thinking about right now is how I’ll never know 'em
And if you loved me  you would never do this
Our future's battered and bloody  you're so fucking ruthless
They say one door open when another door close
I'm prayin' that's the way that it goes
'Cause right when I'm 'bout to turn the door knob
It seems it's all locked up and the key decomposed
Remind me this the life that I chose
Go full speed
I can't read the signs that say stop
I brush it off and try to act all nonchalant  yeah
I notice everything  I just act like I don't
Boy  I know what I want (I know)
Yeah  I know what I want (Just what)

You swear that you're grown
It's five in the morn'

Don't want to be ignored
All o' sudden you're not into me
And maybe it's not deliberate
And I know you never asked me
I just gotta put it out there
I don't put myself out there
'Cause I was a loner until I met you
And I let you in after all the persuasion
That's why I'd rather be a loner (loner)

Maybe I'm just trying way too hard to keep you
You're an angel and I'm blessed
So I am trying to do my best
Want you to know how very nice it was to meet you
So much time I spend to find something that I could call mine
Something real  out of all these phony people
And I know our past is tainted
But I'm willing  if you're willing
I'll be see through
Can you take this chance on me?
(You won't regret it  c'mon and get it)
Love is like the lottery
Can you take this chance on me?
(You won't regret it  c'mon and get it)
You're the only one I see
Yeah  we had issues
Can we dismiss those?
If to you I am indebted  don't expect you to forget it
But it's only gonna stop us if we let it
Yeah  it hit me like a gunshot
And from then 'til my burial plot
I'mma roll these dice until I hit the jackpot
Baby  I know I learned my lesson
Love was never my profession
I'm just learning as we're growing and progressing
No  I never meant to hurt you
It's myself  I didn't virtue
Now my mind is ready to give our love nurture

Take one look at you
You're heaven's incarnate
What is this spell  baby?
Please show some mercy
Melting like an ice cream when you smile
Melting  you're a daydream
Stay a while
I pray that I can learn to be funny
I'm watching every stand-up comedy
Just hoping that it will rub off on me
So you'll smile at everything I say
You got some soft lips and some pearly whites (pearly whites)
I wanna touch them in the dead of night (dead of night)
Your smile ignites just like a candlelight (candlelight)
Then somehow I know everything's alright

Bienvenidos a Miami
(How you gonna pay 'em all?)
When I was just a little girl (I was just a little girl)
Had my sight set on a bigger world
Got myself a visa
And started catching flights to where the grass is greener
They look at me funny when I write a check
'Cause they assumed I would be paying in sex
(I found one)
He said he'd want me in his video like Bound 1
(Like Bound 1)

Can you please pick up your phone?
I don't know  I don't know why you're not answering

That broke the straw on top the camel's back  get over the hump
It's what I tell myself to tell you but I'm pressing my luck
Don't mean to press your buttons
Shouldn't have unbuttoned the jeans
I'd make it worse if I admit it didn't mean anything
Or maybe it's just a dream

Alright baby  I don't know what you think I was doing
But  who's going to treat you better than me?
Let's just be honest here...

But shit  what's really going on?
