lyrics
"You and me in our first dance
The lives of those
We lost in once sweet embrace
Since those days our world has changed
Our love remains the same
God knows we have had our share of saving grace
And I am proud of all the blessings
You have given me
The mountains we have climbed to get this far
You learn to take the laughter with the tears
After all these year
You make it feel brand new
After the fires that we walked thru
Against the odds we never lost our faith
In our hearts we have made our home
Where our children all have grown
Precious moments time cannot erase
We have been living up and down the gypsy highway
Seasons that we have learned to share apart
Somehow in my heart I always keep you near me
After all these years
After all these years
You stood by me
The days and nights that I was gone
After all these years
And you stood strong
Because with our love there's nothing left to fear
 love is gone
  after you fall....
That's the way you need it
Any way you want it
She loves to laugh
She loves to sing
She does everything
She loves to move
She loves to groove
She loves the loving things
All night
So hold tight
Hold tight
Any way you want it
That's the way you need it
Any way you want it

What's that chip on your shoulder?
Outside we saw a rainbow
Inside is where the heart grows
Picking up the pieces
Something more to believe in
As you search the embers
Nothing comes easy
You've got some fascination
With your high expectations
This love is your obsession
Let down your defenses
Open up to the one who cares

Getting close to an overload
Up against a no win situation

When you can't give no more
They want it all but you gotta say no
I'm turning off the noise that makes me crazy
Lookin' back with no regrets
To forgive is to forget
I want a little peace of mind to turn to

Walking and talking and laughing
About dreaming the things that you want will work out
People in places where you want to be

City of the angels
With cold steel magnum force is how the man possessed the skill
He shot a man in Paris
He did a job in L.A

She took the midnight train goin' anywhere
Just a city boy  born and raised in South Detroit
He took the midnight train goin' anywhere
A singer in a smoky room
The smell of wine and cheap perfume
For a smile  they can share the night
It goes on and on and on and on
Strangers waitin'
Up and down the boulevard
Their shadows searchin' in the night
Streetlights  people
Livin' just to find emotion
Hidin' somewhere in the night
Workin' hard to get my fill
Everybody wants a thrill
Payin' anything to roll the dice
Just one more time

Now this time you've gone too far
You're performance perfect
In every way perfect!
I hear rumors all around
Contracts and lawyers
And champagne downtown
Tell me what you think
You want me to do
I've been always fair with you
Turning on me
After all we've been through
You want trouble then that's just
The way it will be
You're caught up in the power
A blue magical maze
Now the circle is broken
In a spellbinding rage
Better see if you're holding
The wrong edge of the blade
If it's sharp  if it cuts
Living his world like he wants to
Turns a boy in to a fighting man
They won't take me
They won't break me
No one could tell him what to do
Had to learn everything the hard way
I'm telling you that he's nobody's fool
They won't take me
They won't break me
I'm finally out in the clear and I'm free
I've got dreams I'm living for
I'm moving on where they'll never find me
Rolling on to anywhere
Just when you think you had it all figured out
Running scared can change your mind
I never knew I had so much to give
How hard times can fool you
Feeling good out on your own
I've got dreams I'm living for
I'll break away
This is my escape
I'll break away
 you're on my mind
 sleep alone tonight
 it's been you and me
 always another show
 oh-oh
All the good times that you saved
When the summer's gone
She'll be there... standing by the light
She should know wrong from right
Is she feeling?

Lonely dreamer  left to choose
I don't know where the love is  there's a promise undone
Someone's crying in a room all alone
Shadows fall  after the hurt is gone
Through it all  we love and we lose
Where is the one  someone who's happy (happy to give)
Who's happy (happy to give) happy to give you love
A song for the singer  one book of dreams
Take this heartache  away from me

(Happy to give)  oo happy to give
Oh somebody's happy to give you love
I..Don't care..No more about your face
No you..Make me mad...The way you cat around
And all your sexy ways
Do you got another lover now
Do you think it's me you're fooling now
No..No
Oh....I can see it in your eyes
Ever since you walked away
Said your last goodbye
Oh...I can see it in your eyes
All the damage has been done
No more alibis
Oh you...never hear
A single word I say
No you..turn away
Where do you disappear
Oh I've had enough
You need to get a life
It's all..so tired
I think I'm out of here

The silver dreams you hate to lose

Well keep your faith. Do what you choose
You can hear the thunder of their cry
Ahead of their time
They wonder why
In the shadows of a golden age
A generation waits for dawn
Brave carry on
Bold and the strong
Only the young can say
They're free to fly away
Sharing the same desires
Burning like wildfire
They are seeing through the promises
And all the lies they dare to tell
Is it heaven or hell?

Suzanne...no no no no no remember
From the moment she looked my way. I was so hypnotized
The eyes of a woman  there's nowhere to run
The eyes of a woman
In the arms of an angel  in a dangerous disguise
Love's a blue fascination
It's a mystery that burns  takes a lifetime to learn
The eyes of a woman  there's nowhere to run
The eyes of a woman  my fears come undone
In the eyes of a woman  there's nowhere to run
The eyes of a woman  my fears come undone
Let the light shine out of darkness
Fallen down but not destroyed
It's just another trial by fire
In my song I'll send a prayer
Where the will to face this shame
It's just another trial by fire
Hello Mr. Moon
Can I have some time with you
Trouble keep me running
You can see it coming
I know who shines down on you
Hello Mr. Moon
I've come back to talk to you
All my life I'm running
From the love that's coming
Saving grace please pull me through
In my doubt I can't believe
Like a wave tossed where the wind blows
Tears of faith temper my soul
Cold empty side walks
Miles away from trusting someone
Far from giving up
Young blood  cry tough
Mean street run
There's a hunger inside you
Desperate rebel runaway
Far from giving up
You'll end  long nights
Chasing the moon
War with yourself
Makes you feel better
Caught behind the lines
Troubles child
Faith finds a cure
It makes you feel better
You know you can shine
Troubled child

Of the memories of you... oh my dear
And I see your face
In your eyes I walk without fear
We're together again
Where the love never ends
Because you're right here
When I think of you
Hold on... just for a while
Hold on... hold on

I try to forget the night that you left
I can dream once again
Where the love never ends
Because you're right here
I said that I'd never fall again
Within myself I was wrong
I know that
When you love a woman
You see your world inside her eyes
When you love a woman
You know she's standing by your side
A joy that lasts forever
There's a band of gold that shines waiting somewhere
If I can't believe that someone is true
To fall in love is so hard to do
I hope and pray tonight
Somewhere you're thinking of me girl
When you love a woman
You see your world inside her eyes
When you love a woman
You know she's standing by your side
A joy that lasts forever
There's a band of gold that shines waiting somewhere

It's enough to make you cry
When you see her walking by
And you look into her eyes
When you love a woman
You see your world inside her eyes
When you love a woman
You know she's standing by your side
A joy that lasts forever
There's a band of gold that shines waiting somewhere
When you love a woman
When you love a woman
And still they try to see
Why something good can hurt so bad
Caught on a one-way street
The taste of bittersweet
One love feeds the fire
One heart burns desire
Two hearts born to run
Who'll be the lonely one?
I wonder who's crying now?
So many stormy nights
So many wrongs or rights
Neither could change
Their headstrong ways
And in a lover's rage
They tore another page
The fighting is worth
The love they save

One love feeds the fire
One heart burns desire
I wonder who's crying now?
Two hearts born to run
Who'll be the lonely one?
I wonder who's crying now?
Only so many tears you can cry
'Till the heartache is over
And now you can say your love
Will never die
Whoooooa-oh-whoa
Whoooa-oh
One love feeds the fire
One heart burns desire
Wonder who's crying now?
Two hearts born to run
Who will be the lonely one?
Precious moments  you and me
We've been old friends  all through the years
Picture postcards  sharing tears
(Chorus)
Need you tonight  lover don't fade away
I've seen your city lights
As I walk away
Why can't this night...go on forever
(Verse)
Without love  we won't survive
Run together  we rule the night
Tell me secrets  oh that make you cry
Where's the laughter  we gotta try
(Chorus)
What's in our hearts  there's never time to say
Need you tonight  lover don't fade away
Like a photograph
That time won't erase
Why can't this night...go on forever

Like the stars at night
I covered you with love
Like a blanket on a cold winter's night
I covered you with joy
To make your lifetime big and bright
You touched me with your eyes
Soft as an evening breeze
You held me in your arms
As the winds rushed through the trees
You are my child
You make my lifetime big and bright
You are my child
You came like the winds of March
With all the love in your eyes
You are my child
You came like the morning lights
You are my child
You came like the morning light"
