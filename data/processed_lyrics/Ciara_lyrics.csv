lyrics
"All I need is somebody that's down for me
And he don't have to have money
And it feels so real
And I
Know that he won't break my heart
And I
Know that we won't ever part
And I
Wanna be with him forever
They can say that I am crazy
And it feels so real

And I
And I
Know that we won't ever part (We won't ever part)
And I (And I)
Wanna be with him forever (Wanna be with him)

And all of the things that you do
I need you (I need you)
So believe me (I do)

'Cause I love you (I love you)
They don't know how I feel
'Cause I know this is real
And I
And I
Know that we won't ever part (We won't ever part)
And I (And I)
Wanna be with him forever (Wanna be with him)
And I
And I
Know that we won't ever part (He won't ever part)
 I'll go to war

 running with romance
 ever since you came in my life

 I know this can't be wrong
 happy tears every night (damn)
 I'm your soldier
 you're my soldier
 cause I love ya)
 I'm your soldier
 I come in no time
Don't hesitate goin' the speed tonight
No time to waste
We can get away
So baby come with me
And I'll fulfill your fantasy
You can get anywhere that you wanna
Tonight it's all on me
Come lay it down on me
Now we're together
We gonna be bumpin' up in them streets
I feel the pressure
I got that overdrive you need
You got me right there where where you want me
Your hands on on my body
This feels so right
That's how I like it
That's the way that I like to (Uh)

You got me right there where where you want me (Right where)
This feels so right (Uh)

You got me right here where you want me
Your hands all on my body
This feels so right
Let's park it right here that's how I like it
(Backseat) Windows up
(Backseat) Windows up
(Backseat) Windows up (That's the way that I like to)
To wake up everyday knowing I am loved by you
I can't believe it
What did I do to deserve someone to hold me like you do?
If nobody's perfect
Then all that I want is to be imperfect with you
'Cause you take me as I am
And I take you as you are
With your heart in weathered hands
And the bruises on my heart
That make me who I am
That make you who you are
Baby  when you take my hand
You show me that my scars are beauty marks
Oh  beauty marks
Beauty marks
I look in the mirror  and I see all my flaws
But you see light in all I do
Now I'm realizing that the uglyness I saw
There are pretty things to you

And I don't have to cover anything  I share it all
I don't have to hide from the truth
'Cause you take me as I am
And I take you as you are
With your heart in weathered hands
And the bruises on my heart
That make me who I am
That make you who you are
Baby  when you take my hand
You show me that my scars are beauty marks
Oh  beauty marks
Beauty marks
Now I know why you love me
So real  it feels like a dream
No looking back to the past
It was all part of the plan
I feel the love in your haze
Boy  when you touch me like that
The way you love every part
You show me my scars are beauty marks  beauty marks
'Cause you take me as I am
And I take you as you are
With your heart in weathered hands
And the bruises on my heart
That make me who I am
That make you who you are
Baby  when you take my hand
 it's just me and you

Ciara
Just one dose of me will have you addicted
To know me is to love me  I handle my business
Any city any town - touch down  I do my thing
When you look at me baby you should see a way out
Out the headache an stress you done been through before
It's only been three months and I already got it bad
So hood that I keep on coming back
My girlfriend's telling me I don't know how to act
He's so good and he knows how to love me
But so hood and he's so heavy in the streets
He's my dude and you better get used to things
And I don't care what you say about me
They say

Tatted on his chest (Uh-huh)
And they say (That he's gonna hurt me)
Just wait and see (But they don't know me)
'Cause I am what he wants his girl and I love it
I can't leave 'em alone
It's just that he know what I want
I can't leave 'em alone
It's just that he know what I want
Always tell me that no one could compare to me
But couldn't handle it when other guy was staring at me
Now the top lays back so everyone could look at me
From the A to hills up in Beverly
He's so fly that he knows how to carry me
Tatted on his chest (Uh-huh)
And they say (That he's gonna hurt me)
Just wait and see (But they don't know me)
'Cause I am what he wants his girl and I love it
I can't leave 'em alone
It's just that he know what I want
I can't leave 'em alone
It's just that he know what I want
I'll move an eighth for that girl  I'll move a half for that boy
Then I flip that (Double up) kick back (Cuddle up)
Your friends try to confuse but you know what
And be happy you're my girl 'cause I'm happy I'm your man (I can't)
I can't leave 'em alone (I can't leave 'em alone)
It's just that he know what I want
I can't leave 'em alone (I can't keep)
It's just that he know what I want (I know what I want)
I can't leave 'em alone (Ah)
It's just that he know what I want (So bad)
Leave you all alone
Leave you all alone

R. Kelly on the radio  let it play
It's funny I ain't even drink shit and I'm so intoxicated
I think I'm over my limit when you're near me
You got your hands on my thigh
I've got my hand on the wheel and the other
I'd rather not play shy
I'm running every light  I can’t concentrate on the road
Losing all control
All because I’m driving under
The influence of your love
I’m driving under
The influence of your touch
I might have to pull over
I might have to pull over
I bet the law would arrest me
If they knew what I was thinkin'
I’m sure it looks a little crazy  but I’m loving it
So put them handcuffs on me
Keep talking to me dirty
I'mma put it on cruise control as I let go

I’m driving under
The influence of your touch
I might have to pull over
I might have to pull over
I might have to pull over
I might have to pull over
And it’s so hard to steer
Put your lips to my ear
But I’m giving you the right of way
Do what you want to me  baby
Lipstick all over your neck
These seats are dripping with sweat
Here’s a night we won’t forget
Driving under
The influence of your love
I’m driving under
The influence of your touch
I might have to pull over
I might have to pull over
I might have to pull over
I might have to pull over

I see the girls walk by dressed in their summer clothes
I have to turn my head until my darkness goes
I see a line of cars and they’re all painted black
With flowers and my love both never to come back
I see people turn their heads and quickly look away
I look inside myself and see my heart is black
Maybe then I’ll fade away and not have to face the facts
It’s not easy facing up when your whole world is black
No more will my green sea go turn a deeper blue
I could not foresee this thing happening to you
If I look hard enough into the setting sun
My love will laugh with me before the morning comes
