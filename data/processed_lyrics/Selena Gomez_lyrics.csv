" yeah  ah
 french kiss my worries all away
 you'll really wanna know where I've been all this time
 got two feet on the ground and felt what real is like
 out in the wild
 far from the crowds
 french kiss my worries all away
 how could it be?
 we'll find the things we seek  ooh-ee
 I'm mesmerized
 goodbye
 french kiss my worries all away (All away)
 oh woah
 my sweeter place
 oh woah
 my sweeter place
 french kiss my worries all away (All away)
 yeah  ooh
Thought that I could chase you with the cold evenin'
Let a couple years water down how I’m feelin' about you (Feelin' about you)
And every time we talk
Every single word builds up to this moment
And I gotta convince myself I don’t want it even though I do (Even though I do)
You could break my heart in two
I wanna hold you when I'm not supposed to
When I'm lyin' close to someone else
You're stuck in my head and I can't get you out of it
I know I'd go back to you
We never got it right
Playin’ and replayin' old conversations
Overthinkin' every word and I hate it
And what's the point in hidin'?
And I'll regret it if I didn't say
This isn't what it could be (Isn't what it could be)

When I'm lyin' close to someone else
I know I'd go back to you
I know I'd go back to you

I'd go back to you
I know I said I wasn't sure
But I'd go back to you
I know I'd go back to you
You can break my heart in two
It's just a thing you make me do
I know I'd go back to you
I wanna hold you when I'm not supposed to (When I'm not supposed to)
I'll go back to you
I know I'd go back to you (I'll go back to you)
I know I'd go back to you
Tryna distract myself
But then I see your face
Tryna play it coy
Tryna make it disappear
But just like the battle of Troy
There's nothing subtle here
Bigger than it used to be
Call me an amenity
Even if it's in my dreams
Not to think about you
Not to give in to you
You might also like
With my feelings on fire
Guess I'm a bad liar
I see how your attention builds
It's like looking in a mirror
Your touch like a happy pill
What could possibly happen next?
Can we focus on the love?
Paint my kiss across your chest
Not to think about you (Not to think about you)
Not to give in to you (Not to give in to you)
With my feelings on fire
Guess I'm a bad liar
Not to think about you (Think about you)
Not to give in to you (Not to give in to you)
With my feelings on fire
Tell 'em that it's my birthday
Every night's my birthday
Happy as can be
How do you do?
Come and meet the queen
Cake and cream
Blow your dreams away with me
Blow your dreams away with me (So yummy)

Like a diamond  I need a little pressure
So press me down till I scream
If you're the flame  I'm kerosene
I'm burning up  baby
All I need is your body heat right next to me
Burning up burning up  so give it up give it up
All I need is your body heat right next to me
I’m burning up baby  all I want is your body heat
Burning up burning up  so give it up give it up

Pretty restlessly
Think I might know why (Ah)

I want a boyfriend

 I broke your heart
 how can love die?
 it's like I could cry
 and it might just not help
 you
 how can love die?
I can't disguise myself
I've build these walls so high
And I can't climb myself
And just when I feel like fallin' down
You pick me up right off the ground
They can't keep between us two right now
They can't steal our love
They can't steal our love
They can't steal our love

I can't seem to choose what to do
There's nothing I can say

Breathe you in like you're in the air

Cause you're keeping me safe and warm
Even when I'm home alone
Wearing nothing but your cologne
Maybe you should call off the day

Running my mind cause my heart lost all control

La herida de tu amor sanó

Pero ahora este pecho es antibalas
No te tengo a ti  me tengo a mí
No es para que piense' que esto es pa' ti  nah
Yo me fui para que no se te olvide
De a una muerte como tú sе revive
Cuando se sеque el último mar
Es cuando pensaré en regresar
Está sobreentendido lo que siento
Ya no estás  qué bueno es el tiempo
Estoy curá' de ti  te dije ya
Ya no te siento aquí  no te siento ya

Is not
What it seems
The end will no doubt justify the means
You can fix any problem with the slightest of ease
But you might find out it'll go to your head
When you write a report on a book you never read
And that's what I said
Everything is not what it seems
When you can get all you wanted in your wildest dreams
You might run into trouble if you go to extremes
Because everything is not what it seems
There's always lot of people that you need to see
But you got a quick way to get from A to B
Just be careful who's aware of your reality
You'll know what I mean
There's a whole other world that you'll only know
When you can make yourself invisible from head-to-toe
Careful what you show

Be careful not to mess with the balance of things
Because everything is not what it seems
But it doesn't mean much to a girl like me
'Cause I could do the things you'd never believe
Even in your wildest dreams
It's like a catch twenty-two
Everything is not what it seems
When you can get all you wanted in your wildest dreams
You might run into trouble if you go to extremes
Because everything is not what it seems (Oh)
Everything is not what it seems
When you can have what you want by the simplest of means

 I'd do me too

 but I know you soft
 I'm so with it

Put a gold star on my disorder
I'm a sensitive situation (Mmm)
You're a hot and cold combination
But my kind of trouble likes your trouble too (Ah)

Now you say I got a touch
Make you never wanna leave
And syncopate my skin to your heart beating
Let me show you how proud I am to be yours

I ain't trying to fuck your business up
And I ain't trying to get you into stuff
But the way you touchin' on me in the club
Rubbin' on my miniature
Ain't worried bout no press and ain't worried bout the next bitch
They love the way you dress and ain't got shit up on you
Just met a bad bitch without the ass shots
Let me show you how proud I am to be yours
Leave this dress a mess on the floor
No matter how hard I'm trying to
I want you all to myself
You're metaphorical gin and juice
So come on give me a taste
Of what it’s like to be next to you
Won't let one drop go to waste
You're metaphorical gin and juice

Words were like licorice to the taste

And now I'm pretty sure I can't take no more
I can't take no more-ore

Every word is relief
I'm in dance floor therapy  all my babies and me
But tonight  it's for free
No self-sabotage  no letting my thoughts run
Me and this spiral are done
Burn this camouflage I've been wearing for months
Tryna let a little happy in for once
I need to let my mind rest
While my body reflects (Ooh)
Don't get me down  I won't let me get me (Ooh)
Don't get me down  I won't let me get me (Ooh)

They fell in love one summer
A little too wild for each other
Shiny 'til it wasn't
Feels good 'til it doesn't
It was her first real lover
His too 'til he had another
Trust levels went way down
Of course she was sad
But now she's glad she dodged a bullet (Mm)
Took a few years to soak up the tears

Of course she was sad
But now she's glad she dodged a bullet (Mm)
Took a few years to soak up the tears

She knows she'll find love (She knows)
Only if she wants it

I put you first and you adored it
Set fires to my forest
And you let it burn
Sang off-key in my chorus
'Cause it wasn't yours
I saw the signs and I ignored it
Rose-colored glasses all distorted
Set fire to my purpose
And I let it burn
You got off on the hurtin'
We'd always go into it blindly
I needed to lose you to find me
This dancing was killing me softly
I needed to lose you to love me

I needed to lose you to love me
You promised the world and I fell for it
I put you first and you adored it
Set fires to my forest
And you let it burn
Sang off-key in my chorus
I needed to lose you to love me
And now the chapter is closed and done

Just outside the 95
I got my chicas by my side
Nobody knows if we fake it
You like to watch while we shake it
I know we're making you thirsty
You want us all in the worst way
But you don't understand

Me and my girls

Tan skin looks damn good in white
Stripping down by the Hollywood sign

Takes you to a different place
A different space
Ooh  the smoke is getting closer
I can feel our young blood race
Through cityscapes
And everybody wants to be touched
Everybody wants to get some
But don't you play a song about love
When I move my body
I don't have to talk about none
Let the chemicals do its stuff
'Til the energy is too much
Yeah  all I need
Is the rhythm

And sweep it under the table so you would never know
Tryna fight somethin' that my eyes can't see
My mind and me
We don't get along sometimes
And it gets hard to breathe
But I wouldn't change my life
My mind and me
It's hard to talk and feel heard when you always feel like a burden

You can hold onto the sadness like a souvenir
Or you can close your eyes and see your life

You can tap into the strength you never knew you had
You can breathe into your faith no matter where you’re at
Just close your eyes and change your life
Like the air
Like the air you can
But you can rise with your mind and make your higher power proud
Like the air you can rise
