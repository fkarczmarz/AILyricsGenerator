lyrics
"And although sleep leaves me behind
There's nowhere I'd rather be
And now our bed is oh so cold
And I can sleep what side I want
It's not the same with you gone
But in that night you tore my heart
If only you had slept alone
If those seeds had not been sown
Oh you could come home and you would know that
I hear your key turning in the door
I won't be hearing that sound anymore
And you and your sin can leave the way you just came in
Send my regards to her
I hope you've found that
I'd like to watch you sleep at night
Another wasted day
But that's alright with me
When shadows turn to clouds
Good choices won't be made
Until tomorrow comes
But that's alright with me
I will stand and wait until it's morning
And I won't make it lying down
I will close my eyes so I can't see you
And I will have all my chances again
I want all of my chances again
And as the sky turns red
The streetlights coming on
I could stay up all night or go to bed
Until tomorrow comes
Until tomorrow comes
I will stand and wait until it's morning
And I won't make it lying down
I will close my eyes so I can't see you
And I will have all my chances again
I want all of my chances again

And I will have all my chances again
He asked to drink by our fire
And I was pleased to let him stay
He drank there quietly for a while
And then he turned and said to me
Your eyes are green
Like summer grass
Your lips are red
Like a fresh cut rose
Your hair is soft
Like an Irish stream
And your voice
Is filled with sweet beauty
And the last words I heard him say
Were I shall return for you my love
On Christmas Day
And the night will come
But I won't sleep
As I watch the stars that lead him
I cannot place where he is
But still my heart goes with him
I'm saving all my Sunday clothes
For the day that I'll be leaving
You might also likeFather knows
My sister knows
And my friends
They're happy for me
And the priest he says
You should thank God
For the blessing
Of such beauty
And the last words I heard him say
Were I shall return for you my love
On Christmas Day
Were I shall return for you my love
On Christmas Day
(On Christmas Day)
(I shall return for you my love)
And the last words I heard him say
Were the last words I ever heard him say
I shall return for you my love
On Christmas Day
I swear I will return
On Christmas Day
And yes I shall return
On Christmas Day
I shall return for you
On Christmas Day
My love I will return
On Christmas Day
I shall return my love
On Christmas Day
And turn and close my door
And sit back down where you were sitting
A little closer than before
And when you look that serious
It just makes me want you more
And I've been meaning to tell you
Why everyone says that I look happier when you're around
And yes I know you're nervous
Never seen you so unsure
And you're drinking more and more
And there's no need to hurry
Take your time I'll still be here
And I've been meaning to tell you
Why everyone says that I look happier
Why everyone says that I look happier
The better I feel
The better I feel

We've been circling for time baby
We're coming down to land tonight
The wait is over and now it's easy
Everything's fine
Why everyone says that I look happier
Why everyone says that I look happier
The sand lying on the floor
The bed upstairs still unmade
The dust float in the light
The people just left
All laughter and mess
Forgetting this and that
And rushing back
The front door open
The music still playing in one room
Down the hall
Towels on the floor
And then it's quiet
Just the bees and birds
The summer haze
Of the trees
And the air
Feeds it all
Feeds it all
We can all feel it
Like a light hand on your back
Welcoming you
We can all feel it
Like a light hand on your back
Welcoming you

The day before we went to war
The day before we went to war
We can all feel it
All the parasols and kids at play
The sea so still and calm
Blue as the cloudless sky
Just the gentle hum
Of the summers goings on
Broken by the sudden rush of two planes
Flying low and fast
Into the sun
Into the sun
We can all feel it
Like a light hand on your back
Welcoming you
We can all feel it
Like a light hand on your back
Welcoming you
The day before we went to war
The day before we went to war
We can all feel it
We can all feel it
Like a light hand on your back
Welcoming you
We can all feel it
Like a light hand on your back
Welcoming you
The day before we went to war
The day before we went to war
You're probably doing too much again
You spend all your hours just rushing around
Do you have a little time?
Do you have a little time for me?
You spend your time waiting for anyone to see
Do you have a little time?
Do you have a little time for me?
If you should stop for a while
You'll find me standing by
Over here at the side of your life
I'd like to hold you still
Remind you of what you've missed
If you have a little time
Why do you still run when you could walk with me?
Life will pass you by when you move this quickly
Why can you see when you're spinning around?
Do you have a little time?
Do you have a little time for me?

If you let me listen I'll make you feel clear
You spend your time waiting for anyone to say
But wake up on my own
Pretend that I'm still sleeping
Till you go home
I can't look at you this morning
I should probably have a sign
That says leave right now or quicker
You've overstayed your time
That's why you have to leave
Maybe I slept peaceful on your shoulder
Your arm warm around my side
And I can't face your smile
The second that I feel your safe hands
Reaching out for mine
I slip away and out of sight
You've overstayed your time

Your best friend I've come to be
Please don't think of getting up for me
You don't even need to speak
When I've been here for just one day
You'll already miss me if I go away
So close the blinds and shut the door
You won't need other friends anymore
Cause I will be your safety

Now all your love you give to me

So you're with her and not with me
Oh how lucky one man can be
I hear your house is small and clean
Oh how lovely with your homecoming queen
Oh how lovely it must be
When you see her sweet smile baby
Don't think of me
When she lays in your warm arms
Don't think of me
So you're with her not with me
I know she spreads sweet honey
Last night with her
When you see her sweet smile baby
Don't think of me

And it's too late and it's too bad

And it's too late and it's too bad
See it for what it was and start another day
All the liberty you took  the love that you abused
The friends that you turned against me if you could
And you're twisting what I say  all that saying you were scared
It doesn't matter anymore 'cause I'm not there
You were careless when the beat kicked in and careless when it left
And careless all the way  I didn't see it till the end
I feel nothing when you cry
I hear nothing  see no need to reply
I can smile now and turn away
Come over here  so you can see me walk away and celebrate
The end of night (The end of night)
The end of night (The end of night)
The end of night (The end of night)
The end of night (The end of night)
It only takes one lie to bring this house down
Behind closed doors  no one tells the first time 'round
Pain is worse when you bring it on yourself
The sweetest bully building  a love that couldn't last
You were ugly when the beat kicked in and ugly when it left
And ugly all the way  I didn't see it till the end

After the fall comes love
I hate to hate and love to love
After the fall comes love

Really much of anything
While you were telling me
I turned against the wind
And when my eyes started to burn
And you turned your back on me
Now time to me
’Cause I've done a hundred things
You've only dreamed
So don’t come crying to me
Don't come trying again
'Cause I don't remember anymore how we used to be
Don't call us friends
And you waited all alone
For your luck to come along
You assumed that things they'd go your way
It would all just carry on

So don't come crying to me
Don't come trying again
'Cause I don't remember anymore how we used to be
And go with the flow
And take it easy and let stuff go
I wanna sleep like a baby
Rise with the sun
And kick it all back and get nothing done
I wanna make this day
The longest day
With a warmth that
Delivers happiness
If only for today
The lover who really loved
The dancer who danced
To the last song
Don't wanna take sides
Don't wanna make sense
Of pounds and pence
I want to be alone
I don't wanna hide
Don't wanna be talked over
Or walked upon
I wanna think the heart
Is bigger than the head

To be passed over
To go unnoticed
To be clumsy get things wrong
And I know what it's like
To arrive too late
To be told to leave
To be walked upon
If only for today
The lover who really loved
The dancer who danced
To the last song
If only for today

I don't care where you've been
I won't drink myself to sleep
I ain't thinking 'bout you no more
I found a way to let you go
So you don't have to stay now
But you can't rip my heart out
I found a way to let you go
It's gonna rip your heart out
Got your picture covering up the cracks on the wall
But the lines won't fade
Didn't think that I would be missing you at all
Maybe that was my mistake

Nothing you say will change my mind
You couldn't wait to leave me behind
Nothing you say will change my mind
You couldn't wait to leave me behind
Nothing you say will change my mind
You couldn't wait to leave me behind
I found a way to let you go
So you don't have to stay now
But you can't rip my heart out
I found a way to let you go
No more going there
To see you lying still while we all come and go
No more watching sunsets that seems
Like summer's holding on
And no more standing quietly at your window
No more driving down your road
Wondering when you'll be home
And no more peace when they all leave and leave us two alone
And time we always lose
Is finally found here with you
But I will stand here by you
No more calling friends from the car
Saying I don't know when
I'll be there but I'll do my best to come
No more letting you warm my hands
No more trying to take it in
And no more saying goodbye for the last time again
And no more saying goodbye for the last time again

And time we always lose
Is finally found here with you
But I will stand here by you
No more trips to Grafton Street
No more going there
No more sitting up all night waiting for any word
Nothing's left that's safe here now
Nothing will bring you home
Nothing can bring us the peace we had in Grafton Street
And it's been there everyday
When you cry I remind you that I'm never gone away
That I'm here by your side until you send me away
When you're one hundred thousand years
And when we walk out hand in hand
And you tell me about your day
Nothing else matters
But all you have to say
And when you wake up far too early
It's a chance to start again
And I don't know what will happen
But I know I want to stay
And if the light turns to darkness
Your face might turn away
When your words don't sound as sweet anymore
I'll listen to what you say
And when you're pushing me and telling me
I still won't walk away
But I know I have to stay
And I'm here as long as you need
When you show you're okay on your own
I'll smile and leave
And I'm here as long as you need
When you show you're okay on your own
I'll smile and leave
Nothing goes too slow  I moves alone
A song that plays makes me miss all that i've lost
'Til the sun goes down and the lights go on
This feeling I'm fine  one when you're gone
Hell after this is gone when I'm home
If I'm going to Hell after this
I'm gonna enjoy it while I can
I won't remember your face after this
I'm gonna enjoy it while I can
Got a coin and the sun  back in time
Looking up  got the sky on my mind
Feels like God is on my side
This feeling I'm fine  one when you're gone
Hell after this is gone when I'm home
If I'm going to Hell after this
I'm gonna enjoy it while I can
I won't remember your face after this
I'm gonna enjoy it while I can
Oh  if I'm going to Hell after this
I'm gonna enjoy it while I can
I'm gonna enjoy it while I can
I wonder how am I still here
And I don't want to move a thing
It might change my memory
I'll do what I want
But I can't hide
And I won't go
I won't sleep
And I can't breathe
Until you're resting here with me
And I won't leave
And I can't hide
I cannot be
Until you're resting here with me
Don't want to call my friends
For they might wake me from this dream
And I can't leave this bed

And I won't leave
And I can't hide

I just want to be happy again
I just want to feel deep in my own world
But I'm so lonely I don't even wanna be with myself anymore
On a different day if I was safe in my own skin
Then I wouldn't feel lost and so frightened
But this is today and I'm lost in my own skin
And I'm so lonely I don't even wanna be with myself anymore
And I'm so lonely I don't even wanna be with myself anymore
And I'm so lonely I don't even wanna be with myself anymore
I just want to feel safe in my own skin
I know you're up when I get home
With one small step upon the stair
I know your look when I get there
If you were a king up there on your throne
Would you be wise enough to let me go?
For this queen you think you own
Wants to be a hunter again
I want to see the world alone again
To take a chance on life again
So let me go
The unread book and painful look
If you were a king up there on your throne
Would you be wise enough to let me go?
For this queen you think you own

I want to see the world alone again
To take a chance on life again
So let me go
I want to be a hunter again
I want to see the world alone again
To take a chance on life again
And I wanna think that you look good as you rise
Let me face the sound and fury
Let me face hurricanes
And I wanna see you as you walk through the door
And I wanna talk of nothing as the world passes by
Let me face the sound and fury
Let me face hurricanes
Let me not turn away
From happiness or pain
Just not to run away
In my heart and in my head
Let me face hurricanes

In your car  you're sad
Oh  your taller now I've found
Hold your fire course
Oh  your fallen out
Go and sow your courses

If I rise  one more try
All I give  more than this

When I rang you at home they said you'd left yesterday
I thought it was strange when your car was found
By the tree in Ennis where we used to hang around
And what you've done is right
I hope you're safe tonight
It's been a long day coming
And long will it last when it's last day leaving
I'm helping it pass by loving you more
And who he would become
All the things he'd have done?
Would he have loved you and not let you down?
And would he be stronger than his father?
And what you've done is right
I hope you're safe tonight
It's been a long day coming

Sometimes I can feel it then suddenly it's gone
Some days I can tell you the truth
And some days I just don't

Armies of words cannot hope to contain
That it comes and it goes
And I have no control
Some days I can think clear and some days I won't
Sometimes I can feel it and suddenly it's gone
Some days I'm strong
And some days my skin's broken and thin
It arrives when it feels and takes what it needs
And it leaves before I get to know
It's only a step away moments
Then armies of words cannot hope to contain

Some days I can tell you the truth
And some days I just don't
Someone does something too quick or too soon
Armies of words cannot hope to contain
That it comes and it goes
And I can't seem to hold
And there's nothing I own
If you gave me just a coin
For every time we say goodbye
Well  I'd be rich beyond my dreams
I'm sorry for my weary life
I know I'm not perfect
But I can smile
And I hope that you see this heart
Behind my tired eyes
If you tell me that I can't
And if I say I'm coming home
I'll probably be out all night
I know  I can be afraid
But I'm alive
And I hope that you trust this heart
Behind my tired eyes

Cause I'm no angel

Don’t hide it behind the sun
Just give it to me as it is
And let it stand
Don’t fly it like a kite
Between the clouds
It needs no excuse
Just bring it down
Let eyes that are in pain look upon it
In all its glory
Let us move on
Let us move on
For this is short
And it will pass
Let us move on
Let us move on
For this is short
And it will pass
For every voice that is lifted
In reverence and pain
Show us now
And let love not be chained
We should feel what we can stand
And let us be alive
So we know
That we’ve done all we can
Let hearts that are frozen get to see it
In all its glory

So let all that is lost be forgotten
Let us move on
Like the waters in the open sea
When tribulations come all we can say is hopefully
And yesterday you could probably say there's no hope for me
A testimony for broken hearts in the city
You either crash landing or planning on flying with me
Vividly I can see that your feelings would like to dwell
I heard emotions burn deep
I heard when you fall out of love the drop is steep
Cause I can make the decision to let it all go away
Before I ever run astray I'll look you in the eye and say
Let us move on
Let us move on
For this is short
And it will pass
Let us move on
Let us move on
For this is short
And I'll try for you to be a little more on time
I know you need to say you know you've let me down
But you haven't and it's hard to talk with people all around
Please don't say how proud you are
Let's do the things we normally do
From your rebel songs sung out of tune
Don't hold my hand for longer than you need to
Let's forget that we're here and make some plans
We'll go for walks sit together on the bench we always sat
I'll tell you every little detail of my day and so will you
This is just another day
Let's do the things we normally do
From your rebel songs sung out of tune
Don't hold my hand for longer than you need to

Armored cars and tanks

The man behind the wire there's a fight to love
A fight to have your bed's a battlefield and back
And all of this will just be stripped away
Let's do the things we normally do
From your rebel songs sung out of tune
Don't hold my hand for longer than you need to
Don't look me in the eye more than you need to
Don't try to say goodbye if I don't want to
Don't say how proud you are
And say I'm far away and take along your way
I never stick around quite long enough to make it
I apologise that once again I'm not in love
But it's not as if I mind that your heart ain't exactly breaking
But if my life is for rent
And I don't learn to buy
'Cause nothing I have is truly mine
I've always thought that I would love to live by the sea
To travel the world alone and live more simply
I have no idea what's happened to that dream
'Cause there's really nothing left here to stop me
If my life is for rent
And I don't learn to buy
'Cause nothing I have is truly mine
If my life is for rent
And I don't learn to buy
'Cause nothing I have is truly mine

And watch the birds soar above
Let 'em tell us of love and loss
How we'll live and how we'll die
'Cause they say he once was
Somebody with a black suit
It makes me want to ask
Was it in the mad loves
And the big fights
So was it in the small change
And the passing updates
So was it in the giving up
And the getting on
So was it in the mad love
So was it in the mad loves
And the big fights

And watch the clouds pass above
How paper burns and pictures fade
Only melody remains

Is of no concern to you
And your friends
Where I lay my hat
May not be my home
But I will last on my own
Cause it's me and my life
It's my life (it's my life)
In the palm of my hand
Not that you'd see
And I'm tired and bored
Of waiting for you
And all those things you never do
Cause it's me and my life
He left at dawn and as I slept I felt him go
Returns no more  I will not watch the ocean
My lover's gone  no earthly ships will ever
Bring him home again  bring him home again
My lover's gone  I know that kiss will be my last
No more his song  the tune upon his lips has passed
I sing alone while I watch the ocean
My lover's gone  no earthly ships will ever
Bring him home again  bring him home again
My lover's gone  his boots no longer by my door
He left at dawn and as I slept I felt him go
Returns no more  I will not watch the ocean
My lover's gone  no earthly ships will ever
I'm free to walk out the door
You don't think I'll be back for more
Try to think of the world
Where you could stay and these safe hands could go
Take your heart above the water
Wherever I choose to go
No love without freedom
No love without freedom
No love without freedom
No freedom without love
Even when you don't see me
And even when you don't hear
I'll be flying low below the sun
And you'll feel it all out here
No love without freedom
No love without freedom
No love without freedom
No freedom without love
No love without freedom
No love without freedom
No love without freedom
No freedom without love

Standing here in silence

Holding you in my hand

When me and you had to make each other happy and there was hope with everything
It's hard enough to feel the world as it is and hold on anything
Without these quiet times you've bought 'round here
I'm gonna have to run away  I'm sure that I belong some other place
I've seen another side  of all I've seen it keeps me wonderin' where my family is
It's hard enough to see the world as it is and hold on anything
Without these quiet times comin' 'round here
And I miss you
And I want you
But I can't have you
Even when you're here
To forget everything you've seen and known  erase every idea
When you walk up in the street and hold my hand and smile
Well  I won't be takin' it cause I know how it turns out
And it takes me back to these quiet times comin' 'round here
And I miss you
And I want you
You're not coming back
And I need you
But I can't have you
Even when you're here
And I miss you
And I want you
You're not coming back
And I need you
But I can't have you
But I'm home now and things still look the same
I think I'll leave it till tomorrow to unpack
Try to forget for one more night that I'm back in my flat
On the road where the cars never stop
Going through the night
To a life where I can't watch the sunset
I don't have time  I don't have time
I've still got sand in my shoes
And I can't shake the thought of you
I should get on  forget you
But why would I want to?
I know we said goodbye
Anything else would've been confused
But I wanna see you again
Tomorrow's back to work and down to sanity
Should run a bath and then clear up the mess I made before I left here
Try to remind myself that I was happy here before
I knew that I could get on a plane and fly away

I know we said goodbye
Anything else would've been confused
But I wanna see you again
I wanna see you again
I wanna see you again
Two weeks away  all it takes
To change and turn me around I've fallen
I walked away and never said
That I wanted to see you again
I've still got sand in my shoes
And I can't shake the thought of you
I should get on  forget you
But why would I want to?
I know we said goodbye
Anything else would've been confused

But I wanna see you again
I wanna see you again
You can't hide here any longer
My god you need to rinse those puffy eyes
You can't lie still any longer
And yes they'll ask where you've been
And you probably don't want to hear tomorrow's another day
But I promise you you'll see the sun again
And you're asking me why pain's the only way to happiness
And I promise you you'll see the sun again

You said that one day of this was worth dying for
So be thankful you knew her at all
But it's no more

It was bound to happen that I'd end up at yours
I temporarily forgot there's better days to come
I thought that I would give it just one more chance
So paper thin that one real feeling could knock you down
Being comforted by strangers you'll never need to know
Not sad because you lost me
But sad because you thought it was cool to be sad

Well if you had walked past me today I wouldn't have picked you out
I wouldn't have picked you out
I wouldn't have picked you out
And I'm not coming back
When you're crawling on the floor
Reaching for the phone to ring
Anyone who knows you anymore
Inside everybody's hiding something
Staring at the same four walls
Have you tried to help yourself?
That you need to get some rest
Inside everybody's hiding something
Take time to catch your breath and choose your moment
Don't slide

Even at a time like this
When the morning seems so far
Think that pain belongs to you
But it's happened to us all
You bought this on yourself
And it's high time you left it there
Lie here and rest your head
Dream of something else instead
All the songs she used to sing
All the songs she used to play
And the promise of some kind of love
And the promise of some kind of love
When we lose what we love
Don't think anything will ever taste the same
When we lose what we love
Don't think anything will ever feel as good again
Destroy only enough that enough still remains of
But she played them once again

She closed and locked the door
And left them lying on the floor
And she sang
 bigger dreams  enough for everyone
 free of love  I wanted to travel alone
 I'm sorry I remembered it wrong
 but you're still on my mind
 I've run so far  you're still on my mind
 but you're still on my mind
And we make love  it seems a little desolate
It's hard sometimes not to look away
And think what's the point when I'm having to hold this fire down
I think I'll explode if I can't feel this free now
If you won't let me fall for you
Then you won't see the best that I would love to do for you
Instead  you will be missing me when I go
Cause I'm bored of hanging out in your cold
When I feel loved  baby  I join the road
And the world moves with me
When I feel lost I just slip away
Silently  quietly take my things and go
And think what's the point  think where's the hope we're coming home
Cause if you won't let me fall for you
Then you won't see the best that I would love to do for you
Instead  you will be missing me when I go

Oh  take me home
Oh  take me home
When you're stoned  baby  take me home
Take my hand and show me where we're going
So sit on top of the world and tell me how you're feeling
What you feel is what I feel for you
Take my hand and if I'm lying to you
Watch my lips and hear the words I'm telling you
Give your trust to me and look into my heart
So sit on top of the world and tell me how you're feeling

Take my hand and if I'm lying to you

 talking in the heat
Got out of bed at all
The morning rain clouds up my window
And I can't see at all
And even if I could  it'd all be grey
But your picture on my wall
It reminds me that it's not so bad
It's not so bad
I drank too much last night  got bills to pay
My head just feels in pain
I missed the bus and there'll be hell today
I'm late for work again
And even if I'm there  they'll all imply
That I might not last the day
And then you call me and it's not so bad
It's not so bad
And I want to thank you
For giving me the best day of my life

Is having the best day of my life

Oh  just to be with you
Flowers won't be left in parks  work will still be done
People won't be dressed in black  babies will be born
No flags will fly  the sun will rise but we will know that you are gone
You who loved to love
And believed we can never give enough
It wakes me every single night thinking through the day
Did you stop at any time  have doubts at any stage?
Or were you calm or were you numb  or happy just to get it done?
I've lived my life without regret until today
And you who loved to love
And believed we can never give enough
I didn't get to say goodbye the day before the day
Was trying to get to work on time that's why I turned away
And missed the most important thing you ever tried to say
I've lived my life without regret until today

The music that you play lights up my world
The sweetest that I've heard
Could it be that I've been touched and turned? Oh Lord  please
Finally  finally things are changing
This land is mine but I'll let you rule
I'll let you navigate and demand
Just as long as you know  this land is mine
So find your home and settle in
Oh  I'm ready to let you in
Just as long as we know  this land is mine
After all the battles and the wars  the scars and loss
Well  I'm still the queen of my domain
And feeling stronger now
The walls are down a little more each day  since you came
Finally  finally things are changing
Follow the days I've traveled alone
In this cold and colorless place till now
It's what I had to pay

There's an empty seat next to me everywhere I go
Even on the plane and on the sofa back at home
Life's too short for all this time
We could have spent as two
I've seen it and I've held it
And it's better spent with you
I have run from most things that come too close
Now dated plans keep taking me further from you
And time is running out and I'm tired of missing you
What am I doing here when you're there?
What am I doing here when you're there?
I hope that they don't find me in many years to come
With a list of things by my bed that I've never done
One of them being throwing off all these silly rules

I promise I'm not trying to make your life harder
Or return to where we were
But I will go down with this ship
And I won't put my hands up and surrender
There will be no white flag above my door
I'm in love and always will be
I know I left too much mess and destruction
To come back again
And I caused nothing but trouble
I understand if you can't talk to me again
And if you live by the rules of it's over

Who makes you feel the way I make you feel?

Just a few notes from a passing car
And it can take me
With heart opening speed
To somewhere not here
I'm held stock still by a sight of something
And send me absolutely elsewhere
And take me absolutely right here
You don’t need a god
To pray out here
You don't need a god
To stay out here
You don't need a thing
But what we have right here
It can be one word
Or the smallest thing that only I see
It hits like lightning
And it changed the way I feel
