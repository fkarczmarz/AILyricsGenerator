lyrics
"Very sentimental and it means a lot to me
Oh  better settled down than playing games through gritted teeth
Oh  when you light the fire all your fears about it die
You're telling everybody  all those years of killing time
I wasn't satisfied at 25 or 23
Oh  will you let me find it? How much faster can it be?
Oh  hold on
When the 21st century's gone  we hold on
Move along
When you're finally finding your song  then hold on
Move along
No  it doesn't matter what it is or cannot be
Oh  where's the war I'm fighting? It's just not fierce enough for me
Oh when you found the diamonds  all your tears were still inside
Oh  but baby if you let me I'll do anything for you
All the innocence is burning  can you feel a better time?

Oh  hold on
When the 21st century's gone  we hold on
Move along
When you're finally finding your song  then hold on
Move along
Oh  hold on
When the 21st century's gone  we hold on
Move along
When you're finally finding your song  then hold on
Move along
Oh  let it go
'Cause the song that's in my head  it's unintentional
Baby  let it go
It's just a place I know
But the song that's in my head  it's unintentional
Gotta let it go
Oh  then you know
But this song that's in my head  it's unintentional
Baby  let it go
You put up defences
Why do you want to?
Because I'm here to protect you
So take it easy
I'll make it so easy
You can lay your head down
And we'll leave it 'til tomorrow
You seem to believe you belong to somebody else
When you leave me alone in this world you know that I'm in hell
Do you know what it's like to be lonely and by yourself?
When your life is tangled
You wear your disguises
But why do you need to
When I'm standing here beside you?
So take it easy
I make it so easy
You can lay your head down
And we'll leave it 'til tomorrow
You seem to believe you belong to somebody else
When you leave me alone in this world you know that I'm in hell
Do you know what it's like to be lonely and by yourself?

Slipping through my fingers and into another's
Tell me why won't you turn back?
You seem to believe you belong to somebody else
When you leave me alone in this world you know that I'm in hell
(It's hard enough when you're alone in the world)
Do you know what it's like to be lonely and by yourself?
You seem to believe you belong to somebody else
When you leave me alone in this world you know that I'm in hell
(It's hard enough when you're alone in the world)
Imagine living in a box
And I won't come out
Until I've broken all the locks
Slurring all my words
Until something sticks
But in this smoky universe
My mind keeps playing tricks
And although you're the only home I know
As if by magic thoughts of you are gone
And now I'm keeping my head in the clouds
And it's not so tragic if I don't look down
Oo-oo-ooh oo-ooh ooh oo-ooh oo-ooh oo-ooh
Oo-oo-ooh oo-ooh ooh oo-ooh oo-ooh oo-ooh
Submerging from your world
And back into my bliss
A day rolled into one
Is burning on my lips
Blurring all your words
Until they don't exist
And in a parallel universe
It's me you can't resist

And although you're the only home I'll ever know

And it's not so tragic if I don't look down

Oo-oo-ooh oo-ooh ooh oo-ooh oo-ooh oo-ooh
And although (You say I'm a rose-tinted lover come on)
You're the only home I'll ever know (You know I'll never love another)
As if by magic (I won't stay a lonely lover for long)
Thoughts of you are gone
And now (You say I'm a rose-tinted lover come on)
I'm keeping my head in the clouds (You know I'll never love another)
And it's not so tragic (I won't stay a lonely lover for long)
Understand it?
We can fight 'til it's light
Doesn't mend it
Do you still dream we're alright
And we'll find it?
What if I tell you lies
And demand it?
Demand it
Baby  how many times
You're not listening right in my mind
I know it's alright
But then you find you're lost in the fight
And now you've broken the love of your life
Or you're just blinded
I wanted to manage information
Find the automatic driver
Oh  I'll find it
Woah  but I'm still so in love
Imagine how much I'm crying
Oh  I'm crying
Oh  woah

Then we've landed
Oh  that smile that you hide
Leaves me stranded

It's an ending  an ending
Baby  how many times
You're not listening right in my mind

And this time we're in paradise
You're my favorite
I wanted to make a contribution  baby
I wanted to start a revolution with you

Why did I let myself run and hide you?

Yo! Lazer! Lazer!
You're rocking with Major Lazer!
I'll never let you sweep me off my feet
I won't let you in again
The messages I tried to send
My information's just not going in
Burning bridges shore to shore
I break away from something more
I'm not turned on to love until it's cheap
I'll never let you sweep me off my feet
I won't let you turn around
To walk away from something when it's dead
Come out to play when you are hurt?
There's certain things that should be left unsaid
And life's too short for me to stop
I won't let you turn around
And tell me now I'm much too proud
All you do is fill me up with doubt
I'm having fun  don't put me down
I'll never let you sweep me off my feet
I won't let you in again
The messages I've tried to send
My information's just not going in
Burning bridges shore to shore

I'm not turned on to love until it's cheap
Been there  done that  messed around
I'm having fun  don't put me down
I'll never let you sweep me off my feet
This time  baby  I'll be bulletproof
This time  baby  I'll be bulletproof
I won't let you turn around
And tell me now I'm much too proud
To walk away from something when it's dead
Do-do-do your dirty words
Come out to play when you are hurt?
There's certain things that should be left unsaid
And life's too short for me to stop

I won't let you turn around

You know me well  but I don't know you at all

You know me well  but I don't know you at all

Early '90s décor  it was a day for
We wanted to play  but we had nothing left to play for
Colourless colour

And sights from my eyes
The discovery of the unknown
Is something to tell the folks back home

You've turned me away so many times
You can take it away at any given moment
It's hard to believe while you're in this disguise
So would you hold me please?
I'm trying hard to breathe
I'm just surviving
So would you hold me please?
I'm trying hard to breathe
Stop me from crying
When I see you walking with her
I have to cover my eyes
(I have to cover my eyes)
Every time you leave with her
Something inside me dies
(Something inside of me dies)
No wonder it hurts to sit by your side
(Turned me away so many times)
There's a different song I can play you tonight
(We don't have to sit here in silence)
(It's just a little sacrifice)
You don't need to worry about the others
(It's all in your mind)

It's symbolic in one way or another
But I know it's harder for you than for me
I step back and won't be reminded
I give you some space to hide it
‘Cause I know it's harder for you than for me
I never wanna let you down
‘Cause the world stops a little when you hit the ground
So bye-bye to the sights unkind 'cause
The skies have realigned us
And I know it hasn't been nice all the time
Now we're finally coming into the light
I will not be playing inside by myself

There is a high?
That when you learn
There is a high?

I'm sick of hiding  face it  you and I don't walk the same
When a certain man started spinning lies  it started to rain
Now I see it  I am clearly terrified of modern-day
Oh  lately there's something in the atmosphere
Telling me things that I don't wanna hear
Taking me places I don't wanna be
Showing me things that I don't wanna see
Lately  there's something in the atmosphere
Telling me things that I don't wanna hear
Taking me places I don't wanna be
Showing me things that I don't wanna see
Now I'm really feeling different
Oh  can't you see  you've done it this time?
It's everything I live for
Smell the fear and spot the signs
Those fantasies of better times
That prophecy that makes you learn
It's hard to find
Oh  plant the seed  don't trip on it
Can you really get a grip on it?
Take your time

It's the same thing as lying
‘Cause I'm trying to be that woman now (Do do-do do-do do do do  do do-do do-do do do do)

I'd rather say it now  before it comes 'round again
And your shadow still hangs on
You've been two weeks gone
And so tonight I followed you home
There are so many different ways
Of collecting all the strays
The ones that get away
It's feeding my frustrations
And I haven't got the patience
These sheets are still warm
This bed is our only home
We make arrangements over the phone
Where has all the conversation gone?

Might swap my phone for a beeper
Recognize I got lost upriver
I just wanna know I'm in the deep end
Get a taste for what's lying on the seabed
And the kids in the car wanna sing along
Only players with the marks gotta think fast
But the players with the most make a big splash
If I hopped on way back

Tried to run but I'm running into hurdles
Put that pressure on a plate and you know I'ma clean it
I'm giving like lush
I'm pushing it nine months
I'm stronger than I was
I know that they want me to feel
And I know that they hate that I'm doin' so damn well
I been keeping on the gas
I might break down but I know that
I'm not ever gonna crash
I've come way too far now
(That's right)
Stand still looking at me
Over now for five years
And how change has overtaken
Close your eyes but I wouldn't put the seat back
I been keeping on the gas when I break down
I'm in here running laps when it rains now
Now I'm hearing it the most in the morning
Making sure he doesn't cancel the calling
In my ear  finally my saviour is here
I hear you call me from the other room
You say my name as if you know what you're about to do
You say you're tired and you must be leaving soon
When will we ever see this through?
And I continue to drown my sorrows
After you're gone
And look around for somebody else to
Hang my hopes on
In fact it's easier now that
You're not here
I'm no longer dreading you
Muttering those words in my ear
In my ear  finally my saviour is here

I fell through the hole yesterday
Your smile pulled me in like elastic
I felt my mind detonate
Oh  I've made mistakes
And you just say it's growing pains
When I feel ashamed
You tell me it's just growing pains
We broke in two like a matchstick
It burns in my soul every day  every day
Your world  it was to me so fantastic
And hell seemed so far away  far away
Oh  I've made mistakes

I will not be near  am I finally getting to you?
When you turn and turn and say you're sorry
Loud so I can hear  if this time you're telling the truth
I have never seen that doorway open
All my life spent talking about being the one
Oh  no  please don't sit there frowning
All that does is separate the love
When your story's told
When you're five years old

In your father's hands
When you're ten years old

Just pack your things and go
Honey  don't pretend you didn't know
Oh now  don't you say you miss me
I've been up for sale all week
So just wipe the tears  let's go
Can't get back the years  I know
I don't need everything quick
I've been up finding my feet
I've been up and down for so long
I've been locked out of my home
I've been up cynical street
I've been up finding my feet

Had enough of dragging my feet
I've been up since last week
In the morning I pretend I like it
But I'm fifty percent  I'll find it

When we're together  happiness delight
Let them hear it so they recognise
We're getting closer  open up your stride
What's your limit? Are you getting tired?
We're riding over hills and riversides
Now I'm dreaming  now I'm hypnotized
The miracle is our give and take
I've tried without you  it's not the same
I'll build you up  I'm not turning back
My time is up  but don't tell me that

And now I can feel the change in the weather
Oh  where I'm going  I know it's much better
I wanna tell you where I'm living now
Only wanna show you what it's all about
I found a feeling I can't live without
Oh  and I feel like I've been sleeping now
Look in the mirror  reveal your self-doubt
Turning around was easy somehow
I gave enough to bring myself down
Oh  but it's mine  and I'll take it back now

No more standing on the line
While I'm out here telling time
And my pride's been feeling shy
But my heart is open wide
That you'd rather just deny
I'm walking on a broken roof
While I'm looking at the sky
It's all false love and affection
You don't want me
You just like the attention
Yes  it's all false love and affection
You don't like me

I'm not your toy
This isn't another girl-meets-boy

You've seen the future  now a love that is blind
Makes you want to kiss and not tell
Makes you want to kiss and not tell
You've dialed that number now  so where's the surprise?
Temptation's callin' you  a secret reply
Makes you want to kiss and not tell
Makes you want to kiss and not tell

Makes me want to kiss and not tell
You say in evidence  they won't take you alive
But when the sun goes down you cover your lies

And sometimes you just need a night on the town  oh

That's what I think I need
But when you let me down gently
Turn me into someone good
That's what I really need
Tell me that I'm someone good
I hope it doesn't seem
Like I'm young foolish and green
Let me in for a minute
You're not my life but I want you in it

How do you feel in the night
Now the feeling's left behind
As you know there was a time
When your silence left me blind
Now you're callin' from the aisle
A denial left to slide
I can't imagine why we'd ever take part again
Can I get a plus one to the party
Tell everybody you're the new ten out of ten
I got a love but I don’t really wanna try
I got it covered but I’m waiting for a high
There’s not a love without changes
We got a love and maybe we can save it
I ran inside and I just left you in the heat
Oh I don’t know why we wanna hide
I often wonder if I’m ever even here
I often wonder if I’m on a mental line
Oh I get nervous 'cause I know you’ve got a number on me
I’m only running 'cause I know you’ve got a hunger for it
Don't wanna show you so I'm closing my eyes
I didn't know it was a broken disguise
I've got a love but I wouldn't put a  on it
I'll be the Ken to your Malibu Barbie
I can't imagine why we'd ever take part again

How I can never get enough of your kissing
Even a little bit of love can save us all

How you’re the girl that I’ve been missing
How I can never get enough of your kissing
Only wanted to sit there when the signal is slow
Only wanted to sit down and fantasize
I wouldn't wanna be lying
Wouldn't wanna be lying to myself
You're a little bit lost in someone else
I'm coming from the other side
I know
I'm hidden but we don't live twice
I won't
Stand still and let this all go by
Don't talk
Are you paying attention? Don't be careless about this
Be the God-blessed one that turns my spirit gold
Even when I'm switched off the yearning carries on
And I don't wanna feel anything for anyone anymore

When finding somebody that slips in your mind
Don't wanna be on your mind
I'd prefer to get down
Than be living a lie
Elephants and...
Don't wanna be on your mind
I'd prefer to get down
Than be living a lie
I'm afraid you got found
Is it real to deny?
I've been thinking about how
I can leave anytime
I've been thinking about time
With the birds and the bees
I'm in wonderland
When will you finally see
Elephants and birds
Hanging round in the trees?
Just look closer
They're all looking at you and me
Elephants and birds
When you finally see
Elephants and birds
Everybody's lovin' on the cigarette trees
The air is rich with the Hawaiian breeze
The grass is alive with sugar weeds
And the hilltops tuck in the bay for the night
The palm trees make it feel like a paradise
Cause in your eyes
That's my paradise
When all the roads ahead of me stop lookin' new
When everything I know is slippin' out of view
You
My heaven is you
The runners run and the teasers tease
But none of these faces can set me free
And the water here is crystal clear and bright
When I compare this pleasure beach
To all the places in your eyes that I have seen
It could be anywhere if you're not by my side

Ooh  ooh  ooh  ooh
I'm the obsessor  holding your hand
It seems you have forgotten about your man
Alone in the darkness  my bed's a different land
Your touch intensifies and I'm in the quicksand
I'm in the quicksand
I'm in the quicksand
You're the upsetter  stroking my hand
What's my position? I don't understand
Am I your possession  am I in demand?
Oh  when you turn to me I'm in the quicksand
I'm in the quicksand
I'm in the quicksand
You  you moved into my mind again  oh

Oh  I could let you stay
But I'm walking on broken ground again
Oh  oh  when will I learn?

Shine  make me a shelter to hide
Cause love makes you lose your sight
Now the search party's on its way
And the flood lights on my face
All the shadows that I walk in
Are just my volatile second skin
My reflections are protections
They will keep me from destruction
My directions are distractions
When you're ready come into the light
Lines  design a pathway
Shine  cut out the dark shapes
To find  although I really tried
Only time is a lover's guide
And now the railings fall away
And the stencils draw a face
Our outlines in the sunset
Are just a fragile silhouette
My reflections are protections
They will keep me from destruction
My directions are distractions
When you're ready come into the light
My reflections are protections
They will keep me from destruction
My directions are distractions
If you leave me  I'll go back to hide

 he wants to pounce
 shine so bright
 cold inside
 he doesn't hear a sound
 no one's around
Why won't you let me leave?
And I've been tryna find my way to the shallows
But the water's just too deep
Always somethin' inside of me
Keeps draggin' me down
I'm going deep below the undertow
And it won't let go
All I need is silence
There's a thumpin' that's filled with violence
And he creeps in through the walls at night when
All I need is silence
All I need is silence

So tired of breathin' in numbers
Tryin' to stop my racing heart
All I know is that I want it to stop

Prayin' I won't try anymore
And conversations that begin to shout
Are you happy now?
