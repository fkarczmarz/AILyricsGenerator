lyrics
" we saw you get the rope
 you're making it lurch
 he wasn't even there
 so hold him fast
 you want to let it last
My head abounds
Oh  the feeling
And she wept hold me again  I made no sound
Oh  the beating
And she swore love is never done
So easily
And we went over again  my head abounds
Oh  the feeling
She said you don't need time
Be tame  you won't meet your mate inside
My faith won't lie
He said you don't need mine
Behave  you wanna leave my lady lovers
Of my eighteen summers alone
She said  you don't read minds
Be patient  you won't leave me shaking
Leave me shaking
But it's all the rage back home
It's all the rage back home

Oh  what feeling
She said  you oughtta refine
Be paid  you're gonna see my face in lights
My faith won't lie
But my sweet  you don't need time
Come away and just say you'll love me
Just say you'll love me alone
She said you don't read minds
Be patient  you won't see me shaking
You have been mistaken
But it's all the rage back home
It's all the rage back home
All the rage back home
All the rage back home
All the rage
It's all the rage back home
It's all the rage back home

Put some of us in each
At least try hold the other
In the right light
This sky's gonna break
Some of us die heroes
At least they'll never suffer
At least they'll always
See the ocean
Cause I could go anywhere
I could go anywhere
So free in my place in the sun
Cause I could go anywhere
You know all about me
That's what's so frightening
You know all about me
Seems my moon is traveling
We try to engage
Softened up by peace
At least I had my taste
Of the nightlife
Be kind to the babes
Cause someday you might need them
At least they'll never suffer
At least they'll always

I won't be tied with heartstrings
I search high and low
Seems my moon is traveling
Always
See the ocean
Cause I could go anywhere
Besides my only care's me
My face in the sun
So I had to make up my mind
And hold it for awhile
I would not just leave you without a kiss -
But I guess there must come a time
When there's no more tears to cry
Bees and snakes need homes (need homes)
Barricade
It starts to feel like a barricade
And it kinda does
Starts to feel like a barricade
I could not lean on the politics
Cause I didn't want to train my eye
To hold so short a time
But I still like to witness

Full speed half blind

Come back  come back  breaker one

When I hold you tight
Asleep beside me
There is a slope like an appetite we descend slowly

Some explosion from the bright side

And I've paid my turns in kind
Just speed my feet away
Come back  come back  I'm the warning
On and on
That’s how my observation tends
But all preoccupations are suddenly simple
When I let my second nature win
What’ll it be
It goes on and on
It’s like a blindness
Ties me up again
Won’t be battering windows
Shatter me in my seat
Then a holier thinking
Fires me up again
Won’t be rolling in sinful
Sidling up the street
I’m tryna simplify my scene
Dream of combinations
All night long
Round and round a rhythm escapes
Then I’m stuck without no answers
And I’ll be pretending
There’s a surplus of us to be so flagrant

We made our home without begging your pardon

Heaven restores you in life

It's the smiling on the package
It's the faces in the sand
It's the thought that moves you upwards
Embracing me with two hands
Right will take you places

Denial
It took a life span with no cell mate
By the long way back
You need something for which to care
Leave some shards under the belly
Lay some grease inside my hand
It's a sentimental jury
And the makings of a good plan
You've come to love me lightly
Is this motion everlasting
Or do shudders pass in the night?

I spent a life span with no cell mate
The long way back
You need someone to take you there
Why can't we just play the other game?
But I got sideswiped and came right to '78
My life is pro creation
So I make time to rewind those memories and play
'Cause you and me make a fine mess
You and me make a fine mess
You're on
You get high like you chase the natives
And you tried then to show them your come-and-see face
I like this elevation
'Cause these thoughts are those thoughts that cover me in grey

Her rabid glow is like braille to the night
She swears I'm a slave to the details
The clock is set for nine but you know you're gonna make it eight
She feels that my sentimental side should be held with kids' gloves
But she doesn't know that I left my urge in the icebox
She swears I'm just prey for the female
The clock is set for nine but you know you're gonna make it eight
I'll bring you when my lifeboat sails through the night
That is supposing that you don't sleep tonight
It's like learning a new language
Helps me catch up on my mime
If you don't bring up those lonely parts
This could be a good time
It's like learning a new language
You come here to me
We'll collect those lonely parts and set them down

I'm saving all my energy to pick up when you move into
My airspace
Move into my airspace
And something's coming over me  I see you in the doorway
I can't control the part of me that swells up when you move into
My airspace
Move into my airspace
But each night  I bury my love around you
You're linked to my innocence

I'm sick of this town  I see my face has changed
Say hello  say hello to the angels
Say hello  say hello
Nobody cares somehow
When the loving that you've wasted
Comes raining from a hapless cloud
And I might stop and look upon your face
Disappear in the sweet  sweet gaze
See the living that surrounds me
Dissipate in a violet place
Can't you see what you've done to my heart
And soul?
This is a wasteland now
We spies
We slow hands
Put the weights around yourself
We spies
Oh yeah  we slow hands
You put the weights all around yourself
Now
I submit  my incentive is romance
I watched the pole dance of the stars
We rejoice because the hurting is so painless
From the distance of passing cars
But I am married to your charms and grace
I just go crazy like the good old days
You make me want to pick up a guitar
And celebrate the myriad ways that I love you

If I get there early will it be the right time?
Our heaven is just waiting so put your hand into mine
If I get too surly will you take that in stride?
Our boat is just there waiting  so put that little hand in mine
And speak when you’re spoken of
Catch up on your sleep  girl
When you wear that body glove
You’re acting on initiative
And you’re spelling out your love
You shouldn’t be alone in there
You could be above ground
All I want is to be the very best for you
Oh yeah  all I want is to do the very best by you
Oh  there's time
There'll be no life of crime
Don't rain on me tonight
Circle around me now  baby  it’ll be ok
Cause we all go downtown sometimes
Somehow  baby  we’ll beat this mess
It’s the time  fuck the surface to meet the specialist

I'm a specialist in hope and I'm registered to vote
Why don't you come into my barrio
We'll see if we can float
I'm a specialist in hope and I'm registered to vote
Why don't you come into my barrio
Heaven receives and so did you
Dimming the blue sky
So much release in a rendezvous
But I didn’t really step in
It was one time and
You’re a scent on the breeze ever since
Leave my head to spin
Rush
Forward to leave my head to spin
Rush
Stay in touch
When we first met you were love tied
Faith like a tree and laying roots
He could see you as his wife then
Honestly I could see it too
Then he became my close friend
We spoke of his love for you often
I came to see you in starlight
And let electric fields yield to skin

Open steady high
That's how you lose

Over the trees amen
That’s how you make a ghost
Watch how you break things you learn the most
Something about the one that negates hope
Marauder chained of no real code
Marauder breaks bonds
Marauder stays long
Plays with the real face on
See I touched an angel’s wing
She laid it over me
Approach a remedy
Played with the real face on
See I touched an angel’s wing
She held it over me
We had the real face on
When she walks down the street
She knows there's people watching
The building fronts are just fronts
To hide the people watching her
But she once fell through the street
Down a manhole in that bad way
The underground drip
Was just like her scuba days
Days
Daze

She broke away

She broke away
There's something that's invisible
There's some things you can't hide
Trying to detect you when I'm sleeping
In a wave you say goodbye
There's something that's invisible
There's some things you can't hide
Trying to detect you when I'm sleeping
I make money like Fred Astaire
I see that you've come to resist me
I'm a pitbull in time
Your pretense is not what restricts me
It's the circles inside
The anatomy of kisses and a teacher who tries
Who knows how we'll disappear?
Would you like to be my missus and in future with child?
You know we can't get back from here
But we can get away

I hear you're moving real fine
You wear those shoes like a dove
Now strut those shoes
We'll go roaming in the night
You keep it moving to your soul's delight
Now I've tried the brakes
I tried but you know it's a lonely ride
How are things on the west coast?
But I don't want to take your heart
And I don't want a piece of history
My god
How are things on the west coast?
Hear you're moving real fine tonight
You wear those shoes side to side

Slow now
And let the waves have their way now
Slow

I hope it's not beyond me
Settling down it takes time
One day we'll live together
And life will be better
I gave a lot to you
I take a lot from you too
You slave a lot from me
Guess you could say I gave you my edge
But I can't pretend I need to defend
Some part of me from you
