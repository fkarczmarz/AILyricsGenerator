lyrics
"Party on! I want to hear you scream and shout!
Taking it back to a hardcore level
Taking it back to a hardcore level
Go!
Whoa-oh! I never give in
Whoa-oh! I never give up
Whoa-oh! I never give in
I just want to be—want to be loved
Whoa-oh! I never give in
Whoa-oh! I never give up
Whoa-oh! I never give in
I just want to be—want to be loved
I want domination
I want your submission
I see you're not resisting
To this temptation
I got one confession
A love deprivation
I got a jet-black heart

I just want to be—want to be loved
I got another confession
I fell to temptation
And there is no question
There was some connection
Gotta follow my heart
No matter how far
I gotta to roll the dice
Never look back and never think twice
Whoa-oh! I never give in
Whoa-oh! I never give up
Whoa-oh! I never give in
I just want to be—want to be loved

We're tearing down the white picket fences
A soldier bleeds  and a soldier dies
Have you ever thought that war was a sickness?
I’m a son of it  fucked up from it
Casualty of my family cause of it
We dare to dream  or live to die
Reunited by the truth at the right time
Something’s wrong here
Or so it seems
'Cause I’m not sleeping in
American Dreams  American lies
We're trying to see through the smoke in our eyes
So give me the truth
Don't tell me your lies
'Cause it's harder to breathe
When you're buried alive
By American Dreams
With every bullet hole  there's a blood stain
Another family that's struggling to keep sane
'Cause their neighborhood ain't a safe place
Got us all wearing black every Sunday
And I'm growing numb to the violence
Sing along to the sounds of the sirens
We're trying to keep ourselves alive
But it's hard to get by when it feels like
Something’s wrong here
Or so it seems
'Cause I'm not sleeping in

Don't tell me your lies
'Cause it's harder to breathe
When you’re buried alive
By American Dreams
Giving it a go alone
Begging on my knees
Is there a god to save me?
I've been a wretched soul
From my heart down to my toes
I was lost in my disease
And you were right there screaming
Don't change when it’s too late
Maybe I said the right things wrong
And my one last shot is too far gone
Will live for you before I die
Maybe I pushed you way too far
To pull you back from where you are
Will live for you before I die
From the valley of the dead
I'm hearing every word you said
Are you giving us some room to grow?
Or digging us a deeper hole
And killing any shred of hope for us to believe in?

Sick of being here alone

And my one last shot is too far gone
Will live for you before I die
Maybe I pushed you way too far
To pull you back from where you are
Will live for you before I die
Will live for you before I die
 I'm a believer
 pull me close to your chest
 the adrenaline rush
 lift me up
 are you ready or not?
I don't need that shit
Take my money  take my obsession
I just wanna be heard  loud and clear are my words
Comin' from within  man  tell 'em what you heard
It's about a revolution
In your heart and in your mind  you can find the conclusion
Lifestyle and obsession
Diamond rings get you nothin' but a lifelong lesson
And your pocketbook stressin'
You're a slave to the system  workin' jobs that you hate
For that shit you don't need
It's too bad the world is based on greed
Step back and see
Stop thinkin' 'bout yourself  start thinkin' 'bout
There's no money  there's no possession  only obsession
I don't need that shit
Take my money  take my possession  take my obsession
I don't need that shit
'Cause everything is nothing  and emptiness is in everything
This reality is really just a fucked up dream
With the flesh and the blood that you call your soul
Flip it inside out  it's a big black hole
Take your money  burn it up like an asteroid
Possessions  they are never gonna fill the void
Take it away and learn the best lesson

I don't need that shit
Fuck your money  fuck your possession  fuck your obsession
I don't need that shit
Money  possession  obsession
From the whispers of your doubts?
Are you denying me?
Cause I keep on reaching out
But after everything that you've been through
I know you did the best that you could do
And I had to let you know
You're so much more than damaged
Why can't you see what I see in you?
I know all about the pain you feel
And what you're going through
I only wish you knew
In darkness you're still beautiful
But I can see your open wounds
They're bleeding through
I know you're fading
Into the shadows of your life
Don't push me away from you

Life cuts you open and it feels like you're broken
It feels like you're broken
It feels like you're broken

And you don't know if the next man is dumbin'
Survival of the fittest what it is
Channel the energy and with my strength I will devour
Sickening thoughts is running through my head
That's when I realize I'm glad I'm not dead
Corruption and abuse
The salesman of our blood
For the public's craving
Existence in the dark
It's in our nature to destroy ourselves
It's in our nature to kill ourselves
It's in our nature to kill each other
And now my life is all shifty and it all moves fast
Close to a buck fifty  we all stand strong
In respect to the family in times of insanity
And through words of profanity
I describe our dysfunctional family
Blood brothers keep it real to the end

And I am fighting for
All of the broken people
All of the people thrown overboard

Been tryna deal with the thoughts and my condition
And still I try to hang on to what I'm missing
I been runnin' from fate without a lifeline
But now I'm in the wrong place at the wrong time
I've been hangin' by a thread
With my feet over the edge
Got my back against the wall
Will this nightmare ever end?
Will I break before I bend?
I got my head in the game I'm on a mission
We are the marginalized but not the victims
Fighting the fight of our lives to make you listen
You got me losin' my breath it's been a long run

Will this nightmare ever end?
Will I break before I bend?
Break the fall
Shut your mouth
'Cause I can see through the lies
We're only getting sicker
From the secrets we hide
Disaster is our master
As we lie here burning in bed
But something tells me
I cannot give up on you yet
I will not give up on you today
I will forgive and forget
'Cause I know that it will set me free
But all that's left
Is the emptiness inside of me
You murdered my heart
Broke my trust and watched me fade away

Will you love me to death?
I will love you until the end

You murdered my heart
Broke my trust and watched me fade away

All alone
Broken home
All alone
I can't seem to fight these feelings
I'm caught in the middle of this
And my wounds are not healing
I'm stuck in between my parents
I wish I had someone to talk to
Someone I could confide in
Want to know the truth
Broken home
All alone
I know my mother loves me
But does my father even care?
If I'm sad or angry
You were never ever there
When I needed you
I hope you regret what you did
I think I know the truth

It feels bad to be alone
How could I tell it so all you all could feel it?
Depression strikes me hard just like my old earth would tell it
Pain bottled up about to blow like a gun
Stories that I tell are non-fiction
And you can't take it back cause it's already done
Broken home
Broken home
Can't seem to fight these feelings
Caught in the middle of this
My wounds are not healing
Stuck in between my parents
Broken home
Every lie straight to my face
So blind I could not see
Right behind my back you stabbed me
Should have know you were a bitch
Shut up you are making me sick
Little man you are nothing like me
Lying cheating so deceiving
I trusted you broke me down
And you screwed me over
Do not try to deny it
You cannot hide it
Ill be ignited
When I get to watch you burn
Burn Burn
I want to watch you burn
Burn Burn
I want to watch you burn
You are going to get what you deserve

My world is upside down

Trying to find your way through the dark days
But you don't know how
You flipped the world upside down
And right now you don't wanna show it
'Cause you don't think that anyone will notice
Until you tell someone
You'll feel like you're the only one
And everybody says they're fine
But I know we're not alright
Everybody says they're fine
But I know we're not alright
I know we're not alright
It's always darkest just before the light
I know your silence is a deadly sound
It's never easy when you're breaking down
But I'll be there when you come around
When you come around
Face down in the days that we wasted
Trying to find our way through the mazes
We could wait this out
Or walk through that fire somehow
You trying to put together all the pieces
When you should turn around now and leave 'em

Bloody knuckles paint the whole place red
All alone in a room full of misfits
Everybody's looking at me
Something's got a hold on me
I'm choking on my crooked teeth
Wake me up if I sleep
Cause I'm haunted by my dreams
Crooked teeth
My crooked teeth
Cutting way too close to my skin
I feel the devil trying to creep back in

Flash back and I'm trying to forget

Cut from the mold of the anti-social
Plug them in and turn 'em on
Process the data  make yourself the bomb
What is your target?
What is your reason?
Do you have emotions  is your heart freezing?
Seizing this opportunity to speak
You didn't say nothin but turn your fucking cheek
Dead Cell!
Dead Cell!
Learn a lesson from the almighty dread
Kids are getting sick like malaria
The kids are getting singled out
Let me hear the dead cells shout
Dead Cell!

Whoa  when I get down
Whoa  lift me higher
Whoa
I swear to God that it might just be the death of me
I'm burning pictures of myself like it could set me free
I was dead  now I'm living because I made my decision
No  I don't need permission to elevate with precision
I'm 'bout to break through the ceiling
'Cause I need something to lift me up when I'm down
I get lost in my head for so long  I can't get out
When I'm feeling like I'm crawling in my skin and sinking down
I need something to lift me up
I wanna elevate
Elevate
Watch me elevate

Face everything and rise
The streets crawl with a deadly omen
I need a cure for this life I've chosen

I thought I saw you in an hourglass
I’m not sure where the time has gone
But I know it's been too long
We used to say we'd never change
Now we’re trying not to show our age
I know you said you needed space
So you moved all the furniture around this place
You don't feel like home
You don't feel like home
It's getting dark at sunset park
I see the marks on your broken heart
I'm trying not to let it get to me
But it's hard with all our history
Leaving town while the city sleeps
I keep looking in the rearview mirror
Even though I wasn't happy here

I realized what is wrong with me
It's been a helter-skelter romance from the start
Take these memories that are haunting me
Of a paper man cut into shreds
By his own pair of scissors
Because days come and go

Hanging over from another good time

Broke up the next day
My bags outside

I'm a broken man
I'm full of sin
I'm sick of all this hell
That I'm livin' in
And I can't escape it
This is how it feels
When you try to numb the pain
With a thousand pills
You tore me down
And wished that I was dead
In another bed
But when I push away
You only pull me closer
It's only over
When we both wanna say it's over
I gotta change
This is not who I am
I wanna start over
Wanna try this again
You're everything I need
Everything I'm not
Give me one more shot

Fly into outer space
We'll float away...
And we die...
Die to love another day

You lifted me up
Just to watch as you broke me
You promised me
Looked me straight in the eyes
No matter what you say
I don't know truth from the lies
I held you up
Like I always do
I forgave you for your sins
And I carried you through
No matter how hard we fall
We always knew
You will bleed for me
And I will bleed for you
We fly into outer space
Die to love another day (We can rise again)

Fly!
Fly into outer space
We'll float away...
And we die...
Die to love another day

I'm drowning in myself
Did someone turn the lights out?
Or is it just another dark cloud in my head?
'Cause I'm cut deep
My heart won't beat
If I wanna scratch out yesterday
I've got so much I need to say
(I've got so much I need to say)
I think I need help
'Cause I'm drowning in myself
It's sinking in
I can't pretend that I ain't been through hell
I think I need help

Believe it
And I won't keep listening when temptation's creeping in

I'm sorry  but the party's over
Cocaine nose and trendy clothes
Gotta send her to rehab
She found out she's got no soul
But it really doesn't bother her
White trash queen  American dream
Oh  what a role model
Throwing a fit  making a scene
Like no tomorrow
Hollywood whore  passed out on the floor
Can't take it no more
I'm sorry  but the party's over
The talk of the town is she's goin' down
I'm sorry  but the party's over now
Awake by noon  drunk by 4:00
Sucked up in the showbiz
You're so lame  you're such a bore
I wanna kick your teeth in
Plastic smile to match your style
We can tell ya got a facelift

You're a number one hit

The talk of the town is she's goin' down

And I'm a junkie for the way that you please
You shut me up when you swallow me down
I almost told you that I loved you
I say the damnedest things when you're on top of me
I almost told you that I loved you
You look so fragile as I fuck with your head
I almost told you that I loved you
I say the damnedest things when you're on top of me
I almost told you that I loved you
I'm not the one that you want
The one that you need
My love is like a fucking disease
You can give me your hand
You can make your demands
I'm the hardest motherfucker to please

My name's Coby Dick
Mr. Dick if you're nasty
Rock a mic with a voice that's raspy
And I'm poetic in my operations
My God given talent is to rock all the nations
We're going to infest
Push your wig back with my lyrical pistol
Cock back and unleash with my physical
Wrap you in my thoughts and become indivisible
Stick to my mind as we rock into ritual
You better do just what I say
And if you don't then you will pay
Infest!

Kill the noise
I choke on the air I'm breathing
Ain't nobody stopping the bleeding
Deaf with demons on both sides
Chained to this static in my mind
And I can't hide
Screaming at my face
So loud I can't hear my voice
Breaking through my mistakes
It's time to kill the noise
Kill the noise
My scars keep screamin'
I live through the pain for a reason
It drags me down like an anchor

Suffocation  no breathing
Don't give a fuck if I cut my arm bleeding
This is my last resort
Cut my life into pieces
I've reached my last resort
Suffocation  no breathing
Don't give a fuck if I cut my arm bleeding
Do you even care if I die bleeding?
Would it be wrong  would it be right
If I took my life tonight? Chances are that I might
Mutilation out of sight
And I'm contemplatin' suicide
'Cause I'm losin' my sight  losin' my mind
Wish somebody would tell me I'm fine
Losin' my sight  losin' my mind
Wish somebody would tell me I'm fine
I never realized I was spread too thin
'Til it was too late and I was empty within
Hungry  feeding on chaos and livin' in sin
Downward spiral  where do I begin?
It all started when I lost my mother
No love for myself  and no love for another
Searchin' to find a love upon a higher level
Findin' nothin' but questions and devils

In a lonely soul
Slipped and fell into
A deep black hole
I can tell you're lost
I'm here for you
Wildfires burning you
Down to stone
Blind eyes turning
From a world so cold
A million miles apart
Within my reach
It's not like me to worry
But when I see you fading in the dark
I'll leave a light on for you
There for you if you drift too far
I'll leave a light on for you
The rain comes
Following an endless drought
To wash away the remnants
Of all your doubts

I didn't care 'bout a thing
It was me in this world
And a broken dream
I was blamin' myself
For all that was goin' wrong
I was way out there
On the wrong side of town
And the ones that I loved
I started pushing them out
Then I realized
That it was all my fault
I've been lookin' for a lifeline
For what seems like a lifetime
I'm drowning in the pain
I'm breaking down again
Lookin' for a lifeline
So I put out my hand
And I asked for some help
We tore down the walls
I built around myself
I was struck by the light
And I fell to the ground

I'm never gonna fade away

In your arms
No matter what I say
It's only going to steal your breath
And slip away
I don't want to dive in first
You don't want to hear these words
It's only gonna make it worse

'Cause you've got a heart of gold
But maybe you should let me go
I'll love you through a periscope
You wear your heart so fearless

Pulling me underneath

It's life or death  so hold your breath or suffocate them
Provoking fears with smoke and mirrors  the tension's rising
We waste our time and wait in line while nothing changes

Until the people get loud
So get down
Take it to another level right now
No resolution
Stand up  this is renegade music
Take back your life right now
Are you ready for some new shit?

Look into my eyes
Then I realize that
She could see inside my head
So I close my eyes
Thinking that I could hide
Disassociate so I don't have to lose my head
This situation leads to agitation
Will she cut me off?
Will this be an amputation?
I don't know if I care

Life's not fair
Fighting all the time
This is out of line
She loves me not
Loves me not
Do you realize I won't compromise

I have shed my tears
I have drank my beers and watched my fears fly away

To tell her I hate

Peeled out in my big-block Chevy
Flipped it six times and I knew that I was ready
To straighten up because my best friend died
I didn't wanna carry on living that life
And now I'm running from the scene
'Cause I was caught up in the crime
It's a loaded memory
Yeah  it kills me every time
And I'm trying not to scream  but it's eating me alive
I'm still haunted by the best years of

I was young and I was helpless  man
Self-medicating my own depression  man
I drank a bottle after breakfast
I lost my job  so I lost faith
I just saw a baby bump in my girl's waist (What?)
I need a drink to feel right
Party with my homies to escape from real life
Yeah  we had it all figured out
Pocket full of pills and a forty in my mouth  but

This is the start of the ending
This is the start of the ending
I admit it took a second  but I realized
I been looking for a reason just to sever ties
Only seeing what I wanna see
Got me questioning the things that I started to believe
Paranoid from the trauma in my life  uh
Trust issues make it hard to sleep at night  uh
Wish I could worry just a little less
Wish I could quiet all the noise up inside my head

I've made a huge mess
I can't control myself
Words manifest from deep inside where people hide within
This rugged style steals your brain
It's not receding and my body's going numb
Thrown away
I want to be
Thrown away

We are the future  the 21st century dyslexic  glue sniffing cyber sluts
With homicidal minds and handguns
We are insane  nothing will change
There is a thin line between what is good and what is evil
My life is a circus and I am tripping down that tightrope
And again  and again
There's no beginning  there is no end
There is only change
Progression backwards  is this where we are heading
Take back your soul  forget your emptiness
There is a thin line between what is good and what is evil
My life is a circus and I am tripping down that tightrope
And again  and again

I speak of madness  my heart and soul
I cry for people who have got no control
Lets take our sanity  lets take compassion
And be responsible for every action
There is a thin line between what is good and what is evil
My life is a circus and I am tripping down that tightrope
And again  and again
Never turn my back to the vultures
I’ma need to check all your coats 'cause
You never know when the enemy approaches
Who do you trust?
Tell me who do you trust?
I see 'em coming at us
But when the Molotov drops
Tell me who do you trust?
Everywhere I go
I see people passing by
They keep staring back at me
Like some freak in paradise
Are you people savage?
Pull the knife out from my back
In the company of rich
I’ll take loyalty over royalty
Who do you trust?
Tell me who do you trust?
I see 'em coming at us
But when the Molotov drops
Tell me who do you trust?
Who do you trust?
Tell me who do you trust?
I see 'em coming at us
But when the Molotov drops
Tell me who do you trust?

Caught between the thorns and the roses
People going in and out of focus
I'ma need to check all your motives
And see the fire lying under where the smoke is
Who do you trust?
Tell me who do you trust?
I see 'em coming at us
But when the Molotov drops
Tell me who do you trust?
Everywhere I go
I see people passing by
They keep staring back at me

Pull the knife out from my back
In the company of rich

Tell me who do you trust? What?
