lyrics
"Come creeping into your days
And the world comes stealing children from your room
Guard your innocence from hallucination
And know that darkness always gathers around the light
There is a light we can't always see
If there is a world we can't always be
If there is a dark that we shouldn't doubt
When the wind screams and shouts
And the sea is a dragon's tail
And the ship that stole your heart away sets sail
When all you've left is leaving
And all you got is grieving
And all you know is needing
If there is a light we can't always see
If there is a world we can't always be
If there is a dark that we shouldn't doubt
'Cause this is a song
A song for someone
Someone like me
I know the world is dumb
But you don't have to be
I've got a question for the child in you before it leaves
Are you tough enough to be kind?
Do you know your heart has its own mind?
Darkness gathers around the light
There is a light we can't always see
If there is a world we can't always be
If there is a dark that we shouldn't doubt
And this is a song
A song for someone
This is a song
A song for someone
Someone like me
Someone like me
Diamonds on a ring of gold
You say you want
Your story to remain untold
But all the promises we made
From the cradle to the grave
When all I want is you
You say you'll give me
A highway with no one on it
Treasure just to look upon it
All the riches in the night
You say you'll give me
Eyes in the moon of blindness
A river in a time of dryness
A harbour in the tempest
But all the promises we make
From the cradle to the grave
When all I want is you
You might also like
You say you want
Your love to work out right
To last with me through the night
You say you want
Diamonds on a ring of gold
Your story to remain untold
Your love not to grow cold
All the promises we break
From the cradle to the grave
When all I want is you
For one day they will have to stand up to themselves
Blessed are the liars
For the truth can be awkward
It's not a place
This country is to me a sound
Of drum and bass
You close your eyes to look around
It's a sound
It's not a place
This country is to me a thought
That offers grace
For every welcome that is sought
You are rock and roll
You and I are rock and roll
You are rock and roll
Came here looking for American soul
You might also like
It's not a place
This is a dream the whole world owns
The pilgrim's face
It had your heart to call her home
Hold on Brother John
Too many mothers weepin'
Dream on Brother John
But in your dreams you can't be sleepin'
You are rock and roll
You and I are rock and roll
You are rock and roll
Came here looking for American soul
American
American
Put your hands in the air
Hold up the sky
Could be too late but we still gotta try
There's a moment in our life where a soul can die
There's a promise in the heart of every good dream
It's a call to action not to fantasy
Let it be unity
Let it be community
For refugees like you and me
A country to receive us
Will you be my sanctuary?
Refu-Jesus
You are rock and roll
You and I are rock and roll
You are rock and roll
Came here looking for American soul
You are rock and roll
You and I are rock and roll
You are rock and roll
Came here looking for American soul

Come all you angels forgetting to fly
Come all who feel we're not on our own
All UFOs come on your way home
You just have to be right one more time then you're wrong
Atomic City (Atomic)
Atomic City (Atomic)
I'm free
Where you are is where I'll be
I'm free
So unexpectedly
Come all who serve above and below
Come all believers and all who don't know
Then you dive into your eyes and blah blah blah
Guitar-shaped pool with strings et cetera
Love is god and god is love

The wheel has not stopped

Where you are is where I'll be
I'm free
So unexpectedly
I'm free
I see what's in front of me
And your freedom is contagious
What you've got I wanna be
I'm free
It took me my whole life
I got the keys to the cages
I'm ready for bright lights
I'm free
I came here for the fight
I'm front row in Las Vegas
If you tear yourself in two again
If I could throw this lifeless lifeline to the wind
Into the night and through the rain
Into the half light and through the flame
Into the light and to the day
To let it go and so to fade away
To let it go and so fade away
I'm not sleeping

They'd tell you what I would say
True colours fly in blue and black
Blue silken sky and burning flag
Let it go and so fade away

There's no room  no space to rent in this town
You're out of luck  and the reason that you had to care
The traffic is stuck  and you're not moving anywhere
You thought you'd found a friend to take you out of this place
Someone you could lend a hand in return for grace
It's a beautiful day
Sky falls  you feel like
It's a beautiful day
Don't let it get away
You're on the road  but you've got no destination
You're in the mud  in the maze of her imagination
You love this town even if that doesn't ring true
You've been all over  and it's been all over you
It's a beautiful day
Don't let it get away
It's a beautiful day

See the world in green and blue
See China right in front of you
See the canyons broken by cloud
See the tuna fleets clearing the sea out
See the Bedouin fires at night
See the oil fields at first light
And see the bird with a leaf in her mouth
After the flood all the colours came out
It was a beautiful day
Don't let it get away
Beautiful day
Touch me
Take me to that other place
Reach me
I know I'm not a hopeless case
What you don't have you don't need it now
What you don't know you can feel it somehow
What you don't have you don't need it now
Don't need it now
Comes a stingin' rain
See it drivin' nails
Into the souls on the tree of pain
From the firefly
A red orange glow
See the face of fear
Runnin' scared in the valley below
Bullet the blue sky
Bullet the blue sky
Bullet the blue
Bullet the blue
In the locust wind
Comes a rattle and hum
Jacob wrestled the angel
And the angel was overcome
You plant a demon seed
You raise a flower of fire
We see them burnin' crosses

So this guy comes up to me
His face red like a rose on a thorn bush
Like all the colours of a royal flush
And he's peelin' off those dollar bills
Slappin' 'em down
And I can see those fighter planes
And I can see those fighter planes
Across the mud huts as children sleep
Through the alleys of a quiet city street
And take the staircase to the first floor
Turn the key and slowly unlock the door
As a man breathes into his saxophone
And through the walls you can hear the city groan
America
See across the field
See the sky ripped open
See the rain comin' through the gapin' wound
Howling the women and children
Who run into the arms

California  then we fell into the shining sea
The weight that drags your heart down
Well  that's what took me where I need to be
Which is here
Out on Zuma
Watching you cry like a baby
California  at the dawn you thought would never come
But it did
Like it always does
Woah  all I know
And all I need to know
Is there is no
Yeah  there is no end to love
You might also like
I didn't call you
Words can scare a thought away
Everyone's a star in our town
It's just your light gets dimmer if you have to stay
In your bedroom
In a mirror
Watching yourself cry like a baby
California  blood-orange sunset brings you to your knees
I've seen for myself
There's no end to grief
That's how I know
Woah  that's how I know
And why I need to know
That there is no
Yeah  there is no end to love
Woah  all I know and all I need to know
Is there is no
Yeah  there is no end to love
(There is no end to love)
Woah  all I know
And all I need to know
Is there is no
Yeah  there is no end to love
Woah  we come and go
Stolen days you don't give back
The fear was all I knew
I was looking for a soul that's real
Then I ran into you
And that cherry blossom tree
Was a gateway to the sun
Northside just across the river to the Southside
That's a long way here
All the green and all the gold
The foolish pride that gets you out the door
Sleepwalking down the road
Not waking from these dreams
It was a war zone in my teens
I'm still standing on that street
Still need an enemy
The worst ones I can't see

Northside just across the river from the Southside
That's a long way here
All the green and all the gold
The hurt you hide and the joy you hold
The foolish pride that sends you back for more
You can't return to where you've never left
Blossoms falling from a tree
They cover you and cover me
Paint the world you need to see
Sometimes fear is the only place that we can call our home
Cedarwood Road
And a heart that is broken
The less you find out as you go
I knew much more then
Than I do now
Neon heart  dayglo eyes
A city lit by fireflies
They're advertising in the skies
For people like us
And I miss you when you're not around
I'm getting ready to leave the ground
Ooh-ooh-ooh  ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh  ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Oh  you look so beautiful tonight
In the city of blinding lights
Don't look before you laugh
Look ugly in a photograph
Flash bulbs  purple irises
The camera can't see
I've seen you walk unafraid
I've seen you in the clothes you made
Can you see the beauty inside of me?
What happened to the beauty I had inside of me?

Oh  you look so beautiful tonight

In the city of blinding lights
The more you know  the less you feel
Some pray for  others steal
Blessings are not just for the ones who kneel
You shoot me from a gun
I need you to elevate me here
At the corner of your lips
As the orbit of your hips
Eclipse  you elevate my soul
I've got no self-control
Been living like a mole
Now going down  excavation
I and I in the sky
You make me feel like I can fly
So high  elevation
A star  lit up like a cigar
Strung out like a guitar
Maybe you could educate my mind
Explain all these controls
I can't sing but I've got soul
The goal is elevation
A mole  digging in a hole
Digging up my soul
Now going down  excavation
I and I in the sky
You make me feel like I can fly
So high  elevation

Love  lift me out of these blues

So high  elevation
Elevation...

Tells the next one there'll be one more
And every gambler knows that to lose
Is what you're really there for
Summer I was fearless
Now I speak into an answer phone
Like every falling leaf on the breeze
If you go
If you go your way and I go mine
Are we so
Are we so helpless against the tide?
Knows that we're in love with defeat
Are we ready to be swept off our feet
And stop chasing
Every breaking wave?
Every sailor knows that the sea
Is a friend made enemy
And every shipwrecked soul knows what it is
To live without intimacy
I thought I heard the captain's voice
But it's hard to listen while you preach
Like every broken wave on the shore
This is as far as I could reach

The sea knows where are the rocks
And drowning is no sin
You know where my heart is
The same place that yours has been
We know that we fear to win
And so we end before we begin
Before we begin
If you go
If you go your way and I'll go mine
Are we so
Are we so helpless against the tide?
Knows that we're in love with defeat
Are we ready to be swept off our feet
And stop chasing
Get out of your own way  hah  hah
Love hurts
Now you're the girl who's left with no words
Your heart's a balloon  but then it bursts
It doesn't take a cannon  just a pin
Your skin's not covering and resistance
Love has got to fight for its existence
The enemy has armies of assistance
The amorous  the glamorous  the kiss
A fist  listen to this  oh
Get out of your own way  oh  ah
Get out of your own way  oh  ah
I could sing it to you all night  all night
If I could  I'd make it alright  alright
Nothing's stopping you except what's inside
I can help you  but it's your fight  your fight
Fight back
Don't take it lying down  you got to bite back
The face of liberty's starting to crack
She had a plan up until she got a smack in the mouth
And it all went south
Like freedom
The slaves are looking for someone to lead them
The master's looking for someone to need him
The promised land is there for those who need it most

Blessed are the arrogant
For their's the kingdom of their own company
Blessed are the superstars
For the magnificence in their light
We understand better our own insignificance
Blessed are the filthy rich
For you can only truly own what you give away
I have run through the fields
Only to be with you
Only to be with you
I have scaled these city walls
These city walls
Only to be with you
But I still haven't found what I'm lookin' for
But I still haven't found what I'm lookin' for
I have kissed honey lips
Felt the healing fingertips
It burned like fire
This burnin' desire
I have spoke with the tongue of angels
I have held the hand of a devil
It was warm in the night
I was cold as a stone
But I still haven't found what I'm lookin' for

A body in a soul
You don’t see me but you will
I am not invisible

Has been gone a while
But it's not an illusion
The ache
In my heart
Is so much a part
Of who I am
Something in your eyes
Took a thousand years to get here
Something in your eyes
Hold me close
Hold me close and don't let me go
Hold me close
Like I'm someone that you might know
Hold me close
The darkness just lets us see
Who we are
I’ve got your light inside of me

Once
We are born
We begin to forget
The very reason we came
But you
I'm sure I've met
Long before the night the stars went out
We're meeting up again

Hold me close and don't let me go
Hold me close
Like I'm someone that you might know
Hold me close
The darkness just lets us see
Who we are

Free yourself to be yourself

I can see the lights in front of me
I believe my best days are ahead
I can see the lights in front of me
I gotta get out from under my bed
To see again the lights in front of me
If I can't get an answer
In your eyes I see it
The lights of home
The lights of home
I was born from a screaming sound
I can see the lights in front of me
I thought my head was harder than ground

Run to the ocean
Or do you feel the same?
Will it make it easier on you

When it's one need in the night
Did I disappoint you
Or leave a bad taste in your mouth?
You act like you never had love

To drag the past out into the light
One
Have you come here for forgiveness?
Have you come to raise the dead?
Have you come here to play Jesus
To the lepers in your head?

The sunlight warms your skin
All the beauty that's been lost before
Wants to find us again
I can't fight you anymore
It's you I'm fighting for
The sea throws rocks together
But time leaves us polished stones
We can't fall any further
If we can't feel ordinary love
And we cannot reach any higher
If we can't deal with ordinary love
Birds fly high in the summer sky
And rest on the breeze
The same wind will take care of you and I
We'll build our house in the trees

There's a man in the corner in a pool of misery
I'm in a white van
As a red sea covers the ground
5:30 on a Friday night
Thirty-three good people cut down
I don't believe anymore
I don't believe anymore
Face down on a pillow of shame
There's some girls with a needle trying to spell my name
My body's not a canvas
My body's now a toilet wall
I don't believe anymore
I don't believe anymore

If I open my eyes
Woke up from where she was lyin' still
Said I gotta do something
About where we're goin'
Step on a steam train
Run from the darkness in the night
Ah la la la de day
Ah la la la de day
Sweet the sin
Bitter the taste in my mouth
I see seven towers
But I only see one way out
Scream without raising your voice
You know I took the poison from the poison stream
Then I floated out of here
Ah la la la de day
Ah la la la de day

She runs through the streets
With eyes painted red
Under a black belly of cloud in the rain
In through a doorway
She brings me white golden pearls
Stolen from the sea
And the storm blows up in her eyes
She will suffer the needle chill
She's running to stand still
 your tea and sugar
 dreaming
 there's no healing
 no
 your dreams all take flight
You're telling me and anyone
You're hard enough
You don't have to put up a fight
You don't have to always be right
Let me take some of the punches
For you tonight
Listen to me now
I need to let you know
You don't have to go it alone
And it's you when I look in the mirror
And it's you when I don't pick up the phone
Sometimes you can't make it on your own
We fight all the time
You and I  that's alright
We're the same soul
I don't need  I don't need to hear you say
That if we weren't so alike
You'd like me a whole lot more

Can you hear me when I sing
You're the reason I sing
You're the reason why the opera is in me...
Where are we now?
Still got to let you know
A house doesn't make a home
Don't leave me here alone...
And it's you when I look in the mirror
And it's you that makes it hard to let go
Sometimes you can't make it on your own
Sometimes you can't make it
Best you can do is to fake it
I have some scars from where I've been
You've got eyes that can see right through me
You're not afraid of anything they've seen
I was told that I would feel
Nothing the first time
I don't know how these cuts heal
But in you I found a rhyme
If there is a light you can't always see
And there is a world we can't always be
If there is a dark that we shouldn't doubt
And this is a song
A song for someone
This is a song
A song for someone
You let me in to a conversation
A conversation only we could make
You're breaking into my imagination
I was told I'd feel
Nothing the first time
You were slow to heal

Of anything in this world
There's nothing you can throw at me
That I haven't already heard
I'm just trying to find
A decent melody
A song that I can sing
In my own company
I never thought you were a fool
But darling look at you (Oh)
You gotta stand up straight
Carry your own weight
You've got to get yourself together
You've got stuck in a moment
And now you can't get out of it
Don't say that later will be better
Now you're stuck in a moment
And you can't get out of it
I will not forsake
The colours that you bring
The nights you filled with fireworks
They left you with nothing
I am still enchanted
By the light you brought to me

And if the day won't last

Along the stony pass

And if the day won't last
And if your way should falter
Along the stony pass
It's just a moment
Summer serenading's a long way from this frozen place  your face
And like flowers growing in a bomb crater
I've been thinking about the West Coast
Not the one that everyone knows
We're sick of living in the shadows
We've one more chance before the light goes
For a summer of love (Summer of love)
Summer of love (Summer of love)
That all we need's ahead of us somewhere
In a summer to come
So we run
I've been thinking about the West Coast

To claim the victory Jesus won (Sunday  Bloody Sunday) on
Yeah yeah yeah
But she won't catch me or break my fall
Baby got blue skies up ahead

It's no secret that our world is in darkness tonight
They say the sun is sometimes eclipsed by the moon
Y'know I don't see you when she walks in the room
It's no secret that a friend is someone who lets you help
It's no secret that a liar won't believe anyone else
They say a secret is something you tell one other person
We're fallin' from the sky tonight
On the sheer face of love like a fly on a wall
It's no secret at all
It's no secret that a conscience can sometimes be a pest
It's no secret ambition bites the nails of success
All kill their inspiration and sing about the grief
For love

The universe exploding 'cause of one man's lie
A light had been turned on
You walked out in the world like you belong there
As easy as a breeze
Each heart was yours to please
Is it only me who sees there's something wrong there?
I can see you
You need to see me
It's the little things that give you away
The words you cannot say
Your big mouth in the way
I saw you on the stairs
You didn't notice I was there
That's 'cause you were talking at me and not to me
You were high above the storm
A hurricane being born
This freedom it might cost you your liberty

Sometimes
I can't believe my existence
I see myself from a distance
I can't get back inside
Sometimes
The air is so anxious
All my thoughts are so reckless
And all my innocence has died
Sometimes
I wake at four in the morning
Where all the darkness is swarming
And it covers me in fear
Sometimes
Sometimes
Sometimes
Sometimes
I'm full of anger and grieving
So far away from believing
That any sun will reappear
Sometimes
The end is not coming
It's not coming
The end is here
Sometimes
Sometimes
Sometimes
Sometimes
Sometimes
When the painted glass shatters
And you're the only thing matters
But I can't see you through the tears
Sometimes
The end is not coming
It's not coming
The end is here
Chasing down a dream before it disappeared
I was aching to be somewhere near
Your voice was all I heard
I was shaking from a storm in me
Haunted by the spectres that we had to see
Just wishing to be blinded
And we were pilgrims on our way
I woke up at the moment when the miracle occurred
Heard a song that made some sense out of the world
Everything I ever lost now has been returned
The most beautiful sound I'd ever heard
We got language so we can't communicate
Religion so I can love and hate
Music so I can exaggerate my pain
And give it a name

Somebody stepped inside your soul
Little by little they robbed and stole
Till someone else was in control
You think it's easier
To put your finger on the trouble

I have a will for survival
So you can hurt me and hurt me some more
I can live with denial

 we drank the wine
 I spiked your drink
 you were acting like it was the end of the world
 I was drowning sorrows
 going down on me
 you said you'd wait till the end of the world
(Turn it up loud  captain)
Lights go down  it's dark
The jungle is your head  can't rule your heart
A feeling so much stronger than a thought
Your eyes are wide
And though your soul  it can't be bought
Your mind can wander
Hello  hello (¡Hola!)
I'm at a place called Vertigo (¿Dónde está?)
It's everything I wish I didn't know
Except you give me something I can feel
Feel
The night is full of holes
As bullets rip the sky of ink with gold
They twinkle as the boys play rock and roll
They know that they can't dance
At least they know
I can't stand the beats  I'm asking for the cheque
The girl with crimson nails has Jesus round her neck
Swinging to the music  swinging to the music
Oh  oh  oh

Love is not the easy thing
The only baggage you can bring
Is all that you can't leave behind

And for a second you turn back

We're still building then burning down love
