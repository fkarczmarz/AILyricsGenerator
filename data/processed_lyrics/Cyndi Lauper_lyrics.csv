"There's a locket in my pocket that I can't find
I'm at my own front door and I can't get in
I'm dialing up 911
I'm on the brink of trouble again
If you could change the time a little
Tell me do you have a home-made remedy
The only time we talk is in our sleep
I'm dialing up 911
I'm on the brink of trouble again
If you could change the time a little

My back is in the corner
My boat is taking on water
You can't wrap fire up in paper
And you can't rap your way out of here
I'm dialing up 911
I'm on the brink of trouble again
If you could change the time a little
I'm on the brink of trouble again
If you could change the time a little
I'm dialing up the 911
I'm dialing up the 911
I'm dialing up the 911
I'm dialing up the 911
The 911 emergency number
Is not in effect in the area where you are
Please hang up and dial 0 for operator
I wish I could tell you that I stopped hearing your name
And then I realize every thought of you
Runs a circle around my heart
I hear your voice haunting me
I feel your touch in the dark
It was a night to remember
All your kisses I still taste
It was a night to remember
Can't forget the look on your face
Oh-no  oh
Starlight send a message like a beacon into the night
To tell you I'm lonely when I shut out the light
Because a part of me left with you
So I feel lost inside
Sometimes I look into my mirror
I see you shining through my eyes
It was a night to remember
All your kisses I still taste
It was a night to remember
Can't forget the look on your face
Oh  It was a night to remember
All these feelings I can't erase
Oh  no

Endless dreams
Around my shoulders
I cannot free (I cannot free)
This restless heart
It was a night to remember
All your kisses I still taste

Can't forget the look on your face
No  It was a night to remember
Not enough time for you to stay
Oh  it was a night to remember
All your kisses I still taste
It was a night to remember
Can't forget the look on your face
Oh  no...
 and I'll be with you
 all through the night today
 we won't reach back
 there is no end
 so stray cat sings back
 under those white street lamps
 we won't reach back
 there is no end
 the sleep in your eyes is enough
 let me stay there awhile
 we won't reach back
 there is no end
We don't need no thought control
No dark sarcasm in the classroom
 ah
 no-not your soul
 where is little boy blue?
 oh
 kids walking
 just a kid

Just like I said I would be
I'm your friend
Just like you think it should be
Did you think I would stand here and lie?
While our moment was passing us by
Waiting for your change of heart
It just takes a beat
To turn it around
At the edge of my seat
Please turn it around
Days go by
Leaving me with a hunger
I could fly
Back to when we were younger
When adventures like cars we would ride
And the years lied ahead still untried

Don't you know that no one alive can always be an angel?
When things go wrong I seem bad...
Oh but I'm just a soul whose intentions are good
With a joy that's hard to hide
Oh then sometimes it seems that all I have to do is worry
And then you're bound to see my other side
Oh but I'm just a soul whose intentions are good
If I seem edgy
I want you to know
Life has its problems
And I have my share
And that's one thing I never wanna do
And have thoughts like any other one?

Searching for my hat  I thought I'd left it by the door
So I tore around the room like a bird without a head
I saw your picture waving back at me from underneath the bed
From a long  long time ago
When all I had was a hat full of stars
The one I'll always treasure
The one that you wore
You loved the look but you never looked inside
You would have seen us there
You could've seen far
You should've seen the magic
In my hat full of stars
I'm trying to live in the present  but I keep tripping on the past
No  we never had the time for everything we had
So it felt like we had nothing  that's what makes this hat so sad
It was a long  long time ago
When all we had was a hat full of stars
The one I'll always treasure

I never knew that I could hurt this way
And heartache number two was when you came back again
And now I got heartache by the numbers
Troubles by the score
Every day you love me less
Each day I love you more
A love that I can't win
But the day that I stop counting
Is the day my world will end
Heartache number three was when you called me
And said that you was a-coming home to stay
I waited but you must've lost your way
And now I got heartache by the numbers
Troubles by the score
Every day you love me less
Each day I love you more
A love that I can't win
But the day that I stop counting
Is the day my world will end

Oh he's handsome as can be
But he worries me
He goes to college
And gathers knowledge
He's up in his Latin and Greek
But in his sheikin' he's weak cause

And I gotta have some lovin'
You're sending me where it always rains

You gotta fill it up with love before I fall inside of..

With a pirate smile
Make believe and play pretend
We were innocent and wild
Hopped a fence and slammed the gate
Running down my alleyway
In time to watch Sally's pigeons fly
We loved to watch them dive and soar
Circle in the sky
Free as a bird from three to four
And never knowing why
Neighbors pulled their wash back in
Put away my Barbie and Ken
Look out overhead
While Sally's pigeons fly
I had a fool's confidence
That the world had no boundaries
But instincts and common sense
Come in different quantities
My heart began to
Skip to the beat
Of the boy next door
She had her eye across the street
On someone shy and tall
We lived our dreams
And challenged fate
And Sally let his pigeons out to fly

With a photograph
Two little girls in ponytails
Some twenty-one years back
She left one night with just a nod
Was lost from some back alley job
I close my eyes and Sally's pigeons fly
She never saw those birds again
A pirate smile hasn't made me cry
I close my eyes
In the pages of a Blueboy magazine
Hey  I've been thinking of a new sensation
I'm picking up the good vibrations
Do I wanna go out with a lion's roar?
Yeah  I wanna go south and get me some more
Hey  they say that a stitch in time saves nine
They say I better stop or I'll go blind

Things are overwhelming
Sometimes I think
I don't know what I'll do
But I forget the world
And everything around me
That's what I think
When I think about you
The streets are filled
With too many babies
Black air in the sky of of blue
People pass by
No life in their eyes
The concrete jungle's
Really going crazy
Sometimes I think
Things are overwhelming
Sometimes I think
I don't know what I'll do
But I forget the world
And everything around me
That's what I think
When I think about you

The rent is due
And the pockets are empty
People ask machines for the truth
No crystal ball to help see it all
But where we gonna find
The dreams to feed the babies
Baby life goes on
That's what people say
But I'm nowhere if you go away
I'd just be looking for a brighter day
Sometimes I think
Things are overwhelming
Sometimes I think
I don't know what I'll do
But I forget the world
And everything around me
That's what I think
Break the chain then we break down
Unspoken expectations
Ideals you used to play with
They've finally taken shape
What's good enough for you
Is good enough for me
It's good enough
It's good enough for me
Now you'll say you're startin' to feel the push and pull
Of what could be and never can
Old fashioned superstitions
I find it too hard to break

Ah-ha
It's hard on the soul
Stone the world is stone
Cold to the touch
And hard on the soul
In the grey of the streets
In the neon unknown
I look for a sign
That im not on my own
That im not here alone
As the still of the night
And the choke of the air
And the winners delight
And the losers despair
Closes in left and right
I would love not ot care
From the far away look
Without stars in my eyes
Throught the halls of the rich
And the flats of the poor
Wherever I go
Theres no warmth anymore
Theres no love anymore
See Cyndi Lauper LiveGet tickets as low as $26You might also likeSo I turn on my heels
Im declining the fall
Ive had all I can take
With my back to the wall
Tell the world im not in
Im not taking the call
Stone the world is stone
But I saw it once
With the stars in my eyes
When each colour rang out
In a thunderous chrome
Its no trick of the light
I can't find my way home
Pee-wee's SO excited
'Cause all his friends have been invited (That's you!)
To go wacky at Pee-wee's Playhouse!
There's a crazy rhythm  comin' from Puppetland (What that?)
He's got a couple of talkin' fish
And a genie who'll grant a wish
Golly  it's cuckoo at Pee-wee's Playhouse!
Globey's spinnin'  Mr. Window's grinnin'
'Cause Pterri's flyin' by (Hello!)
The Flowers are singin'  the Picture Phone is ringin'
And the Dinosaur family goes  Hi!
Mr. Kite's soarin'  Conky's still a snorin'
There's the flashing Magic Screen
The Cowntess is so classy  Randy's kinda sassy
A nuttier establishment you've never seen!
Spend the day with Pee-wee and you'll see what we mean!
(Come on!)
Get outta bed  there'll be no more nappin' (Wake up!)
'Cause you've landed in a place where anything can happen
Now we've given you fair warnin'
It's gonna be that kind of mornin'
For bein' wacky!
For getting nutty!
Golly  it's cuckoo!

Confusion is nothing new

Don't be discouraged
It's hard to take courage
In a world full of people
You can lose sight of it all

So don't be afraid to let them show
Your true colors
True colors
Are beautiful like a rainbow

Can always take a little time
I always thought
We'd be together down the line
We start to fight
And can't get over what was said
'Cause you see black and white
And I see red
And I wonder who let in the rain
You know without you
I'm not the same
When love gets strong
People get weak
Sometimes they lose control
And wind up in too deep
They fall like rain
Who let in the rain?
I make the bed and cover
Where you used to sleep
I'm smoothing over promises
Made in these sheets
I envy lovers passing by
Out on the street
'Cause what they have
I couldn't keep
