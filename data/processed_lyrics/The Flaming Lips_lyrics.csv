lyrics
"They rescued everyone
They lifted up the sun
A spoonful weighs a ton
Giving more than they had
The process had begun
A million came from one
The limits now were none
Forcing it off with their hands
The trapdoor came undone
Above our heads it swung
The privilege had been won
Yelling as hard as they can
The doubters all were stunned
Heard louder than a gun
But logic broke  as he appeared  he spoke about the future
We're not going to make it  he explained how the end will come
You and me were never meant to be part of the future
All we have is now
All we've ever had is now
All we have is now
All we'll ever have is now
I noticed that he had a watch and hat that looked familiar
He was me  from a dimension torn free of the future
We're not going to make it  he explained how the end will come
You and me were never meant to be part of the future
All we have is now
All we've ever had is now
All we have is now
For tricking me again
But I have been tricked again
Into forgiving you
What is this?
Are you some kind of hypnotist?
Waving your powers around
The sun eclipse behind the cloud
I thought I recognized your face
Amongst all of those strangers
But I am the stranger now
Amongst all of the recognized
What is this?
Are you some kind of hypnotist?
Waving your powers around
You're fucked up in the good way
And I'm fucked up in the bad
You and me
We thought we were so smart
We thought we could outrun them
But they had robot dogs
You and me
We're both in the same hole
But you dream of ways of leaving
And I get used to the cold
You and me
We heard a sudden thud
But you ran in to save them
And I didn't give a fuck
You and me
We heard a sudden tux
But you ran into to save them
And I didn't give a fuck
You and me
Our egos made from fires
Burning all of our flesh off
Till we're skeletons dueling with wires

Saw the light of the ship get crossed
But it was up above us
It left us where we was
You and me
Have learned that love is true
If you ask me how I know it
Even when they tell the truth
Another part of you dies
The truth is a lie
Assassins of youth

I can't believe their lies

But in your dreams you can buy expensive cars
Or live on Mars and have it your way
And you hate your boss at your job
But in your dreams you can blow his head off
And all your bad days will end
And all your bad days will end

So tell me now
How'd it happen?
After the lava flows
Maybe no one knows
Now that it's burned off the scum of the Earth
I wish the dinosaurs were still here now
It'd be fun to see them playing on the mountains
Up on the mountain they'd be all alone
You can't just leave them on the side of the road
You know they'll never make it on their own
They won't make it even if they try
Something else had happened
All those years ago
Things could have been so great
But now I think it's too late
To see them playing on the mountains

Doing acid and watching the light bugs glow (Glow  glow  glow  glow  glow)

And I couldn't remember
What is love and what is hate
The calculation's error
What is love and what is hate?
And why does it matter?
Is to love just a waste?
How can it matter?
As the dawn began to break
I had to surrender
The universe will have its way
Too powerful to master
What is love and what is hate?
And why does it matter?
Is to love just a waste?
How can it matter?
And I can understand if you still feel sad
It's summertime
Although it's hard to see its true possibilities
I thought it would set me free

Autumn's a coming and soon everything around us will die
Only a fool believes that he is different from the birds in the sky
All those birds go chasing some better sunny days
You can't hear them singing because they've all gone away
But this one bird didn't leave you
It stayed through the wintertime
You can't hear it sing but you can hear it as it flies
So don't you believe them
They'll destroy you with their lies
They only see the obvious
They see the sun go down but they don't see it rise
This one bird didn't leave you
You can hear it as it flies
It's not very loud but you can hear it if you try
So don't you believe them?
Yes it's true someday everything dies
We won't let that defeat us
We can't hear them singing
But we can hear it as it flies

Glows in the dark  it's iridescent
Take it with ya when you travel far
Get yourself a sweet Madonna
Dressed in rhinestone  settin' on a
Pedestal of Abalone Shells
Goin' 90  I ain't scared
'Cause I got the Virgin Mary
For the cure of all mankind
Both of them side by side
So determined
Locked in heated battle
For the cure that is their prize
But it's so dangerous
But they're determined
Theirs is to win
If it kills them
They're just humans
With wives and children
Upwards to the vanguard
Where the pressure is so high
Under the microscope
Hope against hope
Forging for the future
But to sacrifice their lives

So determined

Maybe we're just young and we won't know 'til we're old
We're too young to free ourselves from this lonely fish bowl
Some kind of wall

We can't get about
Always complaining about his life
To his computer wife
You think he would've found by now
To be thought of as a king
That you bought at the grocery store today
And it goes fast
You think of the past
Suddenly everything has changed
And the clouds all form a geometric shape
And it goes fast
You think of the past
Suddenly everything has changed
Putting all the clothes you washed away
And as you’re folding up the shirts you hesitate
And it goes fast
You think of the past
But how can I be glad
Now my flower is dead?
I see you happy
You've made the morning dew
Now you're showing me the truth
But I don’t want to believe you
The sunbeams
Burnin' my child dreams
The machine that brings me joy
Now it's just a stupid toy
I'd kiss your glowing head
And hear the things you said
And always believe you
Is fuckin' with my head
Feels like a dying love in the eyes of the young
Tell me love is neither living or dying
It's a power in your mind
I think it's with you all the time
Her smile was a rainbow
Her hair was sunbeam waves
Shining 'round like a halo
Her face was a fairy tale
That has a poison apple
Her skull was a mighty moat
Her brain was the castle
And the castle gets mistaken for a ship that's floating in the clouds
And the castle is brighter than a thousand Christmas trees
And the castle can never be rebuilt again
No way
One day a strange storm rolled in
While she was riding on her dragon
The mushrooms and the bumblebees
Told the flowers how it happened
She was lost in the invisible war
Fighting in the battle
Her love is still buried there
In the ruins of the castle

Cause I've noticed all the others
Cause I feel like the real reason
That you're quitting and admitting
That you've lost all the will to battle on
Will the fight for our sanity
Be the fight of our lives?
Now that we've lost all the reasons
That we thought that we had
Still the battle that we're in
Rages on till the end
But the thought that went unspoken
Was understanding that you're broken
Still the last volunteer battles on
Battles on
And noticed that I had been bleeding
For how long I didn't know
What kind of weapons have they got?
The softest bullet ever shot
From this moment on
Blaring like a trumpet
Coming from above us and somewhere below
The confidence of knowing
Descending to relieve us of the struggle
To believe it's so
See The Flaming Lips LiveGet tickets as low as $26You might also like
And it seemed to cause a chain reaction
The outreached hands had resigned themselves
To holding onto something that they never had
And that's too bad
Cause in reality there was no reaction
I accidentally touched my head
And noticed that I had been bleeding
I thought we would have to break up the band
To lose your arm would surely upset your brain
The poison then could reach your heart from a vein
I was glad that it didn't destroy you
How sad that would be
'Cause if it destroyed you
It would destroy me
When you had that accident in your car
That whole thing just really seemed too bizarre
Dodging holes and telephone poles through the dash
A million to one that you could survive such a crash
I was glad that it didn't destroy you
How sad that would be
'Cause if it destroyed you
It would destroy me

But the hole that it leaves in its absence can make you feel so low

But you won't let those robots defeat me
They're programmed to destroy us
She's gotta be strong to fight them
So she's taking lots of vitamins
'Cause she knows that ('Cause she knows that)
It'd be tragic (It'd be tragic)
If those evil robots win (Evil robots)
I know she can beat them
But you won't let those robots defeat me
But you won't let those robots defeat me
Think I've got all I need
With you as my girl
Feels like I'm ruling the world
You and me with our kingdom before us
Feels like we're living in the magic forest
With you as my girl
Feels like king of the world
We're the king and queen
Dope dealing celebrities and we're free
Free to live our lives just however we please
In the magic trees

You gotta live what you do
Got blood in my shoe
Driving to work as the sun's coming up
(Driving to work as the sun's coming up)
Wish it was a spaceship coming for us (Coming for us)
To take us away (Take us away)
In some royal parade (Royal parade)
