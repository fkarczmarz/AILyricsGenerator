"Hey
No-no-no  no-no-no  no
We're driving in a black car
And it's blacked out and we're spinnin'
We're listening to Fast Car
And you're driving fast and you're singin'
Don't wanna tell you what I'm feelin'
Don't want this night to hit a ceiling
I'm wearing dirty white shoes
A white t-shirt and your jacket
I'm laughing  but I'm lying
When you're smiling  I'm the saddest
I hide my face so you don't see it
I think out loud  hope you don't hear it
It's going on 18 months now
And it's fucked up  but I'm falling
I feel it every day now
But I'm stallin'  but I'm stallin'
I'm here  but I'm in pieces
And I don't know how to fix this
And I don't know how to fix this  no

If I'm just somebody that you're gonna leave
And you don't feel something when you look at me
You're holdin' my heart  mmm  whatcha say?
Just let me down slowly  I'll be okay
If you're just some habit that I gotta break
I can clear my system in 90 days
You're holdin' my heart  mmm  whatcha say?
Just let me down slowly
I get up  turn the lights out
And it's four o'clock in the morning
I close my eyes  I can't sleep
A hotel room in New York  and
I feel the space that's in between us
Convince myself that this is real love
'Cause you made this shit so easy
And I told you my secrets
So I don't know why I'm tongue tied
At the wrong time when I need this
I'm here  but I'm in pieces
And I don't know how to fix this
And I don't know how to fix this  no
If I'm just somebody that you're gonna leave
And you don't feel something when you look at me
You're holdin' my heart  mmm  whatcha say?
Just let me down slowly  I'll be okay
If you're just some habit that I gotta break
I can clear my system in 90 days
You're holdin' my heart  mmm  whatcha say?
Just let me down slowly
I-I-I  I-I-I  I-I-I
Ooh  no
We're drivin' in your fast car  your fast car
We're drivin' in your fast car  your fast car
We're drivin' in your fast car  your fast car
We're drivin' all night
We're drivin' in your fast car  your fast car  yeah
We're drivin' in your fast car  your fast car  yeah
We're drivin' in your fast car  your fast car  yeah
We're drivin' all night
If I'm just somebody that you're gonna leave
And you don't feel something when you look at me
You're holdin' my heart  mmm  whatcha say?
(Oh  you're holdin' my heart)
Just let me down slowly  I'll be okay
If you're just some habit that I gotta break (Gotta break)
I can clear my system in 90 days
You're holdin' my heart  mmm  whatcha say?
(Oh  you're holdin' my heart)
A world that's waiting up for me that I call my own
Through where no one’s been before
But it feels like home
We can live in a world that we design
The brightest colors fill my head
A million dreams are keeping me awake
I think of what the world could be
A vision of the one I see
A million dreams is all it's gonna take
There's a house we can build
Every room inside is filled with things from far away
Special things I compile
Each one there to make you smile on a rainy day

A million dreams are keeping me awake
I think of what the world could be

Let me be part of it all
Share your dreams with me
But I wanna bring you along to the world I see
To the world we close our eyes to see
We close our eyes to see
The brightest colors fill my head
A million dreams are keeping me awake
I think of what the world could be
A vision of the one I see
A million dreams is all it's gonna take
A million dreams for the world we're gonna make
I wasn't born a renegade
I stumbled through it anyway
I wish someone would have told me that this life is ours to choose
No one's handing you the keys or a book with all the rules
The little that I know I'll tell to you
When they dress you up in lies and you're left naked with the truth
You throw your head back and you spit in the wind
Let 'em drag you through hell
They can't tell you to change who you are
That's all I know so far
That's all I know so far
That's all I know so far
And pay full price for each mistake
But when the candy-coating hides the razor blade
You can cut yourself loose and use that rage

They can't tell you to change who you are

'Til the world blows up
And we will be enough and until the world blows up
Let 'em drag you through hell
They can't tell you to change who you are
That's all I know so far
 it was all green lights
 doesn't mean that it's over
 we don't have to be cold as ice
 I'm all out of life
 we still ran through the rain and the night
 oh
 I'm all out of life
 I'm all out of life
 oh
 I'm all out of life
Another day  I'm late again
Oh  just like that my money's spent
Where did it all go?
Another night  another heart
Another one leaves in the dark
And I'm searching for my counterpart
Where did they all go?
And I lock every single door
And I look behind me even more
Now turned in someone that I swore
I would never be
I wish I could go
Back to playing Barbies in my room
They never say
That you gotta grow up quite this soon
How fast things change
And now I'm here and all I wanna do
Is go back to playing barbies in my room
And I see it on my father's face
Another line that comes with age
I know that time will have its way
Where did it all go?
They say that things were simple then
Although I don't remember when
I wanna know what happens next
Where do we all go?

Rollin' pixie sticks to smoke
Couldn't wait 'til I was older

I slashed your tires
I made you chase me
I wasn't that friendly
'Cause I've been on the run so long they can't find me
You're waking up to remember I'm pretty
And when the chemicals leave my body
Times they keep comin'
All night
Laughin' and fuckin'
Some days like I'm barely breathin'
After we were high and the love dope died it was you
The pill I keep takin'
The nightmare I wake in
My perfect rock bottom
My beautiful trauma

Who's gonna have to die to remind us
That it feels like we chose this blindly
Now I'm gonna fuck up a hotel lobby
'Cause these tough
Times they keep comin'
Last night
I might have messed it up again

Wondering if you're gonna leave
Don't tell me what you see
That you actually believe it
Goddamn right I miss drinking
But I've been up late nights
Staring at the street lights
What if we're a closing window?
But I can't shake the feeling
I can't shake the feeling (I can't shake the feeling)
Do you picture a better life?
I found myself up late feeling kinda jealous
And it's got me thinking
It's just not you (not you)
I've been all night looking in the eyes of my baby

How did we get so low? (How?)
Oooh
Do you picture a better life?
And I wonder (I can't shake the feeling)
Do you picture
And sweaty palms from hanging on too tight
Clenched shut jaw
I've got another headache again tonight
And they burn from all the tears
I've been dying over you
Tie a knot in the rope
But there's nothing to grab
So I let go
I think I finally had enough
I think I maybe think too much
I think this might be it for us
Blow me one last kiss
You think I'm just too serious
I think you're full of shit
My head is spinning so
Blow me one last kiss
Just when it can't get worse
I've had a shit day
Have you had a shit day?

Who the hell are they anyways?
Is it some sad empty castle in the sky?
Did we just shoot too high and spoil like wine?
You walk by and it's like our bodies never touch
I know we never been quite here before
I wish I knew it when we lost it
You used to try to wake the beast in me
There's still a very sleepy part of me inside
I've been waiting to come alive
You stared into my eyes and turned to stone
And now I'm living all alone in these four walls
Kinda blank like the thoughts living in my head
This is the one that I felt I knew so well
I'm still the girl that you chased all around the world
I want the same things we did back then

Come take a walk with me (Come take a walk with me)
What do you feel when you see all the homeless on the street?
Who do you pray for at night before you go to sleep?
What do you feel when you look in the mirror?
Are you proud?
How do you sleep while the rest of us cry?
How do you dream when a mother has no chance to say goodbye?
How do you walk with your head held high?

Bickering worse than that bitch in that Snickers commercial

Didn't choose  but it's the only one we've got
And sometimes  I get so tired of getting tied up in my thoughts
You're the only one that ever makes it stop
God  it hurts to be human
Without you  I'd be losing
And someday  we'll face the music
God  it hurts to be human
Like we're buckled and preparing for the crash

There's no such thing as sin
Let it all come right in

I like whiskey on ice  I like sun in my eyes
I wanna burn it all down  so let's start a fire
I wanna be lost  so lost that I'm found
Naked and laughing with my blood on the ground (My blood on the ground)

It's a trust fall  baby
Picture a place where it all doesn't hurt
Where everything's safe and it doesn't get worse  oh my
We see through bloodshot eyes
Picture a place  somewhere else far away
Where you know what they mean and they mean what they say to us
And would that be enough?
Are we running out of time?
Are we hiding from the light?
Are we just too scared to fight for what we want tonight?
Closе your eyes and leavе it all behind
Go where love is on our side
It's a trust fall  baby
It's a trust fall  baby
You and I and everyone alive
We can run into the fire
It's a trust fall  baby

How it all turned to lies?
Sometimes I think﻿ that it's better
To never ask why
But just because it burns doesn't mean you're gonna die
Funny how the heart can be deceiving
More than just a couple times
Why do we fall in love so easy?
Even when it's not right
But just because it burns doesn't mean you're gonna die

Running like a dog
Fighting like I bitch too much
We could have it all
But neither one of us would budge
'Cause I want it all

But it's always darkest before the light
And that's enough for me to try

Trying to get up that great big hill of hope
For a destination
I realized quickly when I knew I should
That the world was made up of this
Brotherhood of man
For whatever that means
And so I cry somethimes when I'm lying in bed
Just to get it all out what's in my head
So I wake in the morning and I step outside
And I take deep breath and I get real high
And I scream from the top of my lungs
What's goin' on
And I say hey...
And I say hey what's goin' on
And I say hey...
I said hey what's goin' on
Oooh...
Oooh...
I try all the time
In this institution
I pray every single day
For a revolution
And so I cry sometimes when I'm lying in bed
Just to get it all out what's in my head
So I wake in the morning and I step outside
And I take deep breath and I get real high
And I scream from the top of my lungs
What's goin'on
And I say hey...
And I say hey what's goin' on
And I say hey...
I said hey what's goin' on

 you just ain't right

You promised me you'd be around
Uh-huh  that's right
I took your words  and I believed
In everything you said to me
Yeah-huh  that's right
If someone said three years from now
You'd be long gone
I'd stand up and punch them out
'Cause they're all wrong
I know better 'cause you said forever
And ever  who knew?
Remember when we were such fools
And so convinced and just too cool?
I wish I could touch you again
I wish I could still call you  friend
I'd give anything
When someone said count your blessings now
'Fore they're long gone
I guess I just didn't know how
I was all wrong
And ever  who knew?

There's rage and terror and there's sickness here
I fight because I have to
I fight for us to know the truth
There's not enough rope to tie me down
There's not enough tape to shut this mouth
The stones you throw can make me bleed
But I won't stop until we're free
Wild hearts can't be broken
No  wild hearts can't be broken
