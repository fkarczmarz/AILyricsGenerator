lyrics
"Then again  sometimes I get really sweet so
What does it mean if I tell you to go fuck yourself?
Or if I say that you're beautiful to me?
It's affection  always
Ooh  you're gonna see it someday
My attention for you
Even if it's not what you need
Sometimes we talk all night long  we don't shut up
And when it's late  we'll say we're still wide awake so
We love to talk about how you'll come up to visit me
And we'll rent a car and we'll drive upstate
It's affection  always
Ooh  you're gonna see it someday
My attention's on you
Even if it's not what you need
I think of you  I want you too
I'd fall for you
I think of you  I want you too
I'd fall for you
I think of you  I want you too
I'd fall for you
I think of you  I want you too
I'd fall for you

It's affection  always
Filming helicopters crashing in the ocean from way above
You've been locked in here forever and you just can't say goodbye
Kisses on the foreheads of the lovers wrapped in your arms
You've been hiding them in hollowed out pianos left in the dark
You've been locked in here forever and you just can't say goodbye
Apocalypse

Go and sneak us through the rivers
Flood is rising up on your knees
Come out and haunt me

Sharing all your secrets with each other since you were kids
Sleeping soundly with the locket that she gave you clutched in your fist
You've been locked in here forever and you just can't say goodbye
You've been locked in here forever and you just can't say goodbye
I will reach for you
When you're feeling low
 no Hotel Casa Brooklyn
 at Brooklyn House Hotel
Chewin' it like it's bubblegum
Wave it like a magic wand
Pop a few rounds off just for fun
Go to the strip club all alone
Thinkin' that I could take you home
To picture you with those other guys
Is drivin' me crazy all the time
You'll just lead me on 'til I'm drowning in tears
As if I was the
Last man standing on earth
Of you lying in your swimsuit on the bed
Can't live without your love inside me now
I wanna fuck your love slow
Feel your lips crush
I love to watch you when you're trying on your clothes
And now you're all I think about when I'm alone
Can't wait to feel your love inside me now
We'll have a drink or two and we'll go to your house
I wanna fuck your love slow

Come to me now
Don't let me go
Stay by my side

Stay with me still
I've missed you so
When I was young  I thought the world of you
I was dumb to let you drift away

No one else could have the love we shared

It's clearly not enough
You sleep all day and drive out in L.A
It isn't safe
And each time you kiss a girl
You never know what it's worth
You say all of the words they wanna hear
It isn't real
Lost all your money to her
All I wanna know is if you love her
How come you never give in?
Each time you have a dream
You never know what it means
You see that open road and never know which way to go
And each time you fall in love
It's clearly not enough
You sleep all day and drive out in L.A
It isn't safe
Lost all your money to her
All I wanna know is if you love her
I'm coming home

I could always see a house by the ocean
Last night I could hear the waves
Falling in love
Falling in love
Deeper than I've felt it before
I feel I'm falling in love with all my heart
Back when you were far away
We would go on dates to watch the same movie
And you were imagining sitting next to me
Holding my hand for the whole thing
Falling in love

You're the white swan in the photograph

Now I stand on the stage
I forget my lines to your play Satan's Imagination
And a voice in my head's causing suicide searching for any way to remember them

I used to go out & feel the sun on the silent day
So it's coming as quite a shock
A heart could come so undone
The strings could unravel fast
How quickly the war is won
& I can't stop these tears from falling
Right away
I know you're calling
I can't stop these tears from falling now
If I was the thinking heart
& you were the loving soul
With all of my feelings sharp
You came crashing in my world
A music of cathedrals
Bouncing along the glass
It's echoing through my ears
You took it away so fast
Oh well
The lights are low
& I don't need a friend to call my own
'cause I know it's the end
And there is no way out except to watch the love between us die
That's called the Falling Angel
It's an amusement park ride
Some sort of rollercoaster
It takes you up and when it brings you down
It gives you butterflies
And now I'm longing for your kiss
Bet you could read it on my lips
Ohh
Waterfalls  I'm jumping down
I know you're leaving  baby
The birds are flying south
And there's nothing to say
I need you here
I need your love inside of mine like I could die
But he doesn't know what to do
Sitting in the car
Waiting outside her school
He's in for a heartbreak
If it's all been blind faith
From my point of view
Living like he's John Wayne
Always facing the world
Or chasing the girl
He's got so much in his heart
But he doesn't know what to do
All he wants is her
Lying inside his room
Telling all his secrets
That I couldn't keep

Cheap sex and sad films
Help me get where I belong
Stop sending letters
Letters always get burned
It's not like the movies
They fed us on little white lies
I will see you in the next life
That lonesome feeling comes to my door
The whole world turns blue
There's a rundown bar 'cross the railroad tracks
I've got a table for two way in the back
Where I sit alone and think of you
I spend most every night
Beneath the light of a neon moon
If you lose your one and only
There's always room here for the lonely
To watch your broken dreams
Dance in and out of the beams of a neon moon
I think of two young lovers running wild and free
You in the shadows of this smoke-filled room
No telling how many tears I've sat here and cried
Or how many lies that I've lied
Telling my poor heart you'll come back one day

So you tell me to watch
When it's pure
Only your love could get me to fall
And it's so beautiful
And the TV is on
When we make love because
We get carried away
We don't care anyway
When it's pure
Only your love could get me to fall
And it's so beautiful
Wrapped your hair in a towel
But I watch you let it down
And it's all soaking wet
As you take me in your mouth
And we stare at the street
From the back balcony
But now all I can see
Is you undressing for me

So run towards your fears
When it's too much for you to take

Lying on the bathroom floor naked
Hiding coke inside all your orange Pixy Stix
You take a rail & spread it on your tit
You've had a long list of lovers
But none of them matter to you except me

Feels like a call into the forest
Living like a bird
Flying through the air
I don't feel anymore
Coming through
Forces on the light
& I know that
Come & laugh
When you said
I get away
I'm falling through
Every single word is another river
Taking off her clothes
Taking off her dress
Now it's all white
& the yellow sun is feeling like a bite
I don't care anymore
I don't see it again
When you follow me left
Into the lens with the camera now
I don't feel like coming back again
I don't feel a floor
Threw my last wish into the well
And I was making to leave
Just when you said Won't you come home with me?
And as we walk I tell you the tale
They built a statue of me
Standing right there
 from the arms of the chair
Filled up my lungs with  air
 inside a jumping balloon
We’re running into our love
Banging a spanish drum
Locked in a cathedral
Drinking the spanish rum
We are members of a clan
Even if they don't care
Blowing all the speakers
Singing a spanish prayer slowly
 tears right to my eyes
What a surprise
That I'm here watching you now
Getting undressed
 dreams with their hearts on their sleeves
In the middle of a night makes me cry
That I’m looking for you standing right there

Cutting it with scissors 'til there's nothing left

So you open your dress and show me your tits
On the swing set at the old playground
With sunlight on your face in my rear-view
Sunsets
I wanna hear your voice
A love that nobody could destroy
Took photographs like Brautigan's book covers
That we both adored
With sunlight on your face in my rear view
This always happens to me this way
Recurring visions of such sweet days
With sunlight on your face in my rear view
The one where you're showering with wet hair dripping
You know that I'm obsessed with your body
But it's the way you smile that does it for me
It's so sweet
Watching the video where you're lying
In your red lingerie ten times nightly
You know I think your skin's the perfect color
But it's always your eyes that pull me under
It's so sweet

You were sleeping or just faking

I reached down to grab your hand and kissed it when you weren't looking
And I like the way you say exactly what you mean
To be in love to make love to me
Said you wear a new perfume for each city that you visit
So you can always remember how it felt to be there
And your lips are red and all the pictures that you send
To be in love to make love to me
I'm feeling low
Feeling frustrated
Never know
Now that you're gone Ill leave a note

Next time I try to kiss you
I'll fall asleep on the last train

Told me you could never get enough
Posing as a Playboy centerfold
You make me think of
Storms on the beaches
With all the lights off
Everything is wrong but it's all right
Everything is wrong but it's all right
You're the only good thing in my life
Do what your heart desires
Love is always strange when it just starts
Shouldn't have a care left in the world
You make me think of
Storms on the beaches
With all the lights off
Everything is wrong but it's all right
Everything is wrong but it's all right
You're the only good thing in my life
