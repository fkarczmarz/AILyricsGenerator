lyrics
"Woke up a little off today  I can tell that somethin's wrong
I'm a little thrown off today  there's something going on inside me
I'm a little bit off today  a little bit off today
(I'm a little bit off today  a little bit off)
Got up a little off today  just to play that same old song
I don't really wanna try today  I see nothing in my reflection
I'm a little bit dry today  feel like I could die today
(I'm a little bit off today)
Feel like I could die today
Hey-ey yeah  hey-ey yeah
Hey-ey yeah  don't you know? (I'm a little bit off)
Hey-ey yeah  hey-ey yeah
I'm a little pissed off today and there ain't nothin' you can do about it
I'm a little put off today and I could not tell you why
Got a really short fuse today  everyone around me's fucking crazy
I'm a little ticked off today  a little pissed off today

(I'm a little bit off today  off)
I told a little white lie today  I smiled and told someone I loved them
I had to say goodbye today to someone that I love
I couldn't even cry today  I think my heart is finally broken
Didn't need a reason why today  I don't need a reason why today
Hey-ey yeah  hey-ey yeah
Hey-ey yeah  don't you know? (I'm a little bit off)
Hey-ey yeah  hey-ey yeah
I got a little too high today  got lost inside a sea of madness
Crashed a little bit hard today  crashed a little too hard today
Everybody sing
Hey-ey yeah  hey-ey yeah
Hey-ey yeah  don't you know? (I'm a little bit off)
Hey-ey yeah  hey-ey yeah
I'm a little bit off today
Somethin' down inside me feels so different
Just a little bit off today
They may be looking for me (They may be looking for me)
But they're coming for you (But they're coming for you)
I'll paint a picture you can better understand
They promise diamonds (They promise diamonds)
But they pay in sand
It goes on and on and on and on and on
It goes on and on and on and on and on
(I don't wanna wait)
I don't wanna wait for heaven to change me
I don't wanna have to wait for the fall
(I don't wanna wait)
I don't wanna wait for heaven to change things
(I don't wanna wait)
I don't wanna wait for hеaven to change this
I don't wanna have to fall on thе knife

Long before the world I know tore it all apart
Once upon a time  there was a part of me I shared
Years before they took away the part of me that cared
Been a thousand places
And shook a million hands
I don't know where I'm going
But I know just where I've been
I've flown a million miles
And I've rode so many more
Battle born
I'm battle born
Once upon a time  I had an open point of view
But that was just so long ago before I had a clue
Was there such a time where I didn't stand alone?
Was there ever a time  and how would I have known?
Been a thousand places
And shook a million hands

I'm writing this in case I've moved along
There's something that I hope you'll remember
So take the best parts of me
Locked away without the keys
And know that I'm forever by your side
When the lights go down
Know that I am never far away
When the sun burns out
I'll be waiting on the brighter side of grey
Just know that all the things you own are borrowed
And all you get to keep is all you've shared
So wipe away the tears for me
Know that we've made history
Remember no one ever really dies

It's all so wrong
But who am I... who am I to say?

Everything I've done

Step away from the ledge

I could never be what you want me to
You pull me under to save yourself (Save yourself)
You will never see what's inside of me
I pull you under just to save myself
Was there ever any question
On how much I could take?
You kept feeding me your bullshit
Hoping I would break
Is there anybody out there?
Is there anyone who cares?
Is there anybody listening?
Will they hear my final prayers?

Another day comes crashing in
There's a whispering wind that's blowing
There's a storm that's closing in
To a place I've never been
And I can feel her breath beside me
With an empty glass of gin
As the darkness settles in
I can hear her voice again
I can hear your voice again
Waiting for someone to save me
But everyone just runs away (Runs away)
Waiting for someone to change me
But no one ever comes
I'm breaking down the walls that cage me
But nothing ever falls in place (Falls in place)
Waiting for the end to take me
Blinded by the sun
All the ghosts that live inside me
Always waiting in the wind (Wind)
I can see through my reflection
What I've become and what I've been (Been)
And your Hell won't let me in (In)
It's like I'm holding all the aces
But that I know I'll never win (Win)

It was never really me
You just turned and walked away
How you turned me inside out

On motherfuckers like you
Now it's my turn
Fuck you!
You can't run away from anything that you have ever done
You're a victim to the system  you're a knife and I'm a gun
You want me to just turn the other cheek
Want me to admit that I am weak
Want me to submit
You're so self-righteous
And you're never gonna change
You're sick and spineless
You're the fake and I'm the fame
You can't convince me life is fair
'Cause you were never even there
That's why I've never really cared
'Cause I was never really scared
No!

All the days gone by and I can't get 'em back
What was my name now and what is my name now?
I'm trying to rise above myself
I'm trying to look beyond this hell
Seems like I got way off track
They wonder why I hate myself
Surrounded by a living hell
Why can't I see this clearly?
(See this clearly) Why can't I?
Will the sun ever rise? Will the sun ever rise?
Will the sun ever rise?
Will the sun ever rise?
Will the sun ever rise?
Will the sun ever rise?
Will the sun ever rise?
Will the sun ever rise? Will the sun ever rise?
Will the sun ever rise?
Will the sun ever rise?
Will the sun ever rise?
And she said that she's ashamed
What have I become?
What have I done?
I spoke to the devil today
And he swears he's not to blame
And I understood
'Cause I feel the same
Arms wide open
I stand alone
I'm no hero
And I'm not made of stone
Right or wrong
I can hardly tell
I'm on the wrong side of Heaven
And the righteous side of Hell
The wrong side of Heaven
And the righteous side
The righteous side of Hell
I heard from God today
And she sounded just like me
What have I done?
And who have I become?
I saw the devil today
And he looked a lot like me
I looked away
I turned away

Arms wide open
I stand alone
I'm no hero
And I'm not made of stone
Right or wrong
I can hardly tell
I'm on the wrong side of Heaven
And the righteous side of Hell
The wrong side of Heaven
And the righteous side
The righteous side of Hell
I'm not defending
Downward descending
Falling further and further away
Getting closer every day
I'm getting closer every day
To the end
I'm getting closer every day
Arms wide open
I stand alone
I'm no hero
And I'm not made of stone
Right or wrong
I can hardly tell
I'm on the wrong side of Heaven
And the righteous side of Hell
The wrong side of Heaven
And the righteous side of Hell
The wrong side of Heaven
And the righteous side"
