lyrics
"Visualize the yin and yang in a battle so intense
That we get em confused
The resident evil specialize in misconstruing
We wanna be at a presidential level—what are we doing?
By not being ourselves
We can't babble no more than we can bob our head offbeat
Nimrod by the time we forty cause we can't get off meat
While we ask no reason for the misplacement of the season
Look at the picture that's painted
Tainted as the mind who's blinded to the point
Where Sodomites get all the rights
We fall for fights with fisticuffs
Get pissed enough to miss the bus
It disgusts me to see my folks run up on
I say stand upon this section of time marked Revelations
And recognize this mind-numbing reality of horror
Known as mankind
Jesus and his twelve disciples make thirteen
A righteous number of righteous men
Even Judas the Betrayer came true in the end
The Devil say the end is the beginning
They teach that we were the product of incest
Invest no level of self into their system of Paganomics
Stand with us and don't look back upon it
Just face this mindstate
Otherwise Babylon

I bet you never heard of a playa with no game
Take this music dead serious while others entertain
I see they're making their paper so I guess I can't complain
Or can I? I feel they're disrespecting the whole thang
Them hooks like selling dope to black folks
And I choke when the food they serving ain't tasting right
My stomach can't digest it even when I bless it
Now hootie who wants to oppose? Suppose
We rolls through Headland and Delowe
Where me and my niggas would pass the flow
And got down for ours like hind catchers
My mind catches flashbacks to the black past
While mind close niggas laugh at
I grew up on booty shake we did not know no better thang
Gather your thoughts
Something's gotta change
Sounds of laughter and happiness turn my teardrops to rain
Been bearing this burden for too many of my days
Looks like breezes of Autumn done finally blew my way
Like memories of yesterday
I'm thinking of checking my traps and busting my raps
And throwing them craps
My nigga you know if I wanna be playin
But runnin up on me like you miss me
Flexin up on the corner tossin your dice and rollin your Cadillac
But man it seems I'm reaching out and touching the wrong nigga
Don't expect it to be pimping get your index off the trigger
So keep that caine up out of your nose
I said my piece and then I hush
Something's gotta change
Sounds of laughter and happiness turn my teardrops to rain
Been bearing this burden for too many of my days
Looks like breezes of Autumn done finally blew my way
Like memories of yesterday
Some issues need to be addressed like envelopes I mean
Bringing our folks closer together cause they severed us from the get green
Light and we ain't gon' stop until we hit the big screen
Growing old
Just like their parents don't be caring
I'm speaking bout you playing with that phony stuff you sharing
In your raps Mercedes Benz and all your riches
'Cause you flauging  falling like leaves into driveways
Isn't it lovely smoking good and sloppy head on highways
Fridays are tight but Saturday just makes it old
Winter nights are hot warm enough to feed your soul
Growing old
Something's gotta change
Sounds of laughter and happiness turn my teardrops to rain
Been bearing this burden for too many of my days
Looks like breezes of Autumn done finally blew my way
Like memories of yesterday
Fat titties turn to teardrops as fat ass turns to flab
Sores that was open wounds eventually turn to scab
Trees bright and green turn yellow-brown
Fat titties turn to teardrops as fat ass turns to flab
Sores that was open wounds eventually turn to scab
Trees bright and green turn yellow-brown
Fat titties turn to teardrops as fat ass turns to flab
Sores that was open wounds eventually turn to scab
Trees bright and green turn yellow-brown
Said me and my homeboy were coming out with an album
But you gave me your number anyway  you were on the talcum
Powder—how's about them oranges?
Moved away from home to school with big plans
By day  studied the history of music
To get your pants was a Mission Impo–ssible
We were both the same age  but I
The same book of life  so I'd page you when
I felt you that were getting off of work
Or either when you're on your way to school
We started hanging like Ernie and Bert
Just when I think I'm going down your shirt
You're hiking up your skirt now
The events that followed had me volley
If your hometown would be Heaven or Hell
The angelic nastiness you possessed made you by far the best
Therefore  hard to tell
You'd drop me off by the Dungeon
Never came in  but I knew that you were wondering
Now  are these niggas in this house up to something?
W-W-Well  yes and no
Cook it in the basement  then move it at a show
Meanwhile  the video starts playing
Packed full of niggas with a blunt in their hand
And one in they ear—you know what I'm saying  but
I kept your number in my old phone
Got a new chip-flip with the roam-roam
So it took me a minute to retrieve seven digits
But I promised I would call you when I got home  but
When I got home  I never did
By the time I did  heard that you'd had a kid
By some nigga in Decatur who replied  See you later
When he got the good news—that's life  shit
Now  I'm nineteen with a Cadillac
My nigga had a Lex with the gold pack
Got a plaque  but I'm living with my Pop-Pop
So I got a Glock and a LoJack
Yeah  kinda fast for that fella in class who used to draw
And never said much  'cause half of what he saw
Was so far from that place you wanna be
That words only fucked it up more  follow me
Are you starting to gather what I'm getting at?
But keep in mind: At the time  Keep it real was the phrase
Silly when said now  but those were the days
When Spring Break and Daytona
And Freakniks made you wanna
Drop out of college and never go back
Move to the South  but that ain't a Kodak
Moment  on went myself and Big Bo—
Well  you knew hm as 'Twan
That's right—you were around before this shit begun
Well 'Twan had a daughter and
Sorta was made to mature before the first tour
We hit the road like Jack
Laughed and cried and drive it back with some 'gnac
Girls used to say  Y'all talk funny. Y'all from the islands?
And I'd laugh  and they'd just keep smiling
We should hook up and get tore up and then lay down  hey  we
Gotta go because the bus is pulling out in thirty minutes
She's playing tennis  disturbing the tenants
Fifteen-love  fit like glove
Description is like fifteen doves
In a jacuzzi catching the Holy Ghost
Making one woozy in the head and comatose—agree?
Enough about me—how's about you? How's the lil' kid?
She was about two the last time we spoke
I hadn't smoked or took a shot of drink
'Cause I'd start the second album off on another note  now—
That note threw some niggas in the hood off
I'd slow my Lac down to a nice speed
The brain was that fried egg  I might need
New direction was apparent
I was a child looking at the floor  staring
So changing my style was like relief for the primitive beast
To make bread  never primary concern
Just to hop on these beats and wait my turn
And macaroni niggas: impastas
So  on a trip to New York on some beeswax
I get invited to a club where emcees at
And on stage is a singer with some thing on her head
Similar to the turban that I covered up my dreads with
Which I was rocking at the time
When I was going through them phases trying to find
Anything that seemed real in the world
Still searching  but I started liking this girl
Now  you know her as Erykah On & On Badu
Call Tyrone on the phone  Why you—
Do that girl like that  boy? You ought to be ashamed
The song wasn't about me  and that ain't my name
By the name of Seven
And he's five  by the time I do this mix  he'll probably be six
You do the 'rithmetic  me do the language arts
Y'all stand against the wall blindfolded  we throw the darts
To poke you in the heart and take you from the start
To when luxury transportation meant a MARTA card
Or either when your girlfriend that went to Mays' mama
Or her daddy let her borrow the Benz  because she smart
Or maybe if your neighbor does you a huge favor
And he sells you that Rabbit that's been sitting in his yard
You fix it up  you trick it out
You give it rims  you give it bump
You give it all your time because that's all you can think about
And that's as far as I got
(*music fades*)

So the summer passed and now the Rabbit's old?
Niggas in the point ain't changed
Can your punk ass come out to play? Say
Make yourself exempt
Pussy-footin' around be gettin' y'all nowhere but stuck
They got the nerve to ask me why I do the things I do
I got the nerve to serve you up just like a waiter do
Turnin' and walkin' away just ain't gon' work when they be robbin'
Ain't no thing but a chicken wing
We's havin' a smoke-out in the Dungeon with the Mary Jane
It's all about that cess in your chest (It's the joint)

It's that nigga down in the Dungeon with them player-istic hits (Yeah)
I'm quick to stop a sucker flow like menopause at fifty
About the days back when me mammy had to work in kitchens
She had me makin' better grades to make a better life
But I never had no love or respect 'cause we's gon' be alright
I ran the streets and broke my curfew 'cause I gave a shit
I carried guns and butcher knives 'cause I was steadily in the mix
I call the wild because it's time to take the streets
I'm ready to wet 'em up like cereal
Ain't no thing but a chicken wing (It don't stop)
We's havin' a smoke out in the Dungeon with the Mary Jane
It's all about that cess in your chest (It's the joint)
Ain't no thing but a chicken wing
We's havin' a smoke out in the Dungeon with the Mary Jane
It's all about that cess in your chest (It's the joint)
.357 to your forehead
My nine be doin' fine until these niggas wants to clear me
But I feel for them like Chaka Khan feel for you
'Member at the party when we served them niggas dandy?
One is in the air and one is in the chamber
Ain't no thing but a chicken wing
We's havin' a smoke out in the Dungeon with the Mary Jane
It's all about that cess in your chest (It's the joint)
Ain't no thing but a chicken wing
We's havin' a smoke out in the Dungeon with the Mary Jane
It's all about that cess in your chest (It's the joint)
Do more than sixty-five on 85 off in my Cadillac
And got my pump under my seat in case these youngsters wanna have some fun
So how do you figure that Big Boi be scared to blast you?
Before I shoot your ass and dilute your blood with lead
To take me out is truly somethin' difficult
Don't even run up on me unless you want your brain broke
I'ma kick you in your ass and your nigga gettin' pistol whipped
Ain't no thing but a chicken wing
We's havin' a smoke out in the Dungeon with the Mary Jane
It's all about that cess in your chest (It's the joint)
Ain't no thing but a chicken wing
We's havin' a smoke out in the Dungeon with the Mary Jane
It's all about that cess in your chest (It's the joint)
College Park is really on the map
We comin' around Atlanta and the niggas are really strapped

From secondhand cocaine powder—I know it sounds absurd
While the rest of the country bungies off bridges without no snap-back
Where a bona fide nigga like me can't even get no backrub these days
Ain't that bleak on they part?
While we rantin' and ravin' 'bout gats
To keep my faith in you (Keep my faith)
I'm fascinated by the way your nipples peak at me through your blouse
Sneakin' to watch Playboy at night
We all must be caught up in worldly ways
Chemistry between boys and girls
Is a lot like when we went to the woods and laid with the squirrels
Hunchin' with all our clothes on until we felt excited then (Ah)
Put yo hands in the atmosphere if you know what I'm talkin' about
Now if too harsh then walk on out and I'll see you on the next song

Nathaniel
Niggas get jacked like Daniel
Something I can't handle
Yo  unkay
And to them rudypoots don't attempt to try this at home
It's just a poem until y'all learn right from wrong
Know when to bless a situation  when to grab the chrome
Invite you to an emotion-filled theater
Bring your umbrellas  'cause young fella it gets no weirder
Dungeon  dungeon kings
You are now entering the fifth dimension of ascension
Our only intention is to take you high
To make one bob they head would be the track job
Your job's to spit that fire
Some of y'all MC's take this rhymin' for granted  I won't comply
With that slackin'  poppin' and crackin' fourth ward say we snappin'
They want that hardness that oddness that gets a nigga to start this
What's happenin'  see if I do what you won't do today boy
Will I live tomorrow like you can't even live 'cause you strayed
Motivational skills lackin'  when I see you nigga you packin'
But still stay with mom though  playing the King like Don doe
You choked up  you was the nigga that supposed to be so locced up
Makin' them think Hip Hop is dead  exhume the body if you ain't scared
And if I see you in the streets I'd dap you down like you was Greg  yeah
And the winner is—ladies  help me out—OutKast!
(Crowd erupts)
But it's like this  the South got somethin' to say. That's all I got to say
Poverty got me selling things  guess I'm gon' explain
Jane is rolled up  no gangs be throwed up
But still  André got action  they sweat like Keith  all on my teeth
I take it upon myself to handle mine
Thinking that you gots ample time to do this
Have you shot? I thought you knew this
I'm crumbling  no time for fumbling
Selling my sacks  watching my back
Wetting 'em up like splish  leaving 'em in a splash
Of blood  the clock is ticking  niggas from my block is missing
I'm putting it down like it be hot before we all get shot
Got only so much time in this bastard
Bitter be claiming pro  but I be saying they procrastinating
Settling for less
Better be ready when they roll up in your nest and sink one in your chest
And you's gone  up out of here for good
Y'all be bobbin' back and forth to let me know you understood
Yeah  what's up?
There's only so much time left in this crazy world

You heard me on the radio and  yes  my man  I'm true to that
I run my lyrics the way y'all wanna hear 'em
And shoot my dice against the bricks the way I wanna flicks 'em
Nigga  so ring around the roses  diamonds around my neck from flexing
But I'm running niggas over like a ninety-four Lexus  test it
Ten millimeters  count 'em  nigga  fuck a nine
See  I added a millimeter for y'all niggas doing crimes
And drive-bys  kiss your ass bye-bye  sayonara  suckers
I flipped the script and turned the page  ain't scared of you motherfuckers
Be popping shots like them hoes be popping coochies
And I still be spreading bullets like them freaks be spreading cooties
So look here niggas  I'm hunting Red October
I said my shit and ran my lyrics and now my verse is over

Got a Tampa Nugget blunt box  it's empty
That's where the herb be dropping  it's simply marvelous  time is ticking
But some of that time when I be laying vocals in the Dungeon
Sugar Bear and Mone be smoking ounces like it ain't nothing
It ain't shit to take another hit  so hit it
It's all day  every day 'til they label me deceased
So fire up another one and smoke out and fuck the world  peace
We is gonna smoke out until we choke out
Like some merry men  cowards  I be buryin'
Coming around my shop with that  see  nigga  you gets nothing
Just like DJ do the cutting  I be having your posse ducking
Nothing but king shit  I am asking  sucker  can you hang?
That player with the pepper throwing salt off in your game
Sprinkle  sprinkle  motherfucker  don't be crying on me
That southern cess be in my chest until I'm chillin' in peace  yeah

Dropping these things like French fries in hot grease
Big Gipp  Goodie Mob  P.A.  OutKast
The J-O-I  just to let y'all niggas know
Forever pimping  never slipping  that's how it is
That's how it's gon' be  that's how it was in the past
That's how it's gon' be in the futures  nigga
It's all day  every day  so what you wanna do with it?
Bring that shit on  know what I'm saying? Yeah

Was it the bitch that fucked the Goodie and the Dungeon Crew?
Let's say her name was Suzy Skrew 'cause she screwed a lot
Makin' a nigga hit that chonk at legitimate spots
I'm dickin' the ho down — never said I paid her
From College Park and Fayette all the way down to Decatur
Safe as a snake on eggs in a Bimmer 840
She was fine as fuck — I wanted to sex the ho up
She said she understood and everythin' was kosher
I gave her a Lil' Wil CD and a fuckin' poster
You better go on and get the hump up out your back now
It's about fo' or five cats off in my 'Lac now
We just shoot game in the form of story raps now (Yeah)

Child 2: I’m scared
Look out the window  golly  the sky is electric blue
Mama Earth is dying and crying because of you
Raining cats and jackals  all shackles disintegrate to residue
Silly mortals haven't a clue as to what the fuck is going on
I'm on the telephone dialing the Dungeon (Hello?)
This Dre  bring the MP and the SP
Meet me at the center of the Earth and travel carefully
Baby  grab the baby  cause baby  it ain't much time
Mama Earth is tossing and turning and that's a sign
Omega nigga I.F.O.s are landing in Decatur
Hope I'm not over your head  but if so you will catch on later
Played the track  guess she could not take it anymo'
Raping her heavenly body like a ho  coochie so'
From niggas constantly fucking her  never loving her
Never showing appreciation  busting nuts in her face when they done
Who said good folks is not supposed to die?
The sky is falling  nobody balling  they done gave back they guns
For some tickets to the playoffs  but the Hornets  they won
Nigga  we slum  kept all the guns  I gotta protect my family
I drove the biggest thing in the house cause I knew they'd try to ram me
But I'm stabbing  making a path on expressway the best way I know how
Look up in the sky  east  west  no clouds
Him coming now  fuck that money now
I ask my honey how she feeling and is Jordan okay? Yeah  yeah  she chillin'
We should be at The Dungeon shortly  ain't nobody on they porch  see?
Approaching the final exit  I'm thinking I see four horsies
But I don't though  nigga  you won't know until it's on ya
I put that on my dope boys from A-Town to California
All the weed smell like ammonia but at the Dungeon I know they're smoking
Writing the raps and doing the beats to make this last recording
Fuck abortion  I got in the booth to run the final portion
The beat was very dirty and the vocals had distortion

A couple of years ago on Headland and Delowe
Was the start of something good
Where me and my nigga rode the MARTA through the hood
Just tryna find that hookup
Now  every day  we looked up at the ceiling (Yuh)
Watching ceiling fans go 'round  tryna catch that feeling off instrumentals
Had my pencil  and plus  my paper
We caught the 86 Lithonia  headed to Decatur
Writing rhymes  tryna find our spot off in that light
Light off in that spot  knowing that we could rock
Doing the hole-in-the-wall clubs  this shit here must stop
Like  Freeze! We making the crowd move  but we not making no G's  and that's a no-no
Check it  a-one-two  a-one
Two dope niggas in the Cadillac  they call us
Went from Player's Ball to ballers
Putting the South up on the map was like Little Rock to banging
Locales done made it with them big boys up in this industry

Over a million sold to this day  niggas  they take it lightly

Chunky asses  passes getting throwed like Hail Marys

Got stopped at the mall the other day
Heard a call from the other way that I just came from (Ayy)
Some nigga was saying something
Talking 'bout smoke something
Hey  man  you remember me from school? No  not really
But he kept smiling like a clown  facial expression looking silly
And he kept asking me  What kinda car you drive?
I know you paid  I know y'all got beaucoup hoes
From all them songs that y'all done made
And I replied that I'd been going through the same things that he has
True  I've got more fans than the average man
But not enough loot to last me to the end of the week
I live by the beat like you live check-to-check
If it don't move your feet  then  I don't eat  so we like neck-to-neck
Yes  we done come a long way like them slim-ass cigarettes

Harder than a nigga tryna impress God
We'll pull your whole deck  fuck pulling your card
And still take my guitar and take a walk in the park
Any play the sweetest melody the street ever heard
Now bitches sucking on my nouns and I'm eating their verbs
As if pitbulls went out of style  made a vow to myself
If it's for the wealth I'll stop  well put it like this
It's like me selling some dope because my girlfriend wants to shop
I dont stall  slow drag wit' your brain against the wall
All y'all fuckboys  tuck toys inside your pants
Just to pull it out  point it at the ground and make a nigga wanna dance
Now what that be for? You're on that reefer and on that 2Pac

You need to get up  get out  and get something  don't spend all your time tryna get high
You need get up  get out  and get something  how will you make it if you never even try?
You need to get up  get out  and get something 'cause you and I got to do for you and I
I don't recall ever graduatin' at all
Sometimes I feel I'm just a disappointment to y'all
Every day I just lay around then I can't be found
Always askin'  Give me some  livin' life like a bum
Times is rough  my auntie got enough problems of her own
Nigga  you supposed to be grown
I agree  I try to be the man I'm 'posed to be
But negativity is all you seem to ever see
I admit (What?)  I've done some dumb shit
And I'm probably gon' do some more
You shouldn't hold that against me though (Why not?)
Why not? My music's all that I got
But some time must be invested for this to be manifested
I know you know  but I'm gon' say this to you  I
Get high  but I don't get too high (Why?)
So what's the limit 'posed to be?
That must be why you can't get your ass up out the bed before three
You need to get up  get out  cut that bullshit out
Ain't you sick and tired of havin' to do it all?
Damn  what up with all these questions?
You act as though you know somethin' I don't  do you have any suggestions?
'Cause every job I get is cruel and demeanin'
Sick of takin' trash out and toilet bowl cleanin'
But I'm also sick and tired of strugglin'
I never  ever thought I'd to have resort to drug smugglin'
Nah  that ain't what I'm about
Cee-Lo will just continue travelin' his route
Without any doubt or fear
I know the Lord ain't brought me this far so he could drop me off here
Did I make myself clear?

See  when I was a youngster  used to wear them fuckin' Pro Keds
My mama made me do it but the Devil  he made me smarter
Taught me to jack them weak-ass niggas for they fuckin' Starters (Yeah  ha-ha-ha)
In the middle school  I was a bigger fool
I wore a tank top to show off my tattoo  thought I was cool
I used to hang out with my daddy's brothers  I call 'em my uncles
They taught me how to smoke herb  I followed them when they ran numbers
So in a sense  I was Rosemary's baby
And then I learned the difference between a bitch and a lady
Hell  I treat 'em all like hoes  see  I pimped 'em
Bitch never had my money  so I never whipped 'em (What's up  ho?)
Wait  see  all the players came and all the players went
A player ain't a gangster  but a player can handle his shit  bitch
You need to get up  get out  get something
Smoke out 'cause it's all about money  money  money
Yeah  I said it  a nigga sportin' plaits and a Braves hat
I hang with Rico Wade 'cause the Dungeon is where the funk's at  boy
I'm true to Organized 'cause they raised me
I'm also down with LaFace 'cause L.A. Reid  yeah  he pays me
And it's cool
Yeah  it's real cool gettin' paid fat pockets and all that other fat shit like that  ha-ha

That's why
A lot of people in my past tried to do me  screw me
Throw me over in the fire  let me get chunky and charred
Like a piece of wood and them spirits got the mutant's mind
I'm gettin' paranoid and steady lookin' for the time
It's eight in the mornin' and ain't nobody up yet
I got my long johns  get my coat and throw on my ball cap
I'm headed out the door to get off in my ride
I'm diggin' through the ashtray  hopin' to have a good day
I had Jamaica's best
And when I light it up  I hear a voice in my head
(You got to get up  get out  and get something)
Now I know it's on  my day is finally started
Back up in my crib  eat my shit  break out quick in my slick
'84 Sedan DeVille  steady bouncin'
Out the Point to Campbellton Road
The valley of the Southside flow
Everybody know about that killer that we call blow  so
Keep your eyes peeled for the COBRA unit
'Cause they known for jumpin' out of black Chevy trucks and through the fog
Here comes the Red Dogs  I'm bustin' out around the corner in my hog
Dippin' from the area  I'm scared
So one of these bitches might wind up dead
'Cause I have no time for jail
Fuck Clampett cops  fuck Eldrin Bell
And crooked-ass Jackson  got the whole country
Thinkin' that my city is the big lick for '96
'94  Big Gipp  Goodie Mo'
OutKast  a vision from the past
Hootie-hoo
My White Owls are burnin' kind of slow
You need to get up  get out  and get something  don't let the days of your life pass by
You need to get up  get out  and get something  don't spend all your time tryna get high (Nigga)
You need to get up  get out  and get something  how will you make it if you never even try?
You need to get up  get out  and get something (Get something) 'cause you and I got to do for you and I
That's why
Y'all tellin' me that I need to get out and vote  huh  why?
Ain't nobody black runnin' but crac-kers  so  why
I got to register? I thinkin' of better shit to do with my time
Never smelled aroma of diploma  but I write the deep-ass rhymes
So let me take y'all way
Back to when a nigga stayed in Southwest Atlanta  ayy
Y'all could not tell me nothin'  thought I hit that bottom rock
At age thirteen  start workin' at that loadin' dock
They layin' my mama off of work  General Motors trippin'
But I come home banked like Hank from lickin' and dippin'
Doin' dumb shit  not knowin' what a nigga know now
Yeah  that petty shit will have you cased up and locked down
I dips over to East Point  still actin' a fool
Wastin' my time in the school  I'd rather be shootin' pool
Cool is how I played the tenth grade
I thought it was all about mackin' hoes and wearin' pimp fades
Instead of bein' in class  I'd rather be up in some ass
Not thinkin' about them six courses that I need to pass
Graduation rolled around like rolly-pollies
Damn  that's fucked up  I should've listened when my mama told me
That if you play now  you're gonna suffer later
Figured she was talkin' yang-yang  so I payed her
No attention and kept missin' the point she tried to poke me with
The doper that I get  the more I'm feelin' broke as shit
Huh  but that don't matter though  I am an O-U-T-Kast
So get up off your ass
You need to get up  get out  and get something  don't let the days of your life pass by
You need to get up  get out  and get something (Get something)  don't spend all your time tryna get high
You need to get up  get out  and get something  how will you make it if you never even try?
You need to get up  get out  and get something (Get something) 'cause you and I got to do for you and I
You need to g—

And I just want to say one thing
Happy Valentine's Day (Every day the 14th)

I just wanna say Happy Valentine's Day (Every day the 14th)
Can y'all dig that?
Now when arrows don't penetrate  see (Cupid grabs the pistol)
Ya won't believe in me
But you would fancy leprechauns or groundhogs
There's all this talk about Santa Claus  but see
Love will rule supreme
Happy Valentine's Day (Every day the 14th)
You got it  when Cupid knocks at your door (You can't ignore me)
There's no need to run
Now I may have it all wrong  see
If you know what love means  well
Well  somebody tell me
'Cause they just don't believe in me

But you can't run away
Ho-oh
Ya won't believe in me
But you would fancy
Hey  don't you supposed to be
Some kind of player  or something?
Bunny
'Cause I got my good shoes on
And I got 'em tied up tight
So you gon' find out tonight
Got a sweet lil' darlin' back in my corner
Could be an organ donor the way I give up my heart
Ask me how I'm feeling  I'd holla that it's irrele–
I don't get myself caught up in the Jello jella
And pudding pops  that others opt to call falling in love
But for the record  have you ever rode a horse?
Han Solo 'til I'm hit by the bullet  so may the force
Be with you and I'll hit you when better time permits
But how am I to know with the profession that I'm in?
And if you do not know me then how could you be my friend?
Happy Valentine's  Happy Valentine's

But separate's always better when there's feelings involved (Ah)
If what they say is  Nothing is forever
Then what makes  then what makes  then what makes
Then what makes  what makes  what makes love the exception?

And the dank that is crunk in the Dungeon
It goes on and on and on like that
Going out to the Jeeps and the hoes in the 'llac
I be thinking about the good old days when I was a whippersnapper
Used to try to get a kiss  but now it be them drawers I'm after
I'm just a Southernplayalistic pimp
I used to sling a fat rock  but now I'm serving hemp
More doper than a junkie or a Pookie 'cause it's on
So each one teach one  I be claiming true
To East Point and College Park and the things I used to do
Around ATL  home of the pimps and the money makers
I never said I was a gangster  but I will do you
So Hallelujah  Hallelujah

She said she thought Hip Hop was only guns and alcohol

Living in your closet would I stop and would I pause it  whoo
To put that bitch in slower motion  got the potion and the antidote

And let her know her grandchild is a baby and not a pay check

Forever never seems that long until you're grown
And notice that the day-by-day ruler can't be too wrong
Become a magician to abracadabra all the sadder
Asking what happened to the feeling that her and me had
I pray so much about it  need some knee pads
It happened for a reason  one can't be mad

It's the return of the gangster  thanks ta'
Them niggas that's on that blow that run up in your crib

Child to raise plus you true blue 'bout this music but

Because they'd rather be bouncing and shooting
And killing and bouncing and shit  get down
Return of the gangsta  thanks ta'

But not enough to bounce them kids to the zoo
Or to the park so they grow up in the dark never

Robbin' niggas in broad-ass daylight get down
Return of the gangsta thanks ta'

Then the question is Big Boi what's up with Andre?

To stimulate  then activate the left and right brain
Said  Baby boy  you only funky as your last cut
You focus on the past  your ass'll be a has-what
That's one to live by or either that's one to die to
I try to just throw it at you  determine your own adventure  André
Got to her station  Here's my destination
She got off the bus  the conversation lingered in my head for hours
Took a shower  kinda sour 'cause my favorite group ain't comin' wit' it
But I'm witcha 'cause you probably goin' through it anyway
But anyhow  when in doubt
Went on out and bought it 'cause I thought it would be jammin'
But examine all the flawsky-wawsky  awfully
Sad and it's costly  but that's all she
Wrote  and I hope I never have to float in that boat
Up shit's creek  It's weak is the last quote
That I wanna hear when I'm goin' down

They say you're malnutritioned  in need of vitamin D
And invitin' me to that tingle in your spine
I love who you are  love who you ain't — you're so Anne Frank
Let's hit the attic to hide out for 'bout two weeks
Rick James'n  no chains and whips
I do suck lips 'til hips jerk in double time
The boy next door's a freak  ha-ha!
Ain't nobody dope as me  I'm just so fresh  so clean
So fresh and so clean  clean

Rollin' straight Hammers and Vogues in that old Southern slouch
Please  ain't nothin' but incense in my atmosphere
I'm bendin' corners in my 'Lac  boy  'cause that's how we be rollin' here
Deep  the slang is in effect because it's Georgia
Kickin' the khakis and Adidas  packin' your heaters 'cause you supposed to  cousin
Catfish and grits is how my flow flows
Rollin' steady in that Caddy  but them fifty bottles got to go
See  juice and gin used to be my friend from the beginnin'
Now I'm just a player  sippin' sauce every now and then
To catch a buzz like a bumble bee
Niggas who tried to fuck with me
Get sprayed like Raid 'cause it ain't nothin' to see
My heat is in the trunk along with that quad knock
No  my heart don't pump no Kool-Aid
Jump and you'll get too sprayed
Who raise your block? The one and only OutKast
Many a niggas fallin' fast and
I continue blastin'
Swiftly  they ain't gon' get me  got somethin' for 'em
The devil up in your grill and you still don't even know him
Show him who's the okay
Like collard greens and hoecakes  I got soul
That's somethin' that you ain't got
That's why your style is rotten  stop in the land of ATL
Where nothin' but pimps fully equipped quick to make a sale
Folks try to stop it  but they know that it's that

And knock 'em up off they feet like a Southern hustler 'posed to do
I's in the house like— House like— a joint is lit for my kinfolks
And all the niggas that was down since we been broke
Takin' 'em deeper than a submarine
So scream when you hear the team of two
My crew be thick as two fat hoes sittin' off in a Brougham
I'm packin' my tag backwards if you wanna be actin' wrong
Word is bond like super glue
It's funky like pooper-scoop
And every word I say  you can true
The expialalistic Coupe de Ville  can you handle that  you rat?
I take my time cruisin' 'round the city malls
And under my seat for you suckers is your final curtain call

So now I step  rather  walk with the pimp limp
While my niggas are in East Point with that College Park hemp
Smoked out is how I wanna end it on this track
So I pass it to my partner and step back up in my Cadillac
Step up in my shoes  you crews sittin' on Trues
And Vogues for the hoes only when we rollin' through
Atlanta skies be blue  the sun is beaming  it's seemin'

Watch out  here come the folk—Damn
Oh  Lord
As the plot thickens  it gives me the dickens  reminiscent of Charles
A lil' discotheque nestled in the ghettos of Niggaville  USA
Via Atlanta  Georgia
A lil' spot where young men and young women go to experience they first little taste of the night life
Me? Well  I've never been there
You speak of hardcore
While the DJ sweatin' out all the problems and troubles of the day
While this fine  bow-legged girl  fine as all outdoors  lulls lukewarm lullabies in your left ear
Competing with Set It Off in the right
But it all blends perfectly  if you let the liquor tell it
Hey  hey—look  baby  they playin' our song!
And the crowd goes wild  as if Holyfield has just won the fight
But in actuality  it's only about 3 a.m.  and three niggas just done got hauled off in the ambulance  sliced up
Two niggas done started busting—Wham! Wham!
And one nigga done took his shirt off  talking 'bout  Now  who else wanna fuck with Hollywood Court?

Yes! When I first met my SpottieOttieDopalicious angel
I can remember that damn thing like yesterday
The way she moved reminded me of a brown stallion horse with skates on  you know?
Smooth  like a hot comb on nappy-ass hair
I walked up on her and was almost paralyzed
Her neck was smelling sweeter than a plate of yams with extra syrup
Eyes beaming like four karats apiece  just blindin' a nigga
Felt like I chiefed a whole O of that Presidential
My heart was beating so damn fast
Never knowing this moment would bring another life into this world
Funny how shit come together sometimes  you dig?
One moment  you frequent the booty clubs  and the next four years  you and somebody's daughter raisin' y'all own young'n
Now  that's a beautiful thang
That's if you're on top of your game and man enough to handle real-life situations  that is
Can't gamble feeding a baby on that dope money
Might not always be sufficient
But the United Parcel Service and the people at the post office didn't call you back because you had cloudy piss
So now  you back in the trap
Just that: trapped!
Go'n' and marinate on that for a minute
On the way you're living (oooh)
Life is made of half illusion (evolution)
Forty percent confusion (oooh)
You don't know what I've been through (oooh)
Boi how you gonna handle me?
You want me to lolligag and talk that bullshit?

To drop this rhyme  about where my roots at
Yeah  Westside is in the house
Frazier Homes is in the house
Cloverdale is in the house
February 1st  1975 it happened
Was born in West Savannah way before I started rappin'
My mamma had a nigga at the age of fifteen
My daddy was sellin' that sack  now he's gots responsibilities
Stayed at me granny's while me mammy was at work
And she couldn't watch my every move so shit I started servin'
Around Frazier Home  down in the Westside projects
Changin' over foodstamps  and hittin' a lick was next see
I'm just a playa like that  my jeans was sharply creased
I got a fresh white t-shirt and my cap is slightly pointed East
So meet me deep in the streets that's where I learned the capers
I'm slightly slouched  in the seats off in my bucket
But the niggas around the Ave. and the hoes  they love me
They wanna be me and my family too
Because the money that I make be puttin' cable off in every room
So follow the fiends  follow my lead through the nooks and crannies
It's everyday life off in my hood so come and holla at me
But go 'head on  with that foolishness bitch
Let me get lovely with my swerve because I'm true to this shit
And if you coming with eight dollars  you shit out of luck
Because the Westside ain't taking no shorts on the dime
So fire it up

Caught a player slipping
But now I lay it to the floor just like carpet

But then it spread to white and got everyone's undivided attention
'Cause your daughter is on it and you can't hide it
Maybe your son tried it
Rehab too crowded
They scared they scared to talk about it
If you scared  say you scared
February 1st  1975's my birthdate
The player the B-O-I  was brought onto this Earth on Thursday
I think see  my cap I twist it back from all the dank
But if you see me on the Ave  you betta believe I tote that shank
So what y'all thought  bruh?
I gotta protect my name and what we fought for
Southernplayalistic ATLiens in your sock drawer
No lockjaw  we got that raw shit and all the trimmings
Even though we got two albums  this one feel like the beginning
The intro  the Goodie—we kinfolk
Nigga  it's fin to jump off
But now it's time I lay low
'Cause I believe the track gon' cut off
Psych  the track is bumpin' like pussies on some dykes
'Cause my heart don't pump no Slushee
You touch my niggas you touch me
I blow up the microphone  like Marilyn Manson
You can't hush me  yeah
Heat'll make anything move
Just cause the name say Goodie  you take us for fools
Out they rabbit ass mind  don't give me mine
I go off like mines  blowin suckers to smithereens
We was never folks if we fell out over this lil' cream
Or let some soft legs come in between our dreams
We live like Kings  and die like fuckin' men
I don't care how rough you roll  we can't be shut down
Ain't no openin' up shop  we already established
You lap doggin'  we boss hoggin
Grown men  don't beg for attention
Keep wishin'  high heels clickin'
Paper champions  leavin' with they feet behind
Zap em for the pumpkin  at twelve
On the bottom bunk  holla at me
Suckas  think I got they package
But they still eatin moo-moo  oink-oink
And fowl-fowl-fowl-fowl.. *repeats*
The truth hurts  but you can't be scared of it
Still standin for somethin while y'all fallin for nothin
Stop dyin over this lil concrete and lil paper
We get this shit together our power's in numbers
You can deny the lie but you can't deny the truth"
