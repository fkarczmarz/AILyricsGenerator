Faster than a bullet from a gun

It's in my head-head

You bring an energy I've never felt before
Some kind of chemical that reaches through my core
You feel like home  hmm
You're like the opposite of all of my mistakes
Tear down the biggest walls and put me in my place
I know  that kind of comfortable you cannot replicate
You feel like home  hmm
So if you're asking me
I don't just feel it in my heart
Don't just feel it in my heart  no
I feel it in my bones
I feel it in my bones
And I know when it cuts deep down through your chest into your soul
That's how you know  that's how I know
I feel it in my bones

Sweetest sound  took me away from you
We were in love  we were alive
We were strong but we withered and died
Now you're calling me  calling me home
Pulling me out of the crowd

Say it is time to come home
We don't have to hurt no more

Justify the meaning before the feeling's lost

Said you used to have a car before the repo
And now that summer night plays on repeat
We climbed the Golden Gate bridge just to watch the stars collide
And played that Stevie Wonder song a couple thousand times
I'm kinda scared to say it was the best night of my life
But I know I won't forget San Francisco
I know I won't forget that night in San Francisco
In San Francisco

I met you in a bar in San Francisco
But when the sun came up we had to let go
When you took that Greyhound bus
Thought it was the end of us

I'm gonna let my heart decide if this is real
A thousand pictures can't describe how I feel

Heartbreaking melodies I wanna sing
I'm feelin' it all for you
I'm feelin' it all for you
Now I don't fit these shoes I'm standin' in
And I've been growing me a pair of wings
I'm feelin' it all for you
I'm feelin' it all for you
I might lose a little blood along the way
But I'm diving in headfirst
If I had to hit a train to make you stay
(It ain't love unless it hurts)
(It ain't love)
It ain't love unless it hurts
(No  no)
(It ain't love)
(It ain't love unless it hurts)
(No  no)
(It ain't love)

I'll pick my broken heart up off the floor
Give me back mine and then I'll give you yours
I'm feelin' it all for you
I'm feelin' it all for you
I wanna work all night and dream all day
It's like my world has fallen out of shape
I'm feelin' it all for you
I'm feelin' it all for you
I might lose a little blood along the way
But I'm diving in headfirst
If I had to hit a train to make you stay
Anyways and anyhow (This heart won't break)
I might lose a little blood along the way

Bright lights in the windows  the up the stairs
And all of your silence  and all of your songs
I still hear the choir  but you are gone
Can't go back
Can't fight this
Water  water
Tear drops are falling like rain
Daughter  daughter
Still hear you calling my name
Oh  I see your light
In the water  for all my life
I'm standing on my tip-toes  I'm coming undone
You were my hero  when I was young
We live but we never know  lost in the wind
A million candles  just flickering
Can't go back
Can't fight this

Lifted high  let me lay down at your side
Here I stand  'til your soul comes back to mine
Water  water

Daughter  daughter
Still hear you calling my name
Oh  I see your light
I wanna burn like fire tonight
I feel my heartbeat jumping twice
I'm floating up like red balloons
And I could stay right here for life
This place moves me right
Days and nights
I'm captured by the feeling
Love the ride
And now I'm really living life
Alive  a super kind of feeling
Jump on board the ride tonight
Oh-eh-eh-eh
We are born to play
Oh-eh-eh-eh
Baby  we are born to play

We grip with white knuckles we hold strong
And they say love should fit like gloves  perfect equals
If it's meant to be then you just know it  you just know
But you and me will never be the perfect people
Of all the stories that they've told
Ooh  what if our love is written in the scars?
And it took time but we built love from all these broken parts
We can't fix all our fractured bones
And they say love should fit like gloves  perfect equals
If it's meant to be then you just know it  you just know
But you and me will never be the perfect people
Of all the stories that they've wrote
Ooh  what if our love is written in the scars?
Ooh  we built love from all these broken parts
And that's just fine  that's just fine
