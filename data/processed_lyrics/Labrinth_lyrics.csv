"A hundred miles an hour with my heart racin' on the thought
A hundred miles an hour thinkin' of you
Thinkin' of you
Thinkin' of you
Thinkin' of you
Thinkin' of you
Thinkin' of you
Thinkin' of you
Thinkin' of you
From the dawn till the night
On the way you go 'round my mind
'Cause I'm on you like a light with no off switch
The one I wanna spend my life and my drugs with

Thinkin' of you
Thinkin' of you (Only I could have it my way)
Thinkin' of you (Hit the gas for the speed chase)
Thinkin' of you (Hit the gas on the highway)
I'm taking it all for us
Taking it all

Ooh
I'm doing it all for love
I'm doing it all

Money MIA (Pockets hell-a empty)
Mumma making ends meet (Making ends meet)
Better be a man (Michael Corleone)

Give you the world
Mona Lisa's smile

Guess you figured my two times two
Always equates to one
Dreamers are selfish
When it all comes down to it
I hope one of you come back to remind me of who I was
When I go disappearing
Doing it all for love
Ayy ayy ayy ayy
And they all lived happily ever after
And they all lived happily
And they all lived
And they all

 oh no
 don't it?
 Please don't hurt me
 tonight
 see beneath
 falling
 see beneath your beautiful
Burnin' up like Palo Santo through the night
You  you by my side
Feelin' like my four-leaf clover every time
Don't let go
You could be my sa—  my savin' grace
Now go float
Turnin' to the sky got me feelin' invisible
Like a charm 'round my neck
Like a prayer  prayer to protect
Feels like something's in the air
And it's watchin' all my steps
Oh  I feel you coverin' all over me
I feel you coverin' all over me  oh no
I feel the love and it's all over me
Mm  now I feel safe
Under your protection  your sacred embrace
And I'm 'bout to go to space

Don't fence me in
Let me ride through the high flyin' city that I love

Let me be by myself in the evenin' breeze
And listen to the murmur of the tall concrete
Send me off forever but I ask you  please
Don't fence me in
Now put the spin in my wheels  let me run away with my thoughts
Don't fence me in
Say freedom is the word  Heaven's own work of art
Don't fence me in
I wanna ride to the ridge where the view commences
Gaze at the moon till I lose my senses
My heart stays on the road 'cause I can't stand fences
Don't fence me in (Free)
Just turn me loose  let me straddle my own saddle
Underneath the city lights
On my Cayuse  let me wander over yonder
Till I see the morning sky

Ladies and Gentlemen  gathered before you are 5 of the finest word-smiths known to mankind
What you are about to witness is no illusion
Tinie Tempah  come in
A hundred thousand people everybody mosh pitting
I make the most of every minute that the clock give me
So come and rock with me everybody rocking out
I make em jump till there's a hole in the fucking ground
Pose for a picture  nigga I am so off the Richter
All I do is shots shots shots  I don't use no cup or no mixer
I rock all my clothes like a hipster
And I rock them shades like a G
That girl be definitely coming if she's coming with me
I'm like a hundred degrees man I'm even hotter than August
See half them girls in your city they probably got on my tour bus
I make 'em ugly
Where my Paracetamol and Anadin and a crystal ball for my n-n-n-nig Labrinth
Kano  come in
Said I been gone for a hot minute
Who put my Rolex on the radiator
Back like boomerang I'm Dundee'ing it
But you might see me later alligator
In some bally lace ups  with some jacket tapered
So much stones you thought it was animation
Wilma on my case cos all these chicks adjacent
To my table tryna drink my vodka and champagne up
I ain't no Matt Damon  but Bourne with Ultimatums
Get rich or die trying so we started caking
I'm doing 'caine but not the brother of Undertaker
And I ain't Muslim but tell my brothers Assalamu Alaykum
Finish him  Kano my nigga no Raiden
Fuck with my dog then my nigga Alsatian
Tell a man... make a man blazing
Cover up what? nigga tuck chains in
Diamonds all in your face like shaving
And the gyal dem call me Earthquake
Cos I make their pussy cave in
I'm a beast

Got so much cuts I had to teach myself first aid  hey
I'm tryin to learn to play safe
I never get caught out before I get to third base
But still they see me coming I lash in your face
I guess I'm getting foul again
Pure waste and the flows pants are my trouser dem
Throw a little cheese at the rats
Say we're labbin em  you see I'mma be a bigger cat
I ain't here for no packaging  ain't the cutest brother brother
But shaped like a mannequin
Ladies throwing me their clothes  then using their Apocalips
Brother you ain't got no inner soul  put a sock in it
They thought I disappeared
I just did a gap year like a fresher  came back like a graduate
Now everybody's scared
Cause the damage that I've done with two songs is probably more than their album did
Be afraid  be afraid I'ma get'cha
Little Lab's making earthquakes in America
I ain't the Messiah but they call me the creator
When I said let there be light how many stars did I make huh?
Yeah I got the Midas touch
Got gold diggers looking at my fine wrist watch
Even got the restaurant to fine dine this fox
Just take those triples and triple it  I'm so far gone
I'm high  can't get me down like a hard on
Cause the morning says glory when a star is born  hello
I predict an earthquake up in here
Say yeah

Cause we throw bombs on it  throw bombs on it
Just smash something  yes mosh for me
Hey yeah (Oh My God)

With this type of banger is on in the club  nobody wanna hear you
Then a big foot step up in the place  like I’m comin’ in to kill you
Bang ‘em earthquake
Every time I bark on the mic and I won’t stop
Then I hit ‘em and I get ‘em all again
Gotta shut it down  everybody knows that I close shop
Yes yes yes  ok
Now I’m in the building  do what I say
Jump around  hands in the air
And you better get to it ‘cuz you know I don’t play
And let us get it poppin’ and then we turn it up a little
Cuz you know we gotta do it and we doin it well
I’m about to explode

'Cause it's carved in my memory
Oh-oh
I've been dotting Is and crossing Ts  yeah
Planets are aligned  so if I'm dreaming
Don't open my eye
I was always looking now I look no more
Love was always cooking through a steel-plated door
Now I'm in the kitchen sippin' love you songs
I'm having a dish I never had before
Everything  everything I require
Everything  everything that I could desire
But it ain't money  putting gold into my hand
Baby don't you know it's you
That gives me everything
Listеn (Oh)  let me tell you all a littlе secret (Oh)
Always thought that love was some kind of weakness (Oh)
Turns out it's everything I would have dreamed it
Would be and now I see
Everything  everything I require
Everything  everything that I could desire
But it ain't money  putting gold into my hand
Baby don't you know it's you
Ain't got the perfect smile  don't turn heads on my street
Tryin' to be a superstar  like everybody else
But being myself is something I do well
