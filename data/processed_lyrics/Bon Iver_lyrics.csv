lyrics
"Who knows how many poses that I've been in
But them the main closest  hark! It gives meaning mine
I worried 'bout rain and I worried bout lightning
But I watched them off to the light of the morning
Marking the slope  slung low in the highlands
(Where the days have no numbers)
Oh  the old modus: out to be leading live
A word about Gnosis: it ain't gonna buy the groceries
Or middle-out locusts  or weigh to find
I hurry 'bout shame and I worry 'bout a worn path
And I wander off  just to come back home
Turning to waltz  hold high in the lowlands
('Cause the days have no numbers)

So I can depose this  partial to the bleeding vines
Suppose you can't hold shit  how high I've been
What a river don't know is to climb out and heed a line
To slow among roses or stay behind
I've been to that grove
Where no matter the source is
And I walked it off  how long I'd last
Sore-ring to cope  whole band on the canyon
(When the days have no numbers)

Than I am when we started
Benefolance
I'm not sinking — I'm not synching
Five lane divers

The math ahead
The math behind it
It's moon water

And half the hum

Than I am when we started
Benefolance
I'm not sinking — I'm not synching
Five lane divers
Now I'm more
Where you gonna look for confirmation?
And if it's ever gonna happen
So as I'm standing at the station
It might be over soon
(All these years)
There I find you marked in constellation (two  two)
There isn't ceiling in our garden
And then I draw an ear on you
So I can speak into the silence
(It might be over soon) two  two
(And I'm gonna shout all my trouble over)
Oh and I have carried consecration
And then You expelled all decision
As I may stand up with a vision
Caught daylight  goddamn right
Within a rise there lies a scission
In the stair up off the hot car lot
Sun shine hard on the video spot
Sure as any living dream
It's not all then what it seems
And the whole thing's hauled away
A womb
An empty robe
Enough
You're rolling up
You're holding it
You're fabric now

Nor the snow shoe light or the autumns
Threw the meaning out the door

There's no meaning anymore

Fold the map and mend the gap
And I tow the word companion
And I make my self escape
It comes always off the page
I hold the note
You wrote and know
You've buried all your alimony butterflies
Sub find
Is the company stalling?
We had what we wanted: your eyes
(When we leave this room it's gone)
With no word from the former
I'd be happy as hell if you stayed for tea
(I know so well that this is all there is)
A child ignored
These will just be places to me now
The foreman is down
(When we leave this room it's gone)
We're rising the stairs
​I find God
Staying at the Ace Hotel
If the calm would allow
Then I would just be floating to you now
It would make me pass to let it pass on

Where life began when we were young last night)
Well we walked up on that bolt in the street
After you tied me in in the driveway of the apartment of his bede
Sent your sister home in a cab
Said I woulda walked across any thousand lands
(No not really if you can't)
I didn't need you that night
Not gonna need you anytime
Was gonna take it as it goes
I could go forward in the light
Well I better fold my clothes
(I've been looking through your mind)
All my goodness
(I've been looking through your mind)
(I've been looking through your mind)
All my goodness to show
(Why are you so far from saving me?)
What kind of shit to ignore
I've cut the cloth
(Ooh... hard line circle)
How to know who to write
How to know who can cull up all the questions
To clean out a night
I fell in love
I heard about it (bit by bit)
I heard about it (bit by bit)
I heard about it (bit by bit)
And so it's not in your clasp
Then what's the function or the task
Help me reach the hammer
(For then what will I ask?)
That's a pair of them docks
Mooring out two separate lochs
Ain't that some kind of quandry

Take me into your palms
What is left when unhungry?

Still standing in the need of prayer

Or what kind of pith I've amassed
Long lines of questions
But what do you lose to concede?
And yes it's hard to believe when 'em sold for your sleeves
Just come off of your kneel
I can admit to conceal
I've laughed about it (bit by bit)
I've laughed about it (bit by bit)
I remember something
When first I breeched that last Sunday (Ooh)
Low moon don the yellow road
I remember something
That leaving wasn't easing all that heaving in my vines
And as certain it is evening 'at is NOW is not the time (Ooooh)
Toiling with your blood
I remember something
Finding both your hands as second sun came past the glass
Cause it once might not mean something?
But all I'm trying to do is get my feet out from the crease

And I see you

And I carry his guitar
And I can't recall it lightly at all
But I know I'm going in
Not sure what forgiveness is
We've galvanized the squall of it all
I can leave behind the harbour
I will run (all around it)
Have to crawl (still can't stop it)
Along the fires
One more time just pass me by

Now Mona (Now Mona)
From the core to the sky
Wouldn't I be last to see? (carry off and up your seas)
From the door till we die
Deny with love my labour (carry up with love a long)
Was it all I could find (atonements defined)
And your head's down low
If you can see your own kite (Shed a little light  oh Lord)
You know a burden ain't a bust
You are the only way to trust ya
No no no
It's only fair it burns up in that rust
Lay down  Martha
Lay down the holy banner flag
Hold out  Martha
Help is surely on its way
And it's not right
Don't bask in the glory of mine
But oh no  they can't come take that part away
They ate up all their cake
And they drank their own wine
They were always on the take (Will you shed a little light  oh Lord)
Well  you know the burden ain't a gust
The only path to love is touch
I'll always know that all that proper mounts too much

Well you're up all night
And your neighbors don't know
Man  your neighbors don't know
(So shed a little light  oh Lord)
You know a burden ain't a bust
You know that truth's been known to crutch
No no no
To know that you'll leave
Don't you lock when you're fleeing
I'd like not to hear keys
Only hold till your coffee warms
But don't hurry and speed
Once a time  put a tongue
In your ear on the beach
And you clutched clicking heels
And the rain let in
Pry it open with your love
Sending lost and alone standing offers
Such 
In keeper's keep
All the news at the door
Such a revelry
Of everything you said to me

This is Axiom
Down to the downtown
Down to the lock down
I crouch like a crow
Contrasting the snow
'Cause blinded
I am blindsided
Peek in
Into the peer in
I'm not really like this
I'm probably plight-less
I cup the window
I'm crippled and slow

Taut line
Down to the shoreline
The end of a blood line
The moon is a cold light
There's a pull to the flow
My feet melt the snow
'Cause blinded
I was blindsided
Blinded
I was blindsided
Blinded
We were looking at the bags
Wondering if any of the colors
Matched any of the names we knew on the tags
Stacked on top with your brother's
See how they resemble one another's
Even in their plastic little covers?
And I said I know it well
That secret that you know
That you don't know how to tell
It fucks with your honor
And it teases your head
But you know that it's good  girl
'Cause it's running you with red
Then the snow started falling
We were stuck out in your car
You were rubbing both my hands
Chewing on a candy bar
You said Ain't this just like the present
To be showing up like this?
As the moon waned to crescent
We started to kiss

And I know it well
I know it well
And I know it well
I know it well
And I know it well
I know it well
And I know it well
Never keep your eyelids clipped
Hold me for the pops and clicks
I was only for the father's crib
Hair  old  long along
Your neck onto your shoulder blades  oh-oh  oh-oh-oh
Always keep that message taped
Cross your breasts you won't erase
I was only for your very space
Hip  under nothing
Propped up by your other one  face 'way from the sun
Just have to keep a dialogue
Teach our bodies: haunt the cause
I was only trying to spell a loss
Joy  it's all founded
Pincher with the skin inside  oh-oh  oh-oh-oh
You pinned me with your black sphere eyes
You know that all the rope's untied
I was only for to die beside

So it's storming on the lake
Little waves our bodies break
There's a fire going out
But there's really nothing to the south
Swollen orange and light let through
Your one-piece swimmer stuck to you
Sold  I'm ever
Open ears and open eyes  oh-oh  oh-oh-oh
Wake up to your starboard bride
Who goes in and then stays inside
Oh  the demons come  they can subside
I was lost but your fool
Was a long visit wrong?
Say you are the only
The creature fear
I was teased by your blouse
Spit out by your mouth
I was loud by your lowered
Seminary sold
Take all on the wind on
The soft bloody nose
Sign another floor
The creature fear
So did he foil his own? Is he ready to reform?
Shattered in paint
Stay up late
But brought to my space
The wonderful things I’ve learned to waste
I should've known
That I shouldn't hide
To compromise and to covet
All what’s inside
There is no design
You'll have to decide
Time and again
(Got all that I need)
It's time to be brave
Content to the phrases
Just some kind of pages
This for my sister
That for my maple
It's not going the road I'd known as a child of God
Nor to become stable
(So what if I lose? I’m satisfied)

Am I dependent in what I’m defending?
And do we get to hold what faith provides?
Fold your hands into mine
I did my believing
Seeing every time
I know it's lonely in the dark
And this year’s a visitor
And we have to know that faith declines
It's enough
I wear my garment so it shows
Now you know
Only love is all maroon
Gluey feathers on a flume
Sky is womb and she's the moon
I am my mother on the wall
With us all
Nothing's more
Only love is all maroon
Lapping lakes like leery loons
Only love is all maroon
Gluey feathers on a flume
Saw death on a sunny snow
For every life
Forgo the parable
Seek the light
My knees are cold
Go find another lover
To bring a
To string along
With all your lies
You're still very lovable
I toured the light
So many foreign roads
But then you know your gifts seemed heaven sent
I don't know how you house the sin
But you're free now
I was never sure how much of you I could let in
Am I free now
Won't you settle down baby here your love has been
Heavenly father
It’s definitely lava
Why you don't carry other names?
Heard about a day where it dropped the Know
To go another day as we learn to close
Cause I'm a known coward in a coward wind
But you’re free now
You turn around now and you count to 10
To see you go now
Well I know now honey that I can't pretend
Heavenly father
Is whose brought to his autumn
And love is left in end
I just been up here for god damn years
Can you see now?
Filling up hulls with god damn fears
I am free now
Heavenly father
Is all that he offers
I took it remote
I wanted a bath
Tell the story or he goes
Tell the story or he goes
While it's living in a coal mine
Tall time to call your Ma
You're back and forth with light
I waited outside
I was tokin' on dope
I hoped it all wunt go in a minute
With the past that you know
I wanted all that mind sugar
I want it all mine

I waited outside
Then you took me in the room
And you offered up the truth
My eyes crawling up the window to the wall
From dusk 'til dawn
Let me talk to 'em
Let me talk to 'em all
While it's living in a coal mine
Tall time to call your Ma
Fall out
Fall along
In the first of light
Past the Noachide
Bodies wrapped in white
Stranded every pain
I got outta La Grange
In Hinnom
All this time
With your heart in mind
Didn't you edit?
In Hinnom
And the precious feast
The in-vetted
Dirt and ice imbed in cheeks
In the potter's field
(Solar peace
You just set it)
Strangers scattering
Nether passage in the wind
Off pennant tension ring
On the wettest ground
You're laying waste to Halloween
You fucked it  friend  it's on its head  it struck the street
You're in Milwaukee  off your feet
And at once  I knew
I was not magnificent
Strayed above the highway aisle
Jagged vacance  thick with ice
I could see for miles  miles  miles
Third and Lake  it burnt away  the hallway
Was where we learned to celebrate
Automatic bought the years you'd talk for me
That night you played me Lip Parade
Not the needle  nor the thread  the lost decree
Saying nothing  that's enough for me
And at once  I knew
I was not magnificent

Hulled far from the highway aisle
Jagged vacance  thick with ice
I could see for miles  miles  miles
Christmas night  it clutched the light  the hallow bright
Above my brother  I  and tangled spines
We smoked the screen to make it what it was to be
Now  to know it in my memory
And at once  I knew
I was not magnificent
High above the highway aisle
Jagged vacance  thick with ice
I'm happy as I ever been
Couldn't tell ya what the cadence is
It's folded in the evidences
So you wanna leave a mark?
You're honing in on Meadow Park?
I heard you guys are very safe
Caught up with the featherweights
The dawn is rising
The land ain't rising
Flash hope
Pass the throw
Coming in very late
Just above our pay grades
You ask me not to pull alarms
We have to act our ages
The dawn is rising
But the land ain't rising
Catch up
You wanna go the fast way?

Bonded weights
Don't favor them
If it's all that you don't do

Better let them pass away
Better that you find a new way
Before my eyes
Couldn't learn it any other way
Turn down the bed
Turn down these voices inside my head
Lay down with me
Tell me no lies
Don't patronize me
'Cause I can't make you love me
If you don't
You can't make your heart feel
Something it won't
Here in the dark
These final hours
I will lay down my heart
I feel the power but you don't
If you don't
I close my eyes
I won't see
The love you don't feel
When you're holding me
Morning will come and I'll do what's right
Just give me 'til then to give up this fight
And I will give up this fight

I can't make you love me if you don't
If you don't
Love in the nick of time
Well  ain't been gone too far
But heading out towards Ponoma
Where you won't be alone
Where there's thrift store manager in a poke camadee
And a gas mask on his arm
And one by one by one
We'll all be gone
We'll all be gone by the fall
We'll all be gone by the falling light
Brick layer
With a hat down on his feet
I'll say no more
I won't lead no Calvary
How long
Will you disregard the heat?
Half beat
It's no misnomer though

I've the feeling that I better go
So
A heavy stone
Sold my red horse for a venture home
To vanish on the bow
Settling slow
Or so the story goes
Color the era
Film it is historical
My mile could not
Pump the plumb
In my arbor 'til my ardor trumped
All at once
Rushing from the sump pump
Or so the story goes
Balance we won't know
We will see when it gets warm
 I thought that this was half a love  love
 I thought that this was half a love
 I thought that this was half a love
 I thought that this was half a love
 I thought that this was half a love
Melic in the naked  knew a lake and drew the lofts for page
Hurdle all the waitings up  I know it wasn't wedded love  why?
Four long minutes in and it was over  it'd all be back
And the frost took up the eyes
Pressed against the pane
Could see the veins and there was poison out
Resting in a raze  the inner claims I hadn't breadth to shake
Searching for an inner clout  may not take another bout  why?
Honey in the hale could fill the pales of loving less with vain
Hon'  it wasn't yet the spring
Aiming and it sunk and we were drunk and we had fleshed it out
Nose up in the globes  you never know if you are passing out
Hung up in the ivory  both were climbing for a finer cause
Love can hardly leave the room
Borne the arboretic truth you kept posing
Sat down in the suit
Ramble in the roots
Storing up the clues
It had its sullen blue bruised through by showing
Settle past a patience
Where wishes and your will are spilling pictures
Water's running through
In the valley where we grew to write this scripture
Not for a part in any gamut of the dark
Doubled in the toes
Did not lose it in the stack's stow
I'ma lay that call back on ya
You know it won't beseech you
We're laying in an open field
I will let you grow
No need to know this
What is clear up in the daylight is we're hung here
Fall is coming soon
A new year for the moon and the Hmong here

But the berries still to come
All along them I can hear ya
I can hear cry (Crying)
All along me I can hear you
I'd occupy that
Can't sit back long while you're forming that

Tell them I'll be passing on

We can’t see from here right now

And you wish it was only a shame
(At this stage)
(All we can say)
All there is really to say
We are at the beginning again
But oh
How things can change
So don't you run away!
Think we on the wrong track somehow

Across your face
Move dust through the light
To fide your name
It's something fane
This is not a place
Not yet awake
I'm raised of make
Furling forests for the soft
Gotta know been lead aloft
So I'm ridding all your stories
Well  it's all just scared of dying
But isn't this a beach?
And if I know one thing at all
Is I cannot just be a peach
Oh  you come in all woke now
So  please enjoy the feast
We are weightless like a wayless beast
So what is it we don't teach?
When we were children we were hell-bent
Or oblivious at least
But now it comes to mind
We are terrified
So we run and hide
For a verified little peace
So what of this release?
Sun light feels good now  don't it?
And I don't have a leaving plan
But something's gotta ease your mind
But it's all fine  or it's all crime anyway

Not a pantomime
More like anodyne

I could prophet
I could rob I  however
Everywhere isn’t everywhere
This is not a veil
Or a fairy tale in the least
So what of this release?
Some life feels good now  don't it?
(I think I need it)
Don't have to have a leaving plan
(Have to let it)
Nothing's gonna ease your mind
Well  it's all fine and we're all fine anyway
Then she
Returns to cure and see
Heavy fate
After years of waiting
'Cause abnormalities
Surely
Are everywhere you see
So what I think we need
So I won't lead no lie
With our hearts the only matter why
How long it's lasted
I've not received reciprocity
To speak supportively

All these in-betweens that bar my youth

There's no anorberic dream

I learned a lesson
For the Lord?
But can you find the time
Fever last too long
Fever's rashing on
There's no fountain in silver
How art?
How art?
How often ya gonna see now
Truly what ya cease to be
Will you adjust your scenery?
For the Lord?
Keep it rational
Keep it rational
Pour a little salt  we were never here
My my my  my my my  my my
Staring at the sink of blood and crushed veneer
I tell my love to wreck it all
Cut out all the ropes and let me fall
My my my  my my my  my my
Right in this moment  this order's tall
And I told you to be patient
And I told you to be fine
And I told you to be balanced
And I told you to be kind
And in the morning I'll be with you
But it will be a different kind
And I'll be holding all the tickets
And you'll be owning all the fines
Come on  skinny love  what happened here?
Suckle on the hope in light brassieres

Sullen load is full  so slow on the split

And I'm breaking at the britches
And at the end of all your lines
Who will love you?
Who will fight?
Someday  my pain will mark you
Harness your blame
Harness your blame and walk through
With the wild wolves around you
In the morning  I'll call you
Send it farther on
Solace my game
Solace my game  it stars you
Swing wide your crane
Swing wide your crane and run me through
And the story's all over you
In the morning  I'll call you
Can't you find a clue
When your eyes are all painted Sinatra blue?

What a mischief you would bring  young darling
When the onus is not all your own
When you're up for it before you've grown
From the faun forever gone
In the towers of your honeycomb
I'd a tore your hair out just to climb back  darling
When you're filling out your only form
Can you tell that it's just ceremon’?
Now you've added up to what you're from
Build your tether rain-out from your fragments
Break the sailor's table on your sacrum
Fuck the fiercest fables  I’m with Hagen
For the love  comes the burning young
From the liver  sweating through your tongue
Well  you're standing on my sternum
Don't you climb down  darling
Oh  the sermons are the first to rest
Smoke on Sundays when you're drunk and dressed
Out the hollows where the swallow nests
I will see you off now
Down the back of the ridge
There's just something that I got to show you
There is domer and there's rot
And the common case
It ain't nothing what you say is true
With your long arms  try
And just give some time
Presently  it does include my dues
Ain't your standard premonitions
All this phallic repetition
Boy  you tell yourself a tale or two
Man like you
Man  improve
Well  I know that we set off for a common place
(And the lines have run too deep)
How much caring is there of some American love
When there's lovers sleeping in your streets?

So Cerberus Ride
Bring those dead alive
Like Pirate Jenny on the Black Freighter
It'll be a long day of fixing
Make something else your mission
Boy  why this shit's so hard to cue?
Man like you
How you do?

Is all we know
When thaw
Is not below us
In that iron ground
Bet
Is hardly shown
Scraped
Across the foam
Like they stole it
I... I'm growing like the quickening hues
I... I'm telling darkness from lines on you
Over havens fora
All been living alone
Where the ice snap and the hold clast are known

Home
We're savage high
Come
We finally cry
Because it's right
I... we're sewing up through the latchet greens
Same white pillar tone as with the bone street
Sand is thrown where she stashed us at
(All been living alone) All been living alone
Where the cracks at in the low part of the stoning
Enough of this
Give us the grown
I want mine here though
We heard that story before (Woo  hahaha)
What you think we're taming with the towers and the oar?
You keep evading boy  you putting me flat on the floor
It's okay  you were young when you were gave it
But you stayed there
And you’d expect it when we photograph our scars
Some lonely fable that we took in then right from the start
I want it back
I want it back
Won’t you tell me how to get it back?
I want it back
I want it back
Why won't you tell me how to get it back?
I'm coming over for another story told
I'm saying homie that it's not what you been sold
It's hardly what you'd know
The ordinary something neither of us holds
No folding gold for protecting from the lords
Who's that really we leave out in the cold?
But they're depending  so you just keep giving pause
Piss pools in your seat
She's standing inside but you surely repeat
Love is love's reprieve
Winter is coming and you're stuck here
Winter has come and your stacking
All your summer shoes
Love is love's sad news
Now I have nothing that I can keep
Love is love's mystique
You're up on the bar and you're shaking
With every grimy word
Who will you love? What's love when you've hurt?
Love is love's return

Ini was
Keeping what you telling me
I know mine
Living in a lonesome way
Had me looking other ways
I stood a little while within it
Know the way
If forgiveness is a chore
What you waiting for?
We been here before
And I can't ignore it anymore
You know the way it goes
How much longer then? (I'll show you in)
(Now I'll tell you why)

(Said Ini)
–day is Kumran
Everything that happens is from now on
–hundred at a time
And it's hard to find it when you knew it
When your money's gone and you're drunk as hell
On your back with the racks as the stacks of your load
In the back with the racks and the stacks are your load
In the back with the racks and you're unstacking your load
I've been twisting to the sun
I needed to replace
And the fountain in the front yard is rusted out
All my love was down in a frozen ground
There's a black crow sitting across from me
His wiry legs are crossed
Whatever could it be that has brought me to this loss?
