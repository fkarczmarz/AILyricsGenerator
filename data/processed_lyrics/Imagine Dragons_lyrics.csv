"I'm sorry I let you down
Well  these days I'm fine
No  these days I tend to lie
I'll take the western train
Just by the side of Amsterdam
Just by my left brain
Just by the side of the Tin Man
I'm sorry  Brother
I'm sorry I let you down
Well  these days you're fine
No  these days you tend to lie
You'll take the western train
Just by the side of Amsterdam
Just by your left brain
Just by the side of the Tin Man
Your time will come
If you wait for it  if you wait for it
But I keep coming up short

I'm sorry  lover
I'm sorry I bring you down
Well  these days I try
And these days I tend to lie
Kinda thought it was a mystery
And then I thought it wasn't meant to be
You said yourself fantastically
Congratulations  you are all alone!
Your time will come
If you wait for it  if you wait for it
Your time will come
If you wait for it  if you wait for it
But the rain won't fall for the both of us
The sun won't shine on the both of us
Believe me when I say
That I wouldn't have it any other way!
Your time will come
If you wait for it  if you wait for it
But I won't wait much longer!
'Cause these walls start crashin' down!
No  I won't wait much longer!
'Cause these walls start crashin' down!
And terrors don’t prey on innocent victims
Trust me  darlin'  trust me darlin'
It’s been a loveless year
I'm a man of three fears:
Integrity  faith  and crocodile tears
Trust me  darlin'  trust me  darlin'
So look me in the eyes (Eyes)  tell me what you see (You see)
Perfect paradise (—Dise)  tearin' at the seams (Seams)
I wish I could escape it (Escape)  I don't wanna fake it
Wish I could erase it (Erase)  make your heart believe
But I'm a bad liar  bad liar
Now you know  now you know
I'm a bad liar  bad liar
Now you know  you’re free to go
Did all my dreams never mean one thing?
Does happiness lie in a diamond ring?
Oh  I’ve been askin' for—
Oh  I’ve been askin' for problems  problems  problems
I wage my war  on the world inside
I take my gun to the enemy's side
Oh  I've been askin’ for— (Trust me  darlin')
