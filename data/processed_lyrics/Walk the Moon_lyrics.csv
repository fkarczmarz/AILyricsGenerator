" no!
 and I cannot hide
 well--
 all that I want
 all that I want
 all that I want
 all that I want
 all that I want
 all that I want
 all that I want
 all that I want
 but he’s all alone
 maybe if I was vegan
 all that I want
 all that I want
 all that I want
 all that I want
 all that I want
 all that I want
 all that I want
 all that I want
 all that I want
 all that I want
 all that I want
 all that I want
 all that I want
 all that I want
 all that I want
Around me but I
I feel the same inside
Getting older
Not getting wiser
It's got me up all night
That everybody
Wants the same things
At the same damn time
Running in circles
Hunting hunters
Hurry up and wait in line
I just want to meet somebody

Long hours
'Till the sun sets
And then I call my friends
Wash the dirt off
Button your shirt up
Do it all over again
Can you tell me
Is it really worth it
To stick it out in line?
How will I answer
When I look back
How did I spend my time?
I just want to meet somebody
Are you the one who will take me there?
Are you the one who will treat me right?
I'm not afraid of your blue-est flame
My feet are still sore  my back's on the fringes
We tore up the walls  we slept on couches
We lifted this house  we lifted this house
Firecrackers in the east  my car parked south
Your hands on my cheeks  your shoulder in my mouth
I was up against the wall on the west mezzanine
We rattle this town  we rattle this scene
Oh  Anna Sun
Oh  Anna Sun
What do you know? This house is falling apart
What can I say? This house is falling apart
We got no money  but we got heart
We're gonna rattle this ghost town
This house is falling apart
Screen falling off the door  door hanging off the hinges
My feet are still sore  my back's on the fringes
We were up against the wall on the west mezzanine
We rattle this town  we rattle this scene

We got no money  but we got heart
We're gonna rattle this ghost town
This house is falling apart
Live my life without
Station wagon rides
Fumbling around the back
Not one seat belt on
Wait for summertime
Coming up for air
Now it's all a wash
Now it's all a wash
(Screen falling off the door  door hanging off the hinges)
Live my life without
(My feet are still sore  my back's on the fringes)
Coming up for air
(We tore up the walls  we slept on couches)
Now it's all a wash
(We lifted this house  we lifted this house)
I want everyone
(Firecrackers in the east  my car parked south)
Racing down the hill
(Your hands on my cheeks  your shoulder in my mouth)
I am faster than you
(I was up against the wall on the west mezzanine)
Wait for summertime
(We rattle this town  we rattle this scene)
Wait for summertime
Oh  Anna Sun
Oh  Anna Sun

 you said no
 but you said no
 and you said no
 you said if it was gonna happen
 but I said no
 anyway anyway I can
 oh
 oh
 you were in the car
 but you said no
 you just go
 you were in the car
 but you said no
 you just go
 oh
 I can't frown long with your face in my head
 too too long since i had a smile on my head
 I can't frown long with your face in my head
 too too long since I had a smile on my head
 I can't frown long with your face in my head
 too too long since I had a smile on my head
 oh
Is under the mirror of the surface
So cut my cord
I wanna know how deep we can take it
You'll never find it wearing a life-vest
You gotta risk your neck
But know in your heart it will be worth it
So here we go
And no rules—we can stay as long as we want
Slow-dancing in the darkness
And all I know is I wanna be here with you from now on
It's been my fashion to keep my head dry and get my feet wet
Just when you think you're all adult swim
That's precisely when somebody shows you to the ocean
So here we go
And no rules—we can stay as long as we want
Slow-dancing in the darkness
And all I know is I wanna be here with you from now on

All I know is I wanna be here with you from now on
And all I know is I wanna be here with you from now on
Midwest shooting star
In the days she waits
But she moonlights rock 'n' roll
Playing a raindance with her guitar
Sometimes you only get one chance
You got a look in your eyes (your eyes)
I knew you in a past life
One glance and the avalanche drops
One look and my heartbeat stops
Ships pass in the night
I don't want to wait 'til the next life
One glance and the avalanche drops
One look and my heartbeat stops
Last call and everybody's watching
Her voice rings out like a storm
Sometimes the past echoes in the future
Started long before we were born
Sometimes you only get one chance
You got a look in your eyes (your eyes)
I knew you in a past life
One glance and the avalanche drops
One look and my heartbeat stops
Ships pass in the night
I don't want to wait 'til the next life

One glance and the avalanche drops
One look and my heartbeat stops
One glance and the avalanche drops
In slow motion across the room
Little London jeans
Search my memory banks for what to do
I recall 80s movie scenes
And I still don't know what girls like
I'll take my chances  James Bond
I'll pull my chute and hope it works right
Gotta make a good impression
But I knew the very first second
I only got one more question
Do you have a boyfriend?
D-d-d-do you have a boyfriend?
You could be my number one
Mixtape queen
We could have some dirty fun
In my Jurassic Park jeep

Must all be flirtation
Without a little information
Gotta make a good impression
But I knew the very first second
I only got one more question
Do you have a boyfriend?
 I was up until four
 lying dead on the floor
 I was feelin' like shit
 I’m high with my friends
 I think I’ll do it again
 not tryin' to be difficult
 roll the dice
 chance with my love
 gotta spread my wings
 not tryin' to be difficult (What you got?)
 roll the dice
 chance with my love
 feel so alive
 feel so alive
 roll the dice
 chance with my love
Even a good thing can steal away like a thief in the night
Wake up tough
On time
Stand up straight
Talk right
Don't let up
Be funny
Be cool
Keep running
I can't keep up
With all these boys
Fast on their feet
Gnashing teeth
They hit you up
And I can't sleep  wolves are coming for me
If you're keeping secrets  secrets from me
I don't need to know baby
Honey keep your secrets  don't matter to me
But these wolves  they keep on scratching at my heart
And I still can't sleep...

Gnashing teeth

Down the hall from where you live
These floors are talkative
So quiet
A little house out in the woods
And it would feel so good
(Summer is over)
And I wanna leave you satisfied
(Summer is over)
And I can feel the cold changing us inside
(Come under the covers)
'Cause I wanna leave you satisfied tonight
In the low light
Two white shadows become one

And I wanna leave you satisfied

Daylight still a long time coming
But I know it will
Been under their spell  oh  but we're coming awake
So we'll be rude  we'll be loud
As long as it takes
This is why  this is why  we crank the dial to the right
This is why we're biting the bullet
We know the kids are right
Different colors
We carry each other
Just different colors
This is why we're biting the bullet
We know the kids are right
We keep cranking the music up
Driving through our towns
But they don't wanna hear
They want us to turn it down
So come on lovers  come on haters
Tonight we raise the fire
Cause when the people get to dancing
They forget about taking sides

Just to remember that I'm here at all
Well I believe that it takes one to know one
Guessing the fire by the shapes on the wall
There ain't no running away
Ain't no fire escape
There ain't no running away
It's in your DNA
Release yourself
There's no one else
Until you free yourself
You can't help nobody else
There ain't no running away

Vertical lines throwing stripes on the floor
Are you in chains?

Just to remember I got somewhere to go
Do you believe that it takes one to know one?
You already know
Release yourself (Release yourself)

(The wave is just about to break)
When the lightning bolt strikes on a clear blue sky I'm chillin
When the good times roll at the speed of light I'm chillin
When they cramping my style with a dollar sign I'm chillin
When I'm jonezin for you in the waiting line I'm chillin
I feel the wave building up
I'm chillin
Now tell me do you feel that rush
Wish you could be high for the rest of your life you'll be chillin
Your body want that rush but Ima give it time I'll be chillin
Cause we'll be ridin that vibe til the day we die we'll be chillin
Until our heart goes flat on the thin red line we'll be chillin

The wave is just about to break
Embrace the unknown
Soaring through space
Completely weightless
Completely free
Close your eyes
As deep as it was free
Then you came along and opened up
Your sanctuary to me
Walking through your rooms safe in your arms
But you don’t know the shadow in my heart
Take a walk through your house
A place to start again
This could have been heaven
And I let the Devil in
Take a walk through your house
A place to start again
This could have been heaven
And I let the Devil in
Underneath the carpet (Take a walk through your house)
Buried in a kiss (A place to start again)
I cannot hide it (This could have been heaven)
How much longer must I twist? (But I lеt the Devil in)
Is it nearly ovеr? (Take a walk through your house)
Are we near the end? (A place to start again)
Only you can tell me (This could have been heaven)
How much longer must I twist in the wind? (But I let the Devil in)

Are we near the end? (A place to start again)
Only you can tell me

Or something I had once
But since lost and now I
I've got a feeling that I'm not complete anymore
Don't even tell me where we are going
Hands over my eyes  hands over my eyes
Don't even tell me where we are going
Just walk  just walk by my side
It starts with a glimpse  a shimmer a shadow
Or something I had once
But since lost and now I
I've got a feeling that I'm not complete anymore
The salt in my eyes
As I clear the border
Imaginary lines
Shatter and shimmer
I get to you to ask you a question
I get to you to find out for certain
Are you fixin'...?

Another deep dive all the way down
Keep your head
This is the part of the movie where we turn it all around

I can take a hit like Karate Kid
Like how to take a beating
I know I did
It's just another chain reaction
When you make the big mistake
Suffer all the satisfaction
Of feeling this way
A pretty picture of a better man taking you out
Holding your hand at your favorite band
It's just another chain reaction
When you make the big mistake
Suffer all the satisfaction
Of learning something
(I'm so glad we can still be friends)

Just an empty book
With nothing on the page
Oh in my mind
You won't be in my mind
You won't be in my mind

Can't see the road in front of me
So I crash my car
On the way to the temple of your heart
The covers off the bed
The keys are down the drain
Just an empty head
With nothing left to say

Perhaps I lack some foresight (Should have known)
Sure as the setting sun
You can't trust just anyone
That's what you want

While they analyze everything that’s wrong with me
I should probably be drinking ‘til I'm on the street
Calling out your name like a fool with a bottle
Tryna argue with the Uber ’bout quickest route to you
But I'm not
My friends wonder why I'm not bleedin' and cryin'
When I say I'm wishin' you well
They tell me for all of the shit that you put me through
I should be givin' you hell
But I hope you smile when you wake up
I hope you dream when you close your eyes
I should bе mad but it’s all love
I hope you find what you’rе made of
I hope you find out the world's alright
I should be mad but it’s all love

I hope you smile when you wake up
I hope you dream when you close your eyes
I should be mad but it's all love
I hope you find what you're made of
I hope you find out the world's alright
I should be mad but it's all love
Oh I'm good--
Well I can't say I wouldn't change a thing
You got a heart shaped like a fist
And I won't miss you throwin' punches
I should probably be talking trash
Calling out your ass in a song on the radio...
But I hope you smile when you wake up
I hope you dream when you close your eyes
I should be mad but it's all love
I hope you find what you're made of
I hope you find out the world's alright
I should be mad but it's all love
Oh I'm good
And one more thing
Before I fade away
Before I'm your ex-life memory
I can't say I wouldn't change a thing
Can't say I've made it past the pain
I may hate the things you did to me
I may wish we never meet again
But I thank you for everything
I thank you for everything
(You for everything)
(For everything)
(I thank you for everything) (Oh yeah)

Gonna take it in slow motion
Got emotions that'll make it last
You've got freckles on your shoulder
Ammunition like a soldier
Jenny's got a body just like an hourglass
I wanna be the sand inside that hourglass
Oh and make it last
And I got you for the summer

But who knew
That you would be my comfort
You could bring the healing
If my friends gonna let me slide
How come you never left my side
Before I go make it last all night
While I slip into the great divide

Stepping out of body

My baby is a dancing queen
When my baby wears a dress
It's like she's not even a human being
Nobody else

With all the other boys in the runnin'

Morning breaks like splatter paint
Wipe the dust from my eyes
You must have left before morning came
Flashes of the night come rushing in
In a stampede of misbehaviors
I really thought that I could save us
And we're only animals
Didn't mean to start a forest fire
Brush the ashes off your shoulders
Let's get lost in the wild
We're all built for something
Trying to find the starting line
Don't look over your shoulder
Let's get lost in the wild
Let's get lost in the wild
Let's get lost in the wild
Something shocks my muscles
Hard rain backhands my senses

My hand is on the stick shift
And your hand is on my hand

And nothing behind
There's a desert in my blood
And a storm in your eyes
Am I the king of nothing at all?
Then you're the queen of nothing at all
And I forget the pain
I got my hand in your pocket
And my key on your chain
Am I the king of nothing at all?
Then you're the queen of nothing at all
You and I we're walking
Through the emptiness
Is it the only defense
Against the wilderness

And hope to die

How come even together
There can be loneliness?
But it's our only defense
To brave the wilderness
Cross my heart
And hope to die
Taking this one step at a time
I got your back if you got mine
One foot in front of the other

All that we have is each other

Just broke the hell out of my heart

Shades of ghosts in my head

The last chapter in the story of my old self
Damsel in distress
Waiting for a deus ex
In line to be your next ex
What if I don't want to live like that?
Am I just a lab rat
Doing what's done to me
Doesn't sound fun to me
I am not the subject
I am the experiment
I am mad scientist
'Cause I free-fell all year
My chute is blooming out like spring
When I've seen your long hair come down
It turned my head inside out
I still do
Your wrists were bound in my hands
Water washed around our naked feet
Your blue jeans over in the sand
And we were wrestling in our picnic blanket sheets
But I've seen your long hair come down
(Seen your long hair come down)
It turned my head inside out

We were victims of the night
The chemical  physical kryptonite
Helpless to the bass and the fading light
Oh  we were bound to get together

About to go our separate ways and I...
I almost wave goodbye
When you let your hair fall in your face
And I often wonder why the things that I want
Are so hard to find
But I often fail to see the things that I need
Are right here by my side
Something in the air is giving me bad ideas
Something in the air is giving me dangerous thoughts like:
Why don’t you stay at mine tonight?
(Why don’t you stay at mine tonight?)
Keys left hanging in the door
A trail of shoes and winter coats
And we’re kissing on the kitchen floor

AY AY AY AY!
The virgin yawn of folded wings that cracks the crust of the cocoon
The breaking of first light inside the womb
Do you feel my heartbeat quickening
In-between the baited breaths before the turning of the page?
The sense that everything's about to change
It was love at first sight
When I opened my new eyes
And saw your face
The sound of awakening
The exoskeleton thickening
Do you feel the floodgates opening
To the sound of awakening?
As whispers in the heart disclose the rumors of the truth
When the mind has all but hidden it from view
The surface trembles as the core begins to heat
And you no longer trust the turning earth beneath your feet
Questioning if time has ever moved in a straight line
When you hear the aches of past-life lovers
As you pass by one another in the street
