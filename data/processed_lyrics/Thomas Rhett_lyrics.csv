lyrics
"I almost gave up guitar 'cause it hurt to play those strings
I almost let it go
I almost broke my leg riding dirt bike with no fear
I almost lost my best friend over some girl freshman year
I almost lost my license driving home after two beers
Almost  Lord knows
Oh  but when I look back now
Thank God for the almost  thank God for the so close
Thank God for the night I came within an inch of that fence post
For the doors that open  for the ones that slam closed
Thank God for the girls I thought I'd marry  but left me heartbroke
Thank God for the highs  thank God for the lows
Thank God for the almost
I almost got that tattoo on my back that said Delta Chi
Almost didn't visit Granddad a week before he died
I almost didn’t kiss that girl  turned out to be my wife
Guess someone else had something else in mind
Thank God for the almost  thank God for the so close
Thank God for the kick that came within an inch of that goal post
For the doors that open  for the ones that slam closed
Thank God for the girls I thought I'd marry  but left me heartbroke
Thank God for the highs  thank God for the lows
Thank God for the almost

I don't live my life every day like you prayed that I would
You're the last thing on earth I deserve
Don't know why you were patient and wasted good savin' on me
Maybe angels don't always have wings
I ain't that type of guy that miracles wake up next to
But one look at you and I'm there
Don't know why you were patient and wasted good savin' on me
Maybe angels don't always have
Wings and halos
'Cause I dang near drug one through hell

When you just see black and white
Thinkin' 'bout the day we met  you coulda just ignored me
Here I am  layin' next to you  lookin' extra cute in the mornin'
Lookin' back  all through the past  everything before you was borin'
You're the type people wishin' they'd sit next to on a flight
Top of list  who I wanna wash up on a island with
You're the dream  even if we countin' girls in magazines
It's still a mystery
What's someone as beautiful as you
Doin' ridin' 'round with someone like me?
I swear  girl  you could have anyonе you choose
I should stop askin' questions 'fore you gеt up and leave
What's someone as beautiful as you
Doin' wakin' up with someone like me?
Ain't gonna lie  you could have anyone you choose
I should stop askin' questions 'fore you get up and leave
How someone as beautiful as you could just fall out of the blue?
When you're walkin' 'round in my sweater  girl  there's no better view
Spend the rest of forever just treasurin' you
Ooh  I'll follow you wherever and you know that's the truth  yeah

But you ain't got a clue how to ask
You and your girl had a fight and now she's sayin' goodbye
She ran upstairs and packed her bags
It could be rainin' on your perfect vacation
You could be stressed about your work situation
Ain't gotta listen to me  but all I'm sayin'
Ain't nothing that a beer can't fix
Ain't no pain it can't wash away
From the moment that it hits your lips
Makes those clouds look a little less gray
Or hungover from the night before
Turn that frown into a smile real quick
There ain't nothing that a beer can't fix
You're on a lake and you're fishin'
It's hot and all that you're gettin' is a little nibble here and there
You're sitttin'  watchin' your team losin' that championship ring

It might take one or it might take six
Drink it down  it will do the trick
Every day  I'm reminded of the miracle of you
You're too good for coincidence
And too perfect for an accident
And I'm not sure where Heaven is
But every night  I get a glimpse
And I know I'm blessed
Watching you spin in that dress
Making my heart beat out my chest
I can't count the times I've heard

And all I ain't got is my breath
You stole it the first time we met
You're more than I deserve

You poke my mind from every angle  and I

So no one would know
We didn't care where the days went
When everything was about a kiss
And clouds just looked like battleships
Helmets crashin' on the field
And we thought every love was real
We wrote our own destiny
In parkin' lots and empty streets
Jumped over cracks beneath our feet
And we thought it would never end
Then watched it go like summer wind
When growin' up was just a dream
And Friday night was everything
And bein' the fastest was somethin'

And it's been a year since I've seen a deer  had a smallmouth on the line
I spend way less time in Nashville  more time in L.A.
But last night  we cracked some cold beers and cranked Eric Church to ten
And I wouldn't change the things I've done or the places that I've been
Man  it feels good to be country again
I traded in my Silverado  didn't need no four-by-four
Tucked my boots in the back of the closet  they didn't feel like me no more
But I dug 'em out and slipped 'em on  they've been on my feet since then
Man  it feels good to be country again

To see some boys down on death row
Brought some guitars and my buddies
I could feel myself tremblin'
When I shook one of their hands
I thought that he would be a monster
It turns out he's a whole lot like I am
Like I do with boys back home
How Jesus is the ticket
And narrow is the road
About how all we need is forgiveness
'Fore we see them streets of gold
One of 'em name's was Johnny
Ain't touched the grass in thirty years
But it 'bout brought me to tears
Ain't always proud of what we done

And have a big time tonight
Got a Tennessee girl  a Rocky Top breeze
And a big ol' yellow moon
A new set of strings on my '69
And a Yeti full of iced-down booze
Everybody 'round this sleepy little town
Heading down Pinetucky Road
Gonna leave our worries in a cloud of dust
Right there by the old fence post
And have a big time tonight
A bunch of down home boys and some blue jean girls
Kicking up the dirt and shooting out the lights
Life can be an ol' briar patch
Gotta dance your way through it sometimes
So we're gonna drink a little beer  play a little music
And have a big time tonight
Got a pig in the ground  stars in the sky
And a jar full of lightning juice
Got a worn-out path to the river bank
Everybody coming out of them boots
Gonna pick a few songs all night long
Ones that we grew up on
Some fishing in the dark  some Copperhead Road
Everybody just sing along

Tell me yes or no  either way I'm fine
Last time we talked  said you've never been better
That's what you said though when we were together
Mine in July  but you're his in December
I guess I was your gateway love
I didn't get you high enough
Kinda like an eighth grade crush
That never lasts
Are you on that heavy stuff?
Tell me  did you find the one?
Find the one I thought I was
But now I know that I was just

Was I just one piece of the puzzle you're playing?
Did you have your eye on a different prize?

Windows down  country sound
It was always hotter than the grease she used to fry that chicken
Smelled like Marlboro Reds and all the butter from her biscuits
And that Lincoln in the driveway  circa 1982
Was on the shiny side of rusty and on the paler side of blue
Cussin' and complainin' weren't allowed at Mamaw's house
If every nightstand had a Bible  every front porch had a swing
If every backyard had a garden  every front door had a screen
Well  maybe this crazy world would straighten up and slow on down
If every town had a Mamaw's house
She'd ask if I was hungry every thirty seconds
And say things like hellfire  tarnation  and I reckon's
It's where I spent my summers and she put me to work
Shellin' peas and shuckin' corn until my fingers hurt
No tellin' who I'da been without Mamaw's house

If every backyard had a garden  every front door had a screen

35s rolling on the ground
Loving every minute
Skoal peach in the side of the door
Coke cans rolling on the floor
I drove her to PCB
With all my friends and me
I grew up in it
Playin' our song on the stereo
Drivin' 'til we ran outta road
