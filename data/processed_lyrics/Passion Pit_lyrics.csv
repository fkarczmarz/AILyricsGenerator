lyrics
"And paper to write letters on
Cause you're all I'll ever...
Have (it's all I'll ever)
When we wake up you engulf me in your love
Have (it's all I'll ever)
And all you need
Is someone who sees what you can't see
The things you'll never think you'll be
That's all I'll ever...

Have (it's all I'll ever)
I get the notion that I'm almost there
I get the notion that we're getting closer
And with one motion it could all go wrong
If I'm emotional I'll ruin it all
And the roof will cave in and fall to the ground
It's all I'll ever...
Have (it's all I'll ever)
Have (it's all I'll ever)
I promise this
On your cheek or on your lips
Oh-oh  oh  oh-oh  oh
Oh  oh  oh
Oh-oh  oh  oh-oh  oh
Oh  American blood
In my eyes and on my hands
Such an awful circumstance
Condone  carry your woes
Just strike a match and then a pose
But for whom  nobody knows
And we're gonna be alright
And you're gonna keep me safe this night
And we're gonna be alright
Everything will be quite alright
For you and me
For you and me
For you and me

Oh-oh  oh  oh-oh  oh
Oh  American blood
How my love always was young
How it always felt so fun
And then  oh  you went to my head
All my limbs instantly dead
Upside down  dangling by a thread
And we're gonna be alright
And you're gonna keep me safe this night
And we're gonna be alright
Everything will be quite alright
For you and me
For you and me
For you and me
What's it feel like?
What's it feel like to be alone?
What's it hurt like?
Does it hurt you because you know
That all of your blood
Could wash away the world in one massive wave?
Could reach the highest peak and the deepest cave?
And we're gonna be alright
And you're gonna keep me safe this night
And we're gonna be alright
Everything will be quite alright
For you and me
For you and me
For you and me
For you and me
Every time she shares her blood
The world starts leaving webs of love
And I hope you enjoyed it
Now this would be our best song
That you have ever heard
The dirt bike's going on stage
Thank you
You're gonna drive me crazy
You're gonna drive me mad
You got an angel on your shoulder
Makin' heavens out of less
I believe in believing
The things that we don't see
And the skin violin is where
The neighbors won't read meals
And the family heirloom jewelry
With sets and heaps of thieves
Will cast down things
That you've never ever seen
That your fathers set before you

You're gonna drive me crazy
You're gonna drive me mad
You got an angel on your shoulder
Makin' hairpins out of glass
Better things are coming
I swear there's truth in that
I'm shooting off the cannons
And the clouds begin to flow
And the baskets weave but the ones heap
Are the ones we'll never keep
Just pretend that things are mobile
And they're never staying put
And the way we were the day
We climbed to the top of the steeple
With it's people spewing angels out their mouths
And letting tables turn to charcoal
In the lipstick and the lipstick in the evening
Two or three times the bell will ring
It's when we look for the better things
I feel it crash upon your skin
I find it hard to believe there's more
Of these things behind the door
Do you miss me like I miss you?
Do I miss you like you miss me?
Tempted just to make an ugly scene
Ripped down from the brownstones to the street
Yes  please don't ever note me as your friend
Who says we have cold hearts? Acting out our old parts
I get carried away
Carried away from you
And I'm hoping and I'm praying
'Cause I'm sorry  sorry about that
Sorry about things that I said
Always let it get to my head
Higher education  making sense
Justify your thesis  certain that you need this
Tell me what your point is in defense

Listen  I don't really know you and I don't think I want to
But I think I can fake it if you can
And let's agree there's no need  no more talk of money
I get carried away
Carried away from you
And I'm hoping and I'm praying
'Cause I'm sorry  sorry about that
Sorry about the things that I said
Always let it get to my head
I get carried away
Carried away from you
And I'm hoping and I'm praying
'Cause I'm sorry  sorry about that
Sorry about the things that I said
Always let it get to my head
Wake up in the morning
Wake up in the evening
Wake up when you want to
'Cause no one's really watching
Well  she'll have something to say about it
But we all have problems
We're all having problems
And we've all got something to say
I get carried away
Carried away from you
And I'm hoping and I'm praying
'Cause I'm sorry  sorry about that
Sorry about things that I said
Always let it get to my head
I get carried away
Carried away from you
And I'm hoping and I'm praying
'Cause I'm sorry  sorry about that
Sorry about the things that I said
Let's never leave
I said never ever leave
The only reason that I'm fly
You stress me out I stay super high
Ghost love story like Patrick Swayze
Back of the Ghost like Miss Daisy
One night we goin' ride to Vegas
Let's get married and make a baby
I'm in love and she ain't trippin'
She leave me alone when a ninja sippin'
Between the legs they wet and drippin'
For Juicy J to go skinny dippin'
Make up sex everytime we break up
Love the way he go up and down
In the sheets when a ninja wake up
She sprung keep it motivate
Even though I stay vegigate
Drunk texting all through the night
Frustated so intoxicated
She don't understand I'm out tryna' gettin' this paper
Never on bean
She's in the cream
Get to shakin'
Just like a fiend
Get ya naked
Get ya faded
Then I'm busting
Up in your jeans
Hard body classes like John West
And her pussy hit hard like Ron Artest

And now I'm drunker then before babe
Told me drinking doesn't make me nice
You never know where some people will go
Yes some people been hurting me
In the neck or a blink of an eye
Well then they'll say what they say
And they'll do what they do
But it doesn't mean a goddamn thing
Everybody now
Oo ooh ooo
Yea they sing into the bright spring leaves
Everybody now

But someday you're gonna need to find some other kind of place to go

Everybody now

But someday you're gonna need to find some other kind of place to go
Don't you know?

Never

The conversation's moderated
By the noisy streets below
I'm just a mess with a name and a price
And now I'm drunker than before they
Told me drinking doesn't make me nice
You never know where some people will go
You can tell by a look
By the slightest crook in the neck

Now you're standing in the kitchen
And you're pouring out my drink
Well there's a very obvious difference
And it's that one of us can think
But tonight you've got me cornered
And I haven't got a place to go
You never know where some people will go
You can tell by a look
By the slightest crook in the neck
Or the blink of an eye
Well then they'll say what they say
And they'll do what they do

They come singing through the window

Everybody now
But someday you're gonna need to find
Some other kind of place to go
Don't you know?
Start talking 'bout other people
You were caught up in somebody else's mess
And yes  I drank all those drinks on my own
My life's become some blurry little quest
And the clock kept ticking slowly
And you leaned over to ask me
If I even had a clue where I was
Well I lied down on your wood floors
And my brain and body took course
And the night ended as though it never was
It all began to feel insane
I wanna know where they keep the rain
Sylvia  right back where you came from
Sylvia  no one's gonna tell you when enough's enough
Enough is enough
Sick to the bone on the steps to my home
The moon shined through the drapery of leaves
Too hurt to ignore everyone of my own
My true love just to feel some made-up breeze
But as my body crumbled  you walked as I just stumbled
And we spoke only of things made in my head
You never once controlled me  while all the others told me
That if I kept on going  I'd be dead
You might also like
It's not just you who fed the pain
Now tell me where they keep the rain
Sylvia  right back where you came from
Sylvia  no one's gonna tell you when enough's enough
Enough's always too tough
See what I've done now  I don't understand
She says I screamed and that I raised my hand  but
I never meant to  wasn't even there
I never meant to  I would never dare
Sylvia  right back where you came from
Sylvia  no one's gonna tell you when enough's enough
Enough's always too tough
Sylvia  right back where you came from
Sylvia  no one's gonna tell you when enough's enough
I spilled the bucket
Out on the floor
A mistake for sure
Consequences
Turned me hostile
I got so tied in
Made me docile
Then you applauded
When I was loving
Made me feel weak and
I start recovering
Now I feel silly
Selfish and dizzy
Now I got this feeling
That you'll forgive me
And you know
Put up with me then I'll make you see
That things are better when you're with me

That was the night we
Kissed in the moonlight
It was romantic
But didn't feel so right
Cause something was lost then
Today it's replenished
But it was you who
Cleaned up my messes
 (x2)
And oh
Put up with me then I'll make you see
That things are better when you're with me
(x4)
Let down your hair
Let down your hair
Let down your hair
Where you go
And I don't want to see
That you're coming along with me
And I don't wanna go
Wherever you go
I want the two of us to be
Just where we know
And I don't want to know
Everything you know
And I don't wanna see
Everything you see
And I don't wanna go
There hangs a light that comes and shines upon you
Oh we can't stay here
Tear down the moon and all its mockery
There is the sun that takes away our money
The night is deafening and brings on defeat
No I can't stay here
Don't steal away all of her beauty
Take down the darkness bruising both of your knees
It better overwhelm the heart with the heat
No I can't stay here
Every possible way
Never quite as it seems
I know I felt like this before
But now I'm feeling it even more
Because it came from you
Then I open up and see
The person falling here is me
A different way to be
Impossible to ignore
Impossible not to do
Now I tell you openly
You have my heart so don't hurt me
For what I couldn't find
Totall me amazing mind
So understanding and so kind
You're everything to me
Spits out our voices singing
Tra la la la on high now
To kingdom come so slightly
Herein a void in your place
I twitch and tweak in allusion
To sit and stare so blankly
Until all hope is used up
Why do I always need to need you when you're fleeting?
Where do you go when I'm around?
And have the nerve to wear a crown?
Oh na na na na na na hey hey hey hey
In some dark room
A smoky figure fills me full
Makes my head swell in ruin
My family kneels at their pew
I feel it rise above me
The western landscapes towering
And from my shell of a body
The flowers blossom for picking

Oh na na na na na na hey hey hey hey
I've waited and waited for someone to take it
I've painted your patterns but found them attractive
Now I've been leaning towards a life far more candid
Though lead through the dark with your eyes as my candles
Where your life and my life's directions can wrangle
And all of a sudden you've left me to handle
The reasons that never forbid me to stand tall
Darling what you do to me! You're living in my head
I'm not as strong as I was way back then
I wanna be alone
I wanna be alone
I wanna be alone
I wanna be alone
I wanna be alone
I wanna be alone
I wanna be alone
Well aren't you all so proud of me? Have you seen all I can do?

I remember moments as if set in stone
I can see you yelling and you throwing your rings at me
Well I never stopped trying to be better than that
And I'm getting so close to where I wanna be at
But every once in a while I'd rather be
I wanna be alone
I wanna be alone
Leave me alone
I'm fine
I'll be fine until the morning comes
Then unmask me in the blistering sun
Oh let me go
Just let me go
Just let me go
Or I'll burst in front of your eyes
Then collect myself from the ground
And when I go
And when I go
Just let me go
Like a light
Flickering out in the skies
Lost as fast as was found
Everything is easy when you never have to choose
But the balance has shifted and we're forced to lose
Like the sun and the moon I will circle you til you bloom
I will crush I will maul I will burn until I get to you
You might also likeLay low
Don't let me know when it's real
Will they quietly follow me here?
Will they take me as their own?
Now I will hold you I will keep you I'll control my love
Until it folds in my hands
But I'll build it back to the top
Everything is easy when you never have to choose
But the balance has shifted and we're forced to lose
Like the sun and the moon I will circle you til you bloom
I will crush I will maul I will burn until I get to you

Feel it rain!
Feel it rain!
We're alive!
Feel it rain!

Feel it rain!
We're alive!
Feel it rain!
Feel it rain!
Feel it rain!
We're alive!
Feel it rain!
Feel it rain!
Feel it rain!
We're alive!
And my life sways back and forth like the light from above
Or our chance
She’s my evergreen
She means the world to me
He will love you
Hey K  I'm fine
Just tell him what you need
You can run  I'll hide
Still we end up on our knees
And tell him what you need
Feel him emanate around you
And never again feel weak
He will love you till the end of time
Until the end of time
A beautiful design  ridding all of your pain in a landslide
A beautiful design
Hey K  in time
We'll mend and then agree
That our love's just light
And it pours down such relief
When you grieve  you'll find a gorgeous melody
In the harmony that holds you and forces you to see that

A beautiful design
Love is the answer and the one design
Such a simple design  holy architecture
Love is the answer
Love is the answer
Love is the answer
And the one design
Such a simple design
Holy architecture
Love is the answer
In the way that you love you?
And there's nothing to argue
Your life revolves to ruin
Everyone's watching all that you're doing
Say your head's done in
Maybe you should start running
Where they'll never say you cannot stay
Someday everything will be okay
You could hurt her so badly
You don't mean to
Hurting her is too maddening
What you mean to say isn't always what's said
Take a deep breath
As soon as you've let go

Where they'll never say you cannot stay
Someday everything will be okay
What's the point to this?
Feeling happiness in life?
As we fight off our demise
Or love as we play into it's lies
Where they'll never say you cannot stay
I was tied to a rocking chair
I was beat down to a pulp
Rocking back and forth somewhere
You'd have said it was the final straw
There my life was bound and tethered
On a porch by the shore
Easy way to tell one so
The things you know
When they say they think they know
Exactly so
How am I the only one who sees us fight?
What are we? Who are they?
Who says those bastards don't deserve to pay?
We don't stand a chance
So long as they're around
You're just another song and dance
Still I'm the only one who seems to care
You might also like
It's funny being funny
Makes you feel like up and running
When your past lingers like rain clouds
Casting shadows below
I could live with so many burdens
I'll take all your hope and yearning
But there's no way I won't take me
For their petty little woes
Once I had a love to show
A love they know
So slow that they never know
Where I go
How am I the only one who sees us fight?
What are we? Who are they?
Who says those bastards don't deserve to pay?
We don't stand a chance
So long as they're around
You're just another song and dance
Still I'm the only one who seems to care
I know that it's always something
I'm just working with what I've been given
How am I the only one who sees us fight?
What are we? Who are they?
Who says those bastards don't deserve to pay?
We don't stand a chance
So long as they're around
You're just another song and dance
'Cause when all it's all said and done
I always believed we were
But now I'm not so sure
I drink a gin and take a couple of my pills
Then my parade will give you chills
I know we've had enough
You should go if you want to
Well I've made so many messes
And this love has grown so restless
Your whole life's been nothing but this
I won't let you go loveless
I'm so self loathing that it's hard for me to see
Reality from what I dream
Now no one believes me
You might also like
My brain is racing and I feel like I'll explode
You're looking at me from below
This world wasn't made for you
Just go find someone new
You should go if you want to
Well I've made so many messes
And this love has grown so restless
Your whole life's been nothing but this
I won't let you go loveless
Why do I keep hounding on this suffering?
No wind in the sails until I'm fully recovering
You should go if you want to
Well I've made so many messes
And this love has grown so restless
Your whole life's been nothing but this
I won't let you go loveless
You're over the money but under the gun
At least the party's over
Where all your friends have gone to
Tell me I'm so damn perfect
Tell me it all of the time
Tell me I'm so damn perfect
Tell me it all of the time
Thank you!
(And thank you again!)
You're my very best-friend
It's not like you asked me if our night had to end at one of my brother's parties
When the face is a mirror of flattering youth
And all of the work that you say that you'll do
You've barely even started
Can't you...
Tell me I'm so damn perfect
Tell me it all of the time
Tell me I'm so damn perfect
Tell me it all of the time
Thank you!
That's how it feels when you know that something's wrong
Then you came along like a swan off of the lake
You flew across my eyes and out into space
And I ran and I crawled and I chased to get a taste
That's what I did
If there's just one thing you got to remember
Is to write down your name and your phone number
That way I'll have it and we'll make something out of this mess
And if all else fails then the ship won't set sail
God forbid but I guess the both of us will bail
Have you seen me cry
Tears like diamonds?
Down and down they fly
Faster and faster
Like the speed of our love
Batting a thousand but a home-run crack at love
This is where I tell you that
I know love's what I need to work at
You might also likeSo now the two of us rely on each other
With our premonitions out in the gutter
Who would have thought that I'd make it this far?
I'll make it seem like I'm stronger but I'm quite the actor
And now I'm so caught up and I can't escape this pattern
Have you seen me cry
Tears like diamonds?
Down and down they fly
Faster and faster
Like the speed of our love
Batting a thousand but a home-run crack at love
This is where I tell you that
I know love's what I need to work at
Have you seen me cry
Tears like diamonds?
Down and down they fly
Faster and faster
Like the speed of our love
Batting a thousand but a home-run crack at love
This is where I tell you that
I know love's what I need to work at
I'll follow you and you'll follow me
My fabrics mystery
I'll wave your loyalty in the freezing
Breeze so desperately
And another one comes down
And another one comes down
And another one comes down
I think I see my life
He bows all slyly and gentle-like
He's never had the right
I've never lived without
His sad and jealous eyes
And another one comes down
And another one comes down
And another one comes down
They'd say
Let your love grow tall
Let your love grow tall
Tall as the grass in the meadow?
Or the dunes on the shore?
Like the buildings in the city?
And your children on the floor?
You might also like
But it's the thought that counts
Quiet minds don't know their worth
They know what to do
So I'll pray for them and I'll pray for you
Till my face turns blue
And another one comes down
And another one comes down
And another one comes down
They'd say
Let your love grow tall
Let your love grow tall
Tall as the grass in the meadow?
Or the dunes on the shore?
Like the buildings in the city?
And your children on the floor?
Like the darkness in the forest?
Like my frightened worried eyes?
Or the roots in the soil?
How many years do you wait?
The flickering light's just a flame
I've been away for so many years
But I guess I'll just wait a bit longer
I'll stay 'til they open the gates
All my life I stay here waiting
Feel as though there's nothing up there but
One day you came out of nowhere
1985 was a good year
The sky broke apart then you appeared
Lifted off the ground
I took your hands and pulled you down
Because 1985 was a good year
You might also like
How many days went to waste?
Now the rain and the thunder are clashing
The Sun's got a smile 'cross the face
I fight so hard and come back beaten
Soared through a sliver of space
All my life I stay here waiting
Feel as though there's nothing up there but
One day you came out of nowhere
1985 was a good year
The sky broke apart then you appeared
Lifted off the ground
I took your hands and pulled you down
Because 1985 was a good year
Lifted up
Lift us back to the sky and the world above
Lifted up
Lifted up
1985 was a good year
The sky broke apart then you appeared
Lifted off the ground
I took your hands and pulled you down
Because 1985 was a good year
 the walls came crumbling
 I can tell what you've been thinking
And the mountains are peaking
And the flowers are blooming
And the meadows are rolling
Into waves that rush upon the shore
And barely touch your toes
The clouds are crowding 'round us
And I said
Then you lifted your hands and prayed
Go away
You can come back some other day
But they stayed
And you soaked under all of the grey
And the rain
Washed all our cries and pleas away
Now the season is changing
And the leaves now are turning
And the birds aren't singing
And the grass isn't green anymore
Than it used to be when the sunbeams lit it up
And the clouds are crowding 'round us just to say they've had enough
And I said
You might also like
Then you lifted your hands and prayed
Go away
You can come back some other day
But they stayed
And you soaked under all of the grey
And the rain
Washed all our cries and pleas away
And now the current takes us out and all the ripples turn to waves
The wind begins caressing all the branches to a sway
The air shattered like glass and fell like crystals on your face
Then I said
Then you lifted your hands and prayed
Go away
You can come back some other day
But they stayed
And you soaked under all of the grey
And the rain
We want a selfless love that we can always say we trust  oh
Love has always been a mockery
Of those in love and scared to be lonely
Don't want to love  don't want to hurt
If all that loneliness requires just another's comfort
Better off being all on your own
There's a beauty in being alone
Today we're arguing it's not worth making
Another person as just yours for the taking
All your hoping and praying
Won't do more than saying that
Love is just greed
It's almost taken me
But now I can see
Love is just greed
A selfish little need
You follow or you lead
If we really love ourselves
How do you love somebody else?
You might also like
A love to us  a love to them
It's just a history repeating itself time and time again
Love is not a veil to hide your voids
All this talk of love just turns to noise
So you want love  a love so tough
That even all its truths don't seem as though they're adding up  oh
Haven't you already had enough?
What's this suffering remind you of?
Someday we'll all agree it's not worth making
Another person as yours just for the taking
All your hoping and praying
Won't do more than saying that
Love is just greed
It's almost taken me
But now I can see
Love is just greed
A selfish little need
You follow or you lead
If we really love ourselves
How do you love somebody else?
A love all gone is just another story
Honey could you put your arms around me so
Tell me things about you that I wouldn't know
And tell me that you love me like you do
And maybe I will too
Love is just greed
It's almost taken me
But now I can see
Love is just greed
A selfish little need
You follow or you lead
If we really love ourselves
These puddled clouds
Oh I  I understand now
But darkness falls like shattered pieces
Dangling  shimmering
Torn and tattered yet crowned
You must believe to hear me sing these
Messy morsels of my self-assuring love
Oh  it's painful kneading
Yes  I lie and I wrangle with prospective angles
That glare me down and face me
With all I do wrong
Why do they all look like me?
So I try and I scream and I beg and I sigh
Just to prove I'm alive  and it's alright
Cause tonight there's a way I'll make light
Of my treacherous life
If I had hands I'd hold up high
My lofty dreams  my alibi's real name
But I have no strength
You might also likeSo I toss and I turn and I spit in the urn
There's a ghost in your eye
There is someone that knows more than I
But I'm quick to deny
So I try and I scream and I beg and I sigh
Just to prove I'm alive  and it's alright
Cause tonight there's a way I'll make light
Of my treacherous life
He said he didn't mean no harm
His past checkered like checkerboards in Central Park
You do good in the light and the bad in the dark
They're all I see
You mirrored sea
Leave me be
Born with a chance that everybody takes
With all risk and hardly any reward
Slip-ups in this town are like a sentence to life
Like overheard insults or a cheating wife

They're all I see
You mirrored sea
Leave me be
They're all I see
You mirrored sea
Your flowers are withering
Your mother's gone missing
Your leaves have drifted away
But the clouds are clearing up
And I've come reveling
Burning incandescently
Like a bastard on the burning sea
You're just like your father
Buried deep under the water
You're resting on your laurels
And stepping on my toes
Whose side are you on?
What side is this anyway?
Put down your sword and crown
Come lay with me on the ground
You come beating like moth's wings
Spastic and violently
Whipping me into a storm
Shaking me down to the core
But you run away from me
And you left me shimmering
Like diamond wedding rings
Spinning dizzily down on the floor

Put down your sword and crown
We treaded water underneath the ocean's skin
And then he washed away my sins
He held me closer as the tide was coming in
What would it mean?
All the love I need
All along he elevated
He stayed put while I was wandering
Gone so long he started wondering
My brother taught me how to give
He spreads his love until it stretches too thin
Oh how I wanna be like him
He takes away the weight before your heart caves in
What would it mean?
All the love I need
All along he elevated
He stayed put while I was wandering

Gone so long he started wondering
Trapped between the walls of her own home
Don't once think that this madness is my fault alone
Now a nightmare's in the hands
Still everyday's another chance
Let's get married (Oh-oh-oh-oh)
I'll buy a ring and then we'll (Oh-oh-oh-oh)
Consecrate this messy love
Spinning wildly
'Til I finally realize how busy I am
We're both so broken
And our long hoping is that we'll stumble upon our love again

Surrounded by angels
Floating atop of the sea
On bended knee
Don't go where they go
Don't sing all the songs they sing
Nobody knows you
The way you know you
But I think I do

But I think I do
Between these walls
Her bark-stripped limbs
Casts shadows frighteningly tall
I slow to a crawl
I jump and I yell
And she hears nothing at all

The current has pulled me in
The tide has reached my chin
My seaweed tickled skin
Just let the water win
I'm freezing to the bone
You'll never feel at home
Just watch your body go
Just watch your body go
Nobody knows you
The way you know you
But I think I do
Nobody knows you

Like stars burning holes right through the dark
Flicking fire like saltwater into my eyes

They couldn't think of something to say the day you burst
With all their lions and all their might and all their thirst
They crowd your bedroom like some thoughts wearing thin
My beard grew down to the floor and out through the doors
Whenever I'm at rest
I'm wound up tighter than
A dried up birds nest
That's always the issue
But when it starts getting blurry
One's never better than two
There's a place in this world
Where people like me are found by people like you
So find a place as this forever divine
You'll always smile upon me when the season's bad
You'll always make me feel best even when I'm blue
You'll always smile upon me and I'll smile upon you too
I don't know what I need now
Since everything has changed
But if I did know one thing
It's me who's feeling strange
'Cause everything is different
And I don't react well
To changes that come when
Your life's becoming hell

But now you sing
With your voice like an angel attached to a broad pair of wings
But that’s the point
Because once we joined
The crowd started screaming and we couldn’t hear over the noise you spoke and said—
That would look like the others
The truths and the liars that were holding us both to the flames
And it’s so divine
Because the pain
And the time it takes to end all of the talking
And finally meet on a plane
And up there somewhere
And up there somewhere

 some new building will scrape the sky
 I can feel the ladder clearly
 I was outside Penn Station selling red and white carnations
 my wife and I
 but the market cuts a loss
 there's not so much to ask
 my mother-in-law came just to stay a couple nights
 now the accounts are overdrawn
 you'll cook dinner for the neighbors and their kids
 I'm down on both bad knees
 they say to take it slow
 cause I want it all
 pretending no one knows
 and sing 'em all night long
Now they're my home
Now here I cannot feel the wind
Can't feel the rain or cold
And I believe in gentle harmony
How I loathe all this obscenity
Is this the way my life has got to be?
Have I a single opportunity?
Now I'm dreaming somebody would swiftly come and kidnap me
Everyday I lie awake and pray to God today's the day
And all at once I feel this
It reels and calls me towards it
Confounding destiny

To tell me how to live next to your potpourri
All this talking pulls my teeth
I believed in you so you'd believe in
You dared me in the dark
I felt a hush fall quietly from my spark
So now I hide in piles
Of princely orange peels
It feels the way you told me
How it'd always feel
Once I had a name to claim
I scraped on all the walls
Like an orthodox saint
I wish for the same old things
That turned me inside out
Keeling in such pain
It's a game

Fight your war wrapped up in a blanket on your living room floor
What you need?
Because I am letting you down
I was just trying to turn it around
Because I made it to the other side
Our bodies rose and went with the tide
The sun beat down on me when I lost you
What use?
What more can you dwell on just to seek an excuse
Don't you cry -- don't you place yourself above it because you won't try
It really ain't a dream
Wish you knew -- wish you knew I still love you and could control what I do

Let the wind sing us our love songs
As we sift within your sands
Don't answer any prayers they have
Just lift our callous hearts
With the bursting rays of August
 yeah they get you too
 it puts you in the mood
 I can see it on your face
 let's go 'til we can't anymore
 let's go 'til we fall to the floor
 you don't need to tell me

 we can barely sleep
 take the time to try
 break this barren shell
 let's go 'til we can't anymore

Though the world around you is crumbling
And the truth bleak as a bee
I won't let them destroy these dreams
They're just things
Silly little things
They're only things
I think we'll be alright

Where I come from
You say things will be well and fun
Though the world around you is crumbling

Like to throw it around
I was lost  now I'm found
I put my hands in the air
And my knees to the ground  yeah
The pieces of the all
That I could only hold  yeah
I could never say what you want me to say
I've got somebody else
Just to keep me on my toes again
I can barely stand
When you're coming too close
I get caught up in your heartstrings
Way up  where another sky hangs
I'll take all that I can get
Just don't make me go
Go go
Was it here? Was it there?
Was it swirling around us in the atmosphere?
Is it us? Is it them?
It's the ones plucking the petals
'til we're left with the stem
The people push it forward
My body can't afford it
I step up and take it
But I fall to the side

But a solemn warmth draws near
And with a gentle touch of these burdens
And such fears are wiped clear (Oh-oh-oh-oh)
Who says you ought to stay?
How's this the easier way?
It's far from giving up
Cowards never say enough is enough (Is enough)
And then I'm lifted up
Out of the crimson tub
The bath begins to drain
And from the floor he prays away all my pain
Who says that God exists?
All the things you can't control
Should never destroy the love one holds

Always circling

Getting tangled in the lights
