lyrics
"Get to do something I love
And I make it home every evening
To an angel God sent from above
Got an eight point on camera from last year
That this season looks like a ten
I got a barn with a fridge full of cold beer
On the weekend it's full of good friends
I know I'm a lucky man  but I ain't sure why I am
'Cause it ain't like anyone deserves the world in the palm of their hand
Now I hit my knees  thankful as can be
But the one thing I can't get over
How'd a guy like me  who'd have been fine with three
Wind up with a five-leaf clover?
I got a half ton that's parked in the driveway
My dog wags his tail when he hears
I grew up in a good place to be from
My folks still got a bunch of good years
Now I know I'm a lucky man  but I ain't sure why I am
'Cause it ain't like anyone deserves the world in the palm of their hand
Now I hit my knees  thankful as can be
But the one thing I can't get over
How'd a guy like me  who'd have been fine with three
Wind up with a five-leaf clover?

How'd a guy like me  who'd have been fine with three
Wind up with a five-leaf clover?
How'd a guy like me  who could've wound up with weeds
Wednesday when we got our buzz on for second hand six pack
And when I fought that cough off everyone else thought I was so damn cool
But my head was spinnin' like a Tilt-A-Whirl
Yeah man  it really rocked my world
Back when everything seemed just a little bit stronger
Back when the weekend lasted a little longer
I can't tell you why they did  but things seemed to never end back then
Oh way back when  when a little went a long way
One girl  45 bucks was all it took that night
Hit the steakhouse makeout and the movies way up in the back
Credits roll on pace to make it all the way to second base
Tried to play it cool like it was nothin' new and she didn't have a clue
But my head was spinnin' like a Tilt-A-Whirl
Yeah man  she really rocked my world

Oh way back when  when a little went a long long way
Down the same old dead-end highway
Riding that storm running through my veins
Like a shot down tailspun airplane
Scared of nothing and I'm scared to death
I can't breathe and I catch my breath
But I keep chasing that same old devil
Down the same old dead-end highway
Ain't no love in Oklahoma
Just the whistle of a lone black train
You'll know when it's coming for ya
Riding in on the wind and rain
I got saved in the same Red River
The same Red River tryna drown me
With the whole world falling all around me
So I keep chasing that same old devil
Down thе same old dead-end highway

You walking in here
Wearing just what you know makes me weak
And I'm already ordering you a drink
Gonna get out of here
Just like the last time and the time before
We're at your house and through the door
And we're falling all over again
Like a flashback to way back when
Back when we were us
Couldn't get enough
But we both know how this ends
You can leave it up to me
To say things that I don't mean
And I'll leave it up to you
To turn I love you
And just like that
Just as fast as we began
We're all over again
I'll think you're out of my system
At least 'til I miss ya
I'll start going through withdrawals
That's about the time you'll call

Just as fast as we began

Didn't see no use in sticking around
I was green and busting at the seams to leave
Traded that county maintain for a four lane city street
But sometimes things ain't what you think they're gonna be
What you want ain't always what you need
Don't know what you got 'til it's gone
And you're out on your own
All you want is what you can't get back
Don't hold a candle to what you had
Sometimes what you think you'll find
It ain't quite what real life has in store
So be careful what you wish for
She was holding on just a little too tight
Talked a little too much about the rest of our lives
I broke her heart thinking freedom would set me free

Our daddies drank draft at the local bar
With an achin' back just like old Granddad did
And we like cold keg beer and fixin' up trucks
Old bird dogs and the woman we love
Maxwell House steamin' out of a coffee cup
Carolina to California up to Illinois
Blue collar boys
We're the white paint peeling off a picket fence
The rust stains covering a Craftsman wrench
When the sun's coming up you can bet we're clocking in

Maybe I waited too long
Maybe I played my cards wrong
Oh  just a little bit wrong
Baby I apologize for it
I could fall  or I could fly

And I could live  I could die
Hangin' on the words you say
And I've been known to give my all
And jumpin' in harder than

So don't call me baby
Unless you mean it
Don't tell me you need me
If you don't believe it
So let me know the truth
Before I dive right into you
You're a mystery

And there's no other girl like you

Do you have a tendency to lead some people on?

But I was hell on wheels with a full head of steam
When coach put me in
And I'm still proud of that hit
I was a last resort to go to prom with the queen
Thanks to an ex-boyfriend who broke her heart that week
But I still felt like a king
And that might not mean much to you
But it does to me
So say I'm a middle of the road
Not much to show
But I'm a hell of a lover
A damn good brother
And I wear this heart on my sleeve
And that might not mean much to you
But it does to me
I was the one phone call when my brother went to jail
Pawned my guitar just to pay his bail
But I'm okay with that
I was the first man standing next to my best friend
The day the love of his life said I do to him
I was a couple beers deep
But I still remembered that speech

What was growing up like?
Where'd you go to school?
And what would you do if you weren't doin' this?
I'd have a Friday night crowd in the palm of my hand
Singin' them same damn songs like I am now
I'd be feelin' on fire on a hardwood stage
Bright lights like lightning runnin' through my veins
At the Grand Ole Opry or a show in some no-name town
I'd still be doin' this if I weren't doin' this
I'd still be the same guy they knew back in the day
Who was burnin' CD's just to give away
Payin' his dues
If I wasn't doin' this
Hot on the heels of my neon dreams maybe comin' true
Livin' this life just like I was born to do

Someone asked me once in an interview
What was growing up like?
Where'd you go to school?
Keep me safe 'cause there's monsters right outside
Daddy  please don't go  I don't wanna be alone
'Cause the second that you're gone they're gonna know
Before he went to bed he grabbed my hand and said
Just 'cause I'm leavin'
It don't mean that I won't be right by your side
When you need me
And you can't see me in the middle of the night
Just close your eyes and say a prayer
It's okay  I know you're scared when I'm not here
But I'll always be right there
Even though I'm leavin'  I ain't goin' nowhere
Dad  we'll be late  and Uncle Sam don't like to wait
He's got a big old plane that's gonna take me far away
I know I act tough  but there's a churnin' in my gut
'Cause I just can't call you up when things get rough
Before I left  he hugged my neck and said

Maybe we make a deal
Maybe together we can get somewhere
Any place is better
Maybe we'll make something
You got a fast car
And I got a plan to get us out of here
I've been workin' at the convenience store
Managed to save just a little bit of money
Won't have to drive too far
Just across thе border and into the city
And you and I can both get jobs
Finally see what it mеans to be livin'

You still ain't got a job

And we'll move out of the shelter

I got a job that pays all our bills
You stay out drinking late at the bar

I'd always hoped for better
Thought maybe together you and me would find it
Take your fast car and keep on driving
City lights lay out before us and your arm felt nice wrapped around my shoulder
And I had a feeling that I belonged
You got a fast car
Is it fast enough so we can fly away?
Still gotta make a decision
A good truck's got maybe three hundred thousand
You only get so much until it's gone
Duracells in a Maglite
A needle drop on a forty-five
Are the kinda things that only last so long
They say nothing lasts forever
But they ain't seen us together
Or the way the moonlight dances in your eyes
Just a T-shirt in the kitchen
With no make-up and a million
Other things that I could look at my whole life
A love like that makes a man have second thoughts
Maybe some things last forever after all
The FM station on the outskirts
Blue jeans after years of shift work
All fadin' out like I always knew they would
The strings on this guitar
The first love lost on a young heart
Those things are gonna break after the getting's good

 they come and then they go
I've got a wild card  that I keep inside my boot
I've been thinkin' lately maybe I should save it
'Cause them hangovers sure kick my ass these days
So I spend most my happy hours here at home
In the middle of growin' up and gettin' old
But I can still raise hell all night with the boys when I want to
Lay that hammer down to see how fast she'll go
But these days I hang my hat on what I won't do

The coldest beer you'd ever drink

You should've seen a midnight rodeo

When they line dance to Copperhead Road

Then you rolled in with your hair in the wind
I was doin' alright but just your sight
Had my heart stormin’
You wrecked my whole world when you came
And hit me like a hurricane
You hit me like a hurricane
Knew it was gonna be a long night
From the moment when
We locked eyes over whiskey on ice
Started talkin' 'bout us again
If I woulda just laid my drink down
And walked out
I wouldn't be in my truck
Driving us to your house

Blew me away

I just thought I'd tell you now so down the road you're
All good to go through the highs and lows and all life's up and downs
In case I ain't around
Make sure y'all all still eat together at your Mama's after church Sunday

Gonna pick up some clay on the tread of these tires
Have ourselves a hell of a night
Look up in that Carolina sky
Like an old sweet song daddy used to play
And it takes me back to a simpler place and time
When we used to kick back
And let the moonshine
So let the moonshine
It's been a long time since we felt that creek
Runnin' cold and clear over our bare feet
Is the same water my ol' man used in his still
I still remember what he used to say
Like an old sweet song daddy used to play
And it takes me back to a simpler place and time

Seems a little stiff for 2 PM
Holler if you need anything
I've got an ear to lend
I'll be right here cuttin' limes
Countin' cash and stockin' beers
I've got an idea what's on your mind
So in the meantime  think on this
I've seen girls like you in here before
Watched broken hearts break
Through that door a time or two
And I'll bet he packed all his things
You set out to curse his name and have a few
And I'll bet you're doin' your best to move on
Well  you're not the only lonely one
This ain't my first rodeo
I've seen the other side of this bar
Pourin' salts on an open wound
Sittin' right there where you are
And I know it probably stings right now
Somehow more than that Jim Beam
But that clock on the wall will cure it all
Even though that ain't how it seems

I’d be in pieces trying to make the breaking last
If it took one look to turn my days to night
At least I'd have the stars that sparkle in your eyes
There's just some things that leave a man no choice
Like a compass needle needing its true North
Even if I knew the day we met you’d be the reason this heart breaks

Is there ain't words been made could shoulder so much weight

Not a thing about the way I feel would change

About 2AM to catch us some trout
That's when I saw that car pull up
He said boys I don't care that you're way out here
But you look a little young for all that beer
Boys you're dealin' with the county sheriff
So I said we can share if you want to
So buddy won't you?
Take a sip and help us finish shit tonight
I ain't givin' you an attitude
But I can tell you're in a bad mood
Just a little bit will have you feelin' just right

So I sat down and wrote this song
Giving hugs and shaking hands
Just how long this thing goes
But there'll be crowds and there'll be shows
And there will be light after dark
Some day when we aren't six feet apart
First thing that I'm gonna do
Slide on in some corner booth
And take the whole damn family out
Buy my buddies all a round
Pay some extra on the tab
Watch a ball game from the stands
Probably over-wash my hands

He thinks he’s learning fishing from the man that taught Bill Dance
And I think as I untangle it and put it in his hands
I hope he never finds out that I didn't hang the moon
