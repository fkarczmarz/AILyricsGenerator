lyrics
"Put your motherfuckin' hands up and follow me!
Everybody from the 313
Put your motherfuckin' hands up! Look  look
Now  while he stands tough
Notice that this man did not have his hands up
This Free World's got you gassed up
Now  who's afraid of the Big Bad Wolf?
This guy ain't no motherfuckin' MC
I know everything he's 'bout to say against me
I am white  I am a fucking bum
I do live in a trailer with my mom
My boy Future is an Uncle Tom
I do got a dumb friend named Cheddar Bob
Who shoots himself in his leg with his own gun
I did get jumped by all six of you chumps
And Wink did fuck my girl
I'm still standin' here screaming  Fuck the Free World!
Don't ever try to judge me  dude
You don't know what the fuck I've been through
But I know something about you
You went to Cranbrook  that's a private school
What's the matter  dawg? You embarrassed?
This guy's a gangster? His real name's Clarence
And Clarence lives at home with both parents
And Clarence' parents have a real good marriage
This guy don't wanna battle  he's shook
'Cause ain't no such things as halfway crooks
He's scared to death  he's scared to look
At his fucking yearbook  fuck Cranbrook!
Fuck a beat  I'll go acappella
Fuck everybody! Fuck y'all if you doubt me!
I'm a piece of fucking white trash  I say it proudly
Here  tell these people something they don't know about me
You might also like
Tried everything to get my mind off you  it won't work
All it takes is one song on the radio  you're
Right back on it  reminding me all over again how you fuckin' just brushed me off and left me so burnt
Spent a lot of time tryna soul search
Maybe I needed to grow up a little first
Well  looks like I hit a growth spurt
But I'm coming for closure
Don't suppose an explanation I'm owed
For the way that you turned your back on me
Just when I may have needed you most
Oh  you thought it was over?
You could just close the
Chapter and go about your life like it was nothing
You ruined mine  but you seem to be doin' fine
Well  I've never recovered
But tonight  bet you that what you're
'Bout to go through's tougher than anything I ever have suffered
Can't think of a better way to define poetic justice
Hide the shovel and then drive off in the sunset
You might also like
I flee the scene (The scene) like it was my last ride
You see right through (Right through)
Oh  you had me pegged the first time
You can see the truth (The truth)
But it's easier to justify what's bad is good
And I hate to be the bad guy (The bad guy)
I just hate to be the bad guy (The bad guy)
I just hate to be the bad–
And to think I used to think you was the shit  bitch
To think it was you at one time I worshipped? Shit
Think you can hurt people and just keep getting away with it?
Thought some time would pass and I'd forget it? Forget it
You left our family in shambles
You expect me to just get over him  pretend he never existed?
May be gone but he's not forgotten
And don't think 'cause he's been out the picture so long that I've stopped the plotting and still ain't coming to get ya
You're wrong and that shit was rotten
And the way you played him's same shit you did to me  cold
Have you any idea the shit that I've gone through?
Feelings I harbor? All this pent-up resentment I hold on to?
Not once you call to ask me how I'm doing
Letters  you don't respond to 'em
Fuck it  I'm coming to see you
And gee  who better to talk to than you?
The cause of my problems
My life is garbage  and I'm 'bout to take it out on ya
I flee the scene (The scene) like it was my last ride
You see right through (Right through)
Oh  you had me pegged the first time
You can see the truth (The truth)
But it's easier to justify what's bad is good
And I hate to be the bad guy (The bad guy)
I just hate to be the bad guy (The bad guy)
I just hate to be the bad guy
I've been drivin' around your side of this town
Like nine frickin' hours and forty-five minutes now
Feel like I've been waitin' on this moment all of my life
And it's now arrived and my mouth is full of saliva
My knife is out and I'm duckin' on the side of your house
See  it's sad it came to this point
Such a disappointment I had to make this appointment
To come and see ya  but I ain't here for your empathy
I don't need your apology or your friendship or sympathy
It's revenge that I seek
So I sneak vengefully  and treat your bedroom window
Like I reach my full potential—I peeked (Haha)
Tapping the glass lightly then start to crescendo  sneak
All the way 'round to the back porch
You don't plan for intruders beforehand?
Surprised to see me? Cat got your tongue?
Like you picked an axe up and swung  stick to the core plan
Dragged to the back of a trunk by one of your fans
And here's your Bronco hat  you can have that shit back 'cause they suck
We're in a car right now—wait  here comes my favorite lyric
I'm the bad guy who makes fun of people that die
And hey  here's a sequel to my Mathers LP just to try to get people to buy
How's this for a publicity stunt? This should be fun
Last album now 'cause after this you'll be officially done
Eminem killed by M and M  Matthew Mitchell
Bitch  I even have your initials
I initially was gonna bury you next to my brother  but fuck it
Two more exits  time is quite near
Hope we don't get stopped  no license I fear
That sirens I hear?
Guess ninety on the freeway wasn't the brightest idea
As cops appear in my driver's side mirror
(Oh  God! Police! Agh!)
Hope Foxtrot gets an aerial shot of your burial plot  at least
New plan  Stan!
Slim: Chauvinist pig drove in this big Lincoln Town Car
And Frank Ocean  oh  hope you can swim good
Now say you hate homos again!

I also represent anyone on the receiving end of those jokes you offend
I'm the nightmare you fell asleep and then woke up still in
I'm your karma closin' in with each stroke of a pen
Perfect time to have some remorse to show for your sin
When they say all of this is approaching its end
But you refuse to believe that it's over  here we go all over again
Back's to the wall  I'm stackin' up all them odds
But in my head there's a voice in the back and it hollers
After the track is demolished
I am your lack of a conscience
I'm the ringing in your ears
I'm the polyps on the back of your tonsils
Eating your vocal cords after your concerts
I'm your time that's almost up that you haven't acknowledged
Grab for some water
But I'm that pill that's too jagged to swallow
I'm the bullies you hate that you became with every faggot you slaughtered comin' back on ya
I represent everything you take for granted
'Cause Marshall Mathers  the rapper's persona
Is half a facade  and Matthew and Stan's just symbolic
Of you not knowin' what you had 'til it's gone
'Cause after all the glitz and the glam
No more fans that are calling your name
I'm the hindsight to say  I told you so!
Foreshadows of all the things that are to follow
I'm the future that's here to show you what happens tomorrow
If you don't stop after they call ya
Biggest laughing stock of rap who can't call it quits
When it's time to walk away  I'm every guilt trip
The baggage you have  but as you gather up all your possessions
If there's anything you have left to say
'Less it makes an impact then don't bother
So 'fore you rest your case better make sure you're packing a wallop (A wallop)
'Fore it fades into black and it's all over
Behold the final chapter in a saga
Tryna recapture that lightning trapped in a bottle
Twice  the magic that started it all
Tragic portrait of an artist tortured
Trapped in his own drawings
Tap into thoughts blacker and darker than anything imaginable 
Here goes a wild stab in the dark
I've been too long on my own
Everybody has a private world where they can be alone
Are you calling me?
Are you tryin' to get through?
Are you reaching out for me?
I'm reaching out for you
I'm just so fucking depressed
I just can't seem to get out this slump
If I could just get over this hump
But I need something to pull me out this dump
Fell down then I got right back up
But I need that spark to get psyched back up
In order for me to pick the mic back up
I don't know how or why or when
I ended up in this position I'm in
I'm starting to feel distant again
So I decided just to pick this pen
Up and try to make an attempt
Or come to grips with the fact that
And I know some shit's so hard to swallow
But I just can't sit back and wallow
I'll be one tough act to follow
One tough act to follow
I'll be one tough act to follow
But you'd have to walk a thousand miles—
You might also like
What it's like to be me
Just to see what it'd be like to
Go inside each other's minds
Just to see what we find
Look at shit through each other's eyes
I think I'm startin' to lose my sense of humor
Everything's so tense and gloom
I almost feel like I gotta check the temperature
So I try to avoid any eye contact
For conversation like I want that
I'm not lookin' for extra attention
I just wanna be just like you
Blend in with the rest of the room
Maybe just point me to the closest restroom
I don't need no fuckin' man servant
Tryna follow me around and wipe my ass
Laugh at every single joke I crack
Unfortunately I am
I just hide behind the tears of a clown
So why don't you all sit down?
Listen to the tale I'm about to tell
And you ain't gotta walk no thousand miles—
What it's like to be me
Just to see what it'd be like to
Go inside each other's minds
Just to see what we find
Look at shit through each other's eyes
Nobody asked for life to deal us
With these bullshit hands we're dealt
We gotta take these cards ourselves
On my ass and pissed and moaned
Or take this situation in which I'm placed in
And get up and get my own
I was never the type of kid
To wait by the door and pack his bags
And sat on the porch and hoped and prayed
For a dad to show up who never did
I just wanted to fit in
I dreamed of being that cool kid
Even if it meant actin' stupid
Aunt Edna always told me:
'Til I stuck my tongue on that frozen
Stop sign pole at eight-years-old
Tryin' to impress my friends no mo'
But I already told you my whole life story
Not just based on my description
'Cause where you see it from where you're sittin'
It's probably a 110% different
I guess we would have to walk a
Mile in each other's shoes at least
What size you wear? I wear 10's
Let's see if you can fit your feet—
What it's like to be me
Just to see what it'd be like to
Go inside each other's minds
Just to see what we find
Look at shit through each other's eyes
Lately I've been hard to reach
I've been too long on my own (Oh)
Everybody has a private world
Where they can be alone (So)
Are you calling me?
Are you tryin' to get through? (Oh)
Are you reaching out for me?
I'm reaching out for you (So)
Yeah
To my babies:
Stay strong
Your Dad'll be home soon
And to the rest of the world:
God gave you shoes
To fit you
So put 'em on and wear 'em
Be proud of who you are
Even if it sounds corny
Don't never let no one tell you
Let's take it back to straight hip-hop and start it from scratch
I'm 'bout to bloody this track up  everybody get back
That's why my pen needs a pad  'cause my rhymes on the rag
Just like I did with addiction  I'm 'bout to kick it
Like a magician  critics I turn to crickets
Got 'em still on the fence whether to picket
But quick to get it impaled when I tell 'em  Stick it!
Let's bring it back to that vintage Slim  bitch!
The art of MCing mixed with da Vinci and MC Ren
And I don't mean Stimpy's friend  bitch
Been Public Enemy since you thought PE was gym  bitch
Kick your shoes off  let your hair down
(And go berserk) All night long
Grow your beard out  just weird out
(And go berserk) All night long
We're gonna rock this house until we knock it down
So turn the volume loud
'Cause it's mayhem 'til the A.M
And let yourself go  let yourself go
Say  Fuck it! before we kick the bucket
Life's too short to not go for broke
So everybody  everybody (Go berserk)
Grab your vial  yeah

Guess it's just the way that I'm dressed  ain't it?
Khakis pressed  Nike shoes crispy and fresh laced
So I guess it ain't that aftershave
Or cologne that made 'em just faint
Plus I showed up with a coat fresher than wet paint
So if love is a chess game  check mate
Yes siree 'Bob'  I was thinking the same thang
Got your gal blowin' up a valve  v-v-valve-valve
At least I know that I don't know
Question is  are you bozos smart enough to feel stupid?
Hope so  now ho
Kick your shoes off  let your hair down
(And go berserk) All night long
Grow your beard out  just weird out
(And go berserk) All night long
We're gonna rock this house until we knock it down
So turn the volume loud
'Cause it's mayhem 'til the A.M
So crank the bass up like crazy
And let yourself go  let yourself go
Say  Fuck it! before we kick the bucket
Life's too short to not go for broke
So everybody  everybody (Go berzerk)
Get your vinyls
And they say that love is powerful as cough syrup in styrofoam
All I know is I fell asleep and woke up in that Monte Carlo
Sorry  yo—we done both set the bar low
Far as hard drugs are though  that's the past
But I done did enough codeine to knock Future into tomorrow
And girl  I ain't got no money to borrow
But I am tryin' to find a way to get you alone: car note
Oh  Marshall Mathers
Shithead with a potty mouth  get the bar of soap lathered
Kangol's and Carheartless Cargos
Girl  you're fixin' to get your heart broke
I ain't called anybody baby since Birdman  unless you're a swallow (Ha-ha!)
But don't get discouraged  girl
This is your jam  unless you got toe jam
Kick your shoes off  let your hair down
(And go berserk) All night long
Grow your beard out  just weird out
(And go berserk) All night long
We're gonna rock this house until we knock it down
So turn the volume loud
'Cause it's mayhem 'til the A.M
And let yourself go  let yourself go
Say  Fuck it! before we kick the bucket
Life's too short to not go for broke
So everybody  everybody (Go berserk)
Grab your vial  yeah
We're gonna rock this house until we knock it down
So turn the volume loud
'Cause it's mayhem 'til the A.M
So crank the bass up like crazy
And let yourself go  let yourself go
Say  Fuck it! before we kick the bucket
Life's too short to not go for broke
So everybody  everybody (Go berzerk)
I have no snare in my headphones
There you go
Yeah
Have you ever been hated or discriminated against?
Sick is the mind of the motherfuckin' kid that's behind
Keep kickin' ass in the morning and takin' names in the evenin'
Leave 'em with a taste as sour as vinegar in they mouth
Look at me now! I bet you're prolly sick of me now
I never meant to hurt you
I never meant to make you cry
But tonight I'm cleanin' out my closet (One more time!)
I never meant to hurt you
I never meant to make you cry
But tonight I'm cleanin' out my closet (Ha!)

I got some skeletons in my closet and I don't know if no one knows it
So before they throw me inside my coffin and close it
I'ma expose it  I'll take you back to '73
Before I ever had a multi-platinum-selling CD
My faggot father must've had his panties up in a bunch
But the smartest shit I did was take the bullets out of that gun
I never meant to hurt you
I never meant to make you cry
But tonight I'm cleanin' out my closet (One more time!)
I never meant to hurt you
I never meant to make you cry
But tonight I'm cleanin' out my closet (Uh)
Take a second to listen 'fore you think this record is dissin'
Witnessin' your mama poppin' prescription pills in the kitchen
Bitchin' that someone's always goin' through her purse and shit's missin'
My whole life I was made to believe I was sick when I wasn't
But how dare you try to take what you didn't help me to get?!
Remember when Ronnie died and you said you wished it was me? (Hehe)
I never meant to hurt you
I never meant to make you cry
But tonight I'm cleanin' out my closet (One more time!)
I never meant to hurt you
I never meant to make you cry
A lot of people think that what I say on a record
Or what I talk about on a record
That I actually do in real life or that I believe in it
Or if I say that I wanna kill somebody
That I'm actually gonna do it or that I believe in it
You know why? 'Cause I'm a criminal!
Criminal! You're goddamn right
My words are like a dagger with a jagged edge
How many records you expectin' to sell
After your second LP sends you directly to jail?
And a prostitute while my wife's sick in the hospital
You can't teach me a goddamn thing 'cause
I watch TV and Comcast cable
And you ain't able to stop these thoughts
You can't stop me from toppin' these charts
And you can't stop me from droppin' each March
With a brand new CD for these fuckin' retards (Duh)

It was a seed who would grow up just as crazy as she
But how the fuck you supposed to grow up when you weren't raised?
So as I got older and I got a lot taller
I drank more liquor to fuck you up quicker
Than you'd wanna fuck me up for sayin' the word—
My morals went *thhbbpp* when the president got oral
Sex in his Oval Office on top of his desk off of his own employee
I'm the bad guy who makes fun of people that die
In plane crashes and laughs as long as it ain't happenin' to him
-inem and Kim combined (The maniac's in)
In place of the Doctor 'cause Dre couldn't make it today
Don't make me kill him too and spray his brains all over the place
I'm a criminal!
EMINEM: Uh-huh
EMINEM: Aight
MEL-MAN: I'll be right here waitin' on you
EMINEM: Aight
EMINEM: What?!
MEL-MAN: Don't kill nobody this time
{*Whistling*} How you doin'?
TELLER: Okay
EMINEM: I said I'm not gonna fuckin' kill you
TELLER: Don't kill me!
EMINEM: Hurry the fuck up! {*Gunshot*} Thank you!
So I'll be disguised in it and if anybody identifies
Fire at the private eye hired to pry in my business
This puppy's lucky I didn't blast his ass yet
Tuck my dick in between my legs and cluck
You motherfuckin' chickens ain't brave enough
And if it's not a rapper that I make it as
I'ma be a fuckin' rapist in a Jason mask
I'm a criminal!
'Cause every time I write a rhyme these people think it's a crime

I don't wanna be alone in the darkness
I don't wanna be alone in the darkness
I don't wanna be alone in the darkness anymore
Here I am  alone again
Can't get out of this hole I'm in
It's like the walls are closin' in
You can't help me  no one can
I can feel these curtains closin'
I go to open 'em
But something pulls 'em closed again
Feels like I'm loathing in Las Vegas
Haven't got the vaguest why I'm so lost
But I'd make you this small wager
If I bet you I'll be in tomorrow's paper
Who would the odds favor?
I'm so much like my father  you would think that I knew him
One little taste  it'll do
Maybe I'll take it and snooze  then tear up the stage in a few
Fuck the Colt 45  I'ma need somethin' stronger
If I pop any caps  it better be off of vodka
Round after round after round  I'm gettin' loaded (Haha)
That's a lot of shots  huh? (Double entendre)

And I don't wanna be alone in the darkness (Yeah)
I don't wanna be alone in the darkness

Now I'm starin' at the room service menu off a benzo
I can hear the music continue to crescendo
I can see the whole fuckin' venue from my window
That's when you know you're schizo
'Cause I keep peekin' out the curtain from the hotel
The music is so loud
But it's almost as though I don't hear no sound
I should get ready for the show now
Wait  is this the whole crowd? I thought this shit was sold out
Then something told me relax
And just hope for the show to be packed
Don't wanna hit the stage before they fill each row to the max
'Cause that'd be totally wack
You can't murder a show nobody's at
But what if nobody shows? Panic mode
'Bout to snap and go motherfuckin' wacko at any second
'Bout to cancel the show just as fans below rush the entrance
Plan is a go to wreck shit  cameras in all directions
The press is 'bout to go ape shit  bananas on all the networks
Commando with extra clips  I got ammo for all the hecklers
Hit the ground and crawl to the dresser
Alcohol on my breath as I reach for the scope
(Hello darkness  my old friend)
I'm blackin' out  I'm all out of meds
With them benzodiazepines gone
Now it's just magazines sprawled out on the floor
And I don't wanna be alone in the darkness (Yeah)
I don't wanna be alone in the darkness
I don't wanna be alone in the darkness anymore
People start to show up  time to start the show up
It's 10:05 PM and the curtain starts to go up
And I'm already sweatin'  but I'm locked and loaded
For rapid fire spittin' for all the concert-goers
Scopes for sniper vision  surprise from out of nowhere
As I slide the clip in from inside the hotel
Leanin' out the window  going Keyser Söze
Finger on the trigger  but I'm a licensed owner
With no prior convictions  so law says sky's the limit
So my supply's infinite  strapped like I'm a soldier
Got 'em hopping over walls and climbing fences
Some of them John Travolta  staying alive by inches
Guess show time is over
No suicide note  just a note for target distance
But if you'd like to know the reason why I did this
You'll never find a motive  truth is I have no idea
I am just as stumped  no signs of mental illness
Just tryin' to show ya the reason why we're so fucked
'Cause by the time it's over  won't make the slightest difference
And I don't wanna be alone in the darkness
I don't wanna be alone in the darkness
I don't wanna be alone in the darkness anymore

Infected with SARS and Corona (Infected with SARS and Corona)
Like you took a bite off of that (You took a bite off of that  damn)
And it goes from martian to human (From martian to human  yeah)
That's how the virus attacks (That's how the virus attacks)
They come at me with machine guns (At me with machine guns  brr)
Like trying to fight off a gnat
Still stackin' my chips  hoes
Higher than Shaq on his tiptoes
Atop the Empire State Buildin'
This shit is like child's play  childrеn
I will anni-nihilate  kill them
I'll fuck around and pile еight million
I'll await my trial date 'til then (What?)
Ain't nothin' you say could ever trump (Nah)  mic  pencil get killed (Yeah)
If you're hypersensitive  I wasn't referencin' the vice president  chill (Chill)
I mean my penmanship at times tends to get ill  violence but with skill
That's why I hence when I write ends up with the mic and pencil gettin' killed (Haha  yeah  hold up)
And I'm still ride or die for the squad (Yeah)
So you know which side that I'm on
If a battle line's ever drawn  but if I get involved
It'll be like K9's in a brawl
But not similar to Mike Vick at all
'Cause even if I don't have a dog in the fight
They ain't never gonna get rid of the fight in the dog (Fight in the dog)
Got stripes like a tiger  so you might get mauled  a mic in the palms
Like claws  I can swing right for your jaw
And rip it off with one swipe of the paw
Bitch  you still on my dick or nah? (Nah)
If I suck  your wife is a straw (Straw)
I'm sick and I'm not gonna cover my mouth next time that I cough 'cause

So vocalistically (What?)  that's social distancing (Yeah)
Flow going viral  you best stay strapped
With that Lysol and get way back (Shh)
Get that Pine-Sol and that Ajax
'Cause this dry cough is just like football umpires callin' a playback
Bitch  back the fuck up like fifteen yards  these rhymes call for a face mask (Face mask)
'Nother fourteen-day quarantine  they're cordoning off everything
This shit lookin' like a horror scene  like me metaphorically (Damn)
'Cause them stay-at-home orders seem
Like they just keep getting more extreme
Who knows when this nightmare will end (Marilyn)? Like Monroe  Norma Jean (Norma Jean)
Still got that heroin lyrical drip with that morphine and that Thorazine
'Cause I'm so fuckin' dope (Dope) and you're a fiend
And that's the one thing that hasn't changed (Nope)
For some semblance of normalcy
But I might need that Hydrochloroquine 'cause I got that (Yeah)
The Dark Horse  I'm a knight-mare
Mom fed me Valium like air (Mmm)
Thought that's why they called it a high chair (Woah)
I got a contact like eyewear (Woah)
Wait a minute  bitch  let me lie here (Uh)
20/20 hindsight in my side mirror
Every year  you drop the ball like Times Square
My hair trigger whenever I get an idea's
Like  fuck  now my name rings out like a sponge mop
And my drip was a drop
In the bucket  so that gun shot
You just heard just now in that one spot
Just came from the nine mil' that I just got
That's big bucks and I got a full money clip and I'm loaded
I ain't even mean to go the fuck off
And I'm still totally inappropriate with an opiate
Groping it while I'm holding it like a trophy
I'm hoping a little codeine'll get me OD'in'
Woah  everything is slow  I begin to floating
I know that I'm getting loaded  the pen exploded
Hiroshima with the flows  a utopia
With the dope  I'm an OG  I'm like the G.O.A.T.​
Here to get your goat little bit of sodium  it's assault (A salt)
When I'm at the podium  at your throat  holy camoly
I'm in the zone with the shit I'm on
Get Imodium and a commode because nobody's even close
You're petroleum to plutonium  you're a phony
I'm at the crib with your ho
Got her at the pole like voting with no clothing
Stripped down to a toe ring and here we go with the gloating
I've got my nose in the air like a Boeing
Then I got into a little bit of an argument with her
So I took a little lick of a Klonopin at dinner
Then I hit her with the motherfucking ottoman and bit her
Then I shot her in the liver  delivered her to the bottom of the river (Dope)
But I'm probably gon' jump in the water with her
With a wad of money 'cause I got a lot of it
And when it come to drippin'  I be soppin' like a hundred mile an hour
Never runnin' out of either one of 'em  I gotta get it 'cause
They say these bars are like COVID (Bars are like COVID  what?)
You get 'em right off the bat (You get 'em right off the bat  yeah)
Infected with SARS and Corona (Infected with SARS and Corona)
Like you took a bite off of that (You took a bite off of that  damn)
And it goes from martian to human (From martian to human  yeah)
That's how the virus attacks (That's how the virus attacks)
They come at me with machine guns (At me with machine guns  brr)
I can swallow a bottle of alcohol and I'll feel like Godzilla
Better hit the deck like the card dealer
My whole squad's in here  walking around the party
A cross between a zombie apocalypse and B-Bobby The
Brain Heenan which is probably the
Same reason I wrestle with mania
Shady's in this bitch  I'm posse'd up
Consider it to cross me a costly mistake
If they sleepin' on me  the hoes better get insomnia
ADHD  Hydroxycut
Pass the Courvoisier (Hey  hey)
Laughing all the way to the bank  I spray flames
They cannot tame or placate the
Monster
You get in my way  I'ma feed you to the monster (Yeah)
When the moon shines like Ice Road Truckers
I look like a villain outta those blockbusters
Blood on the dance floor  and on the Louis V carpet

I'm in a mental hospital with a crystal ball
Tryna see  will I still be like this tomorrow?
Risperdal  voices whisper
My fist is balled back up against the wall  pencil drawn
This is just the song to go ballistic on
You just pulled a pistol on the guy with a missile launcher
I'm just a Loch Ness  the mythological
Quick to tell a bitch screw off like a fifth of vodka
When you twist the top of the bottle  I'm a
Monster

Blood on the dance floor  and on the Louis V carpet

If you never gave a damn (Ayy)  raise your hand
'Cause I'm about to set trip  vacation plans
I'm on point like my index is  so all you will ever get is
The motherfuckin' finger (Finger)  prostate exam ('Xam)
How can I have all these fans and perspire?
Like a liar's pants  I'm on fire
And I got no plans to retire and I'm still the man you admire
These chicks are spazzin' out  I only get more handsome and flyer
I got 'em passin' out like what you do when you hand someone flyers
And what goes around comes around just like the blades on the chainsaw
'Cause I caught the flack  but my dollars stacked right off the bat like a baseball
'Cause I make bands and I call getting cheese a cakewalk (Cheesecake  yeah)
Won't even lend you an ear  ain't even pretending to care
But I tell a bitch I'll marry her if she'll bury her
Face in my genital area  the original Richard Ramirez
Cristhian Rivera  'cause my lyrics never sit well
So they wanna give me the chair
'Cause e'ry Tom and Dick and Harry carry a Merriam motherfuckin' dictionary on 'em
Swearing up and down they can spit  this shit's hilarious
It's time to put these bitches in the obituary column
We wouldn't see eye to eye with a staring problem
Get the shaft like a steering column (Monster)
Evil half of the Bad Meets
Evil  that means take a back seat
Take it back to Fat Beats with a maxi single
Look at my rap sheet  what attracts these people
Is my 'Gangsta Bitch' like Apache with a catchy jingle
I stack chips  you barely got a half-eaten Cheeto
Fill 'em with the venom and eliminate 'em
Other words  I Minute Maid 'em
I'm murderin' again  nobody will evade
I'm finna kill 'em and dump all their fuckin' bodies in the lake
Obliterating everything  incinerate a renegade
I'm here to make anybody who want it with the pen afraid
But don't nobody want it  but they're gonna get it anyway
'Cause I'm beginnin' to feel like I'm mentally ill
You're bringin' the killer within me outta me
You don't wanna be the enemy of the demon who entered me
And be on the receivin' end of me  what stupidity it'd be
Every bit of me's the epitome of a spitter
Or you finna be dead the minute you run into me
A hundred percent of you is a fifth of a percent of me
I'm on the toilet bowl  I got a trailer full of money and I'm paid in full
I'm not afraid to pull a—
Man  stop
Sayin’ I should quit (Ah)
I fuckin' tell 'em make me (Bitch)
Eat a fuckin’ dick (Yeah)
I'm feelin' like the greatest (Woo!)
On the beat who ever did it
Mike WiLL the one who made it
It's Shady on the lyrics
I'm somewhat outlandish they say
You say we're cut from the same cloth
You better bring more men than the Latter Day Saints
At anything that may stand in they way
As I stand at the bay window with a hand grenade
James Holmes at the Saturday Batman matinee
Must have missed my CAT scan that day (Yeah!)
I just threw a Tampax at Dre
Anymore but I try to get away from the anger and rage
My basal ganglia’s an A to the K
Get your ass sprayed like bidets
You chumps don't even know how to do somethin'
To give goosebumps a day when you say
That somethin’ you wrote gave someone a lump in their throat
Bar for me when I rap isn't fair but
Guess that's the standard I'm held to
But if somethin' like that doesn't tell ya
You set a mark too high when platinum sales are looked at as a failure (Yeah)
Then you better take it back to The Shelter and Hamburger Helper

Fuck am I gonna do?
It's too late to start over
This is the only thing I  thing I know
Sometimes I feel like all I ever do is
Find different ways to word the same old song
Ever since I came along
From the day the song called “Hi! My Name Is” dropped
Started thinking my name was Fault
‘Cause any time things went wrong
I was the one who they would blame it on
The media made me the equivalent
Of a modern-day Genghis Khan
Tried to argue it was only entertainment  dawg
Gangster? Nah  courageous balls
Had to change my style  they said I'm way too soft
And I sound like AZ and Nas  out came the claws
And the fangs been out since then
But up until the instant that I went against it
It was ingrained in me
That I wouldn't amount to a shit stain  I thought
No wonder I had to unlearn everything my brain was taught
Do I really belong in this game?  I pondered
I just wanna play my part
Should I make waves or not?
So back and forth in my brain the tug of war wages on
And I don't wanna seem ungrateful
Or disrespect the art form I was raised upon
But sometimes you gotta take a loss
And have people rub it in your face
Before you get made pissed off
And keep plugging  it's your only outlet
And your only outfit  so you know they gonna talk about it
Better find a way to counter it quick and make it… ah
Feel like I've already said this a kabillion 80 times
How many times can I say the same thing
Different ways that rhyme?
When I was in the same place you are  when I was afraid to—
You might also like
I was a  afraid to make a single sound
Afraid I'd never be found (My dreams)
I didn't wanna go another round (Yeah)
An angry man's power will shut you up (Agh!)
And trip wires fill this house with tip-toed love
Run out of excuses for everyone
So here I am and I will not run (Yeah)
Guts over fear (The time is near)
Guts over fear (Might shed a tear)
For all the times I let you push me round
I let you keep me down (Now I got)
Guts over fear  guts over fear
Feels like a close  it's coming to
Fuck am I gonna do?
It's too late to start over
This is the only thing I  thing I know
I know what it was like  I was there once
Single parents  hate your appearance
As you struggle to find your place in this world
And the pain spawns all the anger on
But it wasn't 'til I put the pain in song
Learned who to aim it on that I made a spark
Started to spit harder shit
Learned how to harness it while the reins were off
And there was a lot of bizarre shit  but the crazy part
Was soon as I stopped saying I gave a fuck
Haters started to appreciate my art
And it just breaks my heart to look at all the pain I caused
But what am I gonna do when the rage is gone
And the lights go out in that trailer park? Oh
And the window is closing and there's nowhere else that I can go with flows and I'm frozen
‘Cause there's no more emotion for me to pull from
Just a bunch of playful songs that I make for fun
But I'd rather make “Not Afraid 2”
Than make another motherfucking “We Made You ” ah
Now  I don't wanna seem indulgent
When I discuss my lows and my highs
My demise and my uprise  pray to God
I just open enough eyes later on
And gave you the supplies and the tools
To hopefully use that'll make you strong
Enough to lift yourself up  when you feel like I felt
‘Cause I can't explain to y'all how dang exhausted my legs felt
Just having to balance my dang self
When on eggshells  I was made to walk
Strength to cause Shady-mania  so when they empty that stadium
Least I made it out of that house
And found a place in this world when the day was done
So this is for every kid who all's they ever did
Was dreamt of one day just getting accepted
I represent him or her  anyone similar
You are the reason that I made this song
And everything you're scared to say
Don't be afraid to say no more
From this day forward  just let them a-holes talk
Take it with a grain of salt—and eat their fucking faces off!
The legend of the angry blonde
Lives on through you when I’m gone  and to think I was a—
I was a  afraid to make a single sound
Afraid I'd never be found (My dreams)
I didn't wanna go another round (Yeah)
An angry man's power will shut you up (Agh!)
And trip wires fill this house with tip-toed love
Run out of excuses for everyone
So here I am and I will not run (Yeah)
Guts over fear (The time is near)
Guts over fear (Might shed a tear)
For all the times I let you push me round
I let you keep me down (Now I got)
And though you say the days are happy
Why is the power off and I'm fucked up?
But don't you place the blame on me
As you pour yourself another drink  yeah
I guess we are who we are
Headlights shining in the dark night  I drive on
Maybe we took this too far
I went in headfirst  never thinkin' about who what I said hurt
In what verse  my mom probably got it the worst
Cleanin' Out My Closet and all them other songs
You're still beautiful to me  ‘cause you're my mom
Though far be it from you to be calm
Our house was Vietnam  Desert Storm
And both of us put together could form an atomic bomb
Equivalent to chemical warfare
And forever we could drag this on and on
But agree to disagree  that gift for me
Up under the Christmas tree don't mean shit to me
You're kickin' me out? It's fifteen degrees
Ma  let me grab my fucking coat!
Anything to have each other's goats
Why we always at each other's throats?
Especially when Dad  he fucked us both
We're in the same fuckin' boat
You'd think that'd make us close (Nope)
And a car full of belongings  still got a ways to go
Back to grandma's house  it's straight up the road
And I was the man of the house  the oldest
So my shoulders carried the weight of the load
Then Nate got taken away by the state at eight-years-old
And that's when I realized you were sick
And it wasn't fixable or changeable
You might also like
I guess we are who we are
Headlights shining in the dark night  I drive on
Maybe we took this too far
‘Cause to this day we remain estranged and I hate it though
‘Cause you ain't even get to witness your grandbabies grow
At the time I was angry  rightfully? Maybe so
Never meant that far to take it  though
‘Cause now I know it's not your fault  and I'm not makin' jokes
That song I no longer play at shows
And I cringe every time it's on the radio
And I think of Nathan being placed in a home
And all the medicine you fed us and
How I just wanted you to taste your own
But now the medication's takin' over
And your mental state's deterioratin' slow
But I love you  Debbie Mathers
Oh  what a tangled web we have ‘cause
One thing I never asked was
Where the fuck my deadbeat dad was
Fuck it  I guess he had trouble keepin' up with every address
But I'da flipped every mattress  every rock and desert cactus
Owned a collection of maps
And followed my kids to the edge of the atlas
If someone ever moved 'em from me
That you coulda bet your asses
And although one has only met their grandma once
You pulled up in our drive one night
As we were leavin' to get some hamburgers
And as you left  I had this overwhelming sadness
Come over me as we pulled off to go our separate paths and
I saw your headlights as I looked back
And I'm mad I didn't get the chance to
Thank you for being my mom and my dad
Tribute  I wrote this on the jet  I guess I had to
Get this off my chest  I hope I get the chance to
Lay it 'fore I'm dead  the stewardess said to fasten
My seatbelt  I guess we're crashin'
I will always love you from afar  ‘cause you're my mom
I guess we are who we are
Headlights shining in the dark night  I drive on
Maybe we took this too far
I want a new life (Start over)
One without a cause (Clean slate)
So I'm coming home tonight (Yeah)
Well  no matter what the cost
And if the plane goes down
Or if the crew can't wake me up
Well  just know that I'm alright
I was not afraid to die
Oh  even if there's songs to sing
Well  my children will carry me
Just know that I'm alright
I was not afraid to die
Because I put my faith in my little girls
So I'll never say goodbye cruel world
Just know that I'm alright
I am not afraid to die
I guess we are who we are
Headlights shining in the dark night  I drive on
Maybe we took this too far
I want a new life
Uh  I was listening to the album
Good fucking luck  you're on your own
Guess who's back  back again?
Shady's back  tell a friend
Guess who's back  guess who's back
Guess who's back  guess who's back
Guess who's back  guess who's back
Guess who's back
Well  look what the stork brung
(What?) Little baby devil with the forked tongue
And it's stickin' out  yeah  like a sore thumb
(Bleah) With a forehead that it grew horns from
Still a white jerk
Pullin' up in a Chrysler to the cypher with the vic's  percs and a Bud Light shirt
Lyrical technician  an electrician y'all light work
And I don't gotta play pretend  it's you I make believe
And you know I'm here to stay 'cause me
If I was to ever take a leave  It would be aspirin to break a feve
If I was to ask for Megan Thee Stallion if she would collab with me
Would I really have a shot at a feat? (Ha!)
I don't know  but I'm glad to be back  like

Ate some codeine  as a way of coping taste of opiates  case of O.E
​Turned me into smiley face emoji
My shit may not be age appropri—
Ate but I will hit an eight year old in the face with a participation trophy
'Cause I have zero doubts
That this whole world's 'bout to turn into some girl scouts
That censorship bureau's out
To shut me down so when I started this verse
It did start off light-hearted at first
But it feels like I'm targeted
Mind bogglin' how my profit has skyrocketed  look what I pocketed
Yeah  the shit is just like y'all have been light joggin' and I've been running at full speed
And that's why I'm ahead like my noggin  and I'm the fight y'all get in

So  how many little kids still wanna act like me?
I'm a bigger prick than cacti be
And that's why these words sting  just like you were being attacked by bees
In the coupe leaning back my seat
Bumpin' R. Kelly's favorite group  the black guy pee's
In my Air Max 90's
White T's walkin' parental advisory
My transgender cat's Siamese
Identifies as black  but acts Chinese
Like a motherfuckin' hacky sack I treat the whole world  'cause I got it at my feet
How can I explain to you?
That even myself  I'm a danger too
I hop on tracks like a kangaroo
And say a few things or two to anger you
But fuck that  if I think that shit  I'ma say that shit
Snake-ass prick  you male crossdresser  fake-ass bitch
And I'll probably get shit for that

They can screw-off  them and you all

Wedgie in my underwear  the whole bed sheet and the comforter
Stuck up in my rectal crack  kiss my disrespectful ass
I'll ride through your cul-de-sac
Window cracked  bumpin' your reference tracks
Y-you collaborative effort rap  I-I have never said his raps
O-overstayed my welcome
Stepped in crap and ruined your welcome mat
So spit that shit from the heart  you didn't write like you wrote it (Wrote it) (Yeah)
While I teabag the microphone 'cause I go nuts on it (Oh  yeah)
Like a fighter jet lined with explosives that'll strike any moment
Headed right at opponents  and I'm the fuckin' pilot that flown it
I'm 'bout to—
Smash into everyone  crash into everything

Why don't every other white rapper sell what I sold? (Ooh)
Kamikaze pilot  I wrote my suicide note
Here come the guys in white coats tryin' to stop me

Look at what I've done
I heard your freestyle on Shade 45  that shit was embarrassing
There is no way we ever air that shit again  I guarantee that
The shit's embarrassing as me rear-ending Tara Reid bare
In my therapy chair  my dick is the hair length of Cher
Lyrically I'm terrible  better get your lyrics prepared
Richard Ramirez is here  serial killin' every beat there is
Somethin' evil is lurkin'  I'm no conspiracy theorist
Get the measurin' stick (What?) Twelve inches of wood (Haha)
Wait  but I've been goin' for your jugular since Craig G Duck Alert
And I've come to pay respects
You get laid to rest and I hope your butt is hurt
Put me on a track  I go cray on it like a color book
You got some views  but you're still below me
And I don't say the hook unless I wrote the hook
And now I'm just freestylin' in the vocal booth
And you know I've always spoke the truth
You're lyin' through your teeth so much  you broke a tooth
And it ain't somethin' I need a phone to do
When I say I can't wait 'til I get ahold of you
And I don't know what I'm s'posed to do
Tell me these crazy things
She used to tell me my daddy was an evil man
She used to tell me he hated me
But then I got a little bit older and I realized
She was the crazy one
But there was nothin' I could do or say to try to change it
'Cause that's just the way she was
They said I can't rap about bein' broke no more
They ain't say I can't rap about coke no more (Ahh)

Just to argue with 'em 'cause their ratings stink?!

Rihanna just hit me on a text
Last night I left hickeys on her neck
Wait  you just dissed me? I'm perplexed
Insult me in a line  compliment me on the next
Damn  I'm really sorry you want me to have a heart attack
Was watchin' 8 Mile on my NordicTrack
Realized I forgot to call you back
Here's that autograph for your daughter  I wrote it on a Starter cap
But how you gonna name yourself after a damn gun and have a man-bun?
Supplyin' smoke  got the fire stoked
Say you got me in a scope  but you grazed me
I say one call to Interscope and you're Swayze
Your reply got the crowd yelling  Woo!
So before you die let's see who can out-petty who
But I'm 45 and I'm still outselling you
By 29  I had three albums that had blew
Now let's talk about somethin' I don't really do
Go in someone's daughter's mouth stealin' food
But you're a fuckin' mole hill  now I'ma make a mountain out of you (Woo!)

Know your facts before you come at me  lil' goof
To burn it in front of you  ho
I'd rather be 80-year-old me than 20-year-old you
'Til I'm hitting old age
Still can fill a whole page with a 10-year-old's rage
Feel like I'm babysitting Lil Tay
Got the Diddy okay  so you spent your whole day
Shootin' a video just to fuckin' dig your own grave
Got you at your own wake  I'm the billy goat
You ain't never made a list next to no Biggie  no Jay
Next to Taylor Swift and that Iggy ho  you about to really blow
Kelly  they'll be putting your name
Like the last motherfucker sayin' Hailie in vain
Alien brain  you Satanist (Yeah)
My biggest flops are your greatest hits
The game's mine again and ain't nothin' changed but the locks
Gotta wake up Labor Day to this (The fuck?)
Bein' rich-shamed by some prick usin' my name for clickbait
In a state of bliss 'cause I said his goddamn name
Now I gotta cock back  aim
It's your moment
Had to give you a career to destroy it
Lethal injection  go to sleep six feet deep
I'll give you a B for the effort
But if I was three-foot-eleven  you'd look up to me
And for the record  you would suck a dick to fuckin' be me for a second
Lick a ballsack to get on my channel
Give your life to be as solidified
This motherfuckin' shit is like Rambo when he's out of bullets
So what good is a fuckin' machine gun when it's outta ammo?
Had enough of this tatted-up mumble rapper
How the fuck can him and I battle?
He'll have to fuck Kim in my flannel
I'll give him my sandals
Exhausting  letting off on my offspring
You dance around it like a sombrero  we can all see
You're fuckin' salty 'cause Young Gerald's balls-deep inside of Halsey
Your red sweater  your black leather
You dress better  I rap better
That a death threat or a love letter?
Little white toothpick
Thanks for dissing me
Now I had an excuse on the mic to write Not Alike
But really  I don't care who's in the right
But you're losin' the fight you picked
Fuckin' nails in these coffins as soft as Cottonelle
But this idiot's boss pops pills and tells him he's got skills
That he put the hit out that got Pac killed  ah
I'm sick of you bein' wack
And still usin' that mothafuckin' Auto-Tune
So let's talk about it (Let's talk about it)
I'm sick of your mumble rap mouth
Need to get the cock up out it
Before we can even talk about it (Talk about it)
I'm sick of your blonde hair and earrings

I used to be the type of kid
That would always think the sky is fallin'
Why am I so differently wired? Am I a martian?
What kind of twisted experiment am I involved in?
‘Cause I don't belong in this world
Flyin' off at the handle at my mom
At school I'm just shy and awkward
And I don't need no goddamn psychologist
Tryna diagnose why I have all these underlyin' problems
Thinkin' he can try and solve 'em
I'm outside chalkin' up drawings
On the sidewalk and in the front drive talkin'
Be noticed ‘cause I'm cryin' and sobbin'
I had a bad day at school so I ain't talkin'
Some cocksucker shoved me into a fuckin' locker
‘Cause he said that I eye-balled him

I used to be the type of kid that would always think the sky's fallin'
Why am I so differently wired in my noggin?
I'm fine long as there's batteries in my Walkman
Nothing is the matter with me
I bike ride through the neighborhood of my apartment
Complex on a ten-speed which I've acquired parts that
But if this is all there is for me life offers
Why bother even tryin' to put up a fight? It's nonsense
But I think a light bulb just lit up in my conscience
What about them rhymes I've been jottin'?
They are kind of giving me confidence
Instead of tryin' to escape through my comics
Why don't I just blast a little something like Onyx?
To put me in the mood to wanna fight and write songs that
Say what I wanna say to the kid that said that I eye-balled him
I could be iconic in my conquest?
That's word to Phife Dawg from A Tribe Called Quest
There's no guarantee
I used to be the type of kid that would always think the sky's fallin'
Now I think the fact that I'm differently wired's awesome
And connect lines like crosswords
And use my enemy's words as strength
‘Cause all my life I was told and taught I am not shit
By you wack fuckin' giant sacks of lyin' dog shit
Thought I was full of horseshit
And now you fuckin' worship the ground on which I am walkin'
Versus the whole 0-16 Lions offense
With this dialogue since '99 Rawkus
In a flyin' saucer full of Italian sausage
The most high exaltin' and I ain't haltin'
The best part about me is I am not you
There's no guarantee

 it was too late to stop it
 watched and gritted my teeth

To seize everything you ever wanted in one moment
Would you capture it or just let it slip?
Yo
There's vomit on his sweater already  mom's spaghetti
To drop bombs  but he keeps on forgetting
What he wrote down  the whole crowd goes so loud
He opens his mouth  but the words won't come out
He's chokin'  how? Everybody's jokin' now
He knows his whole back's to these ropes  it don't matter
He knows when he goes back to this mobile home  that's when it's
Better go capture this moment and hope it don't pass him

God only knows he's grown farther from home  he's no father

Tear this motherfuckin' roof off like two dogs caged
I was playin' in the beginning  the mood all changed
I've been chewed up and spit out and booed off stage
But I kept rhymin' and stepped right in the next cypher
Best believe somebody's payin' the Pied Piper
All the pain inside amplified by the
Fact that I can't get by with my nine-to-
Five and I can't provide the right type of life for my family
And these times are so hard  and it's gettin' even harder
Tryna feed and water my seed  plus teeter-totter
Caught up between bein' a father and a prima donna
Stay in one spot  another day of monotony's gotten me
To the point I'm like a snail  I've got
To formulate a plot or end up in jail or shot
Success is my only motherfuckin' option  failure's not
To go  I cannot grow old in Salem's Lot
This may be the only opportunity that I got

You know I want you bad as a Benjamin  I'm delirious

Snatch my house key off her key chain
She jumps off Wee-Bey from The Wire's dick
Now she's chasin' me with a cheese grater
Here goes that broken record cliché
She treats my face like Serato  she cuts and scratches like a DJ
Each day is an Instant Replay
They say what we display is symptomatic of addict behaviour
Back together  but forgot today was her B-day
She cut me off on the freeway
Simple misunderstanding  but just as I went to slam on the brakes
That's when I realized that she may be crazy as me  wait
Bitch cut my fuckin' brakeline
Stepped on them fuckers eight times
Still goin' seventy-three  thank God there's an exit comin' up
What the mother-F-U-C-K's wrong with her?
Hit the off ramp 'til I coasted to a goshdamn halt
Hit a fuckin' tree  now here she comes at full speed
Snatch that bitch out her car through the window
She screamin'  I body slam her on the cement
Until the concrete gave and created a sinkhole
Buried the stink ho in it  then paid to have the street repaved

In a cold sweat like I got hit with a freeze ray during a heat wave
Guess I eventually caved though  'cause she's layin' next to me in bed—directly aimin' a gat at my head!
Woke up again and jumped up
I confess I'm a static addict  I guess that's why I'm so clingy
Every girl I've ever had either says I got too much baggage
Or I'm too fuckin' dramatic
Man  what the fuck is the matter? I'm just a fuckin' romantic
I fuckin' love you  you fuckin' bitch!

I wish I could say  What a wonderful feeling!

Levels to this shit  I got an elevator
You could never say to me I'm not a fuckin' record breaker (Yeah)
I sound like a broken record every time I break a record
Nobody could ever take away the legacy I made  I never cater
Motherfucker  now I got a right to be this way
I got spite inside my DNA (Yeah)
But I roll 'til the wheels fall off  I'm working tirelessly  ayy
It's the moment y'all been waitin' for like California
Wishin' rain to pour in that drought  y'all
Been prayin' for my downfall (Yeah)
From the 8 Mile to the Southpaw
Still the same Marshall  that outlaw
That they say as a writer might've fell off
I'm back on that bull like the cowboys
So y'all gotta move  yeah  y'all gotta move  yeah  y'all gotta move
Give me some room (Woo!)  give me some room (Hey!)  give me the juice
Hop out the coupe (Joyner!)  hop out the coupe (Joyner!)  hop out and shoot
Last year  I was nobody
This year  I'm selling records
Now everybody wants to come around
Like I owe 'em somethin'
The fuck you want from me
Ten-million dollars?
Get the fuck outta here
You see  I'm just Marshall
Mathers (Marshall Mathers)
I'm just a regular guy  I don't know why all the
Fuss about me (Fuss about me)
Nobody ever gave a fuck before  all they did
Was doubt me (Did was doubt me)
Now everybody wanna run they mouth and try to
Take shots at me (Take shots at me)
Yo
You might see me joggin'  you might see me walkin'
You might see me walkin' a dead Rottweiler dog
With its head chopped off in the park with a spiked collar
Hollerin' at him 'cause the son of a bitch won't quit barkin' (Ruff ruff)
Or leanin' out a window with a cocked shotgun
Drivin' up the block in the car that they shot Pac in
Lookin' for Big's killers  dressin' ridiculous
Blue and red  like I don't see what the big deal is
Double barrel 12-gauge bigger than Chris Wallace
Pissed off 'cause Biggie and Pac just missed all this
Watchin' all these cheap imitations get rich off 'em
And get dollars that shoulda been theirs like they switched wallets
And amidst all this Crist' poppin' and wristwatches
I just sit back and just watch and just get nauseous
And walk around with an empty bottle of Rémy Martin
Startin' shit like some twenty-six-year-old skinny Cartman (Goddamn it!)
An anti-Backstreet and Ricky Martin
Whose instinct's to kill *NSYNC  don't get me started
These fuckin' brats can't sing and Britney's garbage
What's this bitch  retarded? Give me back my sixteen dollars!
All I see is sissies in magazines smilin'
Whatever happened to wilin' out and bein' violent?
Whatever happened to catchin' a good old-fashioned passionate ass-whoopin'
And gettin' your shoes  coat and your hat tooken?

And I don't wrestle  I'll knock you fuckin' faggots the fuck out

Ducked down and got paintballs shot at they truck — blaow!

At me (Best shot at me)
Is it because you love me that y'all expect so much of me?
Now because of this blonde mop that's on top
Of this fucked up head that I've got  I've gone pop?
The underground just spunned around and did a three-sixty
Now these kids diss me and act like some big sissies
Oh  he just did some shit with Missy
So now he thinks he's too big to do some shit with MC Get-Bizzy
My fuckin' bitch mom's suin' for ten-million
She must want a dollar for every pill I've been stealin'

Which is it  bitch: Mrs. Briggs or Ms. Mathers?
It doesn't matter  **** ******** **** ******'* * faggot
Talkin' about I fabricated my past
He's just aggravated I won't ejaculate in his ass (Ugh!)
So tell me  what the hell is a fella to do?
For every million I make  another relative sues
Family fightin' and fussin' over who wants to invite me to supper
A half-brother and sister who never seen me
Or even bothered to call me until they saw me on TV
Now everybody's so happy and proud
I'm finally allowed to step foot in my girlfriend's house (Hey!)
And then to top it off I walked to the newsstand
To buy this cheap-ass little magazine with a food stamp
Skipped to the last page  flipped right fast
And what do I see? A picture of my big white ass
XXL! XXL!
Now your magazine shouldn't have so much trouble to sell
'Cause I'm just Marshall

Things may not always make sense to you right now
But hey
What Daddy always tell you?
Stiffen up that upper lip
What you cryin' about?
You got me
All the things growin' up as Daddy that he had to see
I guess it was never meant to be
Maybe one day we'll wake up and this'll all just be a dream

I know Mommy's not here right now and we don't know why
We feel how we feel inside
But I promise Mama's gon' be alright
I remember back one year when Daddy had no money
Mommy wrapped the Christmas presents up and stuck 'em under the tree
And said some of 'em were from me 'cause Daddy couldn't buy 'em
But his job was to keep the food on the table for you and Mom
Either kept gettin' broken into and robbed or shot up on the block
And your Mom was savin' money for you in a jar
Tryin' to start a piggy bank for you so you could go to college
Almost had a thousand dollars 'til someone broke in and stole it
And I know it hurt so bad it broke your Mama's heart
And it seemed like everything was just startin' to fall apart
Mom and Dad was arguin' a lot
And Dad moved back to the other side of 8 Mile on Novara
And that's when Daddy went to California with his CD
Then you started seein' Daddy on the TV
And Mama didn't like it
And you and Lainie were too young to understand it
And it all happened too fast for either one of us to grab it
I'm just sorry you were there and had to witness it firsthand
'Cause all I ever wanted to do was just make you proud
Now I'm sittin' in this empty house just reminiscin'
Shh! Mama's only gone for the moment
Everything's gonna be alright
Daddy's here to hold ya through the night
I know Mommy's not here right now and we don't know why
We feel how we feel inside
But I promise Mama's gon' be alright
I'ma give you the world
I'll do anything for you to see you smile
And if that mockingbird don't sing and that ring don't shine
I'ma break that birdie's neck

Then why's your face red? Man  you wasted
Well  since age 12  I felt like I'm someone else
'Cause I hung my original self from the top bunk with a belt
Got pissed off and ripped Pamela Lee's tits off

Walked in the strip club  had my jacket zipped up
Flashed the bartender  then stuck my dick in the tip cup
Extraterrestrial  running over pedestrians in a spaceship While they're screaming at me  Let's just be friends
99 percent of my life  I was lied to
I just found out my mom does more dope than I do (Damn)

Just lettin' you know that you're not alone
Holla if you feel like you've been down the same road
And I just can't keep livin' this way
So startin' today
I'm breakin' out of this cage
Time to put my life back together right now
Admittedly I probably did it subliminally for you
I've been through the wringer
But they can do little to the middle finger
And drop dead: no more beef lingers
No more drama from now on
I promise to focus solely on handlin' my responsibilities as a father
So I solemnly swear to always treat this roof like my daughters and raise it

Sold Dre my soul and then told him the moment he signed me
That I'd be the most hated  though made it
So that there's no shame  it's okay to own it
'Cause life is a bitch  she's a bow-legged ho
But now those days are over
I Harvey Weinstein a bathrobe hangin' open
My code name is groper  I role play with lotion
I fuck the whole world then I throw 'way the Trojan
Old lederhosen with home-made explosives
I'll blow eighty holes in you
Don't make me go in  I O. J. the flows
And I'm insult to injury  Rolaids to Goldman
I'm throat spray and Motrin  I throated Nicole
As they both there to choke and my whole blade is soakin'
I stick and I turn in a rotating motion
Invisible with the pen  I'm at the pinnacle of sick individuals
Stick my dick and put the tip in at minimum
I'm fuckin' these syllables  I let 'em lick on my genitals
A little bit unpredictable  I spit the formidable

And if he is as bananas as you say  I'm not taking any chances
You are just what the doc ordered
I'm beginnin' to feel like a Rap God  Rap God
All my people from the front to the back nod  back nod
They said I rap like a robot  so call me Rap-bot
But for me to rap like a computer it must be in my genes
I got a laptop in my back pocket
My pen'll go off when I half-cock it
Got a fat knot from that rap profit
Made a livin' and a killin' off it
Ever since Bill Clinton was still in office
With Monica Lewinsky feelin' on his nutsack
I'm an MC still as honest
But as rude and as indecent as all hell
Syllables  skill-a-holic (Kill 'em all with)
This flippity dippity-hippity hip-hop
You don't really wanna get into a pissin' match
With this rappity brat  packin' a MAC in the back of the Ac'
And at the exact same time  I attempt these lyrical acrobat stunts while I'm practicin' that
I'll still be able to break a motherfuckin' table
Over the back of a couple of faggots and crack it in half
Only realized it was ironic  I was signed to Aftermath after the fact
How could I not blow? All I do is drop F-bombs
Feel my wrath of attack

Well  to be truthful the blueprint's
Simply rage and youthful exuberance
Everybody loves to root for a nuisance
Hit the Earth like an asteroid
Did nothing but shoot for the Moon since (Pew!)
MCs get taken to school with this music
'Cause I use it as a vehicle to bus the rhyme
Now I lead a new school full of students
Me? I'm a product of Rakim
Inspired enough to one day grow up  blow up and be in a position
To meet Run–D.M.C.  and induct them
Into the motherfuckin' Rock and Roll Hall of Fame
Even though I'll walk in the church and burst in a ball of flames
Only Hall of Fame I'll be inducted in is the alcohol of fame
On the wall of shame
You fags think it's all a game  'til I walk a flock of flames
Off a plank and  tell me what in the fuck are you thinkin'?
Little gay-lookin' boy
So gay I can barely say it with a straight face  lookin' boy (Ha-ha!)

And a way to go from your label every day  lookin' boy

Kneel before General Zod
So you'll be Thor and I'll be Odin
You rodent  I'm omnipotent
Let off  then I'm reloadin'
Immediately with these bombs I'm totin'
And I should not be woken
But I got your mom deep-throatin'
I'm out my Ramen Noodle
We have nothin' in common  poodle
It's me  my honesty's brutal
But it's honestly futile if I don't utilize what I do though
For good at least once in a while
So I wanna make sure somewhere in this chicken scratch I scribble and doodle enough rhymes
To maybe try to help get some people through tough times
But I gotta keep a few punchlines
Just in case 'cause even you unsigned
Rappers are hungry lookin' at me like it's lunchtime
I know there was a time where once I
Was king of the underground
But I still rap like I'm on my Pharoahe Monch grind
So I crunch rhymes  but sometimes when you combine
Appeal with the skin color of mine
You get too big and here they come tryin'
To censor you like that one line
I said on I'm Back from The Mathers LP 1 when I
Tried to say I'll take seven kids from Columbine
See if I get away with it now that I ain't as big as I was  but I'm
Morphin' into an immortal  comin' through the portal
You're stuck in a time warp from 2004 though
And I don't know what the fuck that you rhyme for
You're pointless as Rapunzel with fuckin' cornrows
You write normal? Fuck being normal!
And I just bought a new raygun from the future
Just to come and shoot ya  like when Fabolous made Ray J mad
'Cause Fab said he looked like a fag at Mayweather's pad
Singin' to a man while he played piano
So Ray J went straight to the radio station
Lyrics comin' at you at supersonic speed (J.J. Fad)
What I gotta do to get it through to you? I'm superhuman
Innovative and I'm made of rubber so that anything you say is ricochetin' off of me and it'll glue to you and
I'm devastating  more than ever demonstrating
How to give a motherfuckin' audience a feeling like it's levitating
Never fading  and I know the haters are forever waiting
For the day that they can say I fell off  they'll be celebrating
'Cause I know the way to get 'em motivated
I make elevating music  you make elevator music
Oh  he's too mainstream.
With rock  shock rap with Doc
Throw on Lose Yourself and make 'em lose it
I don't know how to make songs like that
I don't know what words to use.
Let me know when it occurs to you
While I'm rippin' any one of these verses that versus you
It's curtains  I'm inadvertently hurtin' you
How many verses I gotta murder to
Prove that if you were half as nice  your songs you could sacrifice virgins too?!
But look at the accolades these skills brung me
Full of myself  but still hungry
I bully myself 'cause I make me do what I put my mind to
And I'm a million leagues above you
I'ma sleep in the front seat
Bumpin' Heavy D and the Boyz  still Chunky but Funky
But in my head there's something I can feel tugging and struggling
Angels fight with devils and here's what they want from me
They're askin' me to eliminate some of the women hate
But if you take into consideration the bitter hatred
I have  then you may be a little patient
And more sympathetic to the situation
And understand the discrimination
But fuck it  life's handin' you lemons? Make lemonade then!
But if I can't batter the women
How the fuck am I supposed to bake 'em a cake then?
Don't mistake him for Satan
It's a fatal mistake if you think I need to be overseas and take a vacation
To trip a broad  and make her fall on her face and
Don't be a retard—be a king? Think not
Been a lover  been a cheat
All my sins need holy water  feel it washing over me
If all it's gonna cause is pain
Truth and my lies right now are falling like the rain
So let the river run
He's comin' home with his neck scratched  to catch flack
Sweat jackets and dress slacks  mismatched
On his breath's Jack  he's a sex addict
And she just wants to exact revenge and get back
It's a chess match  she's on his back like a jet-pack
She's kept track of all his Internet chats
And guess who just happens to be movin' on to the next
Actually  just shit on my last chick and she has what my ex lacks
'Cause she loves danger  psychopath
And you don't fuck with no man's girl  even I know that
But she's devised some plan to stab him in the back
Knife in hand  says their relationship's hangin' by a strand
So she's been on the web lately
Says maybe she'll be my Gwen Stacy  to spite her man
And I know she's using me to try to play him  I don't care
Hi Suzanne  but I shoulda said Bye Suzanne
After the first night  but tonight I am

I've been a liar  been a thief

All my sins need holy water  feel it washing over me
If all it's gonna cause is pain
The truth and my lies now are falling like the rain
So let the river run
A one-night stand turned a two-night stand
He found out  now she feels deserted and used
'Cause he left  so what? He did it first to her too
Now how am I supposed to tell this girl that we're through?
Don't want this to hurt  but what you deserve is the truth
Don't take it personal  I just can't say this in person to you
So I revert to the studio  like hole-in-the-wall diners
Don't have to be reserved in a booth
I just feel like the person who I'm turning into's
Irreversible  I preyed on you like it's church at the pew
And now that I got you I don't want you
Took advantage in my thirst to pursue
Why do I do this dirt that I do?
Get on my soapbox and preach  my sermon and speech
Detergent and bleach is burnin' the wound
'Cause now with her in the womb
We can't bring her in this world  shoulda knew
To use protection 'fore I bit into your forbidden fruit
Fuck!
I've been a liar  been a thief
Been a lover  been a cheat
All my sins need holy water  feel it washing over me
If all it's gonna cause is pain
The truth and my lies now are falling like the rain
So let the river run
My name's (Ooh)  my name's (Ooh)
River (Ooh)  river run
Call me (Ooh)  call me (Ooh)
River (Ooh)  we'll let the river run
Fuck can I say? If life was a highway
And deceit was an enclave  I'd be swerving in five lanes
That's why I may have came at you sideways
I can't keep my lies straight
But I made you terminate my baby
This love triangle left us in a wreck  tangled
What else can I say? It was fun for a while
Bet I really woulda loved your smile
Didn't really wanna abort  but fuck it
What's one more lie  to tell our unborn child?
I've been a liar  been a thief
Been a lover  been a cheat
All my sins need holy water  feel it washing over me
Well  little one (I'm sorry)
I don't want to admit to something (I fucked up)
If all it's gonna cause is pain
The truth and my lies now are falling like the rain
Look at that bitch
There she go  shakin' that ass on the flo'
Bumpin' and grindin' that pole
The way she's grindin' that pole
I think I'm losin' control
Get fucked up  hit the strip club
Wipe your shoe clean  got a routine goin'
Still got a few chunks on them shoestrings showin'
I was dehydrated 'til the beat vibrated
I was revived as soon as this bitch gyrated
Them hips and licked them lips  and that was it
I had to get Nate Dogg here to sing some shit
Two to the one  from the one to the three
I like good pussy and I like good tree
Smoke so much weed  you wouldn't believe
And I get mo' ass than a toilet seat
Three to the one  from the one to the three
I met a bad bitch last night in the D
Let me tell you how I made her leave with me:
Conversation and Hennessy
I've been to the motherfuckin' mountaintop
Heard motherfuckers talk  seen 'em drop
If I ain't got a weapon  I'ma pick up a rock
And when I bust yo' ass  I'm gon' continue to rock
Get your ass off the wall with your two left feet
It's real easy  just follow the beat
Don't let that fine girl pass you by
Look real close 'cause strobe lights lie

Some girls  they act retarded
Some girls are 'bout it  'bout it

I say  every day she be givin' it up

Shake that ass for me
Shake that ass for me
Shake that ass for me

Open your mouth for about four or five minutes
Take a little bit of this fluoride rin-inse
Me and Nate D-o-double-g
Lookin' for a couple bitches with some double D's
Pop a little champagne and a couple E's
We 'bout to have a party (Turn the music up)
Let's get it started (Go 'head and shake your butt)
I'm lookin' fo' a girl I can fuck in my Hummer truck
Apple Bottom jeans and a big ol' butt
Some girls are 'bout it  'bout it
I want a bitch to sit at the crib with no panties on
Knows that she can  but she won't say no
(Now) Look at this lady all in front of me
Would you be mine?
Heard you was freaky from a friend of mine
Now  I hope you don't get mad at me
But I told Nate you was a freak  he said he wants a slut
Hope you don't mind
I told him how you like it from behind
(Now) Shake that ass for me

God
And I ain't leavin' without you  bitch!
Comin' home with me!
And my boy  and his boy
And his boy
And his girl
Whose worst fear is a child with dyed hair and who likes earrings
Like whatever they say has no bearing
It's so scary in a house that allows no swearing
To see him walkin' around with his headphones blarin'
When he talks about his fuckin' dad walkin' out (Bitch!)
'Cause he hates him so bad that he blocks him out
If he ever saw him again he'd probably knock him out
His stepfather hit him so he socked him back
Sing for the laughter and sing for the tear (Come on!)
Maybe tomorrow the good Lord will take you away
Yet everybody just feels like they can relate (Huh-uh)
It's like these kids hang on every single statement we make
Now how the fuck did this metamorphosis happen?
From standin' on corners and porches just rappin'
To get they hands on every dime you have
They want you to lose your mind every time you mad
So they can try to make you out to look like a loose cannon
Any dispute won't hesitate to produce handguns
That's why these prosecutors wanna convict me
Strictly just to get me off of these streets quickly
But all they kids be listenin' to me religiously
So I'm signin' CDs while police fingerprint me

They say music can alter moods and talk to you
Just tell the judge it was my fault and I'll get sued
And they wanna get one ‘cause they think the shit's cool
Not knowin' we really just protectin' ourselves
To bein' able to have any fuckin' thing that we wanted
That's why we sing for these kids who don't have a thing
Except for a dream and a fuckin' rap magazine (Ha-ha!)
Who post pin-up pictures on they walls all day long
Idolize they favorite rappers and know all they songs
Or for anyone who's ever been through shit in they lives
'Til they throw on a rap record and they sit and they vibe
Squeeze it and hold it ‘cause we consider these minutes golden
And maybe they'll admit it when we're gone
Just let our spirits live on
Sing for the laughter and sing for the tear (Come on!)
Maybe tomorrow the good Lord will take you away
Sing for the laughter and sing for the tear (Come on!)
We clutch  it isn't much
But it's enough to make me wonder what's in store for us
It's lust  it's torturous
You must be a sorceress
'Cause you just did the impossible  gained my trust
Don't play games  it'll be dangerous if you fuck me over
'Cause if I get burnt  I'ma show you what it's like to hurt
'Cause I been treated like dirt before ya
Nobody knows me  I'm cold
Walk down this road all alone
It's no one's fault but my own
It's the path I've chosen to go
Don't ask me why I have no love for these motherfuckin' hoes
Bloodsuckin' succubuses  what the fuck is up with this?
I've tried in this department  but I ain't had no luck with this
It sucks  but it's exactly what I thought it would be like tryin' to start over
I got a hole in my heart  but some kind of emotional roller coaster
It's like an explosion every time I hold ya
Wasn't jokin' when I told you you take my breath away
You're a supernova and I'm a

Right at you
I'll do whatever it takes
When I'm with you  I get the shakes
My body aches when I ain't with you  I have zero strength
Why do we say that until we get that person that we think's gonna be that one?
And then once we get 'em  it's never the same
You want 'em when they don't want you
Soon as they do  feelings change
It's not a contest and I ain't on no conquest for no mate
I wasn't lookin' when I stumbled onto you  musta been fate
But so much is at stake  what the fuck does it take?
Let's cut to the chase 'fore the door shuts in your face
Promise me if I cave in and break and leave myself open
That I won't be makin' a mistake 'cause I'm a

And I'm aimin' right at you  right at you
Two-hundred-fifty-thousand miles on a clear night in June
And I'm aimin' right at you  right at you
Right at you
So after a year and six months  it's no longer me that you want
But I love you so much it hurts  never mistreated you once
I'll blow my brains in your lap  lay here and die in your arms
Drop to my knees and I'm pleadin'  I'm tryna stop you from leavin'
'Til I snap your neck like a Popsicle stick  ain't no possible reason
I can think of to let you walk up out this house and let you live
Tears stream down both of my cheeks  now I let you go and just give
And 'fore I put that gun to my temple  I told you this
And I woulda done anything for you
To show you how much I adored you
But it's over now  it's too late to save our love
Just promise me you'll think of me
Every time you look up in the sky and see a star 'cause I'm a
I'm a space-bound rocket ship and your heart's the Moon
And I'm aimin' right at you  right at you
Two-hundred-fifty-thousand miles on a clear night in June
And I'm so lost without you  without you
Got out of bed at all
The morning rain clouds up my window (Window)
And I can't see at all
And even if I could  it'd all be grey
But your picture on my wall
It reminds me that it's not so bad  it's not so bad (Bad)
My tea's gone cold  I'm wondering why I
Got out of bed at all

But your picture on my wall
It reminds me that it's not so bad  it's not so bad (Bad)
I left my cell  my pager and my home phone at the bottom
I sent two letters back in autumn  you must not've got 'em
There prob'ly was a problem at the post office or somethin'
Sometimes I scribble addresses too sloppy when I jot 'em
My girlfriend's pregnant too  I'm 'bout to be a father
If I have a daughter  guess what I'ma call her? I'ma name her Bonnie
I read about your Uncle Ronnie too  I'm sorry
I had a friend kill himself over some bitch who didn't want him
I know you prob'ly hear this every day  but I'm your biggest fan
I even got the underground shit that you did with Skam
I got a room full of your posters and your pictures  man

I ain't mad  I just think it's fucked up you don't answer fans
If you didn't want to talk to me outside your concert  you didn't have to
But you coulda signed an autograph for Matthew
I ain't that mad  though I just don't like bein' lied to
Remember when we met in Denver? You said if I'd write you  you would write back
See  I'm just like you in a way: I never knew my father neither
He used to always cheat on my mom and beat her
I can relate to what you're sayin' in your songs
So when I have a shitty day  I drift away and put 'em on
'Cause I don't really got shit else  so that shit helps when I'm depressed
I even got a tattoo with your name across the chest
Sometimes I even cut myself to see how much it bleeds
It's like adrenaline  the pain is such a sudden rush for me
My girlfriend's jealous 'cause I talk about you 24/7
She don't know what it was like for people like us growin' up
Sincerely yours  Stan—P.S. We should be together too

Dear Mr. I'm-Too-Good-to-Call-or-Write-My-Fans
This'll be the last package I ever send your ass
It's been six months  and still no word—I don't deserve it?
I know you got my last two letters  I wrote the addresses on 'em perfect
So this is my cassette I'm sendin' you  I hope you hear it
I'm in the car right now  I'm doin' ninety on the freeway
You know the song by Phil Collins  In the Air of the Night
About that guy who coulda saved that other guy from drownin'
That's kinda how this is: you coulda rescued me from drownin'
Now it's too late  I'm on a thousand downers now—I'm drowsy
And all I wanted was a lousy letter or a call
I hope you know I ripped all of your pictures off the wall
You ruined it now  I hope you can't sleep and you dream about it
And when you dream  I hope you can't sleep and you scream about it
I hope your conscience eats at you  and you can't breathe without me
But I didn't slit her throat  I just tied her up—see? I ain't like you
'Cause if she suffocates she'll suffer more and then she'll die too
My tea's gone cold  I'm wondering why I
Got out of bed at all
The morning rain clouds up my window (Window)
And I can't see at all
And even if I could  it'd all be grey
But your picture on my wall
It reminds me that it's not so bad  it's not so bad (Bad)
You said your girlfriend's pregnant now  how far along is she?
Look  I'm really flattered you would call your daughter that
And here's an autograph for your brother  I wrote it on a Starter cap
I'm sorry I didn't see you at the show  I must've missed you
Don't think I did that shit intentionally just to diss you
But what's this shit you said about you like to cut your wrists too?
To help your ass from bouncin' off the walls when you get down some
And what's this shit about us meant to be together?
That type of shit'll make me not want us to meet each other
I really think you and your girlfriend need each other
Or maybe you just need to treat her better
I hope you get to read this letter  I just hope it reaches you in time
Before you hurt yourself  I think that you'll be doin' just fine
Why are you so mad? Try to understand that I do want you as a fan
I just don't want you to do some crazy shit
I seen this one shit on the news a couple weeks ago that made me sick
Some dude was drunk and drove his car over a bridge
And had his girlfriend in the trunk  and she was pregnant with his kid
And in the car they found a tape  but they didn't say who it was to
Come to think about it  his name was—it was you
 baby?

With a fuckin' knife in the gut while I'm wipin' my butt
'Cause I just shitted on the mic and I like gettin' cut
It's survival of what?

This is do or die

Get along with the voices inside of my head
I wanted the fame but not the cover of Newsweek
Wanted to receive attention for my music
Fame made me a balloon 'cause my ego inflated
'Cause all I wanted to do's be the Bruce Lee of loose leaf
But with what I gave up to get it was bittersweet
It was like winnin' a used mink
Ironic 'cause I think I'm gettin' so huge I need a shrink
Goin' coo-coo and kooky as Kool Keith

And stumbled onto Jeff VanVonderen
'Cause I need an interventionist
To intervene between me and this monster
And save me from myself and all this conflict
'Cause the very thing that I love's killin' me and I can't conquer it
I'm just relayin' what the voice in my head's sayin'
I'm friends with the monster that's under my bed
Get along with the voices inside of my head
I'll walk amongst you a regular civilian
Take you back to the days that I'd get on a Dre track
Give every kid who got played that
Pumped-up feelin' and shit to say back
To the kids who played him
I ain't here to save the fuckin' children
But if one kid out of a hundred million
Maybe I need a straightjacket
I'm friends with the monster that's under my bed
Get along with the voices inside of my head
I'm friends with the monster that's under my bed

Will the real Slim Shady please stand up?
We're gonna have a problem here
Y'all act like you never seen a white person before
Jaws all on the floor like Pam  like Tommy just burst in the door
And started whoopin' her ass worse than before
They first were divorced  throwin' her over furniture (Agh!)
He didn't just say what I think he did  did he?
And Dr. Dre said
Feminist women love Eminem
Yeah  I probably got a couple of screws up in my head loose
But no worse than what's goin' on in your parents' bedrooms
Sometimes I wanna get on TV and just let loose
But can't  but it's cool for Tom Green to hump a dead moose
My bum is on your lips  my bum is on your lips
And if I'm lucky  you might just give it a little kiss
And that's the message that we deliver to little kids
And expect them not to know what a woman's clitoris is
Of course  they're gonna know what intercourse is
By the time they hit fourth grade they've got the Discovery Channel  don't they?
We ain't nothin' but mammals
Well  some of us cannibals who cut other people open like cantaloupes
But if we can hump dead animals and antelopes
Then there's no reason that a man and another man can't elope
But if you feel like I feel  I got the antidote

Things you joke about with your friends inside your livin' room

And I don't gotta be false or sugarcoat it at all
I just get on the mic and spit it
And whether you like to admit it (Err)  I just shit it
Better than ninety percent of you rappers out can
Then you wonder: How can kids eat up these albums like Valiums?
I'll be the only person in the nursin' home flirting
Pinchin' nurse's asses when I'm jacking off with Jergens
And I'm jerking  but this whole bag of Viagra isn't working

With his windows down and his system up

I sit back with this pack of Zig-Zag's and this bag
Of this weed  it gives me the shit needed to be
The most meanest MC on this  on this Earth
And since birth I've been cursed with this curse to just curse
And just blurt this berserk and bizarre shit that works
And it sells and it helps in itself to relieve
All this tension  dispensin' these sentences
Gettin' this stress that's been eatin' me recently off
Of this chest and I rest again peacefully
But at least have the decency in you
To leave me alone  when you freaks see me out
In the streets when I'm eatin' or feedin' my daughter
To not come and speak to me
I'm not Mr. *NSYNC  I'm not what your friends think
I'm not Mr. Friendly  I can be a prick
If you tempt me  my tank is on empty
No patience is in me and if you offend me
I'm liftin' you ten feet in the air
I don't care who was there and who saw me just jaw you
Go call you a lawyer  file you a lawsuit
I'll smile in the courtroom and buy you a wardrobe
I'm tired of all you  I don't mean to be mean
But that's all I can be  it's just me

Points a finger at me
So I point one back at 'em  but not the index or pinkie
Or the ring or the thumb  it's the one you put up
When you don't give a fuck  when you won't just put up
With the bullshit they pull  'cause they full of shit too
When a dude's gettin' bullied and shoots up his school
And they blame it on Marilyn and the heroin
Where were the parents at? And look where it's at!
Middle America  now it's a tragedy
Now it's so sad to see  an upper-class city
Havin' this happenin'  then attack
Eminem 'cause I rap this way  but I'm glad
'Cause they feed me the fuel that I need for the fire to burn
And it's burnin'  and I have returned
And I am whatever you say I am
If I wasn't  then why would I say I am?
Radio won't even play my jam
'Cause I am whatever you say I am
If I wasn't  then why would I say I am?
I'm so sick and tired of bein' admired
That I wish that I would just die or get fired
And dropped from my label  let's stop with the fables
I'm not gonna be able to top a My Name Is
And pigeon-holed into some poppy sensation
To cop me rotation at rock 'n' roll stations
And I just do not got the patience
To deal with these cocky Caucasians who think
I'm some wigger who just tries to be Black 'cause I talk
With an accent and grab on my balls so they always
Keep askin' the same fuckin' questions
What school did I go to  what hood I grew up in
'Til I'm grabbin' my hair and I'm tearin' it out (Argh!)
'Cause they drivin' me crazy  I can't take it
And I'm thankful for every fan that I get
But I can't take a shit in the bathroom without
Someone standin' by it! No  I won't sign your autograph
You can call me an asshole  I'm glad
'Cause I am whatever you say I am
If I wasn't  then why would I say I am?
Radio won't even play my jam
'Cause I am whatever you say I am
If I wasn't  then why would I say I am?
M.A
I like a bitch that like to wobble  wobble
But I hate to pay a bill (Hate that)
And I made a mil' without a major deal (I made that)
Money ain't a thing  that ain't a thing for real
It's the broke lingo (Huh)
I just want some face but this is no facial (Ooh)
Do right and kill er'body  Drake mode (Hello)
Disrespect that life and I'm in gang mode (Grrr)
Self-made goals (Hey)
When the pain leaves (Huh)
Where does the pain go? (Where?)
Tip of the backwood is where the flame goes (There)
To the sky is where my brain goes (Wow)
Pinocchio and my pistol  they got the same nose
Me and my niggas gotta eat  we share the same stove (What?)

Game over  Thanos on you H-O's

Get the plunger (Plunger) 'cause Marshall and M.A go plum crazy
Call us liquid plumber  'cause even Dre know (Dre know)
Beat knocks like a beefed up Detox
You're gonna need three squads of police officers at least to come pull me off of it and I don't stop
I am the complete opposite of these retards who spit these weak bars  I'ma leave carnage
Each thought'll be so toxic  it'll block the wind through your esophagus
Stop it  cutting off your oxygen
And I hit them pads like a boxing gym
Better watch for Slim  better get to popping and when I'm at the top again
I won't topple  I'm giving it to anyone who wanna come and get it and I'm not gonna stop
But when they ask me is the war finished with MGK? Of course it is
I cleansed him of his mortal sins  I'm God and the Lord forgives even the devil worshippers
I'm moving on but you know your scruples are gone when you're born with Lucifer's horns
Showed them all the blueprint and formula
But it seems like the more they studied my music  the more they remind me of eyeballs
I'm watching my pupils get cornier (Uh)
But I'm contemplating yelling Bombs away on the game
Like I'm outside of an Ariana Grande concert waiting
They call me Saddam Hussein  Ayatollah Khomeini
Where's Osama been? I been laden lately
Look at how I'm behaving  they want me gone away
They wanna JonBenét me (Fuck you)  I'm unaccommodating
Man  I don't see why they hate me (Huh?)
I'm a clown like John Wayne Gacy (What?)
They call me Kanye crazy (Yah)
And I'm back with Andre  baby (Yeah)
And the doctor's operating (What?)
But he never put no scrubs on from Snoop  K. Dot to Shady
'Cause I met your bitch on the internet now I'm getting head like a Pillow Pet
That bimbo can put her lips all the way around this bone and then blow
Like a dusty cartridge from an old Nintendo
Bitch  shut the fuck up 'fore I shoot you too
Ain't shit I won't do just to get a few YouTube views
But  even to the untrained human eye
We ain't the same  you and I
Somebody should have explained to you why
But I know magic and here go my last trick
I'm 'bout to say Abracadabra and pull a B Rabbit up out of my hat
I'm about to relapse and I betcha that you won't know how to react
But a look of disgust  I don't doubt it'd be that
As I begin to fuckin' devour the track
And you backpedal  that is a cowardly act
Like a Saudi attack when the towers collapsed
They call me Saddam Hussein  Ayatollah Khomeini
Where's Osama been? I been laden lately
Look at how I'm behaving  they want me gone away
When the world gives you a raw deal
When it talks to you like you don't belong
Or tells you you're in the wrong field
When something's in your mitochondrial
And blew up my-my-myself again
Mayo and went from Hellmann's and being rail thin
How can I be down? Me and Bizarre in Florida
Proof's room slept on the floor of 'da motel then
And I know they're gonna hate

Because they're gonna taste my—

Beat strangler attack

My Mustang and the Jeep Wrangler grill

Ate shit 'til I can't taste it
Chased it with straight liquor
And awake with a headache
And I take anything in rectangular shape
Then I wait to face the demons I'm bonded to
'Cause they're chasin' me but I'm part of you
So escapin' me is impossible
I latch onto you like a—parasite
And I probably ruined your parents' life
And your childhood too
'Cause if I'm the music that y'all grew up on
I'm responsible for you retarded fools
I'm the super villain Dad and Mom was losin' their marbles to
You marvel that? Eddie Brock is you

But I ain't no Jesus
I walk on water
But only when it freezes (Fuck)
Why are expectations so high? Is it the bar I set?
I lose my grip like the flying trapeze
​flies rip apart my stomach
Knowin' that no matter what bars I come with
As pressure increases like khakis
I walk on water
But I ain't no Jesus
I walk on water (Shit)
But only when it freezes

Mission accomplished
I walk on water

I don't think you should believe in me the way that you do
But I'm doin' my best to not ruin your ex-
Every album song I was spazzin' the fuck out on
And now I'm gettin' clowned and frowned on
But the only one who's looking down on
Me that matters now's DeShaun
Am I lucky to be around this long?
Begs the question though
Especially after the methadone
As yesterday fades and the Dresden home
Is burnt to the ground and all that's left of my house is lawn
The crowds are gone
And it's time to wash out the blonde
Now let 'em tell ya the world no longer cares
Or gives a fuck about your rhymes
'Cause how do I ever let this mic go without a fight
When I made a fuckin' tightrope outta twine?
I won't pout or cry or spiral down or whine
I walk on water
But I ain't no Jesus
I walk on water
But only when it freezes
I don't think you should believe in me the way that you do
'Cause I'm just a man
So me and you are not alike
In my own words  I guess
Have you ever loved someone so much  you'd give an arm for?
When they know they're your heart and you know you are their armor
And you will destroy anyone who would try to harm her
But what happens when karma turns right around to bite you?
And everything you stand for turns on you to spite you?
What happens when you become the main source of her pain?
Daddy  look what I made! Dad's gotta go catch a plane
Daddy's writin' a song  this song ain't gon' write itself
I'll give you one underdog  then you gotta swing by yourself
Then turn right around on that song and tell her you love her
And put hands on her mother who's a spitting image of her
Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice
Just know that I'm lookin' down on you smilin'
And I didn't feel a thing
Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice
Just know that I'm lookin' down on you smilin'
And I didn't feel a thing

I keep havin' this dream  I'm pushin' Hailie on the swing

You're makin' Mommy cry  why? Why is Mommy cryin'?
You always say that  you always say this is the last time
She's pilin' boxes in front of the door  tryna block it
Goes in her pocket  pulls out a tiny necklace locket
I look up  it's just me standin' in the mirror
They're sayin'  You got one more chance to do right and it's tonight
Now go out there and show 'em that you love 'em 'fore it's too late.
And just as I go to walk out of my bedroom door
It turns to a stage  they're gone and the spotlight is on and I'm singin'
Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice
Just know that I'm lookin' down on you smilin'
And I didn't feel a thing
Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice
Just know that I'm lookin' down on you smilin'
And I didn't feel a thing
Sixty-thousand people all jumpin' out their seat
The curtain closes  they're throwin' roses at my feet
I take a bow and Thank you all for comin' out
They're screamin' so loud  I take one last look at the crowd
I glance down  I don't believe what I'm seein'
And I bought you this coin  it says 'Number One Dad'
That's all I wanted  I just wanna give you this coin
Now go up there and show 'em that you love 'em more than us
Screamin' your name  it's no wonder you can't go to sleep
I hear applause  all this time I couldn't see
How could it be that the curtain is closin' on me?
Supposed to be on crashes and burns to ashes
It's spring and Hailie's outside swingin'
I walk right up to Kim and kiss her  tell her I miss her
Hailie just smiles and winks at her little sister  almost as if to say
Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice
Just know that I'm lookin' down on you smilin'
And I didn't feel a thing
Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice
Just know that I'm lookin' down on you smilin'

How many people are proud to be citizens
For the rights that men have died for to protect?
The women and men who have broke their necks
For the freedom of speech the United States government has sworn to uphold… or so we're told
I never would've dreamed in a million years I'd see
So many motherfuckin' people who feel like me
Who share the same views and the same exact beliefs
It's like a fuckin' army marchin' in back of me
'Til it stays stuck in your head for days and days
That I would catapult to the forefront of rap like this?
How could I predict my words would have an impact like this?
I must've struck a chord with somebody up in the office
'Cause Congress keep tellin' me I ain't causin' nothin' but problems
And now they're sayin' I'm in trouble with the government

I ain't have to graduate from Lincoln High School to know that
Gave me a chance and I lit a fire up under his ass

I'm like my skin is it startin' to work to my benefit now? It's—
Who otherwise would've never knew these words exist
Whose moms probably would've never gave two squirts of piss
'Til I created so much motherfuckin' turbulence
And kids flipped when they knew I was produced by Dre
And they connected with me too because I looked like them
That's why they put my lyrics up under this microscope
Sponsors workin' 'round the clock to try to stop my concerts early
After it bothered the fathers of daughters startin' to blossom
So now I'm catchin' the flak from these activists when they raggin'
Just look at me like I'm your closest pal
Aimed at little Erica to attack her character
The ringleader of this circus of worthless pawns
Sent to lead the march right up to the steps of Congress
And piss on the lawns of the White House
To burn the *galf*​​ and replace it with a Parental Advisory sticker
To spit liquor in the faces of this democracy of hypocrisy
Fuck you with the freest of speech this Divided States of Embarrassment will allow me to have! Fuck you!
Ra—  *record scratch*

Well  if you want Shady  this is what I'll give ya
A little bit of weed mixed with some hard liquor
Some vodka that'll jump-start my heart quicker

When I'm rockin' the table while he's operating (Hey!)
You waited this long  now stop debating
'Cause I'm back  I'm on the rag and ovulating
I know that you got a job  Ms. Cheney
But your husband's heart problem's complicating
So the FCC won't let me be
Or let me be me  so let me see
They tried to shut me down on MTV
But it feels so empty without me
So come on and dip  bum on your lips
Fuck that  cum on your lips and some on your tits

Little hellions  kids feeling rebellious
Embarrassed  their parents still listen to Elvis
They start feelin' like prisoners  helpless
'Til someone comes along on a mission and yells  Bitch!
A visionary  vision is scary
Could start a revolution  pollutin' the airwaves
A rebel  so just let me revel and bask
In the fact that I got everyone kissin' my ass
And it's a disaster  such a catastrophe
For you to see so damn much of my ass  you asked for me?
Fix your bent antenna  tune it in  and then I'm gonna
Enter in and up under your skin like a splinter
The center of attention  back for the winter
I'm interesting  the best thing since wrestling
Infesting in your kid's ears and nesting
Testing  Attention  please
Feel the tension soon as someone mentions me
Here's my ten cents  my two cents is free
A nuisance  who sent? You sent for me?

Worse than them little Limp Bizkit bastards

You thirty-six-year-old bald-headed fag  blow me
You don't know me  you're too old  let go
It's over  nobody listens to techno
Now  let's go  just give me the signal
I'll be there with a whole list full of new insults
I've been dope  suspenseful with a pencil
Ever since Prince turned himself into a symbol
But  sometimes  the shit just seems
Everybody only wants to discuss me
So this must mean I'm disgusting
But it's just me  I'm just obscene (Yeah)
Though I'm not the first king of controversy
I am the worst thing since Elvis Presley
To do Black music so selfishly
And use it to get myself wealthy (Hey!)
There's a concept that works
Twenty million other white rappers emerge
But no matter how many fish in the sea
It'd be so empty without me
Now  this looks like a job for me

 my wizzle  this is the plot  listen up
 Slizzle does not give a fuck
 'til the lights go out
 can't shut my mouth
 am I high? Perhaps
 'til the lights go out ('Til the roof  until the roof)
 can't shut my mouth (The roof comes off  the roof comes off)
 am I high? Perhaps ('Til my legs  until my legs)
 there's a certain feelin' you get
 and people are feelin' your shit
 and every single minute you spend
 'cause you may never get it again
 try to get as much shit as you can
 just admit when it's at its end
 here's the order of my list that it's in
 Jay-Z  2Pac and Biggie
 Jada  Kurupt  Nas  and then me
 the shit does not offend me
 but you know respect you got to give me
 like Bobby and Whitney—Nate  hit me!
 'til the lights go out
 can't shut my mouth
 am I high? Perhaps
 'til the lights go out ('Til the roof  until the roof)
 can't shut my mouth (The roof comes off  the roof comes off)
 am I high? Perhaps ('Til my legs  until my legs)
 I eat at an MC's heart
 smart
 my spot is forever reserved
 that would be the death of me first
 I act like I'm an addict
 who wants some static?
 so
 'til the lights go out
 can't shut my mouth
 am I high? Perhaps
 'til the lights go out ('Til the roof  until the roof)
 can't shut my mouth (The roof comes off  the roof comes off)
 am I high? Perhaps ('Til my legs  until my legs)
 until the roof
 the roof comes off
 until my legs
 I
 I will stand tall"
