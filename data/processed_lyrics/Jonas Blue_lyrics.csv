Runnin' free in the world  we got all weekend

Tear it up  tear it down
Gettin' lost in the sound of our hearts beatin'
Take me here  take me now
Gettin' lost in a crowd with you
Up all night
I waited for you all my life
Hold my hand and keep me close
I'll never let you go
No  not tonight
Keep me by your side

 mmm
 yeah
 it makes me anxious
 I need to know
 I need to know
Remember when you said that all good things end?
I never thought that I’d believe you
But now here I am  having lost a friend
And all the times I should've praised you
How am I ever gonna get through?
'Cause I had my chance but I blew it all
And now's my only time to tell you
If the heavens crumble down
And the days we have are through  I'll drink to you
And when the silence is the sound
I know the one I'll owe it to  I'll drink to you
If the heavens crumble down
And the days we have are through  I'll drink to you
And when the silence is the sound
I know the one I'll owe it to  I'll drink to you (I'll drink to you)
I was out of touch  didn't know my luck
You had everything I ever wanted
When I got lost  you came unstuck
And drifted off of my horizon
See Jonas Blue LiveGet tickets as low as $34You might also like
So take me back to where we began
I'll be everything you ever needed
If there’s one last shot  I'll give you all I've got
Oh  Lord knows that you deserve it
If the heavens crumble down
And the days we have are through  I'll drink to you
And when the silence is the sound
I know the one I'll owe it to  I'll drink to you
If the heavens crumble down
And the days we have are through  I'll drink to you
And when the silence is the sound
I know the one I'll owe it to  I'll drink to you (I'll drink to you)
When everything is said and done
The truth remains  you were my champion
When everything is said and done
The truth remains  you were the only one
If the heavens crumble down
And the days we have are through  I'll drink to you
And when the silence is the sound
I know the one I'll owe it to  I'll drink to you
If the heavens crumble down
And the days we have are through  I'll drink to you
And when the silence is the sound
I know the one I'll owe it to  I'll drink to you
If the heavens crumbled down
And the days we have are through  I'll drink to you
And when the silence is the sound
I want a ticket to anywhere
Maybe we make a deal
Maybe together we can get somewhere
Any place is better
Maybe we'll make something
You got a fast car
And I got a plan to get us out of here
I've been working at a convenience store
Managed to save just a little bit of money
We won't have to drive too far
Just across the border and into the city
You and I can both get jobs
And finally see what it means to be living
He says his body's too old for working
My mama went off and left him
She wanted more from life than he could give
So I quit school and that's what I did

You got a fast car
Is it fast enough so we can fly away?
We gotta make a decision
We leave tonight or live and die this way
City lights lay out before us
And your arm felt nice wrapped 'round my shoulder
You got a fast car
And we go cruising to entertain ourselves
You still ain't got a job
And I work in a market as a checkout girl
I know things will get better
You'll find work and I'll get promoted
We'll move out of the shelter
Buy a bigger house and live in the suburbs
City lights lay out before us
And your arm felt nice wrapped 'round my shoulder
You've got a fast car
And I've got a job that pays all our bills
You stay out drinking late at the bar see more of your friends
Than you do of your kids
I'd always hoped for better
Thought maybe together you and me would find it
I've got no plans and I ain't going nowhere
So take your fast car and keep on driving
Speed so fast feel like I was drunk
City lights lay out before us
And your arm felt nice wrapped round my shoulder
And I had the feeling that I belonged
And I had a feeling I could be someone
Oh  oh
You got a fast car
I want a ticket to anywhere
Maybe we will make a deal
Maybe together we can get somewhere
Any place is better
Starting from zero  got nothing to lose
Maybe we'll make something
Me  myself  I got nothing to prove

When this was all brand new
'Cause I've been restless

Got nothing left to lose
'Cause we've been reckless
Heartbeat
Beating and sinking away
I think we can do anything
We can do anything
I feel this heartbeat
Beating and sinking away
I think we can do anything
We can do anything
This could be everything
Distant shadows
You know we leave it all behind
Let's stay reckless

We can do anything

From a river to a flood
I see love around me (Love around me)
I didn't even know my name
Then I was blinded by the dark
My eyes will never look the same
Into the light as the night's comin' down
We're focusin' now

Where should we run to?
We got a ticket that takes us wherever we like
We got our problems
Don't wanna wake up one day wishing that we done more
Don't wanna wake up one day wondering where'd it all go
We coming home tonight
Dry those eyes
We'll be back in the morning when the sun starts to rise
We coming home tonight
We got the world in our hands and we're ready to play
They say we're wasted
But how can we waste it if we're loving every day?
Don't wanna wake up one day wishing that we done more

When I saw you yesterday
I see you
Who knows the secret tomorrow will hold?
We don't really need to know
Maybe we're perfect strangers
Maybe it's not forever
Maybe the night will change us
Maybe we'll stay together
Maybe we'll walk away
Maybе we'll realize
Wе're only human

I wasn't looking for someone that night
That you could fall in love at the first sight
But all of a sudden
(We loved and got lost in the moment)
All of a sudden
(She's gone in the flash of a light)
I'll be looking for the rest of my life
We took a Polaroid
You signed your name upon it
I put it in my wallet
Hoping I'd see your face again
We took a Polaroid
Captured the look in your eyes
It's only a matter of time
Before it starts fading
Mmm
Was it my imagination?
I could've swore I saw someone like you
A thousand people at the station

This love got me rolling the dice
Don't let me lose

Your heart got me hurting at times
Your heart gave me new kind of highs
Your heart got me feeling so fine
So what to do

In the darkest of nights when our bodies collide
That love that is so hard to find

Ooh
Someday  we'll be a million miles away
Waking up on Monday morning
Wishing it was Saturday
Kids screaming out  no warning
This will be a distant memory
I can hear the future calling  let it wait
'Cause you know that we got time to get ourselves together
We got time for us
So baby  let's waste our time like we'll be young forever
Stay forever young
When we were 17  feels like just yesterday
Living a lucid dream  those years just fall away
One day we'll be 33 before we're old and gray
Let's still be 17 like yesterday
Let's stay younger together  let's stay younger together
Let's stay younger together  let's stay younger together
Let's stay younger together  let's stay younger together
Let's stay younger together  let's stay younger together
Let's stay younger together  let's stay younger together
Let's stay younger together  let's stay younger together
Let's stay younger together

Always  you'll always be my fantasy
Even when we're grown up  know that I love you better than today
One day we'll be dancing slowly  but for now I'll make it rain
I can see the future calling  let it wait

We got time for us
So baby  let's waste our time like we'll be young forever
Stay forever young
