Let me talk
I mean this is fuckin' crazy
I can't wait to get to Loaded Lux
Now a nigga G-5 tell number
Started from a dropout
Now I bring that drop out
Ain't no wins over here
We gon' fight and fucking shoot 'til our souls disappear
Call me anything but a broke nigga
Flexed hard on 'em with the blood-red Rari
Every day call fly spirit in an Audi
Run that shit the fuck back
I’m from where the boys get rowdy
Disrespect me get your head on a bounty
Keep your head above water before a nigga drown me
Waka Flocka Flame show rapping more realer
Run down Grove feeling like Godzilla
You tripping
Can't stand up on Xans
Cooking dope with no frying pans
You see that flag hanging out my pants

You might hate us but you gon' show respect
Nigga wanna act like hoes
I’ma show you how that pussy get wet
You ain't 'bout that life
But you stay talking like you think you is
I got all this ice
It’s a frozen day when I throw my wrists
Niggas fucking your chick

Fight me over some money
Frenchie all on his shit
Bands will make her dance
But this forty'll make you strip
Yeah

We gon' fight and fucking shoot 'til our souls disappear
Pink slip shawty  I don't do no fucking lease
Niggas dry snitching  want to run to police
Put it on my niece  you gon' die before me
I put that on the G  Grove Street nigga
Where I'm from  we don't brag if we catch a body nigga
That's just life
Real shit  nigga  that's just life
Watch out for your friends when they got a knife
Blood brothers  me and Wooh Da Kid
Run up over here  no more hard year
Six millions  that's real shit
They know my war stories  niggas know me
Walk up dumping   me
Everybody killers  where are the bodies?
In the hood  where you could find me
Blood brothers in the club  it's a movie
My hood  you can call it grimy

Hole in his head  I guess he lost his mind
And he thought he was a winner when he crossed the line
They know my war stories  niggas know me
