 ayy)
 ayy (Ain't doin' no kissin')
 yeah
 you can stop that right there
Be back immediately to confiscate the moneys
(Ear Drummers)
But you said you didn't need them (Mike WiLL Made-It!)
Young bull livin' like an old geezer (Ah)
Frat girls still tryna get even (Tryna get even)
They lose it when the DJ drops the needle (And they lose it)
Getting so gone I'm not blinkin'
What in the world was I thinkin'?
There is nothin' to explain
Took a bitch to the club and let her party on the table
And get some more
Get you somebody that can do both
Black Beatles got the babes belly rollin'

Young bull livin' like an old geezer (Ah)
Frat girls still tryna get even (Tryna get even)
They lose it when the DJ drops the needle (And they lose it)
A broke ho can only point me to a rich ho
They seen that Guwop and them just came in through the side door
There's so much money on the floor we buyin' school clothes
Why you bring the money machine to the club for?
I Eurostep past a hater like I'm Rondo
I upgrade your baby mama to a condo
Like Chapo servin' llello to the gringos
Young bull livin' like an old geezer (Ah)
Frat girls still tryna get even (Tryna get even)
They lose it when the DJ drops the needle (And they lose it)
I wear leather Gucci jackets like it's still the 80s
I can't worry about a broke nigga or a hater
Young bull livin' like an old geezer (Ah)
Frat girls still tryna get even (Tryna get even)
(Maserati)
Uh  Sremm born with it
When you come from the bottom then you gon' spend it

Candy paint and some vogues on these ho niggas
They done got back in their feelings  they some old niggas

Got a little bit of Promethazine in that cup  I'm 'bout to sip on it
I turned a U-turn on Moreland  got that lift on it (Skrrt  skrrt)
See back in 2003 when they wasn't hip to me
I was sellin' them breakdowns  tell the truth I was tryna live through it
They keep a liquor store on every damn corner
They hop up out the paddy wagon  run up on us
They tryna search us every day  we ain't got nothin' on us
I drink that lean every day like it's a Corona

Have fun  shotkilla like Mike reincarnated
Throwin' out a fuckin' end
I'm blowin' money in the wind
I'm sick of wearin' skinny jeans
I'm more into wearin' Louis V's
These hoes don't fuckin' listen
These niggas don't pay attention
These bitches are not yours
We keep them on all fours
Breakin' down'  rollin' up potent
Sippin' champagne like soda  poppin' red bitches like cola
Trunk beat like Eardrummers
Sremm killed the haters  God bless 'em
Mothafuckas still all in my bone marrow
Flyin' through the air like a fuckin' air devil
All these broke niggas just fish in a barrel
Run back up and I turn into a bezel

I like bad bitches  cause they like bad bitches too
I like hood niggas  with a bad attitude
They could never reach Young Nick' magnitude
Even if they had a longitude  latitude
You are my son  like an episode of Maury
When it comes to rap skills  nobody wanna see her

Cross the border like I lost a daughter
This foreign nigga  he ain't know better
Him pick and choose where them bullets fly
I lose the plane on this fool nigga
Bought dope with my album budget
Play Cloths was the blueprint
Four million in four seasons
Fuck who care for my fashion sense
Tell a ho come and swim in the money (splash)
Broke niggas just stop at the heel
I could body paint you in them name brands
And put a red bow on the wheels
See I'm just in and out  I call a rent a mouth
Suck the ice out of a bezel
Use my rap persona  fuck baby mommas
Still killin' haters  God bless em'
