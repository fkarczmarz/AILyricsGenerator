"Something's wrong with me
There's something in my heart
The streets keep calling me
Three o'clock  just can't close my eyes
Something's wrong with me
There's something in my heart
 meow  meow
 meow)
 meow)
 meow)
 meow  meow
 meow
Thank you for sharing your love and your light
Though we say goodbye
We will say hello again
You'll always live in our hearts and our minds
Thank you for being a friend
That you were to me
I cherish the moments of all our good time
You traveled beyond
Your legacy lives on
Go forward as the eagle
To your endless planets
I know I will see you again
In another life
Thank you for sharing your light with the world
Travel beyond
Your legacy lives on
Now enter the void
 am I keepin' it real?
 I'm just bein' honest
 then who will?
 yeah (Then who will?)
 both at the same time-i-i-ime (Who will?)
 baby (Who will?)
 do my best and that's alright (Who will?)
 I'm comfortable and that's what's tight (Who will?)
 doesn't mean I'm doin' it good
 but don't think I should
 creative spirit walkin'
 then who will?
 yeah (Then who will?)
 baby (Who will?)
 am I keepin' it real?
 I'm just bein' honest
 then who will?
 yeah (Then who will?)
 both at the same time (Who will?)
 baby (Who will?)
 do my best and that's alright (Who will?)
 I'm comfortable and that's what's tight (Who will?)
 doesn't mean I'm doin' it good
 but don't think I should
 ah
 no
 creative spirit walkin'
 then who will?
 then we feel safe
 now the beat gon' breathe
That's my story and I'm sticking to it
I'm high as a kite
Don’t bother me
I'm out here probably doing the most
From the minute I wake up I'm staring at the screen
Watching the world go insane
Gotta stay connected so I know what's happening
In these streets
Thank God for technology 'cause
Where would we be if we couldn't tweet our thoughts?
Won't you leave some things to mystery?
Opening your mouth removes all doubt
So be quiet
Technology is the key to it all
Where did I lose my phone at?
Doesn't really matter 'cause you're already behind the curve
It's okay to disconnect sometimes
 brush your teeth
 go to sleep
 take the wheel
 brush your teeth
 go to sleep
 take the wheel
 brush your teeth
 go to sleep
 how do I look in my durag?
 endlessly
 zoom
 how do I look in my durag?
 endlessly

 I'vе been doing this for some time now...)

 girl

 baby
'Cause I'm just too wasted
You're taking me higher
Straight shots with no chaser
I'm up past the clouds
Can't come down  we're too faded
Way out in the stars
She said  Come to outer space
Drink dat  drink dat
Drink dat
Then she said
The night is almost over
But we still wanna party
Ain't no one in here sober
The weed I'm rolling's gnarly
These bitches love Sosa
These niggas want some molly
I'm just chillin'  getting high as fuck
Looking boss in my Cavalli
Smoking papers  no blunts
Writing Turn up on our cups
'Cause we gon' do that
Someone get another bottle of gin
We just ran through that
Made a million out of nothing  thought you knew that
Hating on my crew swag  that's too bad
Pouring shots  ain't worried 'bout precautions or the cost
You might also like
Can't open my eyes  girl
'Cause I'm just too wasted
You're taking me higher
Straight shots with no chaser
I'm up past the clouds
Can't come down  we're too faded
Way out in the stars
She said  Come to outer space
Drink dat  drink dat
Drink dat
Then she said
No turnin' down  even though we prolly should
I pass some drugs to you  it's prolly good
I know that we famous
Here's some red cups with shots
We should probably take 'em
Smoking out on private property
Haters stay up and watch while we drink
Music low in case the neighbors call the cops on us
Niggas hate and bitches hate  all in the same
So take this cup of Bombay and drink all of it straight
Starting to realize what this party shit can feel like
We take the movies and the songs  make 'em real life
Live for the moment  ain't worried what it end like
Go to the roof and hit the bong  have a good night
Now you should know what the play is
Don't really know what I'm feeling
Sometimes I go through these phases
That means we both feeling faded
I mean we both feeling faded
I really hope that we make it
Can't open my eyes  girl
'Cause I'm just too wasted
You're taking me higher
Straight shots with no chaser
I'm up past the clouds
Can't come down  we're too faded
Way out in the stars
She said  Come to outer space
Drink dat  drink dat
Drink dat
'Til I'm totally numb
Sometimes you want to feel alive
But not on someone else's time
Morning heartache
Senses your love
I just can't catch a break
Squirrels and snakes keep me on my toes
Will you go down with me?
Don't care what you say
'Cause nothing is real
I'd rather be up my mind
Than to be dead alive
Drowning away all of the pain
'Til I'm totally numb
Sometimes you want to feel alive
But not on someone else's time
Sometimes you are dead inside
With the time to read between the lines of life and death
Sometimes it's okay
Sometimes it's the worst thing ever
Hopefully you won't get caught and get a DUI
You will see that it's not so bad
There's always tomorrow
Bottom of the glass
At this point you've made an ass
And your friends will let you know tomorrow
I'm so tired
One more glass to go
Just take the time to
Look a bit deeper
You'd be surprised what you find inside
We're only human
That makes it simple
But all our lives are complex
And it's fine
It's fine
Can you read my mind
Or can you read my heart
Cause they're not one in the same
Your good intentions they're broken and beaten
Comes ringin' through loud and clear
I'll adjust and simply let go
I guess it is what it is (Is)
I'm not sure of what's coming next
But I'll be alright as long as I keep breathin'
I know I'll be alright
Even though you're not around (You're not around)
So hard to get over it
I've tried to get under it
Bye-bye for now
I'll keep holdin' you down (Holdin' you down)
'Til it ain't
Things will never be the same
Never be the same again
Everything so strange (Strange)
We were just gettin' lifted
Now we just reminiscin'
Keep my head above water (Head above water)
My emotions
Gimme a sip of that potion
But I feel like it's open
Tell the doctor come work with me
I keep lookin' at my soul
And I've been workin' nine to nine
Yeah
But they talk about it
But you know it's all fine (All fine)
But who can say that?
I would be the man of your dreams
I will do all that I can
And be all I can be

I'll keep holdin' you down (Holdin' you down)
Even though you're not around (You're not around)
So hard to get over it
I've tried to get under it
Bye-bye for now
I'll keep holdin' you down (Holdin' you down)
Is it 'cause I wear my hair weird or because I like to play Diablo?
Don't act like you don't know what I'm talking 'bout
'Cause I really don't wanna have to spell it out
The next time you call me
I'm gon' sit and stare at the screen
Waiting for the call to end
You stuck me in the friend zone
That's that bullshit
I'm gonna play Diablo either way
You can come or you could go
Because I'd rather play Mortal Kombat anyway  hey
I'm all about my Johnny Cage
If you're not bringing bottles  I suggest you start to walk away
Bitch  don't kill my vibe
I can tell you've kinda got uncomfortable
So let me break it down for you
Unless you plan on giving me some
Because I got enough friends
You might also like
I would throw you in the garbage
'Cause you play too many games
I'm better off by myself
Loving you's bad for my health
No one wants to be in the friend zone
Friend zone
A little?
'Cause I'm just a little drunk and I wanna come party with you
A little
Can I look into your eyes?
I can tell that you're high too
I just wanna party with you
All night
Someone hold my phone 'cause I can't hold my tongue
Sorry if I get a little PTSD
But I just wanna party with you
All night
Because you make me happy
That's right
I only wanna party with you
Tonight
Because you make everything
Breakdowns  buildups  knock downs  broke down
But still try  try try
Baby  this could be a change for us to see
Maybe  we'll figure out where we're supposed to be
Until we find the truth there's something we should do
Can't let the love stop flowing from me to you
You know we tried way too hard to find
A love that's really blind so why even try
Because we know that there's still hope
Just don't let go
Baby  this could be a chance for us to see
Maybe  we'll figure out where we're supposed to be
Until we found the truth there's something we should do
Yo  ayy
Yo  ayy  ayy
Ayy  yo
Yo  ayy  ayy
Yo  ayy
 I could press rewind
About last night  I don't know how it ended
I can't find my phone and I can't find my shoes
But nothing beats being in a party with you
Let's do it all again
Let's do it again
Let's do it all again
Let's do it again
It's just more fun when you come around
Even if I act up
You let me know that I'm not crazy
Crazy
Crazy
Yeah  I remember you were punching my friends
Made an oil spill that makes Exxon offended
Then you fell asleep on the laundry in my room
And this is why I love to party with you
Let's do it all again
Let's do it again

Let's do it all again

When you're around  you know what to say
You brighten my day
I feel that it's crazy
When you're around
(I don't give a fuck!)
Even if you think I should bitch!
Nigga!
(I don't give a fuck!)
Even my friend is bad!
(Still don't give no fucks!)
The fuck you mean you don't take cash?!
Nigga!
Black skies filled with smoke
Darker horizons ahead
Out of the pan and into the fire
The descent into madness
Into the fire
Black skies filled with smoke
Darker horizons ahead (That's right)
Out of the pan and into the fire
The descent into madness
Beyond just more of our space
We are decaying over time
I'm gonna find someone to love
Innerstellar love
Ooh-ooh
Was it wrong for you to belong to me?
Maybe we can find a way
Everyday is like a dream to me
You said I need a place to go
So we said lets go
I let you out of my sight
But you were stir-crazy
Looking for the next best thing
It was the best thing for you and me to unite
No matter where we go the winds still blow
Cause matters of the heart always lead you from the start
Suddenly you came on to me
Was it wrong for you to belong to me?
Maybe we can find a way
Everyday is like a dream to me
You think I'm crazy cause all I want to do is relive the day that I first met you
You might also like
Suddenly you came on to me
Was it wrong for you to belong to me?
Maybe we can find a way
Everyday is like a dream to me
When it all comes to an end
When there's nothing left to say
It is what it is
I tried to make it work
My best just wasn't enough
The things I would do for you
After all is said and done
And I'm all alone
When I sit back and reflect
From a broken heart
Sometimes there's regret
It is what it is
So many things I wanna say
This is the end
Except for the cops
Will they attack?
Would it be 'cause I'm Black?
I want to ride away  off into space and into the sun
With all those spirits and space dust and aliens
Where we belong (Fuck yeah)
Although it seems like it's all crashing down
I just want to ride my bike
Through all the bullshit with the wind in my face
Miss me with that nonsense
I'm free as a bird (Free)
And light as the wind
Just leave me alone (Easy)
Just let me ride off into space (Space ride)
Drift on by
Shine on me
Then pass me by
Warm me up
Then leave me cold
And when I die
Love  love  love  love
You say you ain't got time for games
No more games
But the world got time for games with you
Play your own
Playing with your money and your heart
Just admit you don't know what to do
I've seen a lot of things come and go
Lots of pimps and tons of hoes
How this ends  we'll never know
A king in his castle
A king of the hill
Wasting his time
Chasing cheap thrills
He knows it's gonna cost him
God knows how much
But you know you gotta pay to play (Pay to play)
At the end of the day (At the end of the day)
Playing with your money and your heart
There's got to be another way

A king in his castle

Wasting his time
Chasing cheap thrills
He knows it's gonna cost him
God knows how much
Love  love  love  love
To free fall away
I won't judge you anymore
'Cause sometimes I needed to
Free fall far away
I'm so tired
Where can I lay my head?
I'll just close my eyes
Hope I wake up dead
Don't want to live without you
Don't leave me out here to die
Maybe another time and space
When I can look you in the face
Let me know if you can hear me
It feels so cold and so alone
Just need some sort of sun
We're not alone
But it's hard to tell
Just let me know
So I can go
Because I can feel a pulse
Breathe for me
Breathe for me
Is it time to go?
Go and start the show
Straight up seein' goblins
Where no need to be frightened
Then I go grab the ice cream
Kinda stuck in my day dreams
Night time turn to day dreams
Then in walks in the Jondy
Lotus and the Jondy (x14)
Even when you're really fuckin' mad
I guess that it's supposed to subside
Even though you're probably really mad
You can probably be worse
Just have that sink in for a while
It's okay if it's not goin' your way
It never was
Don't believe their hype
It's probably all covered in lies
I should take my own advice
Hurt the same
Dance away the pain
It's gonna be alright
Just do the fuckin' dance
Even if you started to cry
It's okay
Everything will be alright
It's alright
Just do the happy dance
Even if you're not alright
It's okay
Joy inside your pain
That's alright
And then you'll breathe
Just dance
You will be alright
Keep dancin'
Even though you're not alright again
It's alright
Dance
It's about 3:42
And I don’t know where the bathroom is
My friends say you should eat something
This song is jammin'
I just wanna party  you should be here with me
In this ecstasy  baby
I just wanna party  you should be here with me
In this ecstasy  baby
I just wanna party  you should be here with me
I’m on ecstasy  baby
I just wanna party  you should be here with me
In this ecstasy  baby
Who are you? Why you talking so loud?
I forgot you was my friend
I’m confused as hell  stuck in a pattern grid world
Don’t want it to stop

You really blow my mind (My mind)
Let's not waste any more time
I'll just meet you overseas
We can do it on the plane
I just wanna be with you
I wanna meet you in Brazil
Take you to a place that you never been before
We can just lay on the beach
And just fall asleep  or maybe meet up in Japan
Maybe we can just hold hands
Let's go get drunk in Golden Gai
Maybe meet up in Russia
Meet up in Russia
I don't really care who sees
Let's join the mile high club
Everybody  please put your seatbelts on
Winds are gettin' a little bit choppy and
There appears to be a shiny black man up there in first class
Gettin' some sloppy-toppy  hahaha
He's got all his chains on and a durag
Is that Thundercat?
Open windows and closed doors
All the pretty lights and sounds to open up the night
Friends  they come and go
That's okay  I'm kind of bored
On the edge of dark there's the brightest light
A burning light on the edge of dark
Where no one can tell they’re worlds apart
We'll live with dark  just take the ride
It's your boy Thundercat
Heavy-hearted  but my burden's light
I just wanna live  and learn how to fly
When it's all over  breathe into the light
Sink or swim  I'm not scared to die
Tell 'em how you feel  Kenny

Your heart is struggling  baby
Trying to believe
That there might be something you just couldn't see
But what if I told you  babe
It’s all so easy?

Ladies and gentlemen  Michael McDonald
Wake up and dream  tear down the wall
Of all you believe that might not be true
Long as love lies waiting there
Just hold your face into the light
Though right now you might not know why
Long as love lies waiting
They ain’t know our way  baby
Let me show you  show you the way
On the edge of dark there's the brightest light
A burning light  on the edge of dark
Where no one can tell they're worlds apart
We'll live with dark  just take the ride
Hey  how's it going? This is your boy Thundercat
If you're gonna fill your water bottle with vodka
I won't forget you  even passing
I know we'll meet  don't you forget me
Strange how things work  nothing's promised
Let your heart beat  your guide  mine
Your guide  always we will survive
I will go on  no need for care
Won't you trust me?
I know it's hard when you can't trust
No one  nothing  you can't let go
You can trust me  I will never leave you
Right here  always by your side
I am happy that we got to share this life
And I stare into the clouds
And watch the world turn
Is this where we belong?
Or is it a step to fill?
Makes me wonder  makes me think (Shoryuken)
Everything we do is weak
Turn down
Oh  'cause look at the mess we've made
Who's gonna clean it up?
Oh my God  where's Captain Planet?
Perception  what you see
Compared to reality  so far away
You are so drunk  you miss it all (Yay)
Just make sure you have the right Jordans on
Or be left behind to rot and die
Face down in the gutter
This is gonna sound like I was just hitting the hash (Zone)
They make us think it's a race war when the war is in class (Show 'em)
Teachers come through the speakers  images through the glass (Foam)
Subliminal messages influencing the whole clash (Alone)
If you scared of different then you should not take the same path
If all lives matter when we mention black  why do you gasp? (Bro)
Behind our blue skies is the sun who's surrounded by black (Tone)
I love the camo but why have more ammo than MASH? (Don't)
Instead of blowing yourself up  take a love pill and laugh (You won't)
And I can't find my heart
Where did it go? Did I leave it in the cold?
So please give it back  'cause it's not yours to take
It must've fell when I lost my mind
Deep in the cut  drowning it in pain
Somebody help 'cause I can't find my way
Nobody move  nobody move
Ooh  ooh-ooh
Ah  ah
Somebody tell me how I'm supposed to feel
When I'm sitting here knowing this ain't real (Ain't real)
Why in the world would I give my heart to you?
Just to watch you throw it in the trash
Where werе you when I needed you the most?
Now I'm sitting hеre with a black hole in my chest

Wanna hear all the sounds and see all the sights

Gonna blow all my cash on anime (Yes)
Just point me to (Yes) the pachinko machines (Yes)
Can I just stay one more day?
Reckless nights in Tokyo
I'd probably hide in the suicide forest (Shit!)
This all started when I was a boy
I went to the dentist and he gave me a toy
Goku fucking ruined me
Don't ever wonder where I'm going
I always come back to you
Don't you worry about me

Don't walk away from me
Fragmented memories
Sentences incomplete
That's when she said
Don't wanna put up a fight anymore
I'm down to the end of my rope
And I'm freefalling
I'll search inside myself
I need to know why I act this way
A whisper turns to a scream
I can't ignore it no more
At the end of it all (End of it all)
No one wants to drink alone
From my eyewitness binoculars (Uh-huh)
To Argentina and Africa (Uh-huh)
We mastered the (What?) pressure (Yeah)
You laugh at us (You did)
Fill up the lavish pen if I needed to right my wrongs
I remember when your cousin was coming home
I bitched while we plotted to kill him 'cause we ain't know him
Unfamiliar faces make niggas nervous
Convicted court cases might hit the surface
Restricted territories might come through lurkin'
We ain't want none of that urgent call
That was the word 'fore we moved on 'em
Treat him like Joe the Plumber
I wonder if someone comin' can see this tool on him
Immature and retarded is what you call me
If I can right my wrongs and pen this verse I read

At the end of it all (End of it all)
No one wants to drink alone
You make my days bright as the sun
Each moment with you I adore
'Cause there is no one like you girl
I can't keep my cool
Lalalalalala...
There's nothing I wouldn't do
To put myself closer to you
Every time that I look in your eyes
I see a reflection of me
Don't ever leave me alone
Without you where would I be?
In and out and around
Here it comes
This is the best part
This is the best part
Getting weak
But I'm doing fine
How are you? How are you?
Everything and nothing
Twirling around in my head
Where am I going?
Can you take me with you?
Unrequited love
Time won't always heal
And it eats at my mind
Because you're the one that got away
No one like you
Unrequited love
Sometimes I feel alone
Tried to hold my breath
Somewhere deep in space
And I felt like you understood
What it truly means to be in love
This is what it feels like to have regrets
It is what it is"
