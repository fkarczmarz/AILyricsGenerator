"(Oh-oh)
I am in love with what we are
Not what we should be
Of this whole story (Oh-oh)
The animal inside
Let it live and die (Oh-oh)
Like it's the end of time
Like everything inside
Let it live and die
This is our last chance
Give me your hand
'Cause our world is spinning at the speed of light
The night is fading
Heart is racing
Now just come and love me like we're gonna die

So was that a good one?
You like the way I talk  my American accent
You like the way I dress  you like the way I walk
You say you think it's hot 'cause I'm a motherfucking boss
You never met a girl like this before
It's impossible to get you outta my head (Oh  hey)
And I keep fighting and fighting the feeling
I know I'm gonna love it  but we haven't even done it yet
I know we're both thinking
I wanna get you in your birthday suit
Who's gonna be the first to make the move?
You got any secret tattoos?
Ooh  goddamn
I wanna get you in your birthday suit
Is it gonna happen in a hotel room?

Alright
Some people  they got the big brains
They make all the computer games
Some people  they look so sexy
Pop and fizzle like a Pepsi
Some people  they got the money
Drive around in Lamborghinis
I don't need any of those things

Always leave before the cowboy comes
Now every morning I wake up with you right next to me
Everything stops when I'm with you

The topic of the day
Boys (Boys)  pretend they're men but they're just boys
They're always scratchin' on their toys
Let me tell you somethin' 'bout boys
'Bout boys ('Bout Boys)  'bout boys ('Bout boys)
'Bout boys ('Bout Boys)  'bout boys
Tell me  Rebecca
What do you know about boys?
Boys are horny in the morning
Then they tell me that they love me
Then I give them what they want
They always take me shopping
Boys don't play it like James Dean
Dressin' slick from top to bottom
Misbehave  go to school
To kick their ass like I'm their mother

Let me tell you somethin' 'bout boys

What do you know about boys?
Would you like to share it with the class?
If you looked in my boyfriend's brain
You would see it's kind of roomy
There's some balls and there's a sausage
Always pointing at my boobies
But don't get too complicated
Use big words or talk too quick
You must learn to just be patient
'Cause he's thinking with his  (*gasp*)
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
But if I want somebody to love
Guess I gotta try to put up
With the boys or I could turn gay
No  that's okay
So  if I want somebody to love
I just can't expect too much
From the boys  just use 'em for play
Yeah  that's okay
Let me tell you somethin' bout boys
'Bout boys ('Bout Boys)  'bout boys ('Bout boys)
'Bout boys
So  to sum up today's lesson
Boys  they might have sexy muscles
Or a shiny Lamborghini (Uh-huh)
But it's probably compensating
For an eeny teeny weenie
Eeny-teeny weenie (Hey)  eeny-teeny weenie (Hey)
Eeny-teeny weenie (Hey)  eeny-teeny weenie (Hey)
So  if I want somebody to love
I just can't expect too much
From the boys  just use 'em for play
Just use them to play with
(Boys  boys) They're really cute
You can kind of get down with them
And they're kind of furry and
They kind of smell but sometimes they-
Boys are  boys are okay

But what do you do if it don't?
Do you ever lie in bed with your three cats
And get obsessed with some boy you met
One time  three years ago in Nashville?
And you can't remember his last name
And think
Did I fuck my whole life up?
Did I miss my one true love?
Was he right in front of me at the dive bar?
Was that you with the cowboy blues?
Why'd I leave you standing there at the dive bar?
I miss you with the cowboy blue suit

I shot whiskey with for one night
And I don't remember if he remembers me

Every time I saw you  it was on and
One day you asked if we could just talk
And that's the reason why I'm walkin'
If I am honest
I'm just not hooked on your phonics
I'm not tryin' to be rude or crude
I just wanted one thing from you
And you got confused
You should know
That I love
You a lot
But I just can't date a dude with a vag'
When we fell in love  you made my heart drop
And you had me thinkin' 'bout you non-stop
But you cry 'bout this and whine about that
When you grow a pear  you can call me back
But you're actin' like a chick all the time
You were cool and now you're not  just like that
When you grow a pear  you can call me back

And no  I don't want to see your mangina
When you grow a pear  you can call me back

And you had me thinkin' 'bout you non-stop
But you cry 'bout this and whine about that

And now the dudes are linin' up  'cause they hear we got swagger
But we kick 'em to the curb unless they look like Mick Jagger

Fightin' 'til the end

I got a sick obsession
I'm seein' it in my dreams
I'm lookin' down every alley
I'm makin' those desperate calls
I'm stayin' up all night hopin'
Hittin' my head against the wall
I think about it all the time
I just can't get you off my mind
Won't listen to any advice
Momma's tellin' me I should think twice
But left to my own devices
My friends think I've gone crazy
My judgment's gettin' kinda hazy
My steeze is gonna be affected
If I keep it up like a lovesick crackhead
