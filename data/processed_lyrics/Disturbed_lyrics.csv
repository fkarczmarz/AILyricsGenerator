"Reflecting the pain that has taken you
From what's ailing you
So don't give up
When the demon that's inside you is ready to begin
And it feels like it's a battle that you will never win
When you're aching for the fire and begging for your sin
Lost in your world of lies
I find it so hard to believe in you
Can it be real this time
Or just a part of this game that we're playing through?
I won't give up

When the demon that's inside you is ready to begin
And it feels like it's a battle that you will never win
When you're aching for the fire and begging for your sin
Don't let it take your soul
We're going to fight this war
This is nothing worth dying for
Are you ready to begin?
This is a battle that we are gonna win
When you're aching for the fire and begging for your sin
When the demon that's inside you is ready to begin
And it feels like it's a battle that you will never win
When you're aching for the fire and begging for your sin
I'll be your reason to fight
Has cast a shadow on our world
Our devotion to our appetites
Betrayed us all
An apocalyptic plight
More destruction will unfold
Mother Earth will show her darker side
And take her toll
It's just another way to die
There can be no other reason why
You know we should have seen it coming
Consequences we cannot deny
Will be revealed in time
Glaciers melt as we pollute the sky
A sign of devastation coming
We don’t need another way to die
Can we repent in time?
The time bomb is ticking
And no one is listening
Our future is fading
Is there any hope we'll survive?

And the millions cry out to be saved
Our endless maniacal appetite
Left us with another way to die
It's just another way to die
Greed and hunger led to our demise
A path I can't believe we followed
Black agenda's rooted in a lie
Will we repent in time?
Species fall before our very eyes
A world that they cannot survive in
Left them with another way to die
Are we dead inside?
The time bomb is ticking
And no one is listening
Our future is fading
Is there any hope we'll survive?
And the millions cry out to be saved
Our endless maniacal appetite
Left us with another way to die
It's just another way to die
And the millions cry out to be saved
Our endless maniacal appetite
Left us with another way to die
It's just another way to die
It's just another way to die
No remnants were ever found of it
Feeling the hot bile
With every fake smile
Though no evidence was ever found
It never went away completely
I try to hide from the unholy sound of it
Another day gone
Another night’s dawn
Dark forces pull me underground
That never went away completely
How can I feel this empty?
I will not recover this time
Will I ever know peace of mind again?
I don’t believe it
I can’t achieve it
I think it all is just another sign
It never went away completely

Terror is coursing in me
(Death inside of me
Keeps a diligent watch on everything)
Dreading the final moment when I have to dream
(Keeps a terrible hold on my belief)
(Just waiting for the moment when I...)
And feel you die
In asylum
(I live a lie)
Don’t you know I’m in love with you
And I wasn’t ready
For asylum
(Relive a lie)
Into your grave
Your asylum
(Forgive the lie)
Overcome by the feeling
That I will get to join you in time
Death’s images are all around again
They’re right behind me
They’re going to find me
Judgment for the immortal sin
I know I’ll never know a peaceful night again
Afraid they’ll hear me
They don’t fear me
Punishment for the immoral crime
The debt was never paid completely
Terror is coursing in me

Keeps a diligent watch on everything)
Dreading the final moment when I have to dream

Overcome by the feeling
That I will get to join you in time
This has gone on too long (too long)
No more demonic dreams
Because her memory is killing me
In asylum

Into your grave
For asylum

Overcome by the feeling
That I will get to join you in time (without you)
Is it ever enough?
Will you ever find a new obsession?
What a bad man  like a blind man
So lost in the dark
Still searching for his own salvation
You can never return
And you’re never gonna find redemption now

You will never need to recognize yourself
To deceive
To remove all chance of doubt and be received
With your lie
The deception is complete when you concede
And decide
Penance can't absolve your sin
All your belief cannot absolve your sin
All your belief cannot absolve your sin
Believe when you lie
You will never need to recognize
The source of deceit
To renew your faith in God
You must believe in your lie
The redemption is complete
When you conceive and decline
To release your lives sacrificed to me

Typical enough for me
That I burn inside in agony
What power will enable me
To bury my vision?
The hunger coming over me
As I learn to hide the agony
To make a final remedy
To close that door once and for all
In a world that I don’t want to know
With a message that I never want to send
To be freed from all of this
I want you to quicken my end
Don’t tell me I cannot go
With a wound that refuses to mend
Deliver me from all of this
I want you to quicken my end
It seems the whole experience is
Terrible and crippling
The pain is much more than
Physical  beyond belief
When we’re alone
Typical enough for me
That I burn inside in agony
What power will enable me
To make this decision?
Despair has fallen over me
No way to hide the agony
Embracing my calamity
To save myself once and for all
In a world that I don’t want to know
With a message that I never want to send
To be freed from all of this
I want you to quicken my end

I'm alive
I'm alive
I'm alive
I'm alive
I'm alive
I'm alive
Been haunted by a million screams
But I can hear the marching feet
They're moving into the street
They say the danger's gone away
But I can see the fire's still alight
There's too many men
Too many people
Making too many problems
And there's not much love to go ‘round
Can't you see
This is a land of confusion?
This is the world we live in
And these are the hands we're given
To make it a place worth living in

But there's not much love to go ‘round
Tell me why this is a land of confusion
This is the world we live in
And these are the hands we're given
Use them and let's start trying
To make it a place worth living in
I remember long ago
And all the stars were bright
All through the night
In the wake of this madness
As I held you tight
So long ago
I won't be coming home tonight
My generation will put it right
We're not just making promises
That we know we'll never keep
Too many men
Too many people
Making too many problems
And not much love to go ‘round

This is a land of confusion?
And these are the hands we're given
To make it a place worth fighting for
This is the world we live in
And these are the names we're given
Stand up and let's start showing
In a place where innocents play
I was mourning as the headlines shouted his name
They didn't waste any time
I was disgusted when the madman's image appeared at the top of the screen
Some were barely alive
Too many didn't survive
Still they kept repeating headlines shouting the name
Do they not realize
The future demons with the hope of becoming the one at the top of the screen?
They've thrown morality away
You made sure the world will remember the name
But didn't the thought even enter your mind
You'd give a new legion of monsters a reason to take your life
The pictures drove me insane
Can't get them out of my brain
You made certain they were right at the top of the page
You disrespected the dead
When the only name was of the one who committed the murder at the top of the page
The madman watching with glee
As the herd of innocents flee
They saw it all unfold right on the face of the screen
Perhaps they could be the one
Who'd become famous for the acts of terror reflected on the face of the screen?

Never again
They had a frightening desire for genocide
They wouldn't stop 'til what was left of my family died
Hell-bent on taking over the world
You couldn't hide in the shroud of conformity
We can't forget how we were devastated by the beast
And how we pleaded with our captors for release
We were hunted for no reason at all
One of the darkest times in our history
All that I have left inside
Is a soul that's filled with pride
I tell you never again
Their depraved society
Didn't end up killing me
Scream with me never again
Not again
A generation that was persecuted endlessly
Exterminated by the Nazi war machine
To realize how we lost our humanity
You dare to tell me that there never was a Holocaust?
You think that history will leave their memory lost?
Another Hitler using fear to control

The truth is waiting there for you to find it
A clear reminder of how it began
Deep inside your memory
You turned away as you struggled to find it
You heard the call as you walked away
A voice of calm from within the silence
And for what seemed an eternity
You waited hoping it would call out again
You heard the shadow beckoning
You held your guard as you walked away
When you think all is forsaken
Listen to me now (All's not forsaken)
You need never feel broken again
An unforgivable tragedy
The answer isn't where you think you'd find it
Prepare yourself for the reckoning
For when your world seems to crumble again
You're the one who can redefine it
Don't let hope become a memory
Let the shadow permeate your mind
And reveal the thoughts that were tucked away
So that the door can be opened again

Giving me the strength to face them
Feeling it taking over now
On a path to take it all away
There can be no better way of
Knowing
In a world beyond controlling
Are you gonna deny the savior
In front of your eyes?
Stare into the night
Power beyond containing
Are you gonna remain a slave
For the rest of your life?
Give into the night
Give into the night
In a world beyond controlling
Are you gonna deny the savior
In front of your eyes?
Stare into the night
Power beyond containing
Are you gonna remain a slave
For the rest of your life?
Give into the night
Night
Night
Night
Give into the night
Night

Give into the night
I've come to talk with you again
Because a vision softly creeping
Left its seeds while I was sleeping
And the vision that was planted in my brain
Still remains within the sound of silence
In restless dreams  I walked alone
Narrow streets of cobblestone
'Neath the halo of a street lamp
I turned my collar to the cold and damp
When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light
That split the night and touched the sound of silence
And in the naked light  I saw
Ten thousand people  maybe more
People talking without speaking
People hearing without listening
People writing songs that voices never shared
And no one dared disturb the sound of silence
Silence like a cancer grows
Hear my words that I might teach you
Take my arms that I might reach you
But my words like silent raindrops  fell
And echoed in the wells of silence

And the people bowed and prayed
To the neon God they made
And the sign flashed out its warning
In the words that it was forming
And the sign said  The words of the prophets are written on the subway walls and tenement halls
It's as if the entire world's fallen in love with their insanity
Hear the innocent voices scream
As their tormentors laugh through all of it
No forgiveness from all I've seen
The degradation  I cannot forget
So sleep soundly in your beds tonight
For judgement falls upon you at first light
I'm the hand of God  I'm the dark messiah
I'm the vengeful one
(Look inside and see what you're becoming)
In the blackest moment of a dying world
What have you become?
(Look inside and see what you're becoming)
As the violence surges
And the teeming masses have been terrorized
The human predators all gone mad
Are reaping profits born from their demise
The rabid media plays their roles
Stoking the flames of war to no surprise
Only too eager to sell their souls
For the apocalypse must be televised

Thought it was over with
Thought I was over it
Thought I evicted you from my heart
Kicked you out of my mind
So nothing left of you
Wouldn't be left behind
You just won't go away
You stay in my head
You still haunt my heart
Still see you everywhere
You're still in every room
Feel you with every move
I can't go on without erasing you from my heart
Tired of feeling this pain
Seems you're the only ghost
I just can't chase away

Angered eyes that don't even know who I am
Looking to kill again (They will kill again)
As the unknown enemies surround me
Wicked laughter resonates inside my head
And I am filled with dread (And adrenaline)
What did I do? Why do I deserve this?
Give me a reason why?
Then it all goes a blur
Let instinct take flight
Find my hands on his throat
Yet hear myself say
'cause it isn't in your blood
Not a part of what you're made
So let this be understood
Somebody taught you how to hate
Dead to everyone

In perfect disarray (So innocent)
Nothing predefined (All different)

No deliverance

Is it still in your soul? (No saving you)

That I'm better when I am with you
You delivered me from the pain
In my life
Easy now to recognize
All the misery I have been through
It was beating me to submission
Till the day you arrived
Strength I had lost was revived
And building inside
And we both know why
'Cause you're mine
I knew I could be whole
If you were mine
I'll vanquish any foe
Because you're mine
Been betrayed too many times
Didn't think I would ever recover
That it'd haunt me for the rest of my life
Then you opened up my eyes
And you helped me rediscover
Were the one who resurrected
A man who had died

Feared that it all was just a little too late

'Cause you're mine

If you were mine

Because you're mine

Because you're mine
I can take over the world"
