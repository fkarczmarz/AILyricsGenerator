"Conversation got boring
You said you'd go in to bed soon
So I snuck off to your bedroom
And I thought I'd just wait there (Ugh)
Until I heard you come up the stairs (Ugh)
And I pretended I was sleeping (Ugh)
And I was hoping you would— (Ayy)
Since I said that I was hitting in the club
The Sun be coming up on me
'Cause you be sending me texts-es
And come get all of this love
(It's 5 o'clock in the morning) You ain't got to remind me
Might go crazy
And she'll be waiting on me naked with one of my chains on
She might come and find me (Ah-ah-ah)
And then ask me kindly— (Ah-ah-ah)
Do I want her to go crazy? We do this every night

It's 5 o' clock in the morning (Yeah)
You said you'd go in to bed soon (Let's go)
So I snuck off to your bedroom (Come on)
And I thought I'd just wait there (Wait on me)
Until I heard you come up the stairs (I won't let you stay lonely)
And I pretended I was sleeping (All right)
And I was hoping you would creep in (Goodnight)
It's 5 o' clock in the morning
The conversation got boring
You said you'd go in to bed soon
So I snuck off to your bedroom
And I thought I'd just wait there
Until I heard you come up the stairs
And I was hoping you would creep in
And these females got me stalling
What is he doing? (Oh) What is he doing?
'Cause I keep checking my cell phone and these missed calls
If you don't get your ass up out of that club
And do you know what time it is?
(It's 5 o'clock in the morning) Ooh (Ooh)
But you ain't got to worry about nothing (Worry 'bout nothing)
She might come and find me-ee (Nah-nah-nah)
Do I want her to go crazy? (Crazy) We do this every night
It's 5 o' clock in the morning (Yeah)
You said you'd go in to bed soon (Let's go)
So I snuck off to your bedroom (Come on)
Until I heard you come up the stairs (I won't let you stay lonely)
And I pretended I was sleeping (All right)
It's 5 o' clock in the morning
The conversation got boring
You said you'd go in to bed soon
So I snuck off to your bedroom
And I thought I'd just wait there
Until I heard you come up the stairs
And I was hoping you would creep in
But the T-shirt that I left over your house the last time I came and put it on ya
Too many thirsty girls up in this club for me to leave here with one of them—that's why I call her
(It’s 5 o' clock in the morning) And you yawning
So I let you—that's how you show me love
It's 5 o' clock in the morning (Hahahahaha)
The conversation got boring
You said you'd go in to bed soon
So I snuck off to your bedroom
And I thought I'd just wait there
Until I heard you come up the stairs
And I pretended I was sleeping
And I was hoping you would creep in

So what you wanna do little baby
Now all my ladies in the house say hoe
And all my hoes in the house say lady
I’m so considerate  I never quit a bitch
No matter how many niggas hit  or how many dick she licked
I please that clitoris  I give her a kiss and shit
When other niggas don’t stay long enough  they get the digits and split
If ain't nobody telling you that you are pretty
That's just because you are and they do not want to admit it
Look at all that ass  you ain't got to have titties
At least you part of the itty bitty titty committee really
You goin let em style on you  or you can let em talk
Stop hanging round them stupid bitches  you’d be better off
Them hoes dirty birds  Atlanta Hawks
Go on wear them granny draws
Matter of fact go put that dress on  and don't wear any drawls and come sit on Santa Claus
We can take some pictures with the islands in the back drop
We can go to PC  but you’ll still be my laptop

Was ever gon' make it out the grass patch
Seven heels had me looking for a better deal
A hood nigga  I couldn't count on the NASDAQ
They was picking on me and wouldn't give me my hat back
Nobody thought I knew what I was doing
But nobody achieved what I achieved
If only somebody could have just seen what I seen
Especially if you ain't even put in a day of work
And my daddy proud of me
But he got too much pride to say it out loud for me
The only thing that I ask is that they hold it down for me
But motherfuckers will say that you changed
And they the ones that wouldn't last a day in this game
But I guarantee that I will never succumb to the fame
But I'd rather grow up than to stay eighteen
Life goes on and hopefully only great things
Traveling the world and seeing shit that I ain't seen
And realize how I been actin' and how I been dressing
I realize I can make an impression
I think it's time for some motherfucking confessions
My answer to every question was Fuck y'all
All I need is this 9-11 to fuck broads
I just need to find a seven with enough flaws
My last album ain't do numbers like I wanted to
But that was God tryna ask me what I'm gonna do
He said I hate to put obstacles right in front of you
But you gotta learn to get out of what you're goin' through
Til' Molly came and put a fuckin' wall up in my mind
How many niggas told me I was gonna fail?
'Cause I got a list of niggas that can go to Hell
They feel like I owe 'em something 'cause they know me well
Calling me a sellout cause I won't come back and smoke a L
The same nigga that told me I had a hit
Charged me $300 to put it up in his mix
Now suicide lookin' better than hittin' the lick
'Cause the whole time they knew that I was livin' out my whip
Cause he walk up to me and say:
That just wasn't the right life
And all them girls yellin' at me from in front of the moon
Like I woke up in that Bugatti and went right back to sleep
The star collecting checks and ball up in the season
But ain't nobody give a fuck when ain't nobody give a fuck
And every time they ask me for something
I know I fucked up 'cause I'm a grown man
He said You wanna make God laugh?
Then look up in the sky and try and come up with your own plan
But I won't have 'em if I keep disrespecting my friends
 brush 'em off - HEY!
 brush 'em off - HEY!
 brush 'em off - HEY!
 this what we do - HEY! (in the air)
