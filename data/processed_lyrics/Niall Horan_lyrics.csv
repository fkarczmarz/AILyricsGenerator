lyrics
"We were just lovers in the dark
You've known someone for a long time
But you never really know who they are
It feels like it was only last week
I was trippin' right into your heart
If we're not gonna do this honestly
When I was on my knees in the darkness
You left me with nothing
Now I'm lyin' in the arms of a stranger
But why do I think of you?
You left me with nothing
Now I'm lookin' in the eyes of a stranger
Just tryna get over you
I chase an old love just to feel loved
But it gave me nothin' that was real
But I guess I'm holdin' onto you still

When I was on my knees in the darkness
You left me with nothing
Now I'm lyin' in the arms of a stranger
But why do I think of you?
Now I'm lookin' in the eyes of a stranger
Just tryna get over you
Standin' out in the crowd
Nobody can hear me now
I'm tryna get over you
Standin' out in the crowd
If only you could see me now
I'm tryna get over you
You left me with nothing
And now I'm lyin' in the arms of a stranger
Why do I think of you?
You left me with nothing
And now I'm lookin' in the eyes of a stranger
Just tryna get over you
You left me with nothing
And now I'm lookin' in the eyes of a stranger
Just tryna get over you
Wonder what you're doin' now
At your favourite place  you go and list the names
Is there one you're leavin' out?
I'm not sayin' that you're lyin'
But you're leavin' out the truth
And I'm not sayin' that you're guilty
'Cause I don't have any proof
Feelin' like I'm goin' crazy
And I don't know what to do
'Cause on paper  you don't break them
But it hurts so bad the way you bend the rules
Mmm
The way you bend the rules
Mmm
Someone makes you laugh  I can't help but ask
But you won't say what it's about
I pour myself a glass  it won't be the last
Just our medicine for now

Fumblin' for your keys  then I kissed you
Ask me if I wanna come inside
'Cause we didn't wanna end the night
Then you took my hand and I followed you
Yeah  I see us in black and white
Crystal clear on a starlit night
In all your gorgeous colours
I promise that I'll love you for the rest of my life
See you standing in your dress
Swear in front of all our friends
There'll never be another
I promise that I'll love you for the rest of my life
Now we're sittin' here in your livin' room
Tellin' stories while we share a drink or two
And there's a vision I've been holdin' in my mind
We're sixty-five and you ask
When did I first know  I always knew
And I see us in black and white
Crystal clear on a starlit night
In all your gorgeous colours
I promise that I'll love you for the rest of my life
See you standing in your dress
Swear in front of all our friends
There'll never be another

And I want the world to witness when we finally say I do
It's the way you love  I gotta give it back to you
I can't promise picket fences or sunny afternoons
But at night  when I close my eyes
I see us in black and white
Crystal clear on a starlit night
There'll never be another
I promise that I'll love you
I see us in black and white
Crystal clear on a starlit night

There'll never be another (Never be)
I promise that I'll love you for the rest of my life
And there'll never be another
 we are stargazing now
 I don't like it
 we're falling
 oh
 love me when the lights burn low
 baby
 baby
 I don't like it
 oh
 love me when the lights burn low
 baby
 baby
 ooh
 love me when the lights burn low
 baby
 you know I ain't too proud
 we do this every time
 but we're running in circles
 run away
 I got a feeling that it's time to let it go
 I knew that this was doomed from the get-go
 special
 the sex though
 the echoes
 let it go
 but we're running in circles
 run away
 so I don't take the blame
 but we're running in circles
 better run faster than my bullet
 better run faster than my bullet
 but we're running in circles
 run away
 so I don't take the blame
 but we're running in circles
It's your ocean I wanna swim in
It's your show and I'm just watchin'
Losin' you is not an option
If you leave me like a message in a bottle
And you don't come back tomorrow
At least you came tonight
It's easy to pretend that I'm not caught up
But when you get hot and bothered
I can't give up the fight
Love the way you hurt me
Tell me that you love me
And it doesn't even cross your mind
Daydreamin' 'bout where your lips been
Still get up and forgive you

Can we share a drink and let go of the pressure?
Dear patience
'Cause the last time that we talked seems like forever

Maybe it's time to put your dress away

I keep staring at that little white number
The one in the picture
When we lose our temper
You'd look at it for hours

Make up in the drawer

I catch your eyes and don't blink an eyelid
Feels like the world locked us on an island
An island without waves
I try and try to forget you
But your mother thinks I'm the best for you
Try and try to erase you
But you won't disappear
Feels like every time I turn a corner  you're standin' right there
Over my shoulder  you're everywhere
I swear it's hard to think  it's hard to breathe when you're in the air
I try to run  but you're everywhere I go
When I think I'm all alone
And my heart's under control
Why is lovin' you not fair?
You're everywhere
The ground beneath my feet's a bit colder
I see your face in people I don't know
Feels like the world is twistin' in slo-mo
And I'm stuck in one place (Oh)

When you know there's something missing
Then you rest your head upon my chest

There's a light in the dark
Still a flicker of hope that you first gave to me
That I wanna keep
Please don't leave

In this house of broken hearts
We made our love out of stacks of cards
And yes  we tried to hold on tight
'Cause we knew our love was hard to find
And our paper houses reach the stars
Till we break and scatter worlds apart
Yeah  I paid the price and owned the scars
Why did we climb and fall so far?
We held our cards  built them high
But way too close to the light
So turn your head and let us go
I learned to breathe on my own
And our paper houses reach the stars
Till we break and scatter worlds apart
Yeah  I paid the price and owned the scars
Why did we climb and fall so far?

I don't wanna hurt this much
I can feel you slippin' away

Why do we climb and fall so far?
We came down 'cause there was nothing holdin' us
Is it wrong that I still wonder where you are?
Is it wrong that I still don't know my heart?
Are you all dressed up but with nowhere to go?
Are your tears falling down when the lights are low?
Another Friday night tryna put on a show
Do you hate the weekend 'cause nobody's callin'?
I've still got so much love hidden beneath this skin
So  darlin'
Put a little love on me
Put a little love on me
When the lights come up and there's no shadows dancin'
I look around as my heart is collapsin'
'Cause you're the only one I need
To put a little love on me

'Til there were no more words

Until we saw our worst

Take me back  take me back
To San Francisco
I know what we had would never last
Now I can't let go of you
I might show up on your doorstep  soakin' wet
Say I'm done runnin' from the one that I want so bad
Take me back  take me back
Drunk dialin'  full dive in
Don't you tell me that it's too late now
'Cause I'm pacing  I keep breaking
Is there a way to make it up somehow?
