lyrics
"Said they all wanna live  but I just wanna die
I got a knife  don't wanna fight
I wanna take your fucking life  and end it right on sight
Then I trot to the rocks  with me own blood clot
With the slot of the skull hangin' in the fuckin' river  ho
Got a pound in the blunt  I'm loungin'
Pour another round  I'm drownin'
Climb to the top  I will jump off the mountain (Ayy)
Swerv-swervin' in a motherfucking all-white Crown Vic'
Blue light mounted  siren howlin'
Stole it from a cop because he popped another brown kid (Ayy)
Got the town lit up by the flame that I made
From my grey serenade  make way for the Plague
On the seventh day  grey bodies lay in they graves
Still got the badge  still got the gun
Still got the patch  still got the stun
Put the Glock to my skull then I—

No halo hovering  follow me in your grave
Ain't got no Patek because I'll be here 'til the end of fuckin' times
Thy kingdom come  thy will be done
And still you wonder  Who am I?
I am the devil's son  born and raised
Preachin' $uicide  googly eyes
Tell me more—okay
Praise the fucking devil  God can suck my dick
I scorch the plains
I'm lord of the plagues
Load up my—
Wait a fuckin' minute  I got more to say
Threatenin' swordplay
Some would say nay  'cause the tip of my sword blade dipped in chlordane
Lord Plague breakin' fortés
$carecrow in the corn maze  hauntin' board games
For war  we pray
Plague is cold in Norway hangin' from the doorframe with the sores and stain

Letting a new day begin
Letting a new day begin
Hold to the time that you know
Rather shoot up till I fall
Murder on call with the *59
I been hanging every day from a lifeline
While these fuckers had a dinner every night time
Spray paint the walls with blood and whatever
I don't think I can explain any better
I'm $carecrow the terror and  live for the lesser
My birth was an error
I am the Lord of Loneliness
He said he hopes for the best
Told him I'm ropin' my neck
Then I woke up chokin' from the hole in my chest
Somehow I manage to function and hope
Every day got a lump in my throat
That's them pills swallowed whole
Smoke a blunt and then fuck all these hoes
End up humpin' they throat
This world was never made for me

All these cunts with a fat ass talking 'bout my nut
Got the last laugh  but only as long as the last laugh
Grey flags  so your death mask half-cocked
Shawty blast  so these hands pop gats with the blast
At last  the moment has passed  I got a gash in my thick skull
Throw me in the trash  call for a pickup
Death over bitches all because of Krystal
Blood spillin' in my motherfucking pimp cup
Used to love the bitch  now she suckin' other dicks

Tell me what you know 'bout a motherfucker out the bottom
With a gold grill gleamin'  makin' all these hoes problems
Stalker  creepin' out the fuckin' dungeon
Switchblade on 'em  hit the guts like a pumpkin  dumpin'
Thirty rounds off the clip  off rip
Too thick with the stick  bet I won't miss
Lil $lick real sick  don't talk shit
Ruby was a motherfucking reject
Then I cut my wrists  and now I motherfucking bleed checks
Still broke after all the motherfucking weed gets rolled
Hoes askin' if I see a ghost  tell 'em  No

She choke from the deep-throat  three feet of rope  lethal
Slay the fuckin' sheep  so evil  I'ma hang myself
Ruby got a cult now  hoes tryna bolt down
Ruby the result of a reject from a small town
Turned into a demon  I'm evolved now

Fuck life  and everything that fucking comes with it
Put the barrel in my mouth  blow my fucking brains out
I don't give a fuck about anything  now I'm finished
Never killed a motherfucker  but that's 'bout to fucking change
Throw my ass in jail  and just let me fucking decay
The world is fucking grey  I grip the fucking blade
And carve a line across my neck  and now I'm fucking saved
Bitch  I pull up in that motherfucking donk
Florida to N.O.  we down to catch a homi'
Demonic logic  I might vomit from popping narcotics
Biologic product of a savage  my mama's psychotic
Here to abolish  killing trees with the touch of my finger
G-R-E-Y  hear the war cry of thousands that's burning
But it's switchin' like the nigga with the Yu-Gi-Oh! cards
Against all odds  eyes on another when you go against god
The ultimate is watching  so I guess I'm in charge
And if you think that you're hard  then I'ma act retarded
Why you ride bikes? Better off in a car bitch
The ultimate martian in the hood when the hood is lookin' like hobgoblin
Know a couple niggas that can afford the apartments
Back from BLVCKLVND so I'm black and I'm heartless
Shots in the dark  I'm an excellent marksman
Chop a choppa down  come around with karma
That's why a nigga vibe when a nigga want drama
But I wish a nigga would like Cosmo and Wanda
No Timmy got a long black Jimmy
Smoking on that season milli and the plug is outta Philly
And I still tote the semi when I'm runnin' through the city
Like a motherfucking renegade
Reminiscing 'bout the violence of my old days
All black  bring it back to my old ways

Drowning in my thoughts around the sound will fill me endlessly
Feeling all my days are numbered  count until the end of me
Angel wings broken but I'll never let the devil creep
ULT for life and I'ma rap until the death of me

Feelin' like all my days are numbered  count until the end of me
Angel wings broken but I'll never let the devil creep
Ratatatatatata  boom!
Two strikes  turn that pussy to a sacrifice
Slash and gut the gar  ash the blunt and park
Roll the window down  and ask the price
I've always hated flashin' lights  I'd rather grab the mask and knife
Snag the cash in spite the fact I smashed your bitch for asking nice
I'm passin' pipes and glass and spikes  I bag the ice
Ignite the rags in gasoline  one strike of the match
And now we talking thrice  three strikes
I might forget the events of tonight  Ruby all bite
Cut Throat  Cut Throat
Cut Throat  Cut Throat
Cut Throat
Ratatatatatata—
Cut Throat  Cut Throat
Cut Throat  Cut Throat

Everybody know my rep since 1994 (four!)

Wakin' up  dirty sodas get poured in
I had some blues  but I sold 'em
Keep K's  and Glocks but they stolen
I might just flip 'em and profit
Make more off licks  run your pockets
My OG's poppin' a rocket
I pray to God they free Gozm
If you can't get 'em  I got 'em
Pull up and handle the problem
Squeeze three  hear it move through the breeze
Now you standing bloody  can't breathe
Got goonies who gone off that tweak
Sip syrup and drank Hennessy
That just be the truth through these streets
7th Ward where I snort a slug and cross the fucking line
West Bank/Northside 'till the coffin ride
Who am I? I am God  I am Basquiat
Trap-a-holics mixtapes
Man  drop this shit for these fuck niggas
Grey*59 signed
Rough diamonds  tryna shine
Christ and I  $ui-$uicide
Diving head first when crucified
Lucifer cried when I told him I'm choosing to die
Noose and a knife  but I ain't use the knife
To loosen the noose  keep it tight
Abusing the truth  that's a lie
Fuckboy with a ski mask think he gon' rob me blind?
Fuckboy better think fast when he cock the nine
Fuckboy better—
7th Ward where I snort a slug and cross the fucking line
Yet another line inside the cup  another line you should look up
Another line that shook you up  I signed the line for Lucifer

Pop a jig  load the rig with that motherfucking China white
Fuck it if I die tonight  I'm gamblin' with my fucking life
West Bank  Northside 'til the coffin ride
Who am I? I am God  I am Basquiat
Yung Kurt Cobain with the scarred veins
Mentally deranged  hear the crows say my name ($carecrow!)
I'm just wastin' my time  I'm just wastin' my breath
Why can't I just die? Why can't I go next?
Why we get no respect? Why I love holdin' TEC's?
This ain't no motherfuckin' trend  every day feel like the end"
