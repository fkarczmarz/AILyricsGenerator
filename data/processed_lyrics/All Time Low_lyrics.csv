lyrics
" steal a kiss in the dark
 sound the alarm
King and queen of the streets again
Got young love running through our veins
And it keeps us numb like novacaine
'Cause we got a whole lot of fight in us
And I see a long road that we gotta follow
Before tomorrow catches up
Hold on to this feeling
All our friends are leaving
And we ain't got nowhere to go
Caught up in the afterglow
(Caught up in the afterglow)
Can't stay here but you can't go home
Did you hear that line somewhere before?
And you look just fine on your own
But we look better in the afterglow

And I see a long road that we gotta follow
Before tomorrow catches up

And we ain't got nowhere to go
Caught up in the afterglow
We ain't got nowhere to go
Caught up in the afterglow
Hold on to this feeling
'Cause we ain't got nowhere to go
Caught up in the afterglow
When the lights go down
Come find me in the afterglow
Waiting to be found
I'll meet you in the afterglow
When the lights go down
Come find me in the afterglow
Waiting to be found
You felt it once before  I know you did
I can see it
I understand
Backseat serenade  dizzy hurricane
You're salty like a summer day
Kiss the sweat away to your radio (Radio  radio)
Backseat serenade  little hand grenade
You're salty like a summer day
You take me over  I throw you up against the wall
We've seen it all before but this one's different
It's deliberate
You send me reeling  calling out to you for more
The value of this moment lives in metaphor
Yeah  through it all

A million ways to think about you
I can't say I expected anything different
Cardiac attack in the cradle of the summer
You know I want you in the worst way
I need you like cake on my birthday
The way you operate is so sweet
I need you like cake on my birthday
I got a lot of long nights in my life right now
And a lot of spare time to waste with you
I can't say I expected something so visceral

You were fake  I was great  nothing personal
I'm walking  who's laughing now?
(Who's laughing  who's laughing now?)
I'm wasted  wasting time
You talk for hours but you're wasting lines
A pretty face  but the chase ain't worth the prize
I'm gonna break your little heart
Watch you take the fall
Laughing all the way to the hospital
'Cause there's nothing surgery can do
When I break your little heart in two
I'm gonna break your little heart in two
Party queen  draws a scene  so ridiculous
Little dress  maybe less  so conspicuous
You're falling  who's crashing now?

Wait  I think we're on to something
We can't run from fate
But we can let it take us down
Down this road  where all our colours run together
Let's take the worst and make it better
Let's take this mess and make a home
I know it gets hard for you to stay
But do you really wanna throw it all away?
(I'm thinking)
That we could make forever after all
Finding the gold in our darkest moment
Watching the roads turning into white roses  roses
And we don't ever have to leave these walls

And mark a place in time for every chance you took?
Don't get me wrong
I know you've got your life in place
I'm sure I'll get the picture
And stop waiting up
When it all comes down
To a sunrise on the East Side
Will you be there to carry me home
The remains of my wasted youth?
This wasted time on you
Has left me shaking in waiting
Shaking in waiting for something more
Tonight is alive with the promise of a street-fight
And there's money on the table
That says your cheap shots won't be able to break bones
I've yet to break a sweat
I'll make your past regret its future
Here's to you

While drowning in a river of denial
Tequila shots in the dark scene of the crime
Suburban living with a feeling that I'm giving up
Everything for you
That you were oh-oh-over me?
I think that I should go (Go)
And something's telling me to leave but I won't
It took a lot to take you home
One stupid call and I end up alone
Dancing in the alley with the street-rat night-life

There's a story at the bottom of this bottle and I'm the pen
When the lights go off I want to watch the way you take the stage by storm
The way you wrap those boys around your finger
Go on and play the leader' cause you know it's what you're good at
The low road for the fast track  make every second last
'Cause I got your picture  I'm coming with you  Dear Maria  count me in

Make it count when I'm the one who's selling you out
'Cause it feels like stealing hearts  calling your name from the crowd
Live and let live  you'll be the showgirl of the home team
I'll be the narrator telling another tale of the American dream
I see your name in lights  we can make you a star

Who am I to tell you that you need to change?
Her closet's such a mess
Filled up with all the skeletons she's kept
Nobody's perfect I confess
Dirty laundry is piling in her room
I don't care about what you did
Only care about what we do
Dirty laundry
Looks good on you
Now here's some honesty
Sometimes I trip over your history
Wish I could change my mind
But it's the things I shouldn't see that always catch my eye

Like time is not a crocodile
But I don't mind

Weather's always nice inside my head
I turn my music up so loud
Everything is fine and nothing matters anyway
If I don't care
Pull the curtains back
I think my neighborhood's on fire again
The kids are not alright it seems
At least they went outside this time
The gunshot has gone off
But I am swimming in a footrace
There's no finish line in sight
And they already gave the first place medal

I slept through another day
So long and thanks for the memories
I'd like to say that it's been real
But it's been fake as hell
I caught you lyin' in my face again
You got me hangin' by a thread again
Feel like a kite in a hurricane
So cut the string and let me fly away
Now we're burnin' at both ends
Like candles in the wind
My eyelids collapsin'
Collateral damage
I know it's better if we both say

Weekend wonderful
Fade-away youth
Summer symphony
What could I do?
We were getaway green
In a world of black and white
Getaway green
Like the Costa Mesa traffic lights
Tellin' me I'm what you need

Undefined and out of mind 'til you get lost and lonely too

Caught in the tension  silent confessions
At the foot of your bed
Glitter and crimson  fighting the friction
What a perfect mess
I wonder if you feel kinda like I feel
Temporary
Fixed on a moment just out of focus
And we can't quite see
Being us ain't good for us
And I don't wanna wait 'til the sunshine fades
And bury our love in a shallow grave

How long can we be
Happy if happy ain't meant for us?

Lost in empty pillow talk again
This bed's an island made of feathered down
And I'm stuck here alone
Little else but memories of you on memory foam
To pool my thoughts and find the words to say
If these sheets were the states and you were miles away
I'd fold them end over end to bring you closer to me
Because I don't sleep at all without you pressed up against me
I settle for long distance calls
I'm lost in empty pillow talk again

Paying dues to every moment wasted on words left unsaid

Hoping my night could be better than theirs in the end

Wait outside  I hope the air will serve to remind you
That my heart is as cold as the clouds of your breath
The kids in the dark  the kids in the dark
Here we are at the end of the road
A road that's quietly caving in
Come too far to pretend that we don't
We don't miss where we started
Looking back  I see a setting sun
And watch my shadow fade into the floor
I am left standing on the edge
Wondering how we got this far  how we got this far
They left us alone  the kids in the dark
To burn out forever  or light up a spark
We come together  state of the art
We'll never surrender  the kids in the dark
So let the world sing  What a shame! Hey!
What a shame! Hey! Beautiful scars on critical veins
Come together  state of the art
The kids in the dark

Here we are at the top of the hill
A hill that's quietly crumbling
Been a while since you dressed for the kill
The kill that sent me tumbling
Looking up  I see a falling star
And watch its fire burn into the floor
And I am left standing on the edge
Wondering why we fall so hard  why we fall so hard
They left us alone  the kids in the dark
To burn out forever  or light up a spark
We come together  state of the art

Chasing around to a flicker beat
Making mistakes that were made for us
We brushed them off like paper cuts
I miss you every single way-ay-ay
We said forever but forever wouldn't wait for us
You were my last young renegade heartache
It only took one night
We had to say goodbye
Underneath the lights of a motorway
That's where I go to keep your ghost away
We used to be such a burning flame
Now we're just smoke in the summer rain

Who I used to be
And who I’ll be tomorrow
When the champagne blows my mind
Thrills don’t come for free
The price you pay for dreams
In a sea of strangers
I can’t find me anymore
I keep thinking about you
How you level me out sometimes

I'm a walking travesty
But I'm smiling at everything
You can take back your misery
They're better off without you (they're better off without you)
Arrogant boy cause a scene like you're supposed to
They'll fall asleep without you
You're lucky if your memory remains
Give me therapy
I'm a walking travesty
But I'm smiling at everything
You can take back your misery
But I'm smiling at everything
So I know I'm right on track
It's hard for me to make amends
When you stab me in the back
Sailing on to another sorry shore
Just settle down
I earned my place with the tidal waves
I can't escape this feeling that something ain't right
I carved my name as I crashed the gates
Still I can't escape this feeling that something ain't right
Why don't you think before you speak?
'Cause you don't know me at all
Tell me how you really feel
Write it on the bathroom wall
If anyone was watching
I know you'd say nothing at all

Still I can't escape this feeling that something ain't right
Why don't you think before you speak?
'Cause you don't know me at all
Spread your lies like fireflies
In a white hot summer trying to pull me under
You sharpen words to use like knives
I earned my place with the tidal waves

 wonder if you feel it too
 so much that we didn't see through
 I know that I need you

Are you livin' well?
Are you livin' well?
Are you livin' well in a livin' hell?
(Are you livin' well? Are you livin' well?)
So smile for the cameras and say that your life
Ain't as tame as the ones you're shit talkin'
Are you livin' well? Are you livin' well?
Somebody loves you for yourself

Somebody loves you for yourself
Somebody loves you for yourself
Everyone wants to be somebody
I just want you to see how good you are
You don't have to lean on the crutch of a daydream
To see that you shine like a star
Somebody loves you for yourself
Somebody loves you for yourself
Are you livin' well?
Are you livin' well?
Turn a page  I'm a book half unread
I wanna feel weightless and that should be enough
But I'm stuck in this fucking rut
Waiting on a second-hand pick-me-up
And I'm over
Getting older
If I could just find the time
Then I would never let another day go by
I'm over
Getting old
Maybe it's not my weekend
But it's gonna be my year
And I'm so sick of watching
While the minutes pass as I go nowhere
And this is my reaction
To everything I fear
'Cause I've been going crazy
I don't want to waste another minute here

Make believe that I impress
That every word by design turns a head
I wanna feel weightless  'cause that would be enough
If I could just find the time
Then I would never let another day go by
I'm over
Getting old
Maybe it's not my weekend
But it's gonna be my year
And I'm so sick of watching
While the minutes pass as I go nowhere
And this is my reaction
To everything I fear
'Cause I've been going crazy
I don't want to waste another minute here
This could be all I've waited for
(I've waited  I've waited for)
And this could be everything
I don't wanna dream anymore
Maybe it's not my weekend
But it's gonna be my year
And I've been going crazy
I'm stuck in here
Maybe it's not my weekend
But it's gonna be my year
And I'm so sick of watching
While the minutes pass as I go nowhere
And this is my reaction
To everything I fear
'Cause I've been going crazy"
