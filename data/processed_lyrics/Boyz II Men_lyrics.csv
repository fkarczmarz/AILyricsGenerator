lyrics
"The warmth of
Days gone by
When you were mine
But now those days are memories in time
Life's empty
Without you
By my side
My heart belongs to you
No matter what I try
When I get the courage up to love somebody new
It always falls apart 'cause they just can't compare to you
Reminiscing our love as I watch four seasons change
In comes the winter breeze
That chills the air and drifts the snow
And I imagine kissing you under the mistletoe
When springtime makes its way here
Lilac blooms reminds me of
The scent of your perfume
When summer burns with heat
I always get the hots for you
Go skinny dippin' in the ocean
Where we used to do
When autumn sheds the leaves
The trees are bare when you're not here
It doesn't feel the same

Remember
The nights when (Remember the night)
We closed our eyes (When we closed our eyes)
And vowed that you and I
Would be in love for all time
Every time I think about these things I shared with you
I break down and cry 'cause I get so emotional
Until you release me I'm bound under ball and chain
Reminiscing our love as I watch four seasons change
In comes the winter breeze
That chills the air and drifts the snow
And I imagine kissing you under the mistletoe
When springtime makes its way here
Lilac blooms reminds me of
The scent of your perfume
When summer burns with heat
I always get the hots for you
Go skinny dippin' in the ocean where we used to do
When autumn sheds the leaves the trees are bare
When you're not here
It doesn't feel the same
Please let me love again (I just wanna know if I can fix this)
'Cause I need your love to comfort me and ease my pain
Or four seasons will bring the loneliness again
In comes the winter breeze
That chills the air and drifts the snow
And I imagine kissing you under the mistletoe
When springtime makes its way here
Lilac blooms reminds me of
The scent of your perfume
When summer burns with heat
I always get the hots for you
Go skinny dippin' in the ocean where we used to do
When autumn sheds the leaves the trees are bare
When you're not here
It doesn't feel the same
(It doesn't feel the same)
Remember
The warmth of
Should I light 'em?
Come here and let me feel what's in front of me
The outside world is of no concern
Just let our bodies and the candles in our room burn
With a feverish passion uncontained
Feels like one of those nights
50 candles burn bright
Give me your hand touch me right here
Oh so good want it more and more
Each moment your fingers linger all around
As I kiss you in the place
Where your composure comes undone
And your mind runs
We'll make love 'til the sun completely rises
Come play with me
Let me be the toy
That fulfills your needs
Roll with me
Don't be afraid let the feeling take you away
To a world of ecstasy
Where all you got to do is be free
And give your all and all

Feels like one of those nights
50 candles burn bright
Come and get this
Waited all my life for your touch and your soft kiss
I hear your voice call my name
Holding your body like a plastic molding
Your soul I'll be controlling
Tonight's our night baby
50 candles burn bright
Make love to me
Hold on tight
It's going to be a bumpy ride
Feels like one of those nights
50 candles burn bright
Everything you've given me
I'll always keep it inside
There isn't anything
Or anyone that I could be
And it just wouldn't feel right
If I didn't have you by my side
You were there for me to love and care for me
When skies were gray
Whenever I was down
You were always there to comfort me
And no one else can be
What you have been to me you will always be
You will always be the girl
In my life for all times
Your love is like tears from the stars
Mama I just want you to know
Lovin' you is like food to my soul
You're always down for me
Have always been around for me even when I was bad
You showed me right from my wrong
Yes you did
And you took up for me
When everyone was downin' me
You always did understand
You gave me strength to go on
There were so many times
Looking back when I was so afraid
And then you'd come to me and say to me
I can face anything
And no one else can do
What you have done for me

Never meant to take your love away

Sweet and bitter like our memories
Nothing goes on in my heart except your memories
Where will you be and who will you think of?
You were always gonna be my love
And you should know
Even if I fall in love with somebody else
You were always gonna be the one
Mm
Trying to hold back the tears when thinking of you
All I want is to be with you once more
Said you will all
I hope that I have a place in your heart too
Somebody like you (Somebody like you)
My first love (My first love)
You were always gonna be my love
Even if I fall in love with somebody else (Somebody else)
I'll remember to love you taught me how
You were always gonna be the one
I'll still be singing this love song for
That I used to keep
Carried her 'round in the back of my pocket
She was always with me
I imagined that I was a man of importance
And she had a fancy for me
And I use to dream she would call
Crying her eyes out
She had an obsession with me
I was the love of her life
And she was all mine
The girl in the Life magazine
The first time we met in an aisle
At the market
She was staring at me
I knew even then we would share
Something special
And it was like chemistry
I fell in love from the moment I saw her
So I took her straight home with me
See Boyz II Men LiveGet tickets as low as $29You might also like
And that's where I'd dream
She would step right out of the picture
And spend the whole evening with me
And oh how she hated to go
Back to her picture
The girl in the Life magazine
All of my friends used to laugh (All of my friends used to laugh)
Said I was certifiably mad (Said I was mad)
'Till the day she came
And she blew them away
And asked me if I'd be her man
It seems that she went and fell
In love with my letters
She says she's been looking for me
And so the story ends well
We end up together
The girl in the Life magazine
I'm telling the world here and now
That I'm gonna love you and love you
I take this vow
You captured my heart
So long ago
Still there are some critical things
That you should know
Yeah yeah yeah
Do I give all I have
To be now and forever your man?
Do I take you to be
Without question the woman for me?
Do I promise you? I do
'Cause love doesn't matter to me if its not yours
As we become one through and through
I dedicate all of my life to loving you

I pray
That the Lord would one day somehow
Send you back my way
I need to be back in your arms

To what we had?
The good times that made us laugh
Outweigh the bad
I thought we'd get to see forever
But forever's gone away
It's so hard to say goodbye
To yesterday
I don't know where this road
Is going to lead
All I know is where we've been
If we get to see tomorrow
I hope it's worth all the wait
It's so hard to say goodbye
To yesterday
And I'll take with me the memories
To be my sunshine after the rain
It's so hard to say goodbye
To yesterday
And I'll take with me the memories
To be my sunshine after the rain
It's so hard to say goodbye
And blow out the candlelight
For tonight is just your night
We're gonna celebrate (Mmm)  all through the night

I know it's been heavy on your mind
Baby give him up he's not worth your time
Where is it that says you need a guy
Well you don't need his love to justify your life
You should want him to
So can you?
I know that you're stronger
It's getting clearer to me
So do you?

Hey  it's another Christmas Holiday
It's a joyous thing let the angels sing
Cause we're together
We got a thing here  can't let it slip away
Though outside is rain and sleet
When our bodies meet...
I don't care 'bout the weather
Let it snow  let it snow
Outside it's cold but the fire's blazin'
So baby let it snow
Ohhhh  come over here and help me trim the tree
I wanna wrap you up  baby
Then you'll see you're the only present I need
There's so much more
Waiting for you in store
From this precious day
I can gladly say
There's no place that I'd rather be

Love is scarce and far away
And your heart gets so afraid to trust someone
All the times he let you down
There was no love to be found
Well it's not the end
There'll be time to mend
And you'll love again
Take a chance for love away
Don't never let it make you fall apart
Take your need for love away
And I know it seems hard
Open up let down your guards
But you owe it to your heart
To try again
Oh comes the time
When we must change
What the past has thrown away

Don't be ashamed
Throw your fears away

Hay un vacío en el corazon
Seria demasiado un gesto de amor
Quizás una caricia pueda salvar la ilusión
No dejemos que muera el amor
Si en el fondo nos duele partir
No dejemos que muera el amor
No es posible la vida sin ti
Te necesito hoy
A veces yo te veo llorar
Y se cuando el dolor no se puede ocultar
Me debes otra oportunidad
Si todo lo pasado no vuelve a pasar
Por que seguir sufriendo y no volver a empezar
No dejemos que muera el amor
Si en el fondo nos duele partir
No dejemos que muera el amor
No es posible la vida sin ti
Te necesito hoy

No dejemos que muera el amor

Where did we lose our way
Girl it's drivin' me insane
And I know I just need one more chance
To prove my love to you
And if you come back to me
I'll guarantee
That I'll never let you go
Can we go back to the days our love was strong?
Can you tell me how a perfect love goes wrong?
Can somebody tell me how to get things back
The way they use to be?
Oh God give me a reason
I'm down on bended knee
I'll never walk again until you come back to me

Holding my pillow tight
And I know I don't need to be alone

For when we made love in six weeks
For the ring you wore
Proudly three months from now
And for those beautiful children of ours
Yes  I know it might sound strange 'cause we just met
But I thank you in advance
Shawn  help me sing it
Hi  my name is Shawn (Shawn)
Tell me your name although I know the last one
It's funny that we're shaking hands
Wait a minute  I know this hand
It's the same hand
(I'll hold in front of a minister)
Same hand
(When you're having my son and his sister)
I don't mean to sound so bold and forward
But I thank you in advance

I knew that you'd be my world
Knowing everywhere I go
So many times and changes
You've seen me through
And so I thought up this song
To show my appreciation for lovin' me so long

 you mean everything to me
 I wanna squeeze you
I needed someone to see me through
And I was at the end of my rope
I needed someone to cut me lose
Gave me the sense that I might make it through
And now I know I'll make it
Through the miracle of you
I know the color of love
And it lives inside of you
I know the color of truth
(It's in the image of you)
If it comes from the heart
Then you know that it's true
(Like a rainbow)
And the color of love is in you

'Cause I have so many things to tell you
So many things to talk to you about
'Cause you are the strength that I hold on to
And I hope that I am the strength that you hold on to
So we can strive together and be perfect
'Til death do us part
The night is gone  the morning's here
And soon it's time to talk about
Where we stand and where we plan to be
Our life-long years  I need to know
I keep crying tears of joy
I guess that's what you're put here for
To change these tears of pain to tears of happiness
In my trying times
Trying to get the best of me
I'm still finding time to show I care
With my crying eyes
I see contentment because of you
Trials and tribulations
Build up walls in front of faces
Made of stone
Yet we stand strong enough
To break the walls down to journey on
But I know if we just bond our hearts
There will be nothing that will stand in our way
And we'll be together forever and a day

I've known it for awhile
I wasn't naive to the news my mind just couldn't walk a mile
I only see you with me cause I know the things you like
I know all that you believe and all the plans of your life
I'm everything you need and in this world
A good man is hard to find
And I know you'll miss me
When all is said and done
You'll think about this day and then you'll realize I was the one
U know
That all u need is in me
And u know
Gave you all a man can give you
Made sure I found the time to keep it all together
But the way you're treating me ain't right (Can't understand it)
Why you doing me the way you do it
Do you enjoy to see our love fade away
Can't face the world without ya
Can't even sleep at night
Gave you all that I treasured
And I tried to love you with all my might
And I know you'll miss me when all is said and done
You'll think about this day and realize that I was the one

Infatuation  lust  and a lot of love
Sweet caresses  yes  it's good to be as you rub
And clench my back  ecstasy fills the air
As you kiss on my neck and stroke the back of my hair
To hold you tonight  I feel this is my duty
To grasp  to hold  to rock that booty

We might watch our whole lives pass us by
Let's don't wait 'til the water runs dry
