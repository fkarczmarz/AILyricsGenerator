"Ah-ah
Think I only want you under my mistletoe
I might change your contact to Has a Huge North Pole
You said you like my stockings better on the floor
I don't want Santa's elves underneath this ol' tree
You're my wish list
Lookin' at you got me thinkin' Christmas
Snowflakes in my stomach when we're kissin'
And when you're comin' down the chimney
I need that Charles Dickens
You'll be Santa Claus and I'll be Mrs.

I'm talkin' deckin' all the halls
I'm talkin' spikin' eggnog
I'm talkin' opposite of small
I'm talkin' big snowballs
You got a new toy for me
I'm out here trimmin' the tree
I caught that holiday glee
My true love gave it to me
And I don't want Santa's elves (Don't want) underneath this ol' tree (Tree)
You're my wish list (Wish list)
Lookin' at you got me thinkin' Christmas (Christmas)
Snowflakes in my stomach when we're kissin' (When we're kissin')
And when you're comin' down the chimney
I need that Charles Dickens (No)
I'm talkin' chestnuts (Talkin')
How quickly can you build a snowman? Think fast
The moment when the light is red before the go
The moment when the curtain's down before the show
The moment when you're done  but maybe just one more
That's how I feel before I get you all alone
We could give it a minute
But what's the fun in a minute?
When we could push all the limits
Shirt hanging off my shoulders
Both hands wanna hold ya
So baby  what's the hold up?
Yeah  yeah
Can you feel the tension rising?
Now you're  now you're getting it close
Now you're  now you're getting it close
Almost love  it's almost love
Speed this up 'cause I'm excited
No more  no more taking it slow
No more  no more taking it slow
Almost love  it's almost love

I want you like a loner wants an empty room
I want you like a kiss that's long and overdue
I need you more than I have ever needed you

'Cause it's almost love  but it could be love
'Bout how we shouldn't talk for hours on end
Kissin' after a conversation
'Bout how we'd probably be better off as friends
Same time here next weekend
Say we won't do this again
Make me fall where I stand
Only like you can
How am I supposed to close the door when I still need the closure?
How am I supposed to leave you now that you're already over?
How am I supposed to leave you now that you're already over?
Selfishly don't wanna give you
Time to be on someone else's lips (Ah)
But I'll take three short hours over
Same time here next weekend
Say we won't do this again
Make me fall where I stand
Only like you can

I was born an old soul
Better keep my eyes wide open
There's so much that I don't know
Just another hotel room
Never felt so all alone
I think about my granddad's eyes
And they always send me home
I can almost hear him now
I gotta make him proud
I keep my eyes wide open
I'm about to make my way
Heaven help me keep my faith
And my eyes wide open
I can't see two steps ahead of me
When the fog comes rollin' in
I never thought I'd miss the rain
Lord knows how long it's been
This dream burns inside of me
And I can't just let it go
There's still so much that I don't know

Picturin' us in all these places
Ahead of myself's an understatement
Three stories up here contemplatin'
But what the fuck is patience?

But you speak in such a perfect cadence
Tiptoeing past so many stages

I get nice guys and villainize them
Read their texts like they're havin' sex right now
Scared I'll find out that it's true
And if I do  then I blame you
For every worst that I assume
When I'm forty-five  someone calls me their wife
And he fucks our lives in one selfish night
Don't think I'll find forgiveness as fast as mom did
Please fuckin' fix this
'Cause you were all I looked up to
Now I can't even look at you
(You too)
I mean  as they say in Chicago
It turns out forks are fuckin' everywhere
There’s no hiding from the thought of us
I got ways to find you anywhere
We sat on the roof once
Conversation took us everywhere
And we talked until the sun came up
I wish we stayed just like we were up there
It doesn't matter whether not I want to
Your corner in my mind is well-established
I feel myself fallin' further down your priorities
And I still make excuses for you constantly
I wonder how many things you think about
Remember when you left once?
That never made too much sense to me
You really came to me for sympathy

I wonder how many things you think about before you get to me
I feel myself fallin' further down your priorities
And I still make excuses for you constantly

Not good at bein' present anyway
My relatives always know what to say to piss me off
Small talk in the kitchen
Who sucks competition (Oh)
Call it pessimism
December is a prison
It just makes me miss him
Is it New Year's yet?
I just wanna forget
That I'm at home with nobody to hold
I'm dreamin' 'bout silver and gold (Silver and gold)
That champagne buzz down to my toes (Down to my toes)
Wanna push 'em in the fireplace and watch 'em burn
Fruitcake just makes me sick (Ugh)

Think that I know you the farther you are
(Farther you are  farther you are) No
Like A-B-C-D  that could work so perfectly
If perfect was the kind of thing that worked for me
But I wanna feel nervous  just a little bit off the edge
(Wanna feel  wanna feel  wanna feel)
Even if I know that I will end up in a mess
And for all of the nights I left tears running down my face  messing up my mascara

Hear the barista call an oat milk latte and your name

Arguments in your garage
All the ways we sabotaged it (Mmm)
What it was and what it wasn't
We've been swimmin' on the edge of a cliff
If we could take it all off and just еxist
And skinny dip in water under the bridge
You'll suggest a restaurant we used to go to
How different we are from those scared little kids that had those (Hmm)

I always reach for your leg over there on your side of the car
Baby  everything reminds me of you
Nobody gets my jokes  everyone here thinks I'm fuckin' rude
When I saw you cry  I didn't handle it well
Without you here  I don't know what to do with myself
I think about these things at night before I fall asleep
Things I wish you said to me
The night that your sister said that you got in an accident
I can't get your songs out of my head or your hair out of my room
I saw you met somebody and I'm jealous as hell
That I can't even stomach lovin' somebody else
I think about these things at night before I fall asleep
Things I wish you said to me
Ooh
Ooh  ah

One day  I'll make sure you get a real apology
I waste my time  I waste my life on idiotic things
Like things you never said"
