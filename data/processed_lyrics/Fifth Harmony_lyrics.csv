" oh  yeah

 I can't stop myself from shaking
 I know

 but I know it'll all go wrong
 I love you still

 I love you still
 I always will
 but every kiss and every breathless moment)
 but I know it'll all go wrong (It'll all go wrong)
 I love you still
 I always will
Come and climb in my bed
Don't be shy  do your thing
It's all in my head
I'm tryna chill with you  throwin' bands at you
Show me some different moves and I'll let you groove
And you the one for me and I'm the one for you
Curtains like waves closing in all around us
Dimming the lights just so that they don't blind us
So tongue in cheek when we're laying on roses
But you're touching my skin and you're leaving me hopeless
I wanna feel you un—
Feel you under my body (Body  body)
I wanna feel you un—
Feel you un—

Many times I remind myself
To build these walls and to blind ourselves
And for every action  there's a reaction
And I know the world can be cold  we can't let it divide us
There's something inside us  a power that grows
There's something beautiful in the flaws in all we are
Something calling all of us and it says
We build bridges
Oh  we build bridges
No  we won't separate
We know love can conquer hate
So we build bridges
Bridges  not walls (We build)

Down a dead-end street
Ending so suddenly
Loving him is like trying to change your mind
Once you're already flying through the free fall
Just before they lose it all
Losing him was blue like I'd never known
Forgetting him was like trying to know somebody you never met
Touching him was like realizing all you ever wanted
Was right there in front of you
Memorizing him was as easy as knowing
All the words to your old favorite song
Fighting with him was like trying to solve a crossword
And realizing there's no right answer
Regretting him was like wishing you never found out
That love could be that strong

Feeling the heat and the burn
Seconds away from turnin' this car back around
Somethin' about your feeling pushin' and pullin' me in

Scared of happy
