lyrics
"I get all choked up inside
It's not only from the shame
It's like ten different lovers died
Except you're still just a mile away
But there's nothing left to say
Don't leave us down and out again
Cause we might break instead of bend
I felt a little stain in the pouring rain
It washed away almost everything
If I found another love
They must be forever true
Cause if someone breaks this heart
Your old man right here is through
Heaven just seems so far away
When there's nothing left to say
Don't leave us down and out again
Cause we might break instead of bend
I felt a little stain in the pouring rain
It washed away almost everything

The little girl can't comprehend
She had another dream that her mama's gone
I prefer than to remain the same
Bullet in the brain
I prefer than to remain the same
Looking back on where we used to be
Hearts began to rust
The diamond turned to dust
And baby took her pain all out on me
Bullet in the brain
I prefer than to remain the same
Bullet in the brain
I prefer than to remain the same
I know I share the blame for what’s in store
I was in the wrong but weren't you in it more?
I let you use my gifts
To back those lying lips
I'll never know just what I did it for

We saw the signs
Don't nobody wanna be lonely
Everybody oughta be loved sometime
Feel you simmer down in the pan

Fever  where'd you run to?
Acting right is so routine
And fever let me live a dream
Fever I'm a slave to
No one misbehave too
Fever  they're misunderstood
Wouldn't leave you if I could
Fever
Fever 'cause I'm breaking
Fever got me aching
Fever  why won't you explain?
Break it down again
Fever got me guilty
Just go ahead and kill me
Fever  why won't you explain?
Break it down again
Fever  can you hear me?
Fever  can you hear me?
You shook me like I never been
Now show me how to live again
It used to be a blessing
But fever's got me stressing
Realize I am to blame
But fever let me play the game

Now if the cold pale light in your eyes
Reaches those horizon lines
You know not to leave her
Now if the cold pale light in your eyes
Reaches those horizon lines

I'm tired as I can be
Flames now take control
Fire light the way
Burn the night to day
Bathe in afterglow
Everywhere I go
Roll on fire
Higher and higher
Living in a fever dream

Burning ball of light
The heavens are ablaze
Flames are like a maze

She screams again
Roar at the door
My mind can't take much more

Mama said  Mama said you got a one track mind
But you ain't gonna get it all the time
She wasn't lyin'
I went from San Berdoo to Kalamazoo
Just to get away from you
I searched far and wide hoping I was wrong
But maybe all the good women are gone
My last dime  got used up on gasoline
Know what I mean  what I mean
That's what I say
I went from San Berdoo to Kalamazoo

But maybe all the good women are gone

Rock and roll hustle all the time

Like every honest thing I used to hear
Like every lover hovers in my mind
We made our mark when we were in our prime
The house it burned  but nothing there was mine
We had it all when we were in our prime
Every now and then I see your face from way back when and I explode
Friends no longer aid me  only bullshit serenade me like it's gold
How that gets old
I'm praying for some laughter  maybe joy forever after till I die
Opened my eyes
Like every lover hovers in my mind
We made our mark when we were in our prime
The house it burned  but nothing there was mine

Show me things I cannot see
Shine a little light on my soul

Runs to meet his maker

That's how we're made
The little house on Ellis Drive
Is where I felt most alive
The oak tree covered that old Ford
I miss it Lord  I miss it Lord
These blood red eyes don't see so good
But what's worse is if they could
Would I change my ways?
Wasted times and broken dreams
Violent colors so obscene
It's all I see these days  these days
Watch what you say  the devil is listenin'
He's got ears that you wouldn't believe

Did all those things you asked me to
I thought it was the perfect day
'Til she just opened up to say
It doesn't mean a thing to me
It doesn't mean a thing to me
And it's about time you see
Things ain't like they used to be

The kind that's never good on me
It doesn't mean a thing to me

When the music is done and all the lights are low
I will remember the times when love would really glow
Like a dream I had before my world turned blue
When the light inside would only shine for you
I really don't think you know
I really do hope you know
I really don't think you know
I'll never forget you through stories that I've heard
I'll meet you someday
We'll walk through fields where children play
Your eyes shined bright when you were a kid
Your sisters loved you and all that you did
Your flame has not faded since the day it was lit
Your life was joy
Your mama's only boy
And when the skies are blue
We'll smile like pictures of you as a boy
Before you retired to heavenly joy

Only one I’m dreaming of
Your sugar coated love has got a hold on me
You know you do it to me every time
Got me seeing colors that I never could see
Now I got a one track mind
Rivers run into the ocean
Oceans run into the blue

Clown around forever in the summer time
Down around the deep blue sea

From here to eternity
Feels just like a dream to me

Dance all night 'cause people  they don't wanna be lonely
Never wanna be lonely
They don't wanna be an only one
You had a thing no one could ever be sure of
Never ever had a pure love
And never no cure from
You might also like
You'll be on my mind
Don't give yourself away
To the weight of love
You'll be on your side
Don't give yourself away
The weight of  weight of love
Then break down when they go and desert you
It's so hard to let 'em go
And watch 'em scatter when you start asking questions
Like why we always in the wrong direction?
But you're doing it again
You don't wanna know more
And you've been down this road before
So leave it alone
And when you hear about the lies other people are sayin'
Just know they talk 'cause they don't have a way inside
Oh they try
Look how it hurts their pride
You can never find a soul that's got no pain within
Will it ever end?
You don't wanna know more
And you've been down this road before
So leave it alone
No this ain't nothing new
The only thing you've got is you
So leave it alone
And you got it
So much
I'm crazy for
Your touch
Your touch
Your touch
Your touch
And I'll be good
Like I should
Waiting is such
Your touch
Your touch
Your touch
Your touch
A little louder now
I've got to shout it now
Please rush
I need
You might also like
Your touch
Your touch
Your touch
My mom said Son
You're the one I adore”
Now I'm old and wise
When I see your eyes
You're the one I adore
Will you be true
Till life is done?
You're the one I adore"
