lyrics
"Ghosts of progress dressed in slow death
Feeding on hunger and glaring through the promise
Upon the food that rots slowly in the aisle
A mass of nameless at the oasis
That hides the graves beneath the master's hill
Buried for drinking the river's water while
Shackled to the the line at the empty well
Just like the noose wound over the new ground
Just like the noose wound over new ground
Listen to the fascist sing
Soon we'll be free of blot and mixture
Seeds planted by our forefathers' hand
A mass of promises begin to rupture
Like the pockets of the new world kings
Like swollen stomachs In Appalachia
Like the priest that fucked you as he whispered holy things
A mass of tears have transformed the stones now
Sharpened on suffering and woven into the slings
Hope lies in the rubble of this rich fortress
Taking today what tomorrow never brings

Just like the noose wound over the new ground
Just like the noose wound over new ground
Just like the noose wound over the new ground
Ain't the new sound just like the old sound?
Ain't it funny how the factory's doors close?
'Round the time that the school doors close?
'Round the time that the doors of the jail cells
Open up to greet you like the reaper?
Ain't it funny how the factory's doors close?
'Round the time that the school doors close?
'Round the time that a hundred thousand jail cells
Open up to greet you like the reaper?
Oasis
This is no oasis
Just like the noose wound over the new ground
Just like the noose wound over new ground
Like ashes in the fall
Like ashes in the fall

Beautiful people everywhere
The way they show they care
Makes me want to say
It's a beautiful world
For you
It's a wonderful time to be here
It's nice to be alive
Wonderful people everywhere
The way they comb their hair
Makes me want to say
It's a wonderful place

 fuck Manifest Destiny
 they took turns
 they took turns
 they took turns
Safe from the screams of the children born as ghosts
Gates  guns and alarms shape the calm of the dawn
Peering down into the basin where death lives on
When young run foaming at the mouth with hate
When burning batons beat the freezing who shake
Under the toxic sunsets they dine and toast
Of walls deny the terror faced
By the children born as ghosts
Born as ghosts
Born as ghosts
Born as ghosts
Born as ghosts
(We are the children born as ghosts  born as ghosts)
One book and forty ghosts stuffed in a room
Ah  the school as a tomb
Where home is a wasteland  taste the razor wire
And thought is locked in the womb
The tales that tear at the myth of the dream
(Myth of the dream  myth of the dream)
A suffering that shocks the lives off the screen
(Myth of the dream  myth of the dream)

Capturing my memories
The frontier of loss
They try to escape across the street where
Jesus stripped bare
And raped the spirit He was supposed to nurture
In the name of my
In the name of my
Like autumn leaves his sense fell from him
An empty glass of himself shattered somewhere within
His thoughts like a hundred moths
Trapped in a lampshade
Somewhere within
Their wings banging and burning
On through endless night
Forever awake he lies shaking and starving
Praying for someone to turn off the light

Nothin' proper about ya propaganda
Fools follow rules when the set commands ya
That's how ya got a bullet blasted through ya head
I give a shout out to the living dead

Corporations cold turn ya to stone before ya realize

There's a country's soul that reads post no bills
There's a strike and a line of cops outside of the mill
There's a right to obey and there's a right to kill
There's a country's soul that reads post no bills
There's a strike and a line of cops outside of the mill
Causing innocent blood to flow
They came to seize and take whatever they please
Then all they gave back was death and disease
My people were left with no choice but to decide
Responsible for genocide
Responsible for genocide
Responsible for genocie
AIDS is killing the entire African nation
And a vaccine is still supposedly under preparation
My people were left with no choice but to decide
To conform to a system
Brutality can never be undone
But the sun is not yet set
Bass and drums and microphones a threat
That's when ya investigate the crimes from the inside
And see they're responsible for genocide
Responsible for genocide

These people ain't seen a brown-skinned man
Since their grandparents bought one
So now I'm rollin' down Rodeo with a shotgun
These people ain't seen a brown-skinned man
Since their grandparents bought one
So now I'm rollin' down Rodeo with a shotgun
Funk the track  my verbs sly like the Family Stone
Them pen devils set the stage for the war at home
Locked without a wage  you're standing in the drop zone
The clockers born  starin' at an empty plate
Mama's torn hands cover her sunken face
We hungry but them belly full
The structure is set  ya never change it with a ballot pull
In the ruins there's a network for the toxic rock
Schoolyard to precinct  suburb to project block
Bosses rode south for new flesh and a factory floor
The remains left chained to the powder war
Can't waste a day when the night brings a hearse
So make a move and plead the fifth 'cause ya can't plead the first
Can't waste a day when the night brings a hearse
So now I'm rollin' down Rodeo with a shotgun
These people ain't seen a brown-skinned man

A thousand years they had the tools  we should be takin' 'em
Fuck the G-ride  I want the machines that are makin' 'em
Our target straight with a room full of armed pawns
To off the Kings on the west side at dawn
Can't waste a day when the night brings a hearse

Drawn up by the thoughts I think

More like the murals that fit

A decade of the weapon of sound above ground
No shelter if you're looking for shade
I lick shots at the brutal charade
As the polls close like a casket
On truth devoured  silent play on the shadow of power
A spectacle  monopolized
The camera's eyes on choice disguised
Was it cast for the mass who burn and toil?
Or for the vultures who thirst for blood and oil?
Yes a spectacle  monopolized
They hold the reins  stole your eyes
All the Fistagons  the bullets and bombs
Who stuff the banks  who staff the party ranks

Hadda be playin' on TV
Hadda be loud-mouthed on the comedy hour
Hadda be announced over loud speakers
The CIA and the Mafia are in cahoots
It hadda be said in old ladies' language
It hadda be said in American headlines

And got double-crossed by lowlife goons and agents
Rich bankers with criminal connections
Dope-pushers in CIA working with

It hadda be moaned over factory foghorns
It hadda be chattered on car radio news broadcasts
It hadda be screamed in the kitchen
It hadda be yelled in the basement where uncles were fighting
It hadda be howled on the streets by newsboys to bus conductors

Hadda be FBI chief J. Edgar Hoover
And Frank Costello syndicate mouthpiece

Hadda be the Mafia and the CIA together

Private detective agencies for the oh so very rich
Hadda be capitalism
The vortex of this rage
This competition man to man
The horses head in a capitalist's bed
The Cubans' turf in competitions
Hitmen in gang wars across oceans
Bombing Cambodia settled the score
With White House pots and pans
A warning to Mediterranean governments
The secret police have braced for decades
The NKPD and CIA keep each other's secrets
The OGBU and DIA never hit their own
And full of money

They hadda be rich and they hadda be powerful
They hadda murder in Indonesia five hundred thousand
Hadda murder in Indochina two million
Hadda murder in Czechoslovakia

That was a poem by Allen Ginsberg called Hadda Be Playing On The Jukebox
You're missing the hootah of the funky Buddha
Eluder of the fucked up styles that get wicked
So come on as I start to kick it
'Cause we're like the outlaws striding  suckers are hiding
Jump behind the bush when they see me driving by
Hanging out my window
And my magnum taking out some putos
Acting kinda loco  I'm just another local kid
From the street getting paid for my vocals

Swing out the gat  and I know that we'll gat you right

How I could just kill a man

I melted microphones instead of cones of ice cream
Music orientated so when hip-hop was originated
Fitted like pieces of puzzles  complicated
Shot grabbed the mic and try to say  Yes y'all!
They tried to take it  and say that I'm too small
Cool  'cause I don't get upset
Back to the lab  without a mic to grab
So then I add all the rhymes I had
One after the another one  then I make another one
To diss the opposite then ask if the brother's done
I get a craving like I fiend for nicotine
But I don't need a cigarette  know what I mean?
I'm raging  ripping up the stage and
Don't it sound amazing 'cause every rhyme is made and
Thought of  cause it's sort of an addiction
Magnetized by the mixing

And I'll put you in a mood or is it a state of

An assasinator  if the people ain't stepping

 born without a face
 I tried to look back to my past long lost
 in came the air drop
 he couldn't shake the toxic shock
 insecticide rain
 profit for the bourgeoisie
 path is Luminoso
 uh
 another SS curtain call
 you divide
 re-action
 re-action
Seems I spent the '80s in the Haiti state of mind
Cast me into classes for electroshock
I'm swimming in half truths and it makes me wanna spit
Instructor come separate the healthy from the sick
It's dark now in Dachau and I'm screaming from within
'Cause I'm cell locked in the doctrines of the right
Yet at every turn I'm running into Hell's gates
So I grip the cannon like Fanon and pass the shells to my classmates
'Cause the boss's right to live is mine to die
So I'm going out heavy sorta like Mount Tai
With the five centuries of penitentiary so let the guilty hang
In the year of the boomerang
So let the guilty hang
So let the guilty hang
So let the guilty hang
In the year of the boomerang

Now it's upon you
Now it's upon you
The sistas are in so check the front line
