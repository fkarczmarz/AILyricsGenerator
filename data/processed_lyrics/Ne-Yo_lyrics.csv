To all the girls I've loved before

I cannot deny it  I cannot deny it (yeah)
I done broke a few hearts (yeah)  done my share of lying

Or if I ever did get caught  I'd just deny it
If my mama knew the thangs I did  she wouldn't like it (yeah)
She taught me way better (yeah)  I know I know way better (yeah)
I just didn't care  running round doing whatever
With 3 of they best friends  knew 'em all together
Man  I ain't give a damn  damn
A lot of women had to deal with a boy
That was supposed to be a man  hey
So to the ones I hurt  becoming who I am

Sorry to that one sexy model chick

Can't forget about the one I hit the movies with
One I'm rocking my Louis with
One that did all that freaky shit
Girl  when you play this song
Just say that you'll sing along
Thinking to myself damn  damn
Had to put up with the drama of a boy
That was supposed to be a man  man  oh I

So from the bottom of my heart  I'm sorry
Thank you  I'm sorry  I'm sorry
Sorry  yeah  I'm sorry  yeah
And the hereafter
I've never seen
Seen one like you
You're a knife
Sharp and deadly
And it's me
That you cut into
But I don't mind
In fact I like it

Hard with all these girls just testing me
Uh  and you gon' question me
If she even stand next to me
But you should laugh  'cause you my better half
And these girls just fighting over the rest of me (c'mon!)
Right now it feels so crazy
I know she just some lady
And my outfit is just so 80's
Not to mention McLaren Mercedes
And the 26 in-inch rim whee-eels
Look so good with your 6-inch heels
Fly shit that you be on
Gucci on  Lanvin  Louboutin
And we high as the way we cruising on
High like I  like Mercury
Why do I mention the solar system?
Cause  you in my soul and system
And we gon' take her home with this one

You got something that I can't fight
We got something that we both gon' ride

Or you gon' hate me for being me
Chasing women when I should be recording
Invite a couple then I invite some more in
Next thing you know it's three in the morning and I've only done one song
That's 40k in three hours but everybody watching my section
(here's the truth)
I'm a little irresponsible most of the time
I'm a man of my word but only when I ain't lying
I say I'm not a hater but I hate to see you shine
Especially if your shine is outshining mine
I wanna be faithful but I keep running into dimes
And they make it so easy so it's hard to do right
The image I portray you making people judge a book
But if they really took the time to look
Then they would see the cracks in Mr. Perfect
They would see the cracks in Mr. Perfect
So they would see the cracks in Mr. Perfect

Hoping I never have to pay for it
It's like I've become more of an idiot
With every extra million I get
I thank god for my family and my crew cause I can be a lot to put up with
Much love to the people that don't mind the cracks in Mr. Perfect
(now let it marinate)
They could see the cracks in Mr. Perfect
Ooh you can see the cracks in Mr. Perfect
You could see the cracks in Mr. Perfect
Said you could see the cracks in Mr. Perfect
And in the end they all learned a valuable lesson
When in the grand scheme of things it's our imperfections that truly make us perfect
So destructive in the way that we do
Hmm  a little bit insane
But she loves it just the same and me too  ooh
They say love and insanity
Are somewhat related  in the way that they make us act
But baby girl the love between you and me
Is truly the greatest  though sometimes we hate it
They can't tell me nothing about no you
Cause you're my crazy love
Can't tell me nothing about how we do
Cause we got crazy love
I'm intelligent
Ohh  but my common sense (common sense)

Then I see that fat ass when you walkin out
How I'm gonna tell my baby bye-bye?
Outfit look crazy on her  you my Lady Gaga
But you wanna start at first and get the last word
You wanna lock me down and get the password

The head's kuu-kuu  back shots' psycho
Hit it from the back hard  hope you got GEICO
They can't tell me nothing about no you
Cause you're my crazy love
Can't tell me nothing about how we do
You probably don't care what I have to say
But it's been heavy on my mind for months now
Guess I'm trying to clear some mental space
I would love to talk to you in person
But I understand why that can't be
If you answer this one question for me
I just wonder
Do you ever
Think of me anymore
Do you?
Heard that you just had a baby girl
If she looks anything like her mother
She's the prettiest thing in the world

Never been a dumb dude  no  I'm not dense
I just had a slight lack of common sense
I was the good guy  she was the bad girl
I'm thinking one girl
She thinking me  Earl James and Jimmy
Yep  she had plenty
But love for me  she didn't have any
I was inviting  her into my heart
But she was out riding in some other man's car
She was my night time  thought I was her star
Guess I was wrong  but see I'm strong
Won't take long for me to move on
Please don't worry 'bout me I'm fine
(Please don't worry 'bout me I'm fine)
Only gonna play the fool one time

That makes me wanna tear you down
But one thing that I do know is
Every time you scream at me
I wanna kiss you
Baby when you put your hands on me
I wanna touch you
And when we get to arguing
Just gotta kiss you
But you're just so damn sexy
When you're mad
Every time you scream at me
I wanna kiss you
Baby when you put your hands on me
I wanna touch you
And when we get to arguing
Just gotta kiss you
But you're just so damn sexy"
