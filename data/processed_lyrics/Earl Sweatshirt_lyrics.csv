lyrics
" 2012 quality
 doing eighty-five in my ride
 know I'm striding like a giant
 rule these niggas like a tyrant
 hope your head explode
 but don't deny that Doms got the realest flows
 pulling on the killer 'dro
 thinking This is what I did it for
 Wolf Ganging as if you niggas didn't know
 Doms
 all 'em awe struck
 smoking spliffs
 prior to arriving to the studio
 attractive lady
 running till my foot aching
 Ferragamo do-rag
 running two-mans
 burn a fucking quarter back to two grams
I'ma need a bigger bag for the cohort
Tryna make a millionaire out of slum dogs
Cozy with the east Africans up north
Had her stressin' up the wall playin' Mary J. songs
Who be foldin' late? Who know when to play dead?
Who sit up straight when the roof caved in?
Cup runneth over the brim
Five O's on me like the Olympics
Livin' on the fly tryna wing it
We got us a fire to rekindle
Redirect the fight where it's meant for
Triumph over plight and immense loss
Caught a couple slights and I veered off

Sharp incisors reveal slowly
Foot shook ground when I stepped on it
Didn't look back when I broke soil
'Cause every time I did it would hurt more
And I didn't look back when I broke soil
'Cause every time I did it would hurt more
Alright
 spit out my food  hiccup and piss
 I could smell the liquor in this
 rock my slacks of my ass half-off
 I blast off
 I had to make it right
 I gotta take advice
 abuse these mics
 I’m the contusion type
 never losing hype  no
 and I do it right  no
 I skated before I rapped
 bet 20 hots on your daddy
 probably cold and passive
 feeling down like he passed it
 it's action  I was kinda out the game
 we took the 7 to the Dussy 17 to the block
 if your nigga had Supreme  we was the reason he copped it
 I'm on the hunt for mirrors to box with
 'cause I don't do the crying  bro
 I'm tryna keep the whining to a minimum
 bet I'm splitting quicker than I finish rum
 finna yak if I don't hit the blunt
 half a Xanax when I'm traveling
 brick out on the tour
 spit cattle manure shit
 rally the Horsemen  tally the corpses
 it was sugar in my gas tank
 could've split the last plate
 so I stopped tryin'
 and we outta time
 you ain't gotta lie
 did it my way
 fissures and fires
 foot on the line
 sookie niggas wasn't shit
 hundred dollar chip
 the bottle empty
 this how we on it
 better come prepared
 don't need any luck
I'm half-privileged  think white and have n*gger lips
A tad different  mad smart  act ignorant
Shit  I'll pass a class when my dad starts giving shits
But as long as our relationship is turdless
I'ma keep burning rubber and fucking these beats with burnt dick
Who that? Oh  that new-coon John Cusack
A Mecca button-up  shouting  Bring Fubu back
Hands full of coke  mouth full of crack Muzak
Odd Future on the do-rag—guess who's back?
With no hint  we're egging with no tint
Plus  it's a shotgun under the seat where your ho sits  ugh
The Night Striker  I'm riding her  up-tying her
It's nine Vicodins stuck inside of the windpipes of her
A little bit of sherm sure provokes the fucking fight in her
She started biting 'cause I'm giving cock like it's advice to her
Take that  I'm on top like wave caps
This is grade-A rap—Domo  bring that bass back  nigga
Um  Domo couldn’t be here  so  uh… We’re just… I don’t like talking. Hu— Ugh!
Raps?
My grandma's passing
But I'm too busy tryna get this fuckin' album crackin' to see her
So I apologize in advance if anything should happen (Cut that bitch off!)
And my priorities fucked up  I know it  I'm afraid I'm gonna blow it
And when them expectations raising because daddy was a poet  right?
Talk all you want  I'm takin' no advice  nigga
I'm 'bout to relish in this anguish  and I'm stressin' over payment (Cut that bitch off!)
So don't tell me that I made it  only relatively famous
In the midst of a tornado  misfitted  I'm Clark Gable
I'm not stable  (I'm not stable) abrasive as fuck and they all (Cut that bitch off!)
Pay me  I'm chuckling cross-faded in public
Heart racin' 'til blunt is lit  (Like he don't give a fuck again  right?)
I don't fuck with too much of y'all's shit
Judgin' by the pants and the mall grip
Gully  in the vans with the dark tints
I'm a start-shit type nigga (Cut that bitch off!)
Night life livin'
Ridin' in the Jeep  I'mma side-swipe niggas
What's your life like? That's alright nigga
Hammer in the left ready when the price isn't
Right got the whip and I ain't got the license for it
And Jill got me living like my life is golden
Sitting on the sofa feeling high and dormant
If we could smoke another while the mic records it (Cut that bitch off!)
The nicest doin' it  who the fuck you staring at?
Acting like you've never seen a tooth that's carat-capped
Bars hotter than the blocks where we be at
Stuntin' these niggas gon' flop like Divac
See that nigga? And for the time being
I'mma be that nigga  believe that nigga
You see that nigga? And for the time being
I feel like the Tom Sawyer for real niggas
Looking for a problem  revolver under the Hilfiger
No bluff needed  we will kill niggas
So try me if you want  bruh  I promise I'm with all of that
Late night shooters  got 'em thinking Johnny Carson back
Trying to win this white man's game with my heart intact
All off a dollar and a dream that I really had
Kind of hard to sleep when your thoughts is in the streets
Norf Norf is the side where my family stay
Big Baby Jesus  I can't wait
Until the money coming in  spend it all on guns and rims
I ain't nothing but a nigga  ain't no reason to pretend
Kept the sticky in a Stussy pouch
Ski mask  bloody 'Preme hoodie tossing doobies out
The window of the hoopty  night black as Paul
Mooney at the movies but the moon was out
Food was always optional
Eating nothing but hard punches to that abdominal
Closed fist chronicles  sold sniff  Momma knew
Baggies laying 'round  peanut shells at a carnival
Stomping clowns  welcome pussy niggas to the romper room
Buckshot'll cover a whole torso like a parka do
In a park at two  plotting  trying to garner loot
Split it with his big road dog  call him Marmaduke
Searching for a shard of truth and found  uh
Couple bucks bought his cousins lunch
Another Dutch  stiff collar on the button-up
Road to Hell paved with cement
Covered trussled drugs  toughen up

A degenerate moving through the city with criminals  stealth
Welcome to enemy turf  harder than immigrants work
Golf is stitched into my shirt
Get up off the pavement  brush the dirt up off my psyche
Psyche  psyche
It's probably been 12 years since my father left
Left me fatherless
And I just used to say I hate him in dishonest jest
And every time I got the chance to say it  I would swallow it
I storm that whole bottle  I'll show you a role model
Trying to figure out how and when the fuck I missed moderate
Momma often was offering peace offerings
Searching for a big brother  Tyler was that
And plus he liked how I rap  the blunted mice in the trap
Too black for the white kids  and too white for the blacks
From honor roll to cracking locks up off them bicycle racks
It's evident in them eyes  where he hiding all them icicles at

Was mobbin' deep as '96 Havoc and Prodigy did
We were the pottymouth posse  crash the party and dip
With all belongings then toss em out to the audience
Nothing was fucking awesome
Trying to make it from the bottom
His sins feeling as hard as Vince Carter's knee cartilage is
Supreme garment and weed gardeners garnishing spliffs
With Keef particles and entering apartments with 'zine article
Tolerance for boundaries  I know you happy now
Craven and these Complex fuck niggas done track me down
Not the type where niggas trying to get a raise at my expense
Supposed to be grateful  right?
And the ties between my mom and I are strained and tightened
Even more than they were before all of this shit
Been back a week and I already feel like calling it quits

Welcome to enemy turf  harder than immigrants work

We roam tundras
The boy been gone a few summers too long from road runnin'
Trunk full of old hunnids
Niggas come in the door and smoke somethin'
Choke up on the slugger from home run-ins
Some of those keep one in the chamber
Muffle my pain and muzzle my brain up
Chuck a deuce if you know it's the end
Kept the truth in my palm and my chest

It is night and like the others I clean my weapons
But somethin' was always missin' like six digits
Lucky seven  probably poppa
Little nigga so they picked on him  hassled him
Things changed when I hassled back  so
David hit the pavement with this grapple rap
Snapple fact: you rather wack
While I am poppin' like a snappin' crack
Matter fact  I am Farmer John milkin' cattle tracks
Simple genius  go hard and spit bits of semen
The gang of wolves that creeps in crypts
As deep as Dawson's Creek and shit
I pray they got gills  either that or grab some floaties
Braggin'  tell these faggots to stop naggin'
'Cause them Wolf Gang niggas threw 'em off the bandwagon  like
Uh  was always fucked up as shit wit' it
But I didn't cross the line until the bridge hit it  troll
I got you niggas nervous like virgins flirtin' with Uncle Mervin
Fuckin' y'all with no lubricant  go grab the detergent
I preach to demons at your church  now I'm the newest sermon
Wearin' nothin' but they fuckin' blast with the matchin' turban
I drive through white suburbans in the black Suburban  swervin'
Hittin' curbs and blastin' Erick Sermon  drunk off English bourbon
And treat the beat like sanitized Nazi puss  I'm a German
I'm squirtin' while I'm masturbatin' and regurgitatin'
From eatin' Miley Cyrus salad pussy platter they were servin'

I'm back on my sixty-six-six shit
Flowin' like the blood out the competition's slit wrists
She mad as fuck  stuck in the back of a black Acura
Fed her acid  now the duct tape quacks back at her
Bitch  you're barely breathin'
Leavin' on the back of the boat where I fill you up with semen
From the Wolf Gang teamin'
Flowin' like the creampie inside of your daughter
Oughta eat the bitch with salt and wash it down with a gallon of water
I grab the saw and sawed her arm off and auctioned it
And dip her teeth in gold molds and flossed the shit
Fuckin' awesome  spittin' box of trees
Got you niggas shakin' like it's Parkinsons
From the clitoris of Kelly Clarkson's dick
Ironin' you niggas  now it's time to starch the shit
Drown your bitch in a tub of cum and throw a shark in it
Find a random abandoned garage  and go and park in it
Find Earl layin' on the burgundy carpet
Pull my knife out  sharpen it
(Stab him)  put a arch in it
Pour unleaded gas on him  get the Zippo and spark the shit
Hop back in the van and then depart the bitch
Dude stop  forehead shiny like a new Glock
Two shots fired at the Excursion we were swervin' in
All-purpose verses with a passion for servin' kids
Empty out your purses on an immature crime spree
Eyin' up the nurses with some gloves that read I squeeze
Who the fuck said to speak  Mr. Me-Is-Siamese?
Even Christ said Christ  he flows quite nicely
Hypebeast's highly likely to bite me
And try to high five me  but I just give them high threes
'Cause y'all don't get two  touch me  I'm the shit
Sue me  if you got an issue  grab a tissue
Mediocrity is odd to me
Ass as far as ya eyes can see. Who the best? They holla me
I ain't fuckin' with it if it's no payment
'Cause everyone knows paid dues don't pay rent
I'm dope like the coke that I'm laced with
Dreams what I'm chasin'  flow hot it's chafin'
This is why I'm hot? No  that is why I'm blazin'
Dilla jacked Nick  I am shinin' like the diamond that I'm draped in
But I don't wear jewelery  it's HUF over Louis V
 I never hugged the fence
 stomach full of drugs and shit
 back to Sunday when it's done again (Shit)
 run until the streetlights off
 got the team strapped on
 but that's just the difference
 my team is magicians
 I got hoes in my britches
 full part coming soon
 my nigga
 so much for chivalry
 I ain't stopping in my tracks
 then we running out
 it ain't no more problems
 fuck
 I couldn't stomach that
 I ain't gotta lie 'bout that
 I can't even cry about that
 I know you look down on me
 so
 I'm atheist
 mixed like she moo and chew grass or somethin'
 I guess I'd kinda like my bitch
 but a pervert in the sheets
 murder Merlin over beats
 and then they weep
 haha
 bitch
 drop
 your hobby's what my passion is
 my niggas on that savage shit
 plannin' to make a mess of her
 like what you make—them niggas still ain't fresh as us
Crashin' while jackin' off
To bufferin' vids of Asher Roth eatin' applesauce
Sent to Earth to poke Catholics in the ass with saws
And knock blunt ashes into their caskets  and laugh it off
Six different liquors  with a Prince wig plastered on
When Big Lips is in the attic armed with an addict's arm
Earl puts the ass in assassin
Puts the pieces of decomposin' bodies in plastic
Puts them in a pan and mixes it up with scat
Then gobbles it like fat black bitches and catfish
It so happens that I'm so haphazardous
I'll puke a piece and put it on a hook and fuckin' cast the shit
I'm askin' that you faggot rap actors take action
And get a hall pass for this class-act shit
How the fuck I fit an axe in a satchel?
Slip capsules in a glass  she Dizzee Rascal
Party staff baffled  askin' where her ass go
In my room  redefinin' the meanin' of black holes
But go on  suck it up
But hurry  I got nuts to bust and butts to fuck
And ups to shut and sluts to fuckin' uppercut
Without a doubt  a sure-fire way to get your mother fucked
Ask her for a couple bucks  shove a trumpet up her butt
As well as supper  then I'll rummage through her ruptured cunt
Found the mustard
Fuckin' nosey neighbors notice something's up
What you doin'?  nothin' much
Would shout some other stuff
Got to fuckin' bounce  guess the bouncer's had enough of us

Contemplating ways of getting dome

Or leaving opponents floating with paper and dirty porcelain
Pinnacle of titillating  crisp spit
Fist clenched  emulating '68 Olympics

Coughing from the stable probably indicating spliff's lit

Wipe more because I normally toilet-bowl with a broken pipe  tch

Four Lokos down the hole and a loaded spliff
And who was useless as a broken wrist when tryna open shit
Nigga  cold is what you need to keep the poultry in
Resulting in me rolling slick as bottom of the bowling kicks
Early Man  you posers know me as the troll
Throwing moldy donut holes at your grody ho from his cronies' whip
Eating like the kids when you take ‘em off Ritalin
Throwing temper tantrums at the window of your whip again
Sweeping up the glass to use it as a garnish over tracks
Damaged like the leg he limping to the barn with
Chickenshits
Temper 'bout as thick as tips of pencils is
Missiles to the picket fence

 think she had enough
 I mean we dope as fuck  she had a gram of us
 fag damagers  bitch
Except I promised my momma that I would finish college
Started chasing profit
Sorry ma  I ain't forget about it but if money evil
I'm hoping that you could see through all the drama
And watch me get these dollars
And my ambition burn so hot  it's like I'm bleeding lava
Haters be pleading me to stop but I don't even bother
Though my approach is seeming awkward  I could see it proper
See success and I just see the fact that I don't need a father
Doms hotter than the drop of Harry Potter shit
Pedal to the metal  high-level  full-throttle shit
Still searching for reasons why niggas ain't acknowledge this
I'm lost in an era where real shit does not exist
I need the sway of things  I'm everyday cooling it
I'm getting blazed  laughing at the way they overdoing shit
I'm just a old soul sticking to a newer script
I guess I got to prove this shit  I'm truly too legit to quit
I'd like to send a shout to the fathers that didn't raise us
To every old hater  now unable to say much
To critics doing dirty with comments  a nigga paid for an apartment
Yesterday off some songs I haven't yet made up
Black Cressida  pay up
Bars going hard as the ashtray where I place guts
Shouts to the eses who paid pesos to play us
Riding in the barrio
Huff and puff blowing kush in Huf clothing articles
Kenny rolling blunts got us stuck like a barnacle
To the bottom of your shit  ironic cause the audio
As nautical as ships  look momma  look momma
This karma got me balling up my fist
'Til I demolish your clique  pardon the clips
I am honestly as bomb as it gets
Regardless of who is talking  I'm farming  harvesting hits
Just me and Domo and lit marijuana to split between two of us
Rocking boxes easy as warming some ramen noodles up
So  searching for a way to state it right
I rolled out of bed  greeted momma with a yawn  then
Paused to scratch and itch  and went down to the kitchen
Fixed a plate of eggs and bacon  glass of OJ Simpson
Just as I was about to dig in
A thought jumped in my head  school was to be attended  shit
I paid my thoughts no attention
'Cause I wasn't tryna kick it with this bitch that just ended it with me
But momma wasn't havin' it
So  I grabbed my bag and split out the door  and saw the whore that I'd rather kick
She runs shit  she's the jock  I'm the horseshoe
When she left  it didn't break my heart  it broke my torso
Makin' my eyes ache  stalkin' your MySpace
Posted a new pic  I mean it when I say
That I fuckin' hate you  but
Maybe if you looked in this direction
I'd pick my heart up off the floor and put it in my chest  then
Feel the fuckin' life rushin' through my body
But you got a guy that's not me  so my wrist is lookin' sloppy
Come on  let's cut the bull like a matador
You light me up like lamps  a chance is all I'm really askin' for
Give me one  I promise I'll be back for more
Most wanna tap and score  I want a fam of four

Port wine and pages of pass

That nigga Sweaty got the gas  and Shreddy K brought the matches
Pitch your body in the water like a Lipton teabag
And then switch to a different fucking whip to let them piggies speed past him
It's the rats  tryna get the cheese
What it do? Rap like I'm mincing meat
Call me Lou—if I'm on the track  these niggas skip to me
Niggas want to fade me  bitches feel some type of way for me
Fifties in my pocket falling out like fucking baby teeth
Vince be with the rocket  he gon' pop it when it’s danger 'round
Fingertips to tapers now  salute us when you face us
 in fact
 in fact
 less talk
 bumpin' Bedrock
 thumpin' up against the dead cops
 I'm your motherfuckin' general
 you ain't even gotta ask 'cause you finna know
 icky Earl finish foes
 riddle them with Chronicles of Riddick bows
 got my system slow
 ask them niggas what they sprinting fo'
 in fact
 in fact
 sick as John Gacy
 she was eighteen
 met her at the liquor store
 so I plan on screwinm it
 we're on Earl's burgundy carpet
 beggin' for me to fucking stop it (Ahhhhh!)
 sit down like a pretty ho and don't fight the shit
 put the body in the apartment
 in fact
 in fact
 what the fuck are you doin'?
 boohooin' 'bout your bruises
 you wanna be Miss Fuck-With-The-Music
 she's slidin' on Blueprint
 her arms stopped movin'
 tell 'em both No movin'
 and you're startin' to try my patience
 I could tell by the Hummin' bike
 grabbed the motherfuckin' huntin' knife
 threw him in the trunk and dipped
 shit
 in fact
 dead cop in the back
I've been here before
I've been here before
I've been here before
I've been here before
I've been here before
I've been here before
I've been here before
That's how I always seen it
I spent days faded and anemic
I'm just wastin' away
Look like the way that River Phoenix went gon' end up my fate
Twist a spliff if I don't finish my plate
Shit just lookin' different with age
Try to make some sense of all this shit in my brain
One foot stuck in a tar pit of my ways
See Earl Sweatshirt LiveGet tickets as low as $52You might also like
And if it's like that the whole time
It's me and my nibblin' conscience
I've been alone for the longest
Nothin' gon' save us or stop us
Me and my nibbling conscience
I've been alone for the longest
'Cause they remind me of seein' her
These the times that I need her the most 'cause I feel defeated
(And not by nothin' but myself...)
'Cause they remind me of seein' her
These the times that I need her the most 'cause I feel defeated
But time waits for no man and death waits with cold hands
I'm the youngest old man that ya know"
