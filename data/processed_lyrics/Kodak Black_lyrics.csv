"Can I  baby? (Can I? Can I?)
Can I  baby? Can I  baby?
I hope you ain't nothing like my old friends (Baby)
Or any other women that I had (Can I?)
I know I'm better than your ex-boyfriend (Baby)
Or any other niggas from the past (Can I?)
Can I take you where I learned the game from? (Baby)
Show you why I act the way I act (Can I?)
Lately  I've been on a fucking marathon (Baby)
Running to the motherfucking cash (Can I?)
I'm liking how you make a brother laugh (Baby)
Can I come and get you in a Jag? (Can I?)
Then  hit it in the backseat of the Jag (Baby)
Baby girl  I know you like my swag (Can I?)
Before I turn the lights out
'Fore I turn the lights out  tell me who the fuck you want to be
Can I?
I'm just so excited that I'm free
Sometimes  it be feelin' like a dream (Can I?)
Can a young brother get some sleep? (Baby)
Lately  I've been working over 3 (Can I?)
Mama told me  Son  I never hear from you (Baby)
Cook something  you don't even eat (Can I?)
Mama  I'm just trying to make a mil' for you (Baby)
Put you in a condo on the beach (Can I?)

Before I turn the lights out (Can I? Kodak)
Can I  I told you before you turned the lights on
Can I  ayy look
'Fore I turn the lights out  tell me who the fuck you want to be
Can I?
Why they just can't let a nigga be?
I've been busy  I've been doing me (Can I?)
Have you thinking I've been with the Zoe pound (Baby)
Me and all my niggas come in deep (Can I?)
On the ground  young ten toes down (Baby)
I can put a nigga on his feet (Can I?)
I caught the Audi  then I ran the check up (Baby)
And  I ain't even been out here a week (Can I?)
Got my shooter playing hide and seek (Baby)
Just in case you niggas try and creep (Can I?)
Everybody wanna be your friend now (Baby)
Better watch the company you keep (Can I?)
Everybody got they fucking hand out (Baby)
See you eating now they want a piece (Can I?)
Oh  that's Kodak Black whom I've been hearing bout' (Baby)
He the hottest nigga in the streets (Can I?)
If you love me  love a nigga deep (Baby)
When you see me  what you really see? (Can I?)
To everybody else  I was a sour guy (Baby)
But  I be treating you a little sweet (Can I?)
I'm so close to showing her my real side (Baby)
Show this girl another side of me (Can I?)
I think we've been getting along real fine (Baby)
You love it when I hit it on the beach (Can I?)
I've been working hard  ain't got no spare time (Baby)
I can't even party on the week (Can I?)
I'm just trying to see where your head at (Baby)
When you grow up  what you wanna be? (Can I?)
Run up on a nigga  where the bread at? (Baby)
I be going ham for the cheese (Can I?)
I just wanna see all of my niggas home (Baby)
They can't wait to get back on the streets (Can I?)
I just talked to Jackboy on collect phone (Baby)
He told me he ain't trying to take the plea
Can I? (I'm just in the projects) Baby
Can I? (I'm just in the projects) Baby
For my niggas  I'll swim across the sea
Can I? (Lil Kodak) Baby? (Can I just  baby?)
Can I? Baby  Can I? (Project) Baby
I'm in London  got my beat from London
Every time I like a bih  I find out she a gnat
Somebody call the vet  my dog turned out to be a rat
I'm a slick pimp  got a sixth sense
Ho  you ain't a dime  you just six cents
I be on them beans  she be on codeine
All I want is money  all she want is me
She just wanna be loved  she just wanna be pleased
All I want is money  all she want is me
(All I want is money  all she want is me)
(All I want is money  all she want is me)
Say I'm so selfish  all I think about is fetty
I can't settle down  somethin' just won't let me
I want to settle down  well maybe I ain't ready
Bae  I'm livin' reckless  and I'm thuggin' heavy
In love with the skreets  and I'm in too deep
I be tryna leave  it keep control of me
It got my heart  got my mind  it got my physique
She wanna wake up with my wand and put that ass to sleep
I don't bleed Kool-Aid  baby  I bleed concrete
I ask God to give me wisdom  help me spot a leech
I be talkin' money  tell that ho  kapeesh
Tell that ho to sheesh  love is for the weak

I'm ziggied up  26  13 6.0
I'm a seven figure nigga  remember when I had six
I'm a seven figure nigga  remember I ain't have shit
Even though I'm rich  can't forget that I was hittin' licks
All I want is that  all she want is this
I just wanna hit  but I just wanna hit
What be on your mind when it come to this?
Why you close your eyes every time we kiss?
I'ma keep it pimpin'  I'ma keep on livin'
And keep on catchin' flights
And never catchin' feelin's
I'ma keep it simple  I'ma keep poppin' flo-rhythm
I like when I'm with ya
But I love gettin' scrilla
Every time I like a bih  I find out she a gnat
Somebody call the vet  my dog turned out to be a rat

I need you to stop accusing me of playing games
I been down this road before but this don't feel the same
Cause every time I hold you close it's like you ease my pain
You been riding for so long I hope you never change
Just ride with me down this road it ain't no switching lanes
It's like I'm feeling you more each and every day
I ain't letting you go don't you run away
Baby I won't up and leave you straight
I got your back forever I'ma make sure you straight
It's like I'm feeling you more and more every day
I'm asking God is this a blessing he just sent my way
You looking gooder than some cake I call you Anna May
Got her on her tippy-toes like she balleray
She heard I'm creeping with some hoe called Valarey
She thinking something going on she say I'm acting strange
Red Bull I'ma keep you up under my wings
I ain't saying I'm a vet but I'ma keep you tamed
Yellow baby love to squeeze her like lemonade
Running all around my mind like a skating ring
You the golden one you caught my eyes had to make you mine
Say you the chosen one you genuine you be down to ride

I made it hot at the crib
I kept that fire at the crib
Where you gon' go when you dip?
How I'ma know who for real?
I pour a four in a fifth
You already know what it is
I keep a pole in the whip
'Cause a lot of these niggas out here envy me
It ain't no ho in the clique
None of my dawgs got fuckboy tendencies
I don't even show no sympathy
I done earn my stripes now I'm tryna go get me some real rank
Readin' through my third eye 'cause I got tunnel vision
It's like you gotta sell your soul for them to pay attention
I had to get down with that chrome to show them niggas I'm serious

I put my Hublot on rocks
I put Moscato on rocks

Free all my niggas who stuck in a box
Locked up and watching the clock
I can't be living this life
I don't want Cardi so I'ma pour Henny on ice
I'll show you I'm destined to get it
I be outside with the glizzy
I just might die how I'm livin'
I make you laugh when you with me
Ain't seen my dad in a minute
I just pulled up in a lemon
I'm calling my spirit
Readin' through my third eye 'cause I got tunnel vision
It's like you gotta sell your soul for them to pay attention
I had to get down with that chrome to show them niggas I'm serious
This my shit right here
This my kinda shit right here
Can I ball? Can I chill?
Can I stunt?
Will I live long enough to raise my son?
Made something out of nothin'
Ain't nothin' where I'm from
Can your boy do something productive for once?
I gotta see if the pussy good before I cuff
I'm really in the field so I need someone to hug
I'm out here like for real so I be needin' a little love
All you gotta do is grind
It's gon' take time
Ain't no time to chill
Ain't no time to vibe
All my people wanted me to sit my ass down
But I been on go since I got off my behind
Everybody wanna shine
Nobody wanna grind
None of this shit just fall from the sky

These streets took my conscience  ayy
Yeah  everybody with me on that same thang
I don't gang-bang but I bang-bang
I pull up to the club  I got on eight chains
Took that bitch to Wings-N-Things  she wanted to be my main
Brown liquor made my dawg insane
Booted up or geeked  it's the same thang
Fish scale or molly  it's the same name
Murder by the stains  which gang you claim?
The big Patek face cost ten chains
Took your bitch out to eat on a private plane
Real talk  150 when it's plain Jane
Fucked that junkie behind the dumpster for some cocaine
Chris Johnson  I swear for God I drop the twenty-eight
I told my nigga be smooth  he put a potato on a barrel
I kicked her dumbass out my crib  she say want Chanel
I bought that bitch a lace 'cause she ain't got no hair
I sent that poor-ass ho an Uber 'cause she ain't got no wheels
Thirty golds in my mouth like I'm Stephen Curry
Thirty clip in my Glock 'cause I'm a damn Warrior

She say she pregnant  I swear I think I wanna off her
Eighteen hunnid  I got more stories than an author
I'm credit card swipin' at the Chase Bank (Ayy)
Like a state trooper  I make my money on the road
These streets made me lose my conscience  took a nigga soul
These streets took all my soul from me
Tried to leave me in the cold
These streets took my conscience from me
Now tough love is all I show
I know my niggas got love for me
And they fillin' up they nose
I know my lil' bitch got love for me
She just want everybody to know
I know my niggas  they be missin' me
So I be posted on the stroll
I don't even care how much cash I see
I'm always gon' be in the 'No
I ran out of money  then they switch lanes
I ran it back up and then I switch lanes
In a brand new Range  diamond colored candy cane
I bought a brand new 'K and I can't wait to let it spray
These streets took my conscience
These streets took my conscience
 1800 block  ugly corner  tied  gleeful
 it gotta be mutual
 I won't never tell the world the shit I did for you
 that's cool  as long as you know the truth
 so I keep my distance
 you was in your feelings
 they gon' say I'm trippin'
 shit could've been different
 it's too late  I'm doin' my thing right now
 I'm on the plane right now
 but don't worry  I'll never forget you
 I can't hold that 'gainst you
 still my dirty  but I ain't fuckin' wit' you
 I had to revisit my past  revisit my pain
 we can't rekindle that flame
 you tried to shame me  tried to kill my image
 and you know I'm with it
 steppin' on niggas like I ain't even got no feelings
 I'm wishin' shit could've been different
 I hope you hear it
 it went like that  so nigga that's what it is
 I took you with me  every show I did
 can't waste my lyrics
 they said  No you isn't
 so I'm dyin' how I'm livin'
 now we goin' to prison
 kept that thing with me
 thuggin' real silly
 then I popped  then you went to switchin'
 but you niggas missin'
 niggas went to snitchin'
 shit you never didn't
 thuggin' every minute
 see about me  I'ma show you different
 throwin' rocks at the penitentiary
 no more drug dealin'
 I'm in a new Bentley
 I wonder who did it
 you and me  we made it from the mud
 I swear to God I would've took a slug
 and it's all love
 this just what I'm used to
 throw away my future
 no flag
 that soldier-like mentality automatic

You know I'm a hot boy  but I ain't never lose my cool
The streets on fire  that's why I'm ridin' with my tool
1800 block  boy  I'm quick to give a bitch the blues
I was already sentenced  before I came up out the womb
Streets done already sentenced me  before no cracker could
And I wonder why  when I'm just so fucked up out the hood
And I wonder why  these niggas be hatin' on a G
When I'm the same lil' nigga  who gave you niggas a chance to eat
I had to do that time  could nobody do that shit for me
When I was doin' that time  ain't nobody do that shit with me
I miss my nigga Cool  I know right now he prolly sleep

Yeah life ain’t fair but it’s still good though
It’s a blessing just to be here
Everything 1K
I know you’re money hungry
Can’t wait ‘cause you ain’t eat all day
And you gon’ lose your mind if you don’t get a plate
This for all the soldiers fell victim to the system
Everyday that goes by they so close to losing faith
I gotta thank God for everything
It’s a miracle how you’ll wake up and your dreams right in your face
Everything 1K
I woke up in the morning on a cold slab
How the hell I’m in a damn cell
I’m in jail taking cold baths
I went down the wrong path
Lil boy don’t go that way
You prolly won’t last
Before I had the fame I had the name
I earned my stripes like Adidas
Sliding base like I’m Derek Jeter
How he gon’ learn to be a man when you ain’t never teach him?
Youngin’ can’t even read but he totin’ the Desert Eagle
I done made it through the rain and I ain’t called FEMA

I probably thank God ‘cause without him who is me?
He unlocked my cell when they threw away the key
Hurting ‘cause your people ate and you ain’t get a piece
Now you’re taking from your people plate ‘cause you just tryna eat
Grinding for a mil and I ain’t talkin’ ‘bout a combo
I pray for all my youngins who done took the same route
I know you’re money hungry
Can’t wait ‘cause you ain’t eat all day
And you gon’ lose your mind if you don’t get a plate
This for all the soldiers fell victim to the system
Everyday that goes by they so close to losing faith
I gotta thank God for everything
It’s a miracle how you’ll wake up and your dreams right in your face
A wise man can play a fool but a fool can't play wise
Unless you judge me by my cover you can't read between my lines
I'm a street poet  poetical genius
Y'all need me  believe me
They ain't know that I was intellectual
Tryna change your life  but they won't let ya
I'm in Detroit right now
Just hollerin' at my nigga Wiz
I was hollerin' at my boy  he say he feel like he gon' die soon
Had to pray for him because he need it more than I do
How can I tell my people that's exactly the way I feel?
But I know that I'm blessed  so I won't give a bitch that idea
Runnin' from the Jakes  I was posted up with a 9 mill
Got me jumpin' gates  I got credit cards in my high heels
All my niggas fake  that shit kept comin' out like diarrhea
Wiz  he just whipped up a brick and he ain't put no noodles in it
Told him I just caught me a fish  so don't put no tuna in it
They know that I'm baptized in blood  I let my soul sing it
Talking to my lil' boy  I promise won't let them boys kill me
Young nigga stickin' to the code  'cause I don't condone snitchin'
I ain't goin' out like that rapper  I won't do no tippin'
Willie said my name on the TV  that boy a bold witness
On the news he T.I.P.’d me  that boy got no feelings
Suwoop put the pole on lil' buddy  they said The Game strippin'
Old heads ain't hittin' on nothin'  I say them boys kiddin'
I want all the smoke out the stove  but I don't even roll Phillies
How the hell you callin' me out when you know I don't listen?
How you try and put me in timeout when I ain't Big Boy children?
Nigga waitin' on for me to fall off just like that boy Gillie
How you tell me what came out my mouth  you don't even know Nipsey?
I can't beat you niggas at talkin'  give me a long sentence
Know I keep the pole and I ain't no ho  I know some Rollin 60s
And I'm thuggin' all on my lonely  but I keep some Zoes with me
How the hell you cancel a nigga  and I don't even smoke tobacco?
Mute me when I voice my opinion  and I ain't even know it mattered
Jump right on my live and record me  everything I say be Platinum
How the hell you cancel a nigga  and I don't even smoke tobacco?
Gave my mama hundred racks
And bought a iced-out AP watch
And bought a Cuban links just to match
And hidin' K2 in my mattress
Smokin' Tunechi in my cell
That was my twelfth time going to jail
That was my second time going to hell
And back for real but I prevail
Canary yellow diamonds in my bracelets
Same color as my lady
'Bout to hit her with no Jimmy Mack
And go half on a baby
'Bout to hit her with no Jimmy
Have her walkin' like a penguin
And a brand new two-door Wraith
I coulda bought it but I just rent it
Got a brand new big old chain
Got so much sauce I don't need no pendant
Paintin' pictures when I be spendin'
I'm poppin' flo-rhythym on all these women
And I just went to go see the dentist
Put some stones all in my gold
Know you niggas thought I was gone
Know you niggas thought I wasn't comin' home
Crack a nigga dome
(On probation but I still keep that chrome
I'll crack a nigga dome)
Traded my Rollie for a AP but I coulda got a Patek
Traded my ex bitch for a check
I'm takin' codeine with the x
I wanna buy my brother the world

I had to go through hard times and dark times for me to see the light

'Cause I ain't ever see the sign but the sign showed after time
Guess I was just waiting on that sign
So I got up and went out on my grind
'Cause I used to cry 'cause ain't no food in the house
Used to have the pretty girls and I just hoped that they was mine (Mm-mm)
Black boy robbed a nigga right in front of my eyes
'Til I got old enough to run up on you with the .9
Take yo' shit and make 'em cry
So I don't care about yours 'cause they ain't care about mine
PBL charges got me waiting on trial (Mm-mm)
The sign read Never know until you find out
The things I found out
But they don't understand what goes on in my house
Ain't no love if you broke
They don't even wanna laugh wit' you
They'll even wipe your ass for you
In this world full of fame and pretty girls
It can make your mind swirl
Them Cuban links and them rings
I'm 'bout whatever and I'll hit a nigga like a road rat
Slow money 'cause fast money will get me sentenced
To mask up and hit yo' granny for a penny
I did it so I'm ready for all of the consequences

You know  a nigga so versatile I don't even need no auto-tune and none of that shit
I could sweep the flow up  the melody
Like I could speak to all her fans through every genre
I fuck wit this beat  tough though  ya heard
Helluva made this beat  baby
Everything on my path for this
I swear to God  dawg  I never imagined this
I remember I was out there on my savage shit  carjacking shit
On my snappin' shit  trappin' shit  ratchet shit
Seem like I lost more than I ever gained
Ain't get nun out these streets but pain
Ain't get nun out these streets but hard times
'Cause in these streets ain't nun but hard times
Tell C.B. I say wassup
Tell everybody I say what's happening
Tell E-Pimp I said shoot me som'in
Tell them boys I said stop flaggin'
Tell my momma that I'm comin' home
Tell the world that it won't be long
Ask my hoes wassup with they phones
Tell 'em I'm away but I ain't gone
I said boo bear what you wanna do
Once you slide  imma follow through
The stand took a nigga up and through it
Lil Dash told me  Kodak don't do it
Tell my son that I love his ass
Tell 'em I can't wait to hug his ass
This for the niggas who got all that time
Now they trying to give them numbers back
A nigga shot my cousin four times
I heard through the wall my brother doubled back
I just bumped into this super jit
I'm hollering at Lil Fam through the vent
I'm letting you know I do this shit for fun
Tell me go then consider it done
Shoutout Petho and my brother blood
My nigga C-Lo he just caught a thug
I'm shooting cee-lo in a nigga ass
They hit a nigga for his whole bag
Tell them boys I said stop crabbing
Send it even if I never asked
I knew I should've told my lil nigga DJ to chill
But I can't tell him shit he doin the same shit that I will
I'm thinking bout how would it be if we ain't get on them pills  if we ain't never chose the streets and picked up the steel
I'm thinkin' bout how would it be if we stayed on the field
Like I ain't even have to rap  'cause I got other skills
At nights we ran down with them sticks and got them automobiles
And we was jackin' cars and shit 'cause it wasn't hard to steal
Like doin bids and seeing it come  but this the life I live
But I know that this my last one  something gotta give
Seem like God  got me paying for all the shit I did
'Cause I slowed down a while ago  switched up positive
The rough was just enough for a nigga fell in love with the thrill
But before he forgive me I gotta pay for it still
And I done did so much of shit that I ain't proud I did
But when I took rappin' serious I threw the towel in
But Lord you say you gon' forgive me  so forgive me then
'Cause I done picked the Bible up and read Corinthians
I'm still young and I got a lot to experience
I guess the first time in my life I felt this serious
I gotta lil boy now and I wanna be there for bruh
The feeling he give a nigga I ain't never felt this way before
And you can look into my heart and see that I'm forreal
That I done resulted in a metamorphosis
God  you know my destiny 'cause you gave me this gift
You the one who put this breath in me to make me spit these lyrics
You done gave a nigga a chance to pay my momma bills
You done turned me to a man unlike my daddy is

When you really want 'em  when you really need 'em
When them people playing with your freedom
When a nigga shit on me one time but I be tryna get even
I'm tryna get equal

Who gon' jump the gate on me
Pillow case that thang on it

I bought a Xbox but I don't play on it
PS4 but I don't play no games on it

Been up  I been on my back

Remember I made my first stack
When Wally had that Pontiac
Went to jail and I came back
Went through hell and I came back
Was in my cell  recreating myself
I died  and then I came back
Wondering where my partners at
Ain't write me and I acknowledge that
Snoop had me selling powder bags
He ain't even give me a dollar back
Later on  started sneaking shit in my pocket like it's contraband
Finessin' had me lookin' back at my profit  I had seven bands
Project Baby  Taliban
It's Kodak  run and tell a friend
It's for my mama  she love me
She just want the best for me
Told me I should be in the booth instead of posted up on the ugly
Was in the club on that Hennessy
