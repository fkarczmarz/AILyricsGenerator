"Never let a simp' nigga mess up my eye lid
Can we find a way?
I can't do anything without you
I've been running from you all night and now it feel like
I can't do anything without you
Want you I want you babe
I want it baby
Want you I want you babe
Yeah I need it baby
Want you I want you babe
I want it baby
5 am and I want you baby
5 am and I want you baby

And a dark-skinned Kylie  can I rock both bodies? Ayy

Ballin' like LeBron now  shots like a pro now
Let me tell you how it goes down
I ain't drivin' when it's goin'  now pour me another cup
This your favorite song on  don't tell me you in a rush
When I give you all I have  you tell me it ain't enough

See I know just how you like it  I'll back behind ya

Won't make me feel like I love you

Last night I woke up and I fucked the baddest bitch
I thought I would be ready when I seen her
When I was underneath her
I gotta keep it honest
Keep it real with you

And the last thing I remember was you holding me
The fact that I still love you in the morning
Tells me that your body might be home for me
We were dancing  we were wild in the ocean
When the crowd is all around me  you're still all I see
And the way you lay me down and break me open
Tells me that your body might be home for me
Love the way you lay me down and break me open  open  open
Love the way you lay me down and break me open  open
The moon is up  I'm back to life  my eyes are open
I could lay right here forever if you're holding me
It's the way you love me even though I'm broken
Tells me that your body might be home for me
We were dancing by the tides in the moment
Looked around and when I found you  finally found peace
It's the way you fill me up with your emotion
Tells me that your body might be home for me
