lyrics
"And in our hearts we know the truth
And I believe in love
Try and fill us with your hate and we will shine a light
And the days will become endless
Then it's just too much
I cannot get you close enough
You can always find me here
Let me hold it lightly
Give me arms to pray with
Instead of ones that hold too tightly
We have no need to fight
We raise our voices and let our hearts take flight
Get higher than those planes can fly
Where the stars do not take sides

Then it's just too much
I cannot get you close enough
You can always find me here
Let me hold it lightly
Give me arms to pray with
Instead of ones that hold too tightly
And then it's just too much
You can always find me here
Let me hold it lightly
Give me arms to pray with
Instead of ones that hold too tightly
I let him sleep and as he does
My held breath fills the room with love
Hurts in ways I can't describe
And is born again with each sunrise
And is born again with each sunrise
Funerals were held all over the city
The youth bleed in the square
And women raged as old men fumbled and cried
And how does it feel now you've scratched that itch?
How does it feel?
And pulled out all your stitches
Hubris is a bitch
And then it's just too much
You can always find me here
Let me hold it lightly
Give me arms to pray with
Big enough to hold your love
You need a big god
Big enough to fill you up
You keep me up at night
You know I still like you the most
The best of the best and the worst of the worst
The places that I go
I still like you the most
You'll always be my favourite ghost
You need a big god
Big enough to hold your love
You need a big god
Big enough to fill you up
Sometimes I think it's getting better
And then it gets much worse
Is it just part of the process?
Though I know I should know better
Is it just part of the process?

Don't leave me on this white cliff
Saw what I'd done  he set up a nest outside
And he sang about what I'd become
He sang so loud  sang so clear
I was afraid all the neighbours would hear
So I invited him in  just to reason with him
I promised I wouldn't do it again
But he sang louder and louder inside the house
And no I couldn't get him out
So I trapped him under a cardboard box
Stood on it to make him stop
I picked up the bird and above the din I said
That's the last song you'll ever sing
Held him down  broke his neck
Taught him a lesson he wouldn't forget
But in my dreams began to creep
That old familiar tweet  tweet  tweet
I opened my mouth to scream and shout
I waved my arms and flapped about
But I couldn't scream and I couldn't shout
Couldn't scream and I couldn't shout
I opened my mouth to scream and shout
I waved my arms and flapped about
But I couldn't scream and I couldn't shout
The song was coming from my mouth

They cut out my eyes and sent me home packin'
To pace around the kitchen for scraps of inspiration
And left me doin' laundry to think on what I'd done
I used to move into the future and bring it all back
Now I creep out when there's no one about
'Cause they put crosses on the doors to try and keep me out
The gardеn's overgrown
And I run in the middle of thе road (Ooh)
I cannot see you
Everything I thought I knew has fallen out of view
In this blindness I'm condemned to
I cannot hear you
And there's no one left to sing to

All the gods have been domesticated
And Heaven is now overrated
But you can take your complaints straight to the Lord
I try to still look with wonder on the world
As the roses bloom
And the riot van still plainly in view

Everything I thought I knew has fallen out of view
In this blindness that I'm condemned to
I cannot hear you
And there's no one left to sing to
(Ooh)
(Ooh)
I cannot see you
Everything I thought I knew has fallen out of view
And if I run fast enough
Could I break apart
With the complete conviction of someone who's never had anything actually really bad happen to them
But I am committed now to the feeling
I don't know how it started
Don't know how to stop it
To imaginary music
I just kept spinnin' and I danced myself to death
I just kept spinnin' and I danced myself to death
And this is the end
And I'm thinking about her
Driving around in the backseat of the car
I'll be your demon daddy
And do they speak to you?
'Cause they spеak to me too
The pressurе and the panic
You push your body through

I just kept spinnin' and I danced myself to death

You said that rock and roll is dead
But is that just because it has not been
Resurrected in your image?
Like if Jesus came back
But in a beautiful dress
And all the evangelicals were like
I just kept spinnin' and I danced myself to death
I just kept spinnin' and I danced myself to death
I just kept spinnin' and I danced myself to death
I just kept spinnin' and I danced myself to death
And landed in my eyes
I screamed aloud as it tore through them
They have all been blown out
You left me in the dark
I'm always in this twilight
In the shadow of your heart
I tried to find the sound
But then it stopped and I was in the darkness
So darkness I became
They have all been blown out
You left me in the dark

In the shadow of your heart

I took the stars from my eyes and then I made a map
So I stayed in the darkness with you

You left me in the dark (You left me in the dark)
I'm always in this twilight
In the shadow of your heart (In the shadow of your)
The helpless optimism of spring
Worn out and tired and my heart near retired
And the world bent double from weeping
And yet  the birds begin to sing
Ooh  ooh  oh

I'm not bad  I'm not good
I drank every sky that I could
Made myself mythical  tried to be real
Saw the future in the face of a

Raising the dead under the moonlight

To kiss my face and tell me I'm that chosen one
A generation soaked in grief
We're drying out and hanging on by the skin of our teeth
I never thought it would get this far
This somewhat drunken joke
Sometimes  I see so much beauty
I don't think that I can cope
There is no bad  there is no good
I drank every sky that I could
Made myself mythical  tried to be real
Saw the future in the face of a

(Holding on for your call)
Climbing up the walls for that flashing light
(I can never let go)
'Cause I'm gonna be free and I'm gonna be fine

It's a different kind of danger

And my feet are spinning round
Never knew I was a dancer

If I would feel better just lightly sedated
The feeling comes so fast and I cannot control it
I'm on fire  but I'm trying not to show it
As it picks me up  puts me down
It picks me up  puts me down
Picks me up  it puts me down
A hundred times a day
It picks me up  puts me down
Chews me up  spits me out
Picks me up  it puts me down
I'm always running from something
I push it back  but it keeps on coming
And being clever never got me very far
Because it's all in my head
You're too sensitive  they said
As it picks me up  puts me down
Picks me up  puts me down
Picks me up  it puts me down
A hundred times a day
Picks me up  puts me down
Chews me up  spits me out
It picks me up  puts me down

But I hear the music  I feel the beat

And for a moment  when I'm dancing
I am free

Is this how it is?
Is this how it's always been?
To exist in the face of suffering and death
And somehow still keep singing?
Oh  like Christ up on a cross
Who died for us  who died for what?
Oh  don't you wanna call it off?
But there is nothing else that I know how to do
But to open up my arms and give it all to you
'Cause I hear the music  I feel the beat
And for a moment  when I'm dancing
I am free
I am free
I am free
I told her not to fuss and relax
Pretty little face stopped me in my tracks
But now she sleeps with one eye open
And that's the price she'll pay
I took a knife and cut out her eye
I took it home and watched it wither and die
But that's the price she'll pay
Get your filthy fingers out of my pie
I'll cut your little heart out 'cause you made me cry

That when someone looks at me with real love
I don't like it very much
Kinda makes me feel like I'm bein' crushed
Is this something that you would like to discuss?
And it's good to be alive
Crying into cereal at midnight
I listen to music from 2006 and feel kind of sick
You'll be sorry that you messed with this
Remember being in that basement with Tom Vek?
Everyone treated us like little pets
And in my darkest fantasies
I am the picture of passivity
Waitin' for you side of stage
Suppressing all my private rage
Crying into cereal at midnight
When I decided to wage holy war
It looked very much like staring at my bedroom floor
You'll be sorry that you messed with me
And I know I may not look like much
Just another screaming speck of dust

I met the Devil
A golden heart
I guess I could go back to university
Try and make my mother proud
The spelling is a problem
As is the discipline
And I don't think it would be too long
Before I was drunk in Camberwell again
This is the only thing I've ever had any faith in
And the sunshine hit me and I was behaving strangely
All the walls were melting and there were mermaids everywhere

Heaven is here if you want it
Oh  bring your boy  bring your bottle
Open your mouth  pour it down his neck
Heaven is here if you want it
And all of the fish  let 'em flounder
I went to the water  drank every drop
I'll turn your sea to a desert
More catholic taste than the Devil

You make a fool of death with your beauty
And for a moment
I thought that love was in the drugs
But the more I took  the more it took away
And I could never get enough
I thought that love was on the stage  give yourself to strangers
You don't have to be afraid

Jenny would dance with her ghosts
The ones she had lost and the ones she had found
And the ones who had loved her the most
The ones who'd been gone for so very long
She couldn't remember their names
They spun her around on the damp old stone
Spun away all her sorrow and pain
They danced through the day and into the night
Through the snow that swept through the hall
From winter to summer and winter again

Woke up in Chicago when the sky turned black

In those heavy days in June
When love became an act of defiance
Hold on to each other
Hold on to each other
Hold on to each other
Hold on to each other
And you were broken-hearted
And the world was too
And I was beginning to lose my grip
And I have always held it loosely

I felt it really start to slip
And choirs sing in the street
And I would come to you
To watch the television screen
In your hotel room

Push it further  you know I'll never break
At some point in the party  I thought my heart was failing
Flashes appeared at the corner of my eyes
I saw the stars and I didn't ask why
Heard the voices and caught my breath
So close and yet so far from death
So close and yet so far from death

Well  the feeling was always too much for me
It always came too strong

Maybe I was just hungry for blood
Sea foam woman on the shore
All the mermaids have sharp teeth
Razor blades all in your feet
England is only ever grey or green
The girls glitter striding glorious and coatless in the rain
I remember falling through these streets
It makes my chest hurt to think of it
Cheerful oblivion
Cheerful oblivion
It was not all pain and pavements slick with rain
And shining under lights from shitty clubs and doing shitty drugs
And hugging girls that smelt like Britney Spears and coconuts

Cheerful oblivion
They climb the struts of Brighton Pier
To sacrifice a human heart

I never got to see Elvis
I just sweated it out in a hotel room
But I think the king woulda understood
Why I never made it to Graceland
The bathroom tiles were cool against my hand
I pressed my forehead to the floor and prayed for a trapdoor
I've been here many times before
But I've never made it to Graceland
And if I make it to the mornin'
I shoulda come with a warnin'
And if I make it to the stage
I'll show you what it means
To be saved
Well  pick me up in New Orleans
Pinned in a bathroom stall
Pick me up above my body
Press my corpse against the wall
I told the band to leave without me
I'll get the next flight
And I'll see you all with Elvis

Oh  you know I'm still afraid

Leave me on my knees?
'Cause I belong to the ground now
And it belongs to me
And oh Lord  won't you leave me
Leave me just like this?
'Cause I belong to the ground now
I want no more than this
How I long for the autumn
The sun keeps burning me
Every stone in this city keeps reminding me  oh
Can you protect me from what I want?
The lover I let in who left me so lost
Mother  make me
Make me a big tall tree
So I can shed my leaves and let it blow through me
Mother  make me
Make me a big grey cloud
So I can rain on you things I can't say out loud
All these couples are kissing
And I can't stand the heat
I lost my shoes and left the party
I wandered in the street
I put my feet into the fountain
The statues all asleep
No use wishing on the water
It grants you no relief

Mother  make me
Make me a bird of prey
So I can rise above this  let it fall away
Mother  make me
Make me a song so sweet
Heaven trembles  falling at my feet
Oh Lord  won't you leave me
Leave me on my knees?
'Cause I belong to the ground now
And it belongs to me
And oh Lord  won't you leave me
Leave me just like this?
'Cause I belong to the ground now
I want no more than this
Oh Lord  won't you leave me
Leave me on my knees?
'Cause I belong to the ground now
And it belongs to me
And oh Lord  won't you leave me
Leave me just like this?
'Cause I belong to the ground now
The song always made sense to me
Now I find that when I look down
Every page is empty
There is nothing to describe
Except the moon still bright against the worrying sky
I pray the trees will get their leaves soon
So tell me where to put my love
Do I wait for time to do what it does?
I don't know where to put my love
No cracking open of Heaven
But quiеt and still (All my friends are getting ill)
So tеll me where to put my love

Fractured moonlight on the sea
Reflections still look the same to me
As before I went under
And it's peaceful in the deep
Cathedral where you cannot breathe
Now I am under all
And it's breaking over me
A thousand miles down to the sea bed
Found the place to rest my head
And the arms of the ocean are carrying me
And all this devotion was rushing out of me
And the crashes are heaven for a sinner like me
But the arms of the ocean delivered me
Though the pressure's hard to take
It's the only way I can escape
It seems a heavy choice to make

'Cause the older I get
I find that happiness is an extremely uneventful subject
And there would be no grand choirs to sing
No chorus could come in
About two people sitting doing nothing
But I must confess
I did it all for myself
I gathered you here to hide from some vast unnameable fear
But the loneliness never left me
I always took it with me
But I can put it down in the pleasure of your company
And there will be no grand choirs to sing
No chorus will come in
No ballad will be written
It will be entirely forgotten

At least we had it for a moment

About my old school
And she was there all pink and gold and glittering
I threw my arms around her legs
Came to weeping (Came to weeping)
Came to weeping (Came to weeping)
And I heard your voice as clear as day
And you told me I should concentrate
It was all so strange and so surreal
That a ghost should be so practical
Only if for a night
And the only solution was to stand and fight
And my body was bruised and I was set alight
But you came over me like some holy rite
Only if for a night
And the grass was so green against my new clothes
And I did cartwheels in your honor
Dancing on tiptoes
My own secret ceremonials

In the graveyard doing handstands

I've turned it over in my mind
I sang by the piano
Tore my yellow dress and
Cried and cried and cried
Now to unsee what I've seen
To undo what has been done
Turn off all the lights
Now there's green light in my eyes
And my lover on my mind
And I sing from the piano
Tear my yellow dress and
Cry and cry and cry

All this champagne drunken home
Against the current of gold
Everybody see I love him

From you the flowers grow
And do you understand with every seed you sow
You make this cold world beautiful?

Young and drunk and stumbling in the street
Outside the Joiners Arms like foals unsteady on their feet
With the art students and the boys in bands
High on E and holding hands with someone that I just met
And we climbed onto the roof of the museum
And someone made love in the grass
And I forgot my name
And the way back to my mother's house
With your Blackpool eyes and your bitten lips

And I remember thinking
Even in my dreaming
It was a good line for a song
We were a family pulled from the flood
You tore the floorboards up
And let the river rush in
We were reaching in the dark
That summer in New York
And it was so far to fall
But it didn't hurt at all

From the balcony like my grandmother so many years before me
I've always been in love with you

Of various storms and saints
Parading in the streets
As the banks began to break
And I'm in the throes of it
Somewhere in the belly of the beast
But you took your toll on me
So I gave myself over willingly
You got a hold on me
I don't know how I don't just stand outside and scream
I am teaching myself how to be free
The monument of the memory
You tear it down in your head
Don't make the mountain your enemy

But even though it shocked you

Some things you let go in order to live
Trying to cross a canyon with a broken limb
Wondering what to do with life
I'd already had a sip
So I reasoned I was drunk enough to deal with it

And with one kiss
You inspired a fire of devotion that lasts for twenty years

Wraps itself around you and whispers in your ear
Tells you that I miss you and I wish that you were here
There'll be so much that I'll have to let go
You're disappearing all the time
But I still see you in the light
And it's beautiful but there's that tug inside
You might also like
You're always on my mind
You're always on my mind
And I never minded being on my own
Then something broke in me and I wanted to go home
To be where you are
And now I'm reaching out with every note I sing
And I hope it gets to you on some pacific wind
Wraps itself around you and whispers in your ear
Tells you that I miss you and I wish that you were here
We all need something watching over us
And then the sea swept in and left us all speechless
Speechless
And I never minded being on my own
Then something broke in me and I wanted to go home
To be where you are
And now I'm reaching out with every note I sing
And I hope it gets to you on some pacific wind
Wraps itself around you and whispers in your ear
Tells you that I miss you and I wish that you were here
Wish that you were here
Wish that you were here
Wish that you were here
I know I can count on you
But you've got the love I need to see me through
Sometimes  it seems the goin' is just too rough
And things go wrong  no matter what I do
Now and then  it seems that life is just too much
But you've got the love I need to see me through
When friends are gone  I know my saviour's love is real
You know it's real
Time after time  I think it's just no good
But you've got the love I need to see me through
Woah  oh
You might also like
Sometimes  I feel like throwing my hands up in the air
'Cause I know I can count on you  oh"
