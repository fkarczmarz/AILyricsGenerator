lyrics
"Your friend told you 'cause I told her
Friday nights have been lonely
Change your plans and then phone me
We could go and get forties
Fuck going to that party
12:51 is the time my voice
Found the words I sought
Is it this stage I want?
The world is shutting out for us
But we was confident
Kiss me now that I'm older
I won't try to control you
Friday nights have been lonely
Take it slow but don't warn me
You might also like
We'd go out and get forties
Then we'd go to some party
That I've watched you
Passing by
I've tried too hard
To get back there
Anymore
Tried to get in with you
For a second time
You said the world's closed in
But you crawled in
Back inside
So please
Run away
So please
Run away
I tried to believe in fate
For a second try
It's there in the safe
Why don't you
Close the blinds
For the night

Let him go  he gave up
I gave up
Lisa said  Take time for me
Droppin' him down to his knees
Ah  chest down
Things  they have changed in such a permanent way
Life seems unreal  can we go back to your place?
Oh  You drink too much makes me drink just the same
People tried  felt so right
Givin' themselves good advice
Lookin' down sometimes felt nice
He knows it's justified to kill to survive
Let's suck more blood  let's run three hours a day
The world is over  but I don't care
'Cause I am with you  now I've got to explain
Things  they have changed in such a permanent way
Life seems unreal  can we go back to your place?

Like a little boy
What you runnin' for?
Arrive at the door
Anyone home?
Have I lost it all?
Struck me like a chord
I'm a lonely boy
Holding out the knife
Lonely afterlife
You begged me not to go
Sinkin' like a stone
Use me like an oar
And get yourself to shore
A bang at the door
Anyone home?
That's just what they do
Right in front of you
Like a cannonball
Slammin' through your wall
What they're fightin' for

Struck me like a chord

Holding out the knife
Lonely afterlife
Bangin' on the door
I don't wanna know
Sinkin' like a stone
So use me like an oar
Hard to fight what I can't see
Not tryna build no dynasty
I can't see beyond this wall
But we lost this game
So many times before
I've been on a cold road
I'll be waiting from the other side
Waiting for the tide to rise
I've been on a cold road
I'll be waiting from the other side
 you wanted me
 it's got to pass
 then I got a different view
 I'm not gonna give it a break
 I never was
 I'm not gonna give it a break
 he wanted me
 it's got to pass
 I know you warned me but this is too important
 I never was
 I'm not gonna give it a break
Moscow  1972
Always singin' in my sleep
I will leave it in my dreams

I don't know how to use  how
'Cause I can't  I can't
I spent the money that I saved up
I wanna steal your innocence
Why won't you wear your new trenchcoat?
I should have worked much harder
I should have just not bothered
I never show up on weekdays
And something that you learned yesterday
Drive you to work and you'll be on time
I got some secrets that'll make you stay

You don't make me sorry
Now I know that you never listened – listen
Thinking about that high school dance
Worrying about the finals
I never needed anybody

So don't you wanna remind me
I don't know a thing
And some of us remember
And some run out of place
Can I waste all your time here on the sidewalk?
Can I stand in your light just for a while?
I've waited around to wait in a room
Having a hard time watching you
I wanted to understand your face
So don't you wanna remind me

And some of us remember

Get on your horse and be gone
I will not wait up for you anymore
So you can ask me if something is wrong
Will you go?
I don't know anymore
When the night isn't ready for you

And he claims that it's not a surprise

Waiting for the night
Leaving night by night
You can see me travel
We could be in trouble every night
Always get it right
I'd listen but I can't tonight
I can't tonight  I can't tonight
Well  it's something that you do to get it right
End up reviled for it
Yeah  that's the thanks I get
I don't understand
Your fucked-up system
This sinister city
Try to sell the water
Try to sell the air
Try to sell your daughter
Try to sell her hair

Somethings I don't wanna know

Cause I don't wanna see everybody get together
Leave these dreams alone
You don't wanna have to tell me that I wanted you go
Asked me for the phone
Tried to take control
I don't see it that way

All obsessed with fame
Says we're all the same

And I don't write better when I'm stuck in the ground
So don't teach me a lesson 'cause I've already learned
Yeah  the sun will be shining and my children will burn
Oh  the heart beats in its cage
I don't want what you want  I don't feel what you feel
See  I'm stuck in a city but I belong in a field
Now it's three in the morning and you're eating alone
Oh  the heart beats in its cage
All our friends  they're laughing at us
All of those you loved  you mistrust
Help me  I'm just not quite myself
Look around  there's no one else left
I went to the concert and I fought through the crowd
Guess I got too excited when I thought you were around
And I'm sorry you were thinking I would steal your fire

'Cause they'll be trying to knock you down in some way
Sometimes it feels like the world is falling asleep
How do you wake someone up from inside a dream?
Your mind would wander and search for its place in the night
Your body followed this feeling like following light
Once that your music was born  it followed you 'round
And then it gave your activities meaning and let you be loud
You're sad but you smile  it's not in your eyes
Your eyeballs don't change  it's the muscles around your eyes
An egg to fertilize
A pulse to stabilize
A body to deodorize
A life to scrutinize
A child to criticize
Young adults to modernize!
Citizens to terrorize
Generations to desensitize
Your dreams are sweet and obsessed and you're overworked
You're over taken by visions of being overlooked
How disappointed would D.I.D.I.P.P. be
To see such our power in our hands all wasted on greed?
Am I a prisoner to instincts or do my thoughts just live
As free and detached as boats to the dock?
Just like the music was born and detached from your heart
Is your free time to free minds or for falling apart?

Seven ways to get ahead
Seven reasons to drop out
You like music we can dance to
I'll calm down and I'll get along with you
There is a time when we all fail
Some people take it pretty well
Some take it all out on themselves
Some they just take it out on friends

Old time grudges
Will die so slowly

There's no one I disapprove of more or root for more than myself
So we talk about ourselves in hell
To forget the love we never felt
All the old jokes that work so well
Universal truth was a moment's lie
Don't try to stop us
Don't try to stop us
Don't try to stop us
Get out of the way
Got to get to climb your tree in the light of the living ghost I see
She sees her father in that old man's eyes while secretly he stares at her thighs
Animals on TV singing about some pain they felt at some point
As I watch the velvet drapes appear
And the door was closed for forty years
As we hide what we don't wanna hear
As we hide what's really in our ears

 That's okay  long as we can celebrate
 my uncle would say

 you see  my uncle would say
 that's what she said

 that was long ago and darling  I don't mind
 they were just two fucks in lust
 baby  that just don't mean much

Haha  no  I didn't mean that at all
Ooh  ooh  ooh
Here in the streets so mechanized
Rise to the bottom of the meaning of life
Studied all the rules and didn't want no part
But I let you in just to break this heart
Even though it was only one night
It was fucking strange
Nina's in the bedroom  she said  Time to go now
And the hours  they ran slow
I said  every night  she just can't stop saying
New York City cops  New York City cops
New York City cops  but they ain't too smart
New York City cops  New York City cops
New York City cops  but they ain't too smart
Well  kill me now 'cause I let you down
I swear one day I'm gonna leave this town

Don’t wanna play that game anymore

To seek his enemy's throat cut

What we hide from them
And then say
“What do you want from me?”
Don’t wait so long
Way too long

I can’t stay awake too long
You never wait for some
Other generation
I’ll wait somewhere
What side are you standing on?

Not gonna wake up here anymore
Listen one time  it's not the truth
It's just a story I tell to you
Easy to say  easy to do
Hope that you find it  hope that it's good
Hope that you read it  think that you should
Cuts you some slack as he sits back
Sizes you up  plans his attack
Da-da-da
Drums please  Fab
And I got it all  I got it all
Waitin' for me down on the street
But now you gotta do somethin' special for me
I'm gonna say what's on my mind
Then I'll walk out  then I'll feel fine
I will not show my teeth too quick

Learned all your tricks  wasn't too hard
It's the last one now  I can promise you that

Gone now are the old times
Forgotten  time to hold on the railing
The Rubik's Cube isn't solving for us
Old friends  long forgotten
The old ways at the bottom of

The only thing that's left is us
So pardon the silence that you're hearing
Get dressed in your bed

I don’t wanna be in there with you
I don't wanna be in there without your loving either
I waited for your thoughts
I bet you'd pick it up and mess around with it if I put it down
It gets extremely complicated
Anything to forget everything
You've got to take me out at least once a week
Whether I'm in your arms or I'm at your feet
I know exactly what you're thinking
You won't say it now  but in your heart it's loud
Oh no  my feelings are more important than yours
Oh  the razorblade  wish it would snap this rope
The world is in your hand or it's at your throat
At times it's not that complicated
Anything to forget everything
