"If love was the currency
If my back was up against it
I'd swear on my property
I know you ain't the one to gamble
I bet you you're gonna win
Lay all your cards on the table
Let me know if you're out or in
If you give a little time then I'll be yours (Ooh)
Just spend a little time 'cause it don't cost (Ooh)
Put it all down on a good thing
Don't you wanna know what you're missing?
What I need ain't a lot
Put it all down on a good thing
Don't you wanna know what you're missing?
Put a little love on me
A little love down on me
Won't you put it down on me
Put a little lovin' down on me

Patience lost  I began to lose me
My advice would be take a breath
Close your eyes and take a step
I wasn't scared  I fought this on my own
You pulled me down and I let you go
I told you I would prove you wrong
And now I'm here and I'm standing strong
I know (I know  I know)
I know (I-I know  I know)
I know (I know  I know)
Cause I spent forever waiting
And it's no longer a dream
And now I've landed on my feet
And I ain't got far to go
Day one  I said I'd go for me
One box ticked  got a lot to beat

Going full steam ahead  the meter’s running
Concentrating my moves  I’m on a mission
I see demons all around me
They not gon' stamp  not gon' stamp on me
Don’t stop me in my tracks  I’m onto something
I got all I need
Cut me  do I not bleed?
No bad blood  no bad blood

Sometimes when I fall down low
And I got no where else to go
I hide myself   don't let it show
But you find me
Sometimes when the day goes by
I've missed it 'cause all I did was cry
You always know the reason why
You know me
You always got the words that never let me down  let me down
Always make me laugh somehow
You tell me don't worry
When I've done wrong
It's something that I'll never know
How you can love someone so broken  so right?
'Cause all I ever wanted  was a little bit of Paradise
Sometimes when I run too fast
You let me go don't hold me back
When I can't see the tracks

Sometimes when I can't see
I lose my balance and I can't breathe

Tryna keep my head above the water
Thought you'd know when I was callin'

I just didn't want us to drown
Thought we'd find our way back 'round
Alone  sittin' in your chair
And it's sad  facin' what is gone
Don't know where I belong  tryna find a song that
That doesn't remind me of us  us
Feels like all the walls are closin'
And the sky is fallin' down on me

Don't know where I belong  tryna find a song
I drew a smile on my face to paper over me
But wounds heal when tears dry and cracks they don't show
Let's go back to simplicity
I feel like I've been missing me
Was not who I'm supposed to be
I felt this darkness over me
We all get there eventually
I never knew where I belonged

 no (Woah)

 God only knows
 I wanna take it back to basics

And when you break  I'll be your warm embrace
And I'll be your bed so you can lay your head
I'll be that place you hide all your mistakes
And even if I wanted to
Your heart was bulletproof
And everything that we've been through
Couldn't even pull us through
Been weighing me down  wanna take it all off
Face on the ground  wanna pick it all up
Was praying for love  but I wasn't enough
Done with the pain  make it all stop
I'm more than enough  more than enough

I don't want to feel this pain
Just want to throw it all away and not forget it
Sorrow's here and never leaves
That's another part of me
Better deal with it
I draw these tears from my eyes
Just so I could stop the pain
Just so I could start again
Gave my all to be the best
But you let me go to waste

I know I'm bound to break again

Things happen that are out of my control
So I walk alone constantly thinking thinking thinking to myself but my voice I cannot hear
Where's there to go
I keep laughing ha ha ha ha ha I Crazy I I
Strange thoughts they come and go like nothing leaving shit up in my head
Home at last relief no more weight on my shoulders
I was lost hard road to travel with no shoes on
So much pain
Ooooo ooooo oooo ooooo
Ooooo ooooo oooo ooooo
At times I don't say exactly what I mean but don't treat me like I'm three bricks shy off a load
But what do I know oh oh
I keep laughing ha ha ha ha ha I Crazy I I
Strange thoughts they come and go like nothing leaving shit up in my head
Final stretch I see a break in the weather
Been alone with my thoughts and I see clearer now I'm home
 I don't want nobody baby
 I don't want nobody baby
 I don't want nobody baby
 I don't want nobody baby
 I don't want nobody baby
 I don't want nobody baby
 I don't want nobody baby
Tried to be everything
Don't know how to love
I care way too much
I need a thicker skin
To let nobody in
Don't know how to guard
My tears and my loss
Day comes and everything's enough
I get pins and needles when I think about it
It catches me every day
I've got scars on my soul that I'm scared to show
I tried to raise my voice
Get clouded by the noise
Tripped up more than twice
Those fools taught me right
I bared my naked soul
All of my painful flaws
Wish I could open up
Take in the love

And your lack of love leaves me paranoid
When you wear me out and you spread me thin

Or only keep me sweet to build your wealth
And then the second it goes wrong

Cause I can’t do this on my own

And I was giving up on us
But how can you blame me
If I wasn't enough?
I never minded when your heart turned dark
With every fight I loved you just as hard
And I tried to stop you overthinking
And I gave you my word from the start
That I never minded all your broken parts
Look at all our history
And there's no going back
Remember what you gave me
And now I'm done with being mad
You pushed me and I pulled you back
It all don't matter now

Oh  oh
Swimming in the deep end
With nowhere to go
My body's on a journey
And my mind can't let go
I'm falling into nothing
Tell me what's left to lose
Thought I knew where I was going
But now I know I need you
They say you're no one
Until you're somebody to someone
They say you're no one
'Til someone misses you when you're gone
And now I feel like I've let you down
It's me now who's reaching out
I can't do this on my own
Because you're no one
Until you're somebody to someone

Trying not to give in (Mmm)

Found an answer looking for a question
Got enough words to make a sentence
It’s not easy to find a way
How much water to kill a fire?
How many lows can take you higher?
The only road to your desire
It won’t be easy to find a way
I don’t know what I believe
I won’t let my eyes be deceived
The winds whispering through the trees
That is not gonna be  not gonna be easy
Cause the answers are living indefinitely
It’s time to face it  cause you can’t change it
No rights  no wrongs take it from me

How many laughs to make me happy?
I’m counting stars  they make me lucky
How many turns ‘til I find me?
It’s not easy to find a way
How many lies  ‘til a confession
How many prayers  lead to a blessing
How many burns  to learn a lesson
Now  it’s not easy to find a way
I don’t know what I believe
I won’t let my eyes be deceived
The winds whispering through the trees
That is not gonna be  not gonna be easy
Cause the answers are living indefinitely
It’s time to face it  cause you can’t change it
No rights  no wrongs take it from me
Talk to a stranger and take wrong turns
Cause in this moment we will make it work
Dance with devils  and taste the burn
Cause in this moment we will make it work
Cause the answers are living indefinitely
It’s time to face it  cause you can’t change it
I can't look you in the eye
You read me better than a poem
Guessing every single rhyme
Will you open up this letter
With your heart upon your sleeve?
Knowing you’re not what is missing
I am the only tragedy
Just the thought of me letting you go
Seems so hard when you're all that I know
I tried so hard to be the one
Wasn't ready for you all along
You are too special to be broken
And I can’t be the reason why
I am too lost to be your only
And I can't lay with you and lie

And I'm finally tasting alone
This is the saddest vanilla that I've ever tasted

Lived and waited in the hotel room late at night

And in your way in this cool shade
My tears dry on their own
When there's so many better things than him at hand
