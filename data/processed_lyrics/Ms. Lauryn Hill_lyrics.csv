lyrics
"Masquerading like he got it figured out
Cut off from the sunshine  only smart in his own head
Leaving his descendants to hope and doubt
Left to his devices  those worthless sacrifices
Praying to the altar of himself
Making pilgrimages  thinking he's religious
Like he's got all the light  and no one else
He takes the unsuspected
'Cause he knows they're not connected
And he shows them how to be just as he is
Virtually real
And commercially appealed
To the lust of all the people where he lives
Eve was so naïve  blinded by the pride and greed
Wanting to be intellectual
Drifting from the way  she got turned down one day
And now she thinks that she's bisexual
Caught up in emotion
Burning up in her devotion
To the king of exploitation in the field
She handed him her virtue
'Cause he told her  I won't hurt you
So she lay with him to see how good it feels

Where we gonna go now? What we gonna say now?
Where we gonna go now? What we gonna say now?
Now after the sensation  and the empty fornication
She brought affection home into her bed
Quickly multiplying  now the 3 of them are dying
By the poison she perceived to be good (head!)
Now Eve and her husband are perverted in their judgment
'Cause everything appears to be the same
They entertain suggestion  next time just use protection
Desiring to cover up their shame
But much to their demise
Poor decision closed their eyes
To the very antidote to their dilemma
Burning in their lust
Both of them adulterous
Destroying the original agenda
Praying to the sky in order to maintain a lie
They exhausted every possible conclusion
They can't even entertain the solution in a brain
Filled with vain information and pollution
Hiding from the truth
He provided an excuse
To explain away his desperate situation
When confronted  blamed his wife
Giving birth to carnal life
Refusing to acknowledge what he done
Now if we can agree with who created us to be
Who says we're guilty everyone before his eyes
Making no exceptions  since the day of our conception
Predisposed to hating truth  and loving lies
Where we gonna go now? What we gonna say now?
Where we gonna go now? What we gonna say now?
Stop walking in pride  let the thief be crucified
Un-learn everything you know  and let Him teach you
To this decaying social system
He wants to know how far we're willing to go
If we love him like we say we do  He'll try us
Just you don't regress or slip into hopelessness
Where we gonna go now? What we gonna say now?
Where we gonna go now? What we gonna say now?
I'm telling you  telling you
I'm telling you  I'm telling you
I'm telling you  I'm telling you
Black human packages tied up in strings.
BLACK RAGE can come from all these kinds of things
Black Rage is founded on blatant denial
Deafening silence and social control.
Black Rage is founded on wounds in the soul!
When the dogs bite
When the beatings
When I'm feeling sad
I simply remember all these kinds of things
and then I don't fear so bad!
Black rage is founded: who fed us self-hatred
Lies and abuse  while we waited and waited
Spiritual treason  This grid and its cages
Black rage was founded on these kinds of things
Black rage is founded on draining and draining
Threatening your freedom  To stop your complaining
Poisoning your water  While they say it's raining
Then call you mad for complaining  complaining
Old time bureaucracy drugging the youth
Black rage is founded on blocking the truth
Murder and crime  Compromise and distortion
Sacrifice  sacrifice who makes this fortune?
Greed  falsely called progress
Such human contortion
Black rage is founded on these kinds of things
So when the dog bites
And the beatings
When I’m feeling sad
I simply remember all these kinds of things and then I don’t fear so bad
Free enterprise  is it myth or illusion?
Forcing you back into purposed confusion
Black human trafficking or blood transfusion?
Black rage is founded on these kinds of things.
Victims of violence both psyche and body
Life out of context IS living unGodly
Politics  politics
Greed falsely called wealth
Black rage is founded on denial of self!
Black human packages tied and subsistence
Having to justify your very existence
Try if you must  but you can’t have my soul
Black rage is made by unGodly control
So when the dog bites
And when the beatings
And I’m feeling so sad
I simply remember all these kinds of things

Everybody knows that they're guilty
Resting on their conscious eating their insides
Its Freedom
Its Freedom
Said its Freedom Time now
Time to get free
Its Freedom
There's a war in the mind
For the territory over dominion
Who will dominate opinions
Schizims and isms
Keeping us in forms of religion
Conforming our vision
To the world church's decision
Trapped in a section
Submitted to committee elections
Moral infection
Epidemic Lies and deception
Insurrection
Of the higest possible order
Distorting our tape recorders
From hearing like under water
Beyond the borders
Finding sin in disorder
Bound by the strategy
And systemic depravity
Heavy as gravity
Head first in the cavity
Without a bottom
A fate worse than Sodom
What's got 'em drunk off the spirit?
Truth comes and we can't hear it
And you've been programmed to fear it
I had a vision
I was falling in indecision
Appalling
Calling religion some program on television
How can dominant wisdom
Be recognized in a system
Of anti-christs and majority rules
Intelligent Fools
PhDs of ilusions
Masters of mass confusion
Bachelors of Past illusions
The head or the tail?
The Bloodshed or the Male?
Or confidence in the veil?
Conferences at Yale
Discussing Doctrines at Baal (pronounced Bale)
Causing People to Fail
Keeping A third in jail
Severing all the me
From all I used to be
Formless and void
Totally paranoid
Enjoyed darkness as lord
Keeping me from the sword
Blocked from mercy
Bitter than Ceres
Hungry and thirsty
And still dine at the table of deceit
How incomplete
From confrontation to retreat
We belong to true enemy's defeat
Destitute a necessity
Causing desperation to get the best of me
Punishment 'till there was nothing left of me
Realizing the inescapable death of me
No options in the valley of decision
The only option supernatural circumcision
Inwardly
Only water can purge the hearts from words
The firey darts
Thrown by the workers of the arts
Iniquity
Shaping in
There's no escaping when
Your whole philosiphy is paper thin
In vanity
The wide road is insanity
Can it be all of humanity
Picture that
Scripture that
The origin of man's heart is black
How can we show up for
An invisible war
Preoccupied with a shadow
Making love with a whore
Aching in sores
Babylon the great mystery
Mother of human history
System of social socercery
Our present condition needs serious recongnition
Where's there's no repentance there can be no remission
And that sentence more serious than Vietnam
The atom bomb and Sudam and Minister Farakhan
What's going on
What's a priority to you
By what authority do we
Majority hasn't a clue
We majored in curses
Search the chapters check the verses
Recapture the land remove the mark off our hands
So we can stand
In agreement with his commands
Everything else is damned
Let them with ears understand
Everything else is damned
Let them with ears understand

So foul you can taste it
And while the people sleep
Too comfortable to face it
His life's so incomplete
And nothing can replace it

You say love then abuse me
You never thought you'd lose me
But how quickly we forget that nothin' is for certain
You thought I'd stay here hurtin'
Your guilt trip's just not workin'  repressin' me to death
‘Cause now I'm choosin' life  yo

Afraid to face reality—the system is a joke

Now I don't
As I look at what I've done
The type of life that I've lived
How many things I pray the father will forgive
One situation involved a young man
He was the ocean and I was the sand
He stole my heart like a thief in the night
Dulled my senses and blurried my sight
And I used to love him
I used to love him but now I don't
Now I don't
I used to love him but now I don't
Now I don't
I chose the road of passion and pain (passion and pain)
Sacrificed too much and waited in vain
Gave up my power ceased being queen
Addicted to love like the drug of a fiend
Reached the crossroad which path would I choose
For something to happen that just wasn't fated
Thought what I wanted was something I needed
When momma said no then I just should have heeded
Misled I bled 'till the poison was gone
And out of the darkness arrived the sweet dawn

Was much more than being some foolish man's wife
Showed me that love was respect and devotion
Greater than planets and deeper than any oceans
Content because that part of my life is finished

Is one of a man who's lost treasures untold
And totally let my creator control

 I'm just very blessed to be able to be here today and get to share with you some of the things I've learned.
 cause whatever he relates to whomever is listening  that's what supposed to be understood at that time  so it's all good.
This is a strange song because this song -- when this song was written  this is when everything sort of stopped. It was written a long time ago  but it was right before God just snatched me out of everything. And because I didn't understand... Initially it was written -- I'd written it about the whole Amadou Diallo situation  when it first happened. And I went to the studio  and I laid it down. And it was like  strong  for the first day. And then it just regressed everyday after that. And I said  What's going on? What's happening?
And at the end of it there was a word that i used  rebel. And I guess was afraid. It was such a hot time in the city at that point  I was afraid that if I
Put the record out  people would misunderstand what I meant by rebel and they'd just take it to the streets. So I was very intimidated and afraid. And before I knew it a whole host of things happened. Everything stopped after that. And the creativity stopped. Everything stopped. That's when I realized I had to understand what I was talking about before I could tell somebody else what I was talking about. And I had to be  you know  a living example
It's real crazy because I don't know what the press is saying because I don't listen to the press too much. But I know the view is that I'm emotionally unstable  which is reality. Like you aren't?
I'm laughing because what I've realized I've become is one of those mad scientists who does the tests on themselves first  you see  to make sure that they work. And that's when you know  OK look  I got something that works. You know what I'm saying? I'm not gonna give you something that I haven't tested for myself. And you go through  and you're learning by way of experience  and you're making mistakes  and you're getting up
A friend of mine once said to me  he said  Look  if we weren't supposed to turn around  why does a car have a steering wheel? Are we just supposed to crash into the wall? No  we're supposed to say  Listen  I was going the wrong way... Reverse!
In this particular song  now I realize that this song is about freedom. You see? We could look at one human being  but it's about the spirit of freedom being taken out  and how it's taken out in all of us
 I’m just askin you a question. Y’all givin’ me a clap.

 Kevin Charles... (Here)
Ain't got no money  ain't got no class
Ain't got no friends  ain't got no schooling
Ain't got no hurt  ain't got no job
Ain't got no money  no place to stay
Ain't got no
Programmed inequity  it's in the nervous system
Two thirds of the world turned victim
Subtle energy  they capture and block chi
The unseen violence behind the democracy
Some call it hypocrisy  turn freeman into property
And logically justify not treatin' 'em properly
Invisible ink in the constitution
Meant to preserve the institution  unequal distribution
Of wealth  goods and services
Trapped in circuses
Herds of us  not understandin' our purposes
When appetites and psychological types
Get caught in the hype  it's tight from morning 'til night
I'm demanding my rights
Women's suffrage then black suffrage
Or Jim Crow  the KKK
American terrorism
Murders and beatings on television
It's in the cells now  you thought that was yesterday?
But the compression stays  trauma still got most afraid
Stuck in the memory  fear gives birth to lethargy
Generations of children in jeopardy
History written in jealousy  scribes full of heresy
Full of barbarians  ch-ch-check out my melody
Musical therapy  reprogram
Africa full of coltan
Coltrane was a cold man
Black genius in a cold land tryna be the whole man
Heal the homeland
Past time for our own land
Where a grown man can be a grown man
The system has benefit for robbery is robbery
You can't run from it  God is a natural monopoly
Divine creator stuck in monotony
Bureaucracy  psyche on poverty
Self-esteem broken like pottery
Cause there's just no match for the prodigy
Sovereignty  the god in me
Walking university  living cosmology
Without apology

The more you suppress life the stronger it gets
With death life the longer it gets
I know it’s hard to admit
That you follow some bullshit
Swallow the wrong pill looking for mr bill
Repression  oppression: same thing (same thing)
Fear the shadow that’s the main thing (main thing)
They keep running from
Every action yields an equal and opposite one
Yes that means the consequence comes
Fields of cumbersome back breaking labor
Can’t be healed with just a cummerbund
I was homecoming queen call me number one
Yep that’s another one  now give the drummer some
Tell every mother’s son expression can be far more powerful than a hundred guns
See my Kalashnikov lyrics with the safety off
Now dance around these niggas like Baryshnikov
Street sweeper my words are my keeper
It’s done let loose your tongue
Gifted  black and young
Watch these devils run
They knew a change was gonna come
Sinner man  looking for a place to run
Tell the truth in tongues’ enemy reduced by one's
Thousands 2 can put 10 000 in flight
Speak truth to power every 24 hours

(Ay let me tell you)
Imperialism is a form of Jihad
They killed and enslaved millions for gold bullion  in the name of God
The children of mammon called it spiritual famine
The building blocks of society and economy  broke humanity to build the colonies
Using reverse psychology to keep us from knowing our quality
Let’s accurately diagnose our condition!
Listen:
400 years of the abuse and misuse of religion
Don’t give me another person’s prescription!
I need what I need  my deeds are my deeds
As a man thinketh so is he  Mezanmi!
Reevaluate history  expeditiously
Can’t live my life in apostasy
Emulate the apostrophe hang with S  you can rock with me
I come in love and truth (truth)
Look at what I went through
Now it’s time to acknowledge just what I give you: Life
I've got life
I've got laughs
I've got headaches and toothaches
There’s a whole lotta wrong to be righted  I get excited
I'ma kick this shit off like I’m on Manchester United & my attention is undivided  so you can’t divide and conquer me!
I’m sitting comfortably in a SUV  up in my SUV taking artistic liberties
I’m looking for love (in all the wrong places)
I've got life
I've got laughs
I've got headaches and toothaches
Pools of fascination in my sleep
Cooling off the fire of my longing
Warming up my cold within his heat
Bouncing down the walls of inhibition
Evaporating all of my fears
Baptizing me to complete submission
Dissolving my condition with his tears
It's just like the water
I ain't felt this way in years
I ain't felt this way in years
Floating through the space of my design
Drinking in the mainstream of his mind
Filling up the cup of my emotions
Spilling over into all I do
If only I could get lost in his ocean
Surviving on the thought of loving you

Humbled on the mountain by his presence
Washing my intentions with his name
Sealing all the floodgates of his passion
Saving all his liquid for his own
Moisturizing me to satisfaction
He's pouring out his soul to me for hours and hours
Drawing out my nature with his hands
Burning to be worthy of his land
It's just like the water
It's just like the water
I ain't felt this way in years
And moving me around
He's bathing and he's cleaning me
And moving me around
Moving me around

I just want you around
I just want you around
I just want you around
Thought that I had lost you
I can hardly make a sound
When I thought I couldn't hold you
Knew the world had let me down
Should have took the time to tell you
You keep my feet on the ground
I hope that you can hear me
Cause I know its not profound
I just want you around
I just need you around
I just want you around
I just need you around
When I thought I was without you
I got used to being down
It was my fault I used to doubt you
But that ain't me next time around
Please believe me when I tell you
Cause all my words are bound
This is my cross now let me bare it

Your movement's similar to a serpent
Consequence is no coincidence
Hypocrites always wanna play innocent
Always want to take it to the full out extent
Always want to make it seem like good intent
Never want to face it when it time for punishment
I know you don't wanna hear my opinion
There come many paths and you must choose one

Trying to pretend like your word is your bond
Now some might mistake this for just a simple song
And some don't know what they have ‘til it's gone
Now even when you're gone you can still be reborn
And some may think that they've reached perfection

Responding to your power  a safe place for you to stand
But when the undercurrents come  and pull you out to sea
I'm left with shells and slippery rocks where you used to be
And when the sun comes beating down and burns my body dry
And leads into your sea
And I can feel your desperate hands all over me  all over me
You are hurting me and you said that you wouldn't
You promised me you wouldn't you wouldn't
I said I'd be with you and I know I couldn't
And I knew I couldn't
So moves like that
This is how we bust rhymes on a phat track
I don't know what to sing so my artistry brings
Things from off the top of my head

Typical Hollywood follies good girl
While vice and corruption take over the world
Motives and thoughts
Check your motives and thoughts
Blind with the wickedness  deep in your heart
Modern day wickedness is all you've been taught
Lied to your neighbors  so you get ahead
Modern day trickery is all you've been fed
Motives and thoughts
Yeah

How they helped you out? You're such a hopeless victim
All their talk is seasoned to perfection
An opportunity to further situation
Why they're so important is without explanation

The advice that we go desperately searching for
The subconscious effort to support our paramour

Realizing that there's no place else to go
And there's nobody I know who can help me
Textbook solutions are so improbable
'Cause everybody else is just as empty
Naked as the day that I was born  I tried to hide
Behind education and philosophy
Hopeless explanation to describe a situation
I can't see because the world's on top of me
From the body of this death?
Freeing me from dust and the superficial trust
Of an enemy that seeks to take my breath
Failing to connect 'cause I'm morally defect
By reason of the God inside my head
Causing me to see only what pertains to me
Believing I'm alive when I'm still dead

Naturally pretending that I'm actually defending
God through my facade  don't need material
Oh Jerusalem  wash thy heart from wickedness
That thou mayest be saved from thy deception
How long shall thy faith lodge lies within thee?
Oh Jerusalem  keeping thee from perfection
Submit to truth  leave the deception of thy youth
So we could walk in the council of authority
Forget the proof  our generation so aloof
Only follow in the steps of the majority
Trust in the Lord with all thy heart
And lay not to thine  oh an understanding in all thy ways
Acknowledge Him and He shall direct our paths
Be not wise in thine own eyes and you can follow him
We judge and condemn  just as ignorant as them
Who religion tells us that we should ignore
Perpetrating we're in covenant with Him
Exposed by the very things that we adore
We grin and shake hands  then lay ambush for the man
Who has a different point of view then us
Infuriated 'cause he doesn't understand
Bringing up those things we don't want to discuss
Why still do evil? We don't know how to do good
Walking on in darkness running from the light  hey
Led to believe  because we live in neighborhoods
Telling us what's going on will be alright
When I played with my game of Monopoly
Oh  to suggest that my life is still a mess
Who reveal the pride I'm hiding is what's stopping me
Oh Jerusalem  wash thy heart from wickedness
That thou mayest be saved from thy deception
How long shall thy faith lodge lies within thee?
Oh Jerusalem  keeping thee from perfection
Abide in me and I in you  as the branch cannot bear
Fruit of itself except in the vine
And I in him  the same bring forth much fruit
For without me  you can do nothing
Oh Jerusalem  you're traditions have deceived you
I've chosen you  you haven't chosen me
Do whatsoever  you asking my name he may give to you
But in vain they call my name  teaching doctrines just the same
Justified among themselves
But God know with the heart  what man esteemed as smart
Is an abomination to Emmanuel
Just repent  turn from selfish motivation
So iniquity will not cause your demise
Make you a new heart and a new spirit
For why would he die? Oh Jerusalem  please tell me why
I have no pleasure in the death of him to die
Says the Lord God where forth turn yourselves and live
It's not the talkers  but the walkers and His Word
Are the only ones the Father will forgive
Oh Jerusalem  wash thy heart from wickedness
That thou mayest be saved from thy deception
How long shall thy faith lodge lies within thee?
Oh Jerusalem  providing no protection
Oh Jerusalem

Minutes after they took I

Wasting time  replacing time with each empty excuse
But that'll only work a little while
Coping with despair  knowing you're not there
Ashamed to just admit I've been a fool
So I blame it on the sun  run away from everyone
Hoping to escape this ridicule
Trapped in misery  wrapped so miserably
And this deception  I wear it like a skin
Dying to maintain  oh I keep trying to explain
A heart that never loved me to begin
Oh I'm such a mess  I have no choice but to confess
That I've been desperately trying to belong
Lieing to myself and everybody else
Refusing to admit my right was wrong

Oh what's left of me  I beg you desperately
Cause me to agree with what I know is best for me
Please save me from myself so I can heal
The choices that I've made  oh have been nothing but mistakes
What a wasted use of space  should I die before I wake
In all of my religion  I've fortified this prison
Obligated to obey the demands of bad decisions
Please save me from myself  I need you
Save me from myself  please save me from myself so I can heal

And then He
 why  why  why
 rain  rain falls
 rain don't fall
 they  they  they don't know my Father
Afraid to address the reality before me
To proud to confess that I'm addicted to a lie
So I seek temporary feeling
To replace reality
Though the truth is telling me I have died
But I've been taught to numb it
I hate it when I find out
That I can't get what I wanted
This emotional tantrum
Has become sort of an anthem playing every time I need to take a little trip
To hide this condemnation
I'll find a combination
Of man-made stimulation
To deny my situation
Now this unreality
Is distorting what I see
Reporting back to me
A sense of false security
So in my imagination
I must find a recreation
Desperately in search of ways
To alter my sensation
There's no equilibrium
Inebriated till I'm numb
Intoxicated until I'm dumb
To avoid confrontation

Now this chemical analogy
Is our emotional reality
And ethnical stimulants
And social etiquette
Won't let us be too upset
With the way things really are
You're told to camouflage regret
In a religious structure
Tells us God wants us to suffer
To support a situation we all know is obligation
And if you shun the complication
They'll just gun your reputation
Like mob intimidation
To enforce participation
See they need to keep us fiends
To their lies and broken schemes
And if you find another means
You're told you're being too extreme
And if you wanted to get clean
They'll just pull those social strings
Holding up their social nose
Defying noble things
Now we're all stuck in tradition
Unable to state opposition
Too afraid to contradict
The expectations of the system
Oh and the harsh reality
Is they made grace for you and me
Instead of saving you and me
They're just enslaving you and me

How come we ain't gettin' no higher? (How come  how come)
Now tell me your philosophy
On exactly what an artist should be
Should they be someone with prosperity
And no concept of reality?
Now  who you know without any flaws?
That lives above the spiritual laws?
And does anything they feel just because (Just because  just because)
There's always someone there who'll applaud?

Why you beef with freaks as my album sales peak? Uhh
All I wanted was to sell like five hundred
And be a ghetto superstar since my first album  Blunted
I used to work at Foot Locker  they fired me: I fronted
Now you get it!
Then send it to your block and have my full name cemented (Lauryn Hill!)
And if your lines sound like mine I'm taking a percentage (ka-ching!)
Unprecedented  and still respected when it's vintage
I'm serious  I'm takin' over areas in Aquarius
Runnin' red lights with my ten thousand chariots
They'll hail you then nail you  no matter who you are
They'll make you now then take you down  and make you face it
If you slit the bag open  put your pinky in it and taste it
C'mon baby light my fire
Everything you drop is so tired (Everything you drop  everything you drop)

The past  it seems so far away
And life squeezes so tight that I can't breathe
And every time I've tried to be what someone else has thought of me
So caught up  I wasn't able to achieve
And I made up my mind to define my own destiny
I look at my environment
And wonder where the fire went
What happened to everything we used to be
I hear so many cry for help
Searching outside of themselves
Now I know that His strength is within me
And I made up my mind to define my own destiny (And deep in my heart)
Said it's the misery of Inequity
Said it's the history of Inequity
Yo! Y'all can't handle the truth in a courtroom of lies
High profile gladiators in bloodthirsty arenas
Souls bought and sold and paroled for thirty talents
Court reporter catch the circus on the paper
File it in the system not acknowledged by the Maker
Swearing by the bible blatantly blasphemous
Publicly perpetrating that In God We Trust
Cross-examined by a master manipulator
The faster intimidator receiving the judge's favor
Deceiving sabers doing injury to their neighbors
See the bailiff representing security
Holding the word of God soliciting perjury
Masquerading as the agency for the clients
Orally armed to do bodily harm
And the defense isn't making any sense
Faking the confidence of escaping the consequence
That a defendant is depending on the system
Totally void of judgment purposely made to twist 'em
Emotional victim blackmailed by the henchmen
Framed by intentions
Inventions whereby they lynch men
Enter the false witness slandering the accused
Planting the seed openly showing he's being used
Smearing the individual fearing the unsuspected
Expert witness (the paid authority)
Made a priority to deceive the majority
Do we expect the system made for the elect
To possibly judge correct? Properly serve and protect?
Only two positions: victimizer or victim
Both end up in destruction trusting this crooked system
Mafia with diplomas keeping us in a coma
Trying to own a piece of the American Corona
Teaching ambition to support the family superstition?
When the Son of Perdition is Commander in Chief
Counterfeit wisdom creating the illusion of freedom
Confusion consumes them
Every word they speak it turns them outwardly white
Internally they absent of light
Trapped in the night and bonded to the Cain of the night
The empty pursuits of every tree bearing the wrong fruit
The knowledge of Good and Evil is what caused us to lie
Renounce all your thoughts
Repent and let your mind be re-taught
You'll find what you sought
Was based on the deception you bought
A perception of naught where the majority remains caught

Multi-dimensional
Unexpected sound of the Refugee All-Stars
The sweetest thing I've ever known
Was like the kiss on the collarbone
The soft caress of happiness
I wish I didn't get so weak
Makes me argue just to see
How much you're in love with me
I get mad when you walk away
Warm as the sun dipped in black
Fingertips on the small of my back
More valuable than all I own

Intoxicating (Intoxicating)
Ah
I sometimes watch you in your sleep
Ah
Zion
Unsure of what the balance held
I touched my belly overwhelmed
By what I had been chosen to perform
But then an angel came one day
Told me to kneel down and pray
For unto me a man-child would be born
Woe this crazy circumstance
I knew his life deserved a chance
But everybody told me to be smart
Look at your career  they said
Lauryn  baby use your head
But instead I chose to use my heart
Now the joy of my world
Is in Zion! (Zion  Zion!)
Now the joy of my world
How beautiful if nothing more
Than to wait at Zion's door
I've never been in love like this before
Now let me pray to keep you from
The perils that will surely come
See life for you  my prince has just begun
And I thank you for choosing me
To come through unto life to be
A beautiful reflection of His grace
See I know that a gift so great
Is only one God could create
And I'm reminded every time I see your face

Marching
Okay  how many people here have ever been in love? I know none of the guys are gonna raise their hand. How many of y'all ever been in love?
(Mumbling)
Willingness to do everything for that person
The way they act
Uh-huh
The way they carry themselves  stuff like that
Okay
Yeah
That's deep
That's what I'm talking about
I thought that was a beautiful point. Anyone else want to deal with that?
Love is not phony!
Everybody knows that they've lied
Everybody knows that they guilty
Resting on their conscience eating their inside
For the dominion
Who will dominate the opinion
Conformin' our vision
To the world church's decision
Trapped in a section
Submitted to committee election
Moral infection
Epidemic lies and deception
Insurrection
Of the highest possible order
Destortin' our tape recorders
From hearin' like under water
Beyond the borders
Find the sin in disorder
Bound by the strategy
A systematic depravity
Heavy as gravity
Head first in the cavity
Without a bottom
I had a vision I was fallin' in indescision
Some program on television
Be recognized in the system
Intelligent fools
PhDs in illusion
Masters of mass confusion
Bachelors in past delusion
Now who you choosin'?
The bloodshed of the male
Or confidence in the tale
Conferences is Yale
Discussin' doctrines of Baal
Causin' people to fail
Keepin' the third in jail
His word has nailed
Everything to the tree
Severing all of me
From all that I used to be
Formless and void
Totally paranoid
Enjoy darkness as Lord
Keepin' me from the sword
Block for mercy
Bitter than cerasee
Hungry and thirsty
For good meat we would eat
How incomplete
From confrontation to retreat
Destitute in a necessity
Causin' desperation to get the best of me
Punishment 'til there was nothing left of me
Realizin' the inescapable death of me
No options in the valley of decision
From words to fiery darts
Thrown by the workers of the arts
There's no escapin' when
Your whole philosophy is paper thin
In vanity
The wide road is insanity
Could it be all of humanity
Picture that
Scripture that
The origin of a man's heart is black
How can we show up for
An invisible war
Achin' in sores
Mother of human history
System of social sorcery
Our present condition
Needs serious recognition
Where there's no repentance there can be no admission
The atom bomb and Saddam and Minister Farrakhan
By what authority do to you
The majority hasn't a clue
We majored in curses
Recapture the land
Remove the mark from off of our hands
So we can stand
In agreement with his command
Everything else is damned
Let them with ears understand

Resting on their conscience eating their insides
Pulls the fascination in my sleeve
Cooling off the fire of my longing
Boiling off my cold within his heat
Melting down the walls of inhibition
Evaporating all of my fears
Baptizing me into complete submission
Dissolving my condition with his tears
He's just like the water
I ain't felt this way in years
He's just like the water
I ain't felt this way in years
Floating through the space of my design
Drowning me to find my inside sailing
Drinking in the mainstream of mind
Filling up the cup of my emotions
Spilling over into all I do
If I only I could get lost in his ocean
Surviving on the thought of loving you

Bathing in the fountain of his essence
He causes my expression to remain
Humbled on a mountain by his presence
Washing my intentions with his name
Sealing off the floodgates of his passions
Saving all his liquid for his own
Moisturizing me to satisfaction
In my imagination? No no!
He's pouring out his soul to me for hours and hours
Drawing out my nature with his hands
Yearning I'm so thirsty for his power
Burning to be worthy of his land
He's just like the water
I ain't felt this way in years
He's just like the water
I ain't felt this way in years
Cleaning me
He's purging me
And moving me around
He's bathing me
And he's claiming me
And moving me around
Around and around and around
And around
Moving me around
He's purging me
He's been cleaning me
And moving me around
And around

Around

He wasn't even concerned
To keep him in my life (to keep him in my life)
But I couldn't make it right
And if you ever been in love
Then you'd understand
That what you want might make you cry

I feel like love right now is like confusion
It's like people think they love somebody
When they don't really love somebody
Like I thought I was in love with this girl but I really wasn't
(Laughter)
Ok. Alright
You think that TV and music have somethin' to do with
Why people are always confused about love?
(Girl 1)
(Yes!)
Why?
(Cause today we listen to a lot of TV a lot of music
And it sounds nice but it may not always be right for you)
We need to put you on a bullhorn"
