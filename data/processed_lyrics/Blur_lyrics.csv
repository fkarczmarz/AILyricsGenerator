"An agreement of your bombast
You'd love my bed
You took the other instead
But don't you feel low?
I was being oblique
And you'd love my bed
You got the other instead
What do you owe me?
The price of your peace of mind
You'd love my bed
Well  you knew as much
It's no surprise that today
I get up around two
From a lack of anything to do
And I might as well just grin and bear it
'Cause it's not worth the trouble of an argument
And you have not really stayed in touch
Well  I knew as much
It's no surprise that today
I get up around two
With nothing to do  except get a touch of flu
And I might as well just grin and bear it
'Cause it's not worth the trouble of an argument
And in any case I'd rather wear it
It's like a bad head in the morning
Now I know
You might also like
And I might as well just grin and bear it
'Cause it's not worth the trouble of an argument
And in any case I'd rather wear it
It's like a bad head in the morning
So I might as well just grin and bear it
'Cause it's not worth the trouble of an argument
And in any case I'd rather wear it
You're like a bad head in the morning
You're gonna win
The fallen doves of lovers' vows
In the world all around us
To talk to you about what this breakup has done to me
I have lost the feeling that I thought I'd never lose
Now where am I going?
It is barbaric
Now you can't play to every taste
The powder keg of common cause
All of us carry trauma
And in lieu of an explanation
I will pour oil from the cup on the pyre of abdication
You have lost
The feeling that you thought you'd never lose
And it is barbaric
You might also like
We're taking down the scaffolds very soon
The can of soup and heating up to ten
Which leads me to the part
Where we agreed on different dreams
That we had lost the feeling that we thought we'd never lose
Now where are we going?
It is barbaric
We have lost the feeling that we thought we'd never lose
Now where are we going?
We have lost the feeling that we thought we'd never lose
We have lost the feeling that we thought we'd never lose
Now where are we going?
What you done?
She's a gun
Get nothing done
You beetlebum
Just get numb
And when she lets me slip away
She turns me on and all my violence gone
Nothing is wrong
I just slip away and I am gone
Nothing is wrong
She turns me on
I just slip away and I am gone
Beetlebum
Because you're young
She's a gun
She'll suck your thumb
She'll make you cum

I bought them on the Portobello Road on a Saturday
I stop and stare awhile
A common pastime when conversation goes astray
And don't think I'm walking out of this
She don't mind
I don't really want to change a thing
I want to stay this way forever
My thoughts are getting banal
And don't think I'm walking out of this

I am an ex offender
They let me out in the summer
I think I was in a coma
I didn't know what to do
Oh no
You go hang around  go 'round
I'll watch myself hang on
Look out for the bugman
You go hang around  around
I'll watch myself hang on
Look out for the bugman
I got no sense of existence
I know the nodding dogs
I go out in the city
I stay away from the bugs

Where people go to drink away their gloom
He sat me down and so began
The story of a charmless man
Educated the expensive way
He knows his claret from his Beaujolais
I think he'd like to have been Ronnie Kray
But then nature didn't make him that way
He moves in circles of friends who just pretend
And when you put it all together
There's the model of a charmless man

He knows the swingers and their cavalry
Says he can get in anywhere for free
I began to go a little cross-eyed
And from this charmless man I just had to hide
He doesn't see his days are tumbling down upon him
And yet he tries so hard to please
And when you put it all together
There's the model of a charmless man
And yet he tries so hard to please
And when you put it all together
There's the model of a charmless man
So she takes the bus into the country
Although she got herself rosy cheeks
She didn't leave enough money to pay the rent
The landlord says that she's out in a week
Now she's eating chocolate to induce sleep
And I don't know about you
It's been a hell of a do
Peeping Thomas has a very nice view
Across the street at the exhibitionist
Just stick together so they never get lonely
Had to sit down and have some sugary tea

One of many zeros
Your ears are full but you're empty
Holding out your heart
To people who never really
Care how you are
So give me coffee and TV
Easily
Sociability
It's hard enough for me
And agree to marry me
So we can start over again
Do you go to the country?

Because of who you are

It got to know me
Let me sleep all day
Spent the money
I haven't felt my legs
Since the summer
And I don't call my friends
Forgot their numbers
V.I.P 223
I had my chances  they had me
Now I stay up nights  watch TV
I'm country sad
I'm a ballad man
I'm on the comeback road
Yeah  I'm a blizzard
And in my motor home
Sweat on my pillow  all night

Came as no surprise
Why did we bother?
Should have stayed away
Another night
Go to another party and hang myself
Gently on the shelf
The death of the teenager
Standing on his own
Why did he bother?
Should have slept alone
Another night
Go to another party and hang myself
Gently on the shelf
Another night
Go to another party and hang myself
Eatin' all the morsels  pickin' up the rubbish
Give her effervescence  she needs a little sparkle
Good morning TV  you're looking so healthy
We all say  don't want to be alone
We wear the same clothes 'cause we feel the same
We kiss with dry lips when we say goodnight
Sex on the TV  everybody's at it
The mind gets dirty as you get closer to thirty
He gives her a cuddle  they're glowin' in a huddle
Goodnight TV  you're all made up and you're lookin' like me
We all say  don't want to be alone
We wear the same clothes 'cause we feel the same
We kiss with dry lips when we say goodnight

 Callisto  Sinope
 Barnard's Star
With his hands on the rails
Trying not to be sick again
And holding on for tomorrow
London ice cracks on a seamless line
He's hanging on for dear life
And so we hold each other tightly
Holding on for tomorrow (-row-row-row-row)
She's a twentieth century girl
With her hands on the wheel
Trying not to make him sick again
Seeing what she can borrow
London's so nice back in your seamless rhymes
But we're lost on the Westway
And so we hold each other tightly

Jim stops and gets out the car
Goes to a house in Emperor's Gate
Through the door and to his room
Then he puts the TV on
Turns it off and makes some tea
I'm holding on for tomorrow (-row-row)
Then Susan comes into the room
She's a naughty girl with a lovely smile
It's windy there and the view's so nice
London ice can freeze your toes
 handle it
 and a battery
 it's hurting me
So call the police
Following the herd
Down to Greece
On holiday
Love in the '90s
Is paranoid
On sunny beaches
Take your chances
Looking for
Girls who are boys who like boys to be girls
Always should be someone you really love
Girls who are boys who like boys to be girls
Always should be someone you really love
Avoiding all work
'Cause there's none available
Like battery thinkers
Count your thoughts
Nothing is wasted
Only reproduced
You get nasty blisters

Dancing with myself
Greedy go-getter gone
The luxury of stealth
Obsidian the ha-a-a-a-a-all
Dancing with myself
I get into my bed
I do it to myself
To the local (Oh  oh-oh  oh-oh-oh  oh  oh  oh-oh-oh)

The country's got a hold of my soul
TV's dead and there ain't no war in my head  no
And you seem very beautiful to me
Sleeping but my work's not done
I could be lying on an atom bomb
I'll take care cause I know you'll be there
And you seem very beautiful to me
It is the rest of your life keeps a rolling and rolling
Picture in my pocket looks like you
Gone to heaven instead
The evening news says he was confused
The motorways will all merge soon
Lottery winner buys the moon
They've come to save us  the space invaders are here
He thought of cars
And where  where to drive them
Who to drive them with
There's panic at London Heathrow
Everybody wants to go up into the blue

All the lantern men  marching down till dawn
Morning come  we fall over
Something new
Something you

Here comes the ice cream man  parked at the end of the road
With a swish of his magic whip  all the people in the party froze
I was only twenty-one when I watched it on TV
I was racing in my heart back then
Something new
Something new (Something you do nothing about)
Something new

Something new
(Always sold out by nine  so you better come and get it quick)
Coughing tar in his Japanese motor
The lights are magic and he feels lucky
London loves
The mystery of a speeding car
London loves
The misery of a speeding heart
It's love you like and everyone's at it

Crossing on the guillotine
And if you have nobody left to rely on
I'll hold you in my arms and let you drift
It's got to be that time again

Taking off again

And talking types will let us down again

Seemed like a breath of fresh air back in the summertime
So if it doesn’t seem like a protocol
I'm running out of heart today
I'm running out of open road to you
And I know you are emoting and you're dazed
Is something broke inside you?
'Cause at the moment I'm lost
And feeling that I don't know if I'm losing you again
And when we fly tomorrow over the Java seas
And my younger maps will be there with me
'Cause they remind me of swimming out too far one day
I was running out of heart that day
I was running out of open road to you
Is something broke inside me?
'Cause at the moment I'm lost
And feeling that I don't know if I'm losing you again
I'm running out of heart here
Just sitting out the constant doubt in my head
But I don't know what it is
I'm sweating out the toxins
Is my terracotta heart breaking?
You don't need to tell me
I hope you're with someone who makes you feel safe
In your sleeping tonight
I won't kill myself trying to stay in your life
I got no distance left to run
When you see me
I don't want to see you 'cause I know the dreams that you keep
That's where we meet
I got no distance left to run
Oooh
It's over
I knew it would end this way
I hope you're with someone who makes you feel
I got no distance left to run

The sound of magic music in his ears
Videoed by a busload of tourists
Shiny shell suits on and drinking lemonade
Now I got a funny feeling which I bought mail order
From a man in a teepee in California
Said he once was that great game show performer
My joy of life is on a roll
And we'll all be the same in the end
'Cause then you're on your own

I got on a boat on a hot sunny day
To get out of this town
'Cause the tarmac was melting and the people seem to sway
Stuck in the underground
To the islands  the black kites  the wishing tree
I wanna be with you
On a slow boat to Lantau  the misty seas
I wanna be with you
I crawled out the harbour with recession behind
And now I'm feeling the love of you
So you better get a charge 'til I see you again

Lord knows we'd never clear the clouds

Weird vibrations in the basement
I don't like this scene
Pauli's ghost come back to haunt me
She's been feeling frisky since her husband said goodbye
She wears a low cut T-shirt  runs a little B&B
She's most accommodating when she's in her lingerie
Wife-swapping is your future
You know that it would suit ya
Yes  they're stereotypes  there must be more to life

The suburbs  they are sleeping  but he's dressing up tonight

And when the fun is over  watch themselves on video

I'm a darkened soul
My street's all pop music and gold
Our lives are on TV
You switch off and try to sleep
People get so lonely
Everything's out to sea
I believe that is the way it should be
I hope you feel the same
Everyone is dying
Stop crying now here comes the sun
I didn't mean to hurt you no no no
It takes time to see what you have done
So I wean myself off slowly

Love is the only one
I deceive cos' I'm not that strong
Hope you feel the same
And now it seems that we're falling apart
But I hope I see the good in you come back again
Lying by your side
Tender is the touch
Of someone that you love too much
Tender is the day
The demons go away
Someone who can heal my mind
Get through it
Love's the greatest thing
Get through it
Love's the greatest thing
That we have
I'm waiting for that feeling
I'm waiting for that feeling
Waiting for that feeling to come

The ghost I love the most
Hiding from the sun
Waiting for the night to come
Tender is my heart
I'm screwing up my life
Someone who can heal my mind

Get through it
Love's the greatest thing
That we have
I'm waiting for that feeling

Waiting for that feeling to come
Get through it

Get through it

That we have
I'm waiting for that feeling

Waiting for that feeling to come
Tender is the night
Lying by your side
Tender is the touch
Of someone that you love too much
I'm screwing up my life
Someone who can heal my mind
Get through it
Love's the greatest thing
Get through it
Love's the greatest thing
That we have
I'm waiting for that feeling
I'm waiting for that feeling
Waiting for that feeling to come
And all I saw was that you're not coming back
It comes like me?
But I won't be afraid
I can't seem to find you in this midnight parade
I know it's all true
Up close
I fell in love with you
(I met you at an early show)
(We travelled 'round the world together)
I just looked out to the point
In a full-on assault
It comes like mе?
I know I'm already breaking when I look into your eyes
It comes like me?

So many people standing there
I walked towards them
Into the floodlights
I heard no echo (No echo)
There was distortion everywhere (Everywhere)
I found my ego (My ego)
I felt rubato standing there
Found my Transcendent (Transcendent)
It played in mono painted blue (Painted blue)
You were the Pierrot (The Pierrot)
I was the dark room (The dark room)
I'ma shine a light in your eyes (In your eyes)
You'll probably shine it back on me
But I won't fall this time
I saw the solstice (The solstice)
The service station on the road (On the road)
I took the acid (The acid)
Under the white horses (Down the road)
I could not tear myself away (Myself away)
Became addiction (Addiction)

Where the universal's free
You can find it anywhere
Every night we're gone
And to karaoke songs
How we like to sing along
Though the words are wrong
No one here is alone
Satellites in every home
Here for everyone
Every paper that you read
Says tomorrow's your lucky day
When the days they seem to fall through you

All that you can do is watch them play

You're making it clear when I don't want to think
You're taking me up when I don't want to go up anymore
I'm just watching it all

Goes pretty England and me
Around the Bay of Biscay
And back for tea
Hit traffic on the Dogger Bank
Up the Thames to find a taxi rank
Sail on by with the tide
And go to sleep
(And the radio says)
This is a low
But it won't hurt you
When you're alone
It will be there with you
Findin' ways to stay solo
There's a low in the high forties
Saturday's locked away on the pier
And on the Malin head
Blackpool looks blue and red
Jumped off Land's End
(And the radio says)

They make us look so dumb (En plein soleil)
Been drinking far too much (Jusqu' la fin)
And neither of us mean what we say (En plein amour)
And it looks like we might have made it
What happened to us? (Jusqu' la fin)
Soon it will be gone forever (En plein soleil)
Infatuated only with ourselves (Jusqu' la fin)
And neither of us can think straight any more (En plein amour)

(Tracy Jacks) It's steady employment
(Tracy Jacks) Is a golfing fanatic
(Tracy Jacks) But his putt is erratic
(Tracy Jacks) Saw a Harley Street doctor
(Tracy Jacks) Who prescribed healthy living
(Tracy Jacks) But he's getting past forty
(Tracy Jacks) And all the seams are splitting
Every day he got closer
He knew in his heart he was over
I'd love to stay here and be normal
But it's just so overrated
(Tracy Jacks) Left home without warning
(Tracy Jacks) At five in the morning
(Tracy Jacks) Got on the first train to Walton
(Tracy Jacks) And stood on the seafront laughing
(Tracy Jacks) Threw his clothes in the water
(Tracy Jacks) And ran around naked
(Tracy Jacks) Got stopped by the police
(Tracy Jacks) And escorted back home

Tracy Jacks bulldozed down the house he lived in
Saying it's just so overrated

He knew in his heart he was over
I'd love to stay here and be normal
But it was always overrated

Sleep in really late
Sad drunk and poorly
Not feeling so great
Wandering lost in a town full of frowns
Sad drunk and poorly
Dogs digging up the ground
And I feel the light in the night and in the day
And I feel the light when the sky's just mud and grey
And I feel the light when you tell me it's okay
'Cause you're so great and I love you
DT and coffee
Helps to start the day
DT and coffee
Shaking all the way
DT and coffee
Get no sleep today
And I feel the light in the night and in the day
And I feel the light when the sky's just mud and grey
And I feel the light when you tell me it's okay"
