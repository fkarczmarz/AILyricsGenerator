lyrics
"Don't you know it doesn't have to be so hard?
Waiting for everyone else around to agree
Might take too long
Might take too long
That you are all you're meant to be
When the one from my dream
Is sitting right next to me
And I don't know what to do
Depending on your words and wealth
The only one who's really judging you is yourself
Nobody else
Nobody else
If I could part
It wouldn't be so hard (It won't be so hard)
That you are all you're meant to be
When the one from my dream
Is sitting right next to me
And I don't know what to do
It could be the day that all our dreams come true
For me and you
Till we're at the end of just another day
Are you too terrified to try your best?
Just to end up with an educated guess
Like success
Like those times you wake up mystified
Never held something so close I couldn't keep
Do you really live without the fear that
Everything is changing
And there's nothing I can do
My world is turning pages
While I am just sitting here
Will I ever get there?
Does it even matter?
You might also like
Do I really need it?
Push it out the window
(This could be the day that we push through)
Into another morning
Doesn't even matter
It was only yesterday
(It could be the day that all our dreams come true)
Didn't even know you
Now I'm gonna miss you
Never held something so close I couldn't...)
Nothing ever changes
No matter how long you do your hair
Looks the same to everyone else
Everything is changing
I guess I should warn my mum
But she'll just be excited
Gotta be above it
Gotta be above it
Gotta be above it
And I know that I gotta be above it now
And I know that I can't let them bring me down
And I gotta bide my time as a face in the crowd
And I know that I gotta be above it now
And I know that I gotta be above it now
And I gotta bide my time as a face in the crowd
I know that I gotta be above it now
And I can't let them all just bring me down
This time I'm just gonna take it
Or I'm never gonna shake it
I'll just close my eyes and make it so that
Know that I gotta be above it now
And I can't let them all just bring me down

Gone a little far
Gone a little far this time for something
How was I to know?
How was I to know? This high came rushing
We're on the borderline
Caught between the tides of pain and rapture
Possibly a sign
I'm gonna have the strangest night on Sunday
There I go
Quite a show for a loner in L.A.​
Askin' how I managed to end up in this place
And I couldn't get away
We're on the borderline
Dangerously far and all forgiven
There's gonna be a fight
Gonna be a price to pay on Monday (If you and I get comfortable)
We're on the borderline (On the borderline)
Caught between the tides of pain and rapture
Then I saw the time (Then I saw the time)

Here I go

I wonder how I managed to end up in this place
Where I couldn't get away

 oh
 I don't know how long it's gonna stay with me
 dare I face the real world?
 every day
 I'll get out
 I don't have the verve to belong to this dead side
 dare I face the real world?
 every day
 I forget
 desire go
 I don't know how long It's gonna stay with me
But it's something I'm used to
And I could tell it by your face
No one's ever been rude to you
When I could tell you things
That I can't say to anyone
And you came 'round today
But you didn't stay very long
Now it's like the world owes you
Walking around like everybody should know you
I wanna be like we used to
But now you're worried whose audience will lose you
And I had no idea
What that feeling could do to you
And I could tell you've changed
By the people around you
I used to take the long way
Just so I could walk past your door
I used to wait outside
But I guess I won't anymore

There's so much I wanna tell you
Shaking his big grey trunk for the hell of it
He knows that you're dreamin' about being loved by him
Too bad your chances are slim
And it's not like Mr. Shuck
To get shy when they ask him who is on top
There must be something deep down in the dark down there
But he's not too easily scared
He's got friends but they got the fear
Wouldn't care too much if he just disappeared
(Here he comes)
He pulled the mirrors off his Cadillac (Yeah)
'Cause he doesn't like it looking like he looks back
He talks like his opinion is a simple fact
Somebody grabbed his collar
He cried the whole way home
No one remembered a thing when they saw him again
I look down at my feet
It's a hypnotist's arm
And it works like a charm
But I won't be deprived
Though I doubt there is time
In the morning you'll find
Real life was such a grind
'Cause it feels like murder to put your heart through this
I know I always said that I could never hurt you
But I know that I'll be happier and I know you will too
Wish I could turn you back into a stranger
But I know that I'll be happier and I know you will too
And I know just what I've got to do and it's got to be soon
'Cause I know that I'll be happier and I know you will too
Eventually
(Eventually)
We may never have been in love
Stuck on thinking that there is always something to lose
Or a hit from above
Or a hit from above
I don't need what I'm holding
But meanwhile...
Fluctuations are aching my soul
Expectation is taking its toll
Expectation is taking its toll
'Cause everything you ever told me could have been a lie
We may never have been in love
And then I will escape
No one to please
But when she said she'd come 'round

Every part of me says  Go ahead
Feels like we only go backwards  darling
I know that you think you sound silly when you call my name
But I hear it inside my head all day
When I realise I'm just holding on to the hope that maybe
Your feelings don't show
It feels like I only go backwards  baby
Every part of me says  Go ahead
Feels like we only go backwards  darling
The seed of all this indecision isn't me  oh no
'Cause I decided long ago
But that's the way it seems to go
When trying so hard to get to something real
It feels
It feels like I only go backwards  darling
Every part of me says  Go ahead
Feels like we only go backwards  darling
It feels like I only go backwards  baby
Every part of me says  Go ahead
Feels like we only go backwards  darling
It feels like I only go backwards  baby
Every part of me says  Go ahead

No destiny is too far
We can get a home in Miami  go and get married
Tattoo your name on my arm
This traffic doesn't seem quite as annoying
I know this is different (I'm about to)
Let's cause something permanent
Just so we know we can
I'm about to do something crazy  no more delayin'
No destiny is too far
Did you say  And here comes forever?
We'll be lovers until the end of time (I'm about to)
I see it now

Feelin' all different kinds of things
We were talkin' about everything
From the past to the happenin'
We started talkin' 'bout devotion
The kind that goes on eternally
And I tell her I'm in love with her
But how can I know that I'll always be?
That's a promise I can't make and I won't validate
She's in my
I was happy just listening
No intention to be mentioning
We started talkin' 'bout the future
Not the notion I was motioning

But she doesn't like the life that I lead
She doesn't like the life that I lead
Doesn't like sand stuck on her feet
Or sittin' around smokin' weed
I must seem more like a friend in need
And I boast that it is meant to be
I'm happy just to watch her move
And in all honesty  I don't have a hope in hell
I'm happy just to watch her move
And she doesn't like the friends that I make
Doesn't make friends for friendship's sake
She just gets bored sitting by the lake
Her soul won't surface and her heart won't ache
And I boast that it is meant to be
I'm happy just to watch her move

You ain't as fun as you used to be
You won't recover
You ain't as cool as you used to be
It might be time to face it
 I'll get through
But not nearly as loud as the voice saying
Let it happen  let it happen (It's gonna feel so good)
Just let it happen  let it happen
All this running around trying to cover my shadow
A notion growing inside  now all the others seem shallow
All this running around bearing down on my shoulders
I can hear an alarm  must be morning
I heard about a whirlwind that's coming 'round
It's gonna carry off all that isn't bound
And when it happens  when it happens (I won't be holding on)
So let it happen  let it happen
All this running around  I can't fight it much longer
Something's trying to get out and it's never been closer
If my take-off fails  make up some other story
But if I never come back  tell my mother I'm sorry

Now I gotta add yours to my list of faces to try and not think about
Now I gotta tell 'em I don't care and hope that nobody might work it out
It was obviously an illusion 'cause there's never been so much I've been wrong about
And I don't want to spend all my days thinking of the one I can't live without
So I'm gonna have to add you to my list of people to try and forget about
To try and for-
And as the years go by your name will fade out gradually

 babe? is all you can ask me
 but it's pure
 gonna do it
 and I know now
 I'm sorry
I know where you went  but I don't know how you got there
Silver tongue hill  where you talk up what I'd play down
I would speak up  but I wouldn't know what to say
Oh  to say
Lucidity  come back to me
Put all five senses back to where they're meant to be
There is a will  there is a way
Wandering around like spare time never knew it
I might suck  fizzle or I might just float away
(Float away)
And we'll go running off tonight
High above  where we won't even
Need to reach the sky  my love
Oh  there will be a change in the air
Nobody will be anybody else

 the day that words are clearer for me
Some vision that I hold on to (Hold on to  hold on to)
You know it's everything I do (Thing I do  thing I do)
You know it's everything I do (Thing I do)
Can almost stand competing with the others
Can almost hear the fun that I should be having
Instead of all this dreaming
But it's only when I think of you (Think of you  think of you)
The mover I could turn into (Turn into  turn into)
There must be something I can do (I can do  I can do)
Yeah  there must be something I can do
I just don't know how to feel right
A beautiful girl is wasting my life
I'm playing a part as somebody else
While tryin' so hard to be myself
I just need to hear somebody say
This will all make sense one day
I guess I'm alright  but they're all doing so well
What I would give to be under that spell

How could you let us down?
But they don't know what I found
Or see it from this way 'round
Feeling it overtake
All that I used to hate
All the signs I don't read
Two sides of me can't agree
Will I be in too deep?
Going with what I always longed for
Feel like a brand-new person
But you'll make the same old mistakes
Stop before it's too late
I know…
Feel like a brand-new person
But you'll make the same old mistakes
I finally know what it's like

Making the same mistakes
And I still don't know why it's happening
Stop while it's not too late
And I still don't know…

So how do I know I've gone too far?
(You don't have what it takes)
Stop before it's too late
But maybe your story ain't so different from the rest
And I know it seems wrong to accept
A realization is as good as a guess
And I know it seems wrong to accept
Feel like a brand-new person
In a new direction
Stop thinking that the only option was…

I am just here waiting for the perfect time to tell you I don't know
Maybe I'm just reading into it a little deeper than I should
Is it right? Is it wrong? I don't know
Nothing that has happened so far has been anything we could control
I am just here waiting for the perfect time to tell you that I know

More than a minor setback

Challenges falling in my lap

And everything's still (One more hour)

Couldn't get enough (All that I have)
I did it for fame (One more hour)
But never for money
Not for my future children
Until now
How could I love again?
How could I ever ask for more?
And to the road ahead

Our minds were racing and time went slow
But now I worry our horizons bear nothing new
'Cause I get this feeling and maybe you get it too
We're on a rollercoaster stuck on its loop-de-loop
'Cause what we did one day on a whim
Has slowly become all we do
I never wanted any other way to spend our lives
I know we promised we'd be doing this 'til we die
And now I fear we might
But it's okay
I think there's a way
Not worryin' if I get the right amount of sleep (One more year)
Not carin' if we do the same thing every week (One more year)
Of livin' like I'm only livin' for me (One more year)
Of never talkin' about where we're gonna be (One more year)
One more year
Of livin' like the free spirit I wanna be

 I was getting in my car
 just for a second
Did I count the days wrong?
Did we just go 'round and 'round
All the way to step one?
They would ask me all the time
Every time the show's up
So what you doin' with your life?
It ain't givin' up
Just growin' up in stages
Livin' life in phases
Another season changes
'Cause time waits for no one
'Cause time takes from everyone
I'm just laying here
Waiting for a change to come

Takin' us where we would have gone

And I'm runnin' out of patience
Growin' up
'Cause time waits for no one
 no way
 always
 you told us both to trust
 you had a chance
 sing along
 It's all right
It's way too real  I'm way too sober
Usually they've got you covered all over
Lack of composure  I'm walking over
What will I do?
I never had a chance to
There's no one else around you
Not that I was waiting  vision ever fading
Heading for the deep end
I just need to breathe out
Decisions are approaching  reality in motion
Tryna be patient but I'm feeling ancient
Tryna control the way that I'm facing
Suppose that I didn't care anymore
Fate can decide  I can ignore
I'll just pretend that I always knew
That I had the chance to

And I was closer than ever to letting go
It made my heart run in circles and overdrive
And I was closer than ever to feeling alive

It made my heart run in circles and overdrive
And I was closer than ever to feeling alive
There's no one else around you
Not that I was waiting  vision ever fading
Heading for the deep end
I just need to breathe out
Decision are approaching  reality in motion
Let's not think about it
Put your arms around me  I can sense you doubt me
You don't need to promise
That only leads to heartache  closer to an earthquake
Talked about in Hollywood
All there's left to do
All there's left to do  all there's left to do
All there's left to do  all there's left to do
All there's left to do  all there's left to do
All there's left to do  all there's left to do
There's everywhere I'd rather go
It's true that some things have to change
Oh no
And don't remind me of home
Or I might notice where I am
It's true that some things
Have to change
I know some things have to change
It's true that some things have to change
I know some things have to change
Oh no
I'm gazing out the window
As I ascend into the sky
But I'm the one who's left behind
I'm the one who's left behind
There is nothing that is safe
I know some things have to change
You might also like
But don't remind me of home
I care less and less about it and less about you
No one else around to look at me so
I can look at my shadow as much as I please
All the kicks that I can't compare to
Making friends like you're all supposed to
You will never come close to how I feel
Space around me where my soul can breathe
Off-guard body that my mind can leave
There's a party in my head
And no one is invited
And you will never come close to how I feel
You will never come close to how I feel

Movement doesn't flow
Quite like it does when I'm alone
I'll be the one that's free
You and all your friends can watch me
Today
(Don't ask me how you're supposed to feel)
You will never come close to how I feel
You will never come close to how I feel
You will never come close to how I feel
You know that mine can't lie quite as well as yours
Just let the spare moment flow
Rounding steps as I go through the open doors
Please don't deflate from a sigh
I'd hold still every time but I'd start to shake
I wander around for days
Wondering what I'll say when they want the truth
You will never know how hard I try
To keep from waning while waiting at the start
The depth of every touch is real as you need
But words don't do any favours for me
Oh...
You will never know how hard I try
To keep from waning while waiting at the start
The depth of every touch is real as you need
But words don't do any favours for me

The depth of every touch is real as you need
But words don't do any favours for me
To think they're now all memories  sends me 'round the bend
To watch her airplane swaying  coming in to land
And if I have done something  and you have to let me go
Think of me as someone  someone that you know
But if I don't hear something  pretty soon from now
I'll disconnect completely  see how that works out
7 A.M  midnight in Dover
Sun's coming up now  I guess it's over
Playing his guitar  while he's dying of cancer
7 A.M  midnight in Dover
Sun's coming up now  I guess it's over
That felt natural
Who was I kidding
Push the button and start counting down
Beyond which
I can choose
I can fall
I concur
With the doubt
But I can’t
Turn back round
And they dread
What’s beyond
But time
Is rolling on
Rolling on
Now let’s do this right
Everybody
(And I’ll be trying)
It wouldn't come out right

If I fail

There’s so much
Left unclear
But it’s time
I ran out the door to get her
She was holding hands with Trevor
Not the greatest feeling ever
You should try your luck with Heather
Then I heard they slept together
The less I know the better
Don't suppose you could convince your lover to change his mind
So goodbye
Just don't make me wait forever
Don't make me wait forever
Don't make me wait forever

I was doing fine without ya
Givin' in to all his bullshit
Is this what you want? Is this who you are?
I was doing fine without ya
'Til I saw your eyes turn away from mine
And I can't just spend my whole lifetime wondering
I fell in love with the sound of my heels on the wooden floor
I don't want my footsteps to be silent anymore
Want them to be in the moment
Storm clouds are closing
But I'm still not certain  just how I'm gonna feel
I'll only know in the moment (Ooh)
Anticipation growing (Ooh)
It's getting closer
Ooh  it's getting closer
It's getting closer (I'm not ready)
Ooh  it's getting closer (I need a little more time)

It's getting closer
And no use trying to debate that they've got it wrong
There's no use pining for love when you're on your own
And no use crying outside if nobody's home
There's no use flying to the moon if they won't believe
So why do I go wrong on repeat?
I was blinded by a memory
And there's every chance I'll be learning fast
And the day will come and then it will pass
What do you want when I say I won't?
And in the air of today is tomorrow's dust
There's no use trying to relate to that older soul
And no use biding your time if the bell is tolled
I was blinded by a memory
And there's every chance I'll be learning fast
And the day will come and then it will pass

Sympathy for the fauna
Fragile life in the sauna
In the sea getting warmer

I'm so alone  nothing for me
I guess I'll go home  try to be sane
Try to pretend  none of it happened
Out of this zone  now that I see
I don't need them and they don't need me
I guess I'll go home  try to be sane
Try to pretend  none of it happened
Destined to be  lonely old me
Ah  why won't they talk to me? (I thought I was happy)
Ah  why won't they talk to me? (I thought I was happy)
Ah  why won't they talk to me? (I thought I was happy)
Ah  why won't they talk to me?
Ah  why won't they talk to me?
But I don't even care about it anyway
I wouldn't listen to a word any of them say
They just talk about themselves all day
One day I'll be a star  and they'll be sorry

Give me a sign
Am I wasting my time living in my head?
You'll be sorry when I make up mine instead
Why won't you make up your mind?
Give me a sign

In the world my demons cultivate
I felt the strangest emotion but it wasn't hate for once
And if you don't think it's a crime  you can come along with me
Life is moving  can't you see?
There's no future left for you and me
I was hoping and I was searching endlessly
But baby  now there's nothing left that
I can do
So don't be blue
There is another future waiting there for you
I saw it different  I must admit
I caught a glimpse  I'm going after it
They say people never change but that's bullshit  they do
And even if I wanted  I wouldn't know how
Another version of myself I think I've found at last
And I can't always hide away
Curse indulgence and despise the fame
There is a world out there and it's calling my name

Arise and walk  come through
The world beyond that door (Listen to it call)
 what have I done?
 that makes you cry
 as the reason why
 all that you can do is ask me why
 woman
 woman
 woman
 woman
 as it takes a hold
 not in control
 I have a conscience and it's never fooled
