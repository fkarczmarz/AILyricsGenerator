Turn your radio  turn your radio  off

Uh-uh  uh-uh
Bitches in my ear  they sayin' they love me
Uh  you don't love Scott  you love the Kid Cudi
I ain't no fuckin' slouch  show you what I'm 'bout
My energy is a bit too precious  too drenched in them blessings
Transitionin' to my inner  I'm hearin' their voice
Tellin' me stay in focus  keep focusin'  boy
Feelin' like a trilli billi
The man everywhere I go  in any city
I mean  damn the girls  girls  girls galore
I mean  damn the girls  girls  girls adore
Mixin' fluorescent to the core of the accoutrement
Off the tippy titty  settin' off my groupie radar
Sippin' Hen'  dappin' hands off the roof of my Porsche
A fresh nigga at large  a fresh nigga go hard
All my youngins say  Keep it goin'
All my youngins  they dumb and reppin'  they always knowin'
Got some pride in your town  I'm spottin' 'em lately
Three-piece suit and I'm lookin' so cute
Sexy mama  send her way  you doin' it  honey
Them hatin' fucks sideline and question what you do
Not this  my nigga  you be here (Be here)
Not this  my nigga  you ain't here (Ain't here)
Big boss  I made your heart heavy (Uh-uh)
Can't stop me  can't carry me  baby

Big bro  big bro  big bro (Yeah)  big bro  back home

High-igh-igher  high-igh  high-igh-igher
High-igh-igher  high-igh  high-igh-igher
High-igh-igher  high-igh  high-igh-igher (Ayy  ayy)
Nightmares kept a nigga from closin' his lids (Lids)
Since a kid  I've been haunted by visions of death
Such a trip  now it's normal  I customed the grip
Think they gone  nah  they just dormant  the hauntings ain't left
Now tell me what's a young nigga to do
When the zombies are comin' for you?
Load up them Daryl Dixons
Survived the rage  turn the page  relaxin'  I'm whippin'
Last week  I almost weaved right off of Mulholland
Chiefin' good like I should  alone in my thoughts
All the awesome places I've gone to and witnessed
Is it worth the paranoia  betrayal  or loss?
Nah  nah  heroes can't simply have it all
Sacrifice  but see heroes don't sleep  we hear the call
My nieces know Uncle Scottie's so rock and roll
My princess Vada know rock and roll  Daddy got the glow
Got some pride in your town  I'm spottin' 'em lately
Three-piece suit and I'm lookin' so cute (Yeah)
Sexy mama  send her way  you doin' it  honey
Them hatin' fucks sideline and question what you do
Not this  my nigga  you be here (Be here)
Not this  my nigga  you ain't here (Ain't here)
Big boss  I made your heart heavy (Uh-uh)
Can't stop me  can't carry me  baby

That's just a code in my hood  don't let these guns hit you
Be a man of your word  don't ever let 'em play you
Stand up for your shit  make sure these haters pay you
Can't nothing stop a room full of real niggas
I got some bad rich bitches  they my real niggas
It's like working four jobs not to kill niggas
My little niggas love to ride by and spill niggas
If y'all fell out over some chips that ain't your real nigga
If y'all fell out over a chick that ain't your real nigga
Before I be a house nigga be a field nigga
I gotta Port Arthur chick  call it my trill nigga
I met Duke in '92 and we still niggas
Rockin Hilfigers before they was like chill niggas
Living well me and my niggas gon' eat
Before you hate  hit the brakes with both feet
Hey yo  all right
This is how it's 'posed to be
Hey yo  all right

Max with the homies  try to teach them things
Teach them how to make a piece of change  even keep the change
But they never change  bought a set of chains with another chain
Shoes on the 'rari start to look like hooves
Pigs by the crib start to look like wolves
Money neva change me only change the situation
The paper I be chasin' got them sucka niggas hatin'
Started from the pavement  basement Satan
Couldn't match my flames so they compare me to a mason
Free like slaves but they based and crazy
We talkin' 'bout crack or we talkin' about blacks?
Spliffing the blunt up  then they pickin' the gun up
Motherfuckers is trippin'  they fittin' to run up
And they do it 'til the sun up
And this is for my niggas and my gang
Through the fortune and the fame
Only thing that never change is my niggas
Hey yo  all right

I got the niggas that I need with me
Any issues my nigga you know to please hit me
No question no hesitation when it comes to holding fam down
If you creep me the fuck out you probably ain't around
Now you can hate on the side lines  I'm skippin past
You got me fucked up  keep talkin and kiss my ass
No sweatin the ho shit  too in tune with the family
I do got the ones that do know Scott
They give me the love that a nigga need
If it's a place to stay or a dime sack of weed
Word to Dennis  ridin' thick and thin until we finished
Focused to keep the pockets replenished  clothes on our kids
And keep my niggas from goin away on a bid
Only wanted all the fly shit when we got big
Chasin these hoes up in they ribs at they momma crib
Beat niggas up so 'bout it  'bout it they go blind about it
We all grown  families of our own
Providing for 'em real niggas  real morals that's the code
Perform so long as I am my brother's keeper
He will provide me with a nine if I need or a street sweeper
The love I have for my niggas is another type
You gotta real nigga down with you for your whole life
Love for my niggas
The brothers that I never had made my life a lot less sad  my nigga
Hey yo  all right
This is how it's 'posed to be
Hey yo  all right
This is how it's 'posed to be
Hey yo  all right
This is how it's 'posed to be
Hey yo  all right
Ooh-oh  tap in to the frequency  light
Born from dusk to dawn  I am truly alive
The satellite that sits in frame to illuminate this shaded place
Come on with it  mmm  come on
Moments don't pass me up  no  no
'Cause I seize them in stride
Tell them winnin' never gave me in
When I eternally have faith
In the choices you made  it's all by design
Go with it  mmmm
Come on  don't fuck up the feng shui
I see everything with new beams  I do dream
My eyes are glowing mood rings  you're boring
Stop dueling with the true thing  I do think
When you think too much you're removing what's moving
Stuck inside a statue  look at you
Go ahead and pogo  something gon' catch you
A petty logo  shed all my tattoos

Seems like I've stumbled on a path  no coincidence
Truly in my essence  I've arrived
Who am I? Who am I? Don't remind me
Too alive  too alive  new arriving
You were right  I was left in it before
To the light  to the light  I am Carol Anne
Parallel to paradise
I reach out for my lifeline
The angels laugh in paradise
They say I am my own lifeline  look in you
To the night  to the night I'm abandoned
To deny  to deny  what a sandpit
Couldn't I  couldn't I have an angel?
To the light  to the light  I am Carol Anne

I might go losing it and drive off of a cliff
Fall in the void
And if I blow my brains out all over the scene
That's madness curing sadness (Hm-hm)
These walls ain't talking back  might as well finally paint them black
I'm out of ideas
The ceiling is all I have  downward from here
I'm ripping apart
Who am I? Who are we?
Who am I? Who are we?
All I want is to feel complete
Who am I? Who are we?
Confused  truth is what I choose
Heal I never do
Asking  Who are you?
I don't have one clue
Seems I hate him  too
Seems my color's blue
Who?

Some days  I hurt myself to distract me from distraction
That's madness fixing sadness (Hmm-mm)
Go on adventures to find that the answers aren't plain
But there's comfort in tears (Hmm-mm-mm)
Decoding my sacred heart  flying from here
No more falling apart  ah
Who am I? Who are we?
Who am I? Who are we?
All I want is to feel complete (Complete)

I hate the drugs  but I love the numb (Hmm-hmh)

Oh baby  oh Anne Hathaway
See you jockin' over there  see you lookin' at my girl over here
Why you worried 'bout the girl over here?
Keep your eyes over there  it is creepy when you stare
I see you jockin' over there  think about your own life
Why you talkin' 'bout the young hippy?
And they think they know
And they think they know the deal  for real
And they think they know
And they think they know the deal  for real
I don't love who I am so I'm workin' on a fix
I don't need a bitch tryna tear my mind on my grip
Fuck tryna make it rhyme
Throw them stones  with your bitch ass
Cutting me deep and even though I bleed
I stand alone  alone I'll be
Heart of a lion still shinin' in this sucka ass
Fightin' for the freedom of my soul  I can hear the speech
Yeah I mumble while I'm trippin on so many pills
Hah  they figured that they know a nigga

I sure bet my daddy proud
A little nigga with a Shaker smile
On top of the dreams is where I'm found
Some figured I was Satan bound
Until I came back with a style I found
Then all of a sudden they fixed their faces
'Cause of who I know and the trail of places
That I've stepped
How many niggas wanna hate 'cause I left?
How could you blame me and my plan of attack?
'Cause I'm risking my soul intact  now I'm heard all over the map
Only rule of thumb
It don't really matter just where you from
All that really matter is where you gon' go
Maybe upstate for some
But you can‚Äôt rule out these cats for gone
Second chances given out for some
All you gotta do is take advantage
Then maybe you can get yourself a horse and carriage
Then find yourself and let's begin
I'ma tell you how in a minute
I'ma show you how I be livin'
Now I'm zoned  see things so vivid
I'ma zone out 'til I lose feeling  remember
I'ma be gone way past November
I can find peace somewhere

It sounds like oooooooh

When I'm zoned  I'm feeling alright
I'm feeling alright  I'm feeling alright
When I'm zoned  I'm feeling alright
I'm feeling alright  I forget about it all
Ballin'  is this allowed?
Without feelin' like Shallow Hal
Diamonds on the Jesus piece for style
Back in Cleveland City we ride around
Greetin' my niggas with dap and pound
So if I fall  I won't hit the ground
These are the things that'll make me smile
Knowin' this blunt might burn a while
I keep myself so lifted
I am accustomed to new heights
I feel perfect though they think it's worthless
See without my flight  man
Everybody wanna be a critic
I have my life and I will live it
Shut your mouth before I fuck it
If I'm seen on the scene with my slim cut jeans
More than likely I am faded  man
You are not the shit if everywhere you go
My vice is when the lights start flashin'
I'll be zonin'  all alone then
And the place where my mind is goin'
Filled with songs that no one's knowin'
And the Devil in a hot pink dress
Tryna ask me for one dance
He think he slick
But my guardians protect me from his wrath
So  in my place no hate shall enter
Livin' high up there  up there
I will find peace somewhere
In my mind
It sounds like oooooooh
When I'm gone
It feels like oooooooh
When I'm zoned  I'm feeling alright
I'm feeling alright  I'm feeling alright
When I'm zoned  I'm feeling alright
I'm feeling alright  I forget about it all
In my mind
It sounds like oooooooh
When I'm gone
It feels like oooooooh
When I'm zoned  I'm feeling alright
I'm feeling alright  I'm feeling alright
When I'm zoned  I'm feeling alright
Hello  what it be
To you and yours
Salutations to all  you can call me Cudi
Or Mr. Extravagant 'cause I'm getting my money
Way my doors are swayin'  it's like a bird on wheels
You can come to Ohio and you can see how it feels
And this the premier of that new-new here
It's gonna take you beyond
Where a jet can't Lear
But all you gon' hear
Is somethin' crazy in fact
How I be burnin' the booth
We'll get you looser than Yak
Yep-yep  you got it right
Now don't get left
Get on your good foot
It's only right that you step
And keep boppin' to this shit unfamiliar
If your main line got time then I be drillin' her
I keep you in my realm
I keep you in the sound
I keep myself up high
Because the haze by the pound
And my imagination
You can look all over the nation
But they ain't see

Salutations my niggas
I'm aware that I'm different
You can still keep it hood
While you're smokin' just listen
It don't matter your race
Just take a blunt to the face
And we all gon' rock
Got to keep up the pace
And them girls gon' twerk
Because the vibe is poppin'
As well as the bottles
Keep it rockin'  don't stop 'em
At the Motel-8
We can park out front
Yeah the flow is unleaded
You sucka niggas will front
'Cause I'm Super-Cudder-Realistic-Leaner-Alidocius
And rap ferocious
I been coaching the league
I bobble head the public
If you love it  M dub it
Finish the class if you think nothing 'bout it
Tell 'em like grandpa  you don't know nothing 'bout it
Wear kicks once  then the Leaner come up out 'em
I been sayin' it  you was playin' him
Now you know
You can look all over
But no  you'll never find
Hot shit like mine
Woop  it blow your mind
You can look all over
But no  you'll never find
Hot shit like mine
'Cause I provide

With the bodies that kill
We ain't boppin' on money
Fuck with me 'cause you real
See you shakin' it fast
On some Mystical shit
You could slap that nigga
If he call you a bitch
Yeah I see you with that
But you should be on this
It's that Henney and Coca-Cola
Come over and sit
Won't you tell me your name
Tell me where you be at
I know you know that them hot
But I don't wanna hear that
You see I aim for a check
Before I aim for sex
Niggas aim for death
They tryin' to fuck with the blessed
Ain't no fuckin' with amateurs
Run passed the novice
Sip hella lean
To see who talks the slowest
Ain't no stoppin' me at all
You'd need a sawed-off  or maybe a chainsaw
And even at that
The crack that I brew is still new
Y'all niggas think acute
But Cudi is obtuse
You can look all over
But no  you'll never find
Hot shit like mine
Woop  it blow your mind
You can look all over
But no  you'll never find
Hot shit like mine
'Cause I provide
Uh  uh

The lonely stoner seems to free his mind at night
He's all alone through the day and night
Day and night
The lonely stoner seems to free his mind at night
He's all alone  some things will never change

Wanna know what it sound like when I'm not on drugs?
Please  please don't play this song
People think they really being helpful
By telling me please be careful  yeah right
Please  please don't play this song
Yeah  haha
Balled all that shit right up
Tossed it away to the bottomless pit
The part of my mind that slips
And the part of my mind so sick
I don't even like to take the trip unless I'm sloppy drunk
I pray for my mom  how a teach had a son
That never gave a fuck about a scantron?
All I wanted was to be a human being
And show all the world some new colors and scenes
Imagine all types of beautiful scenery
I remember when I first had trees
Smoked out a Black and Mild  so dumb of me
Now  I'm grape Cigarillo man
Any young black kid  guaranteed fan
Hold it down  humble pie on the humble
And I treat normal girls like models
Think I should hit decline
I'm numb faced while I'm thinking 'bout suicide

You know the saying  ain't no delaying
Gotta gets the getting while the getting's good
Wise up  I'm checking the gate
On humble tales and minimum wage
The blogs tell it  Cudi's lame
Wearing a kilt? He must be gay
Let's keep it trill  fuck being discreet
But some girls tweet how they miss my meat
That's money to blow 'cause it's money for blow
Don't take no shit  you can blame my ma
I'm locking in my rocketship
I'll be a blip on your radar  bitch
Feels like things can be covered
Until the day I'm above myself  hovered

Soon after falling into a deeper psychedelic state
To escape the prison of our reality
Our hero becomes trapped in his own peaceful place
Which immediately becomes his sanctuary
A place filled with his wildest dreams
She said she don't know me anymore
And this what she tells me
I can't stop missing you (Yeah)
It makes me feel a bit complete (Yeah)
Knowing someone you love don't feel the same way about ya
Memories they soon delete (Hmm)
I missed you so damn much
This what this bitch tells me
I can't stop missing you

Why don't you come and watch a nigga tear the whole scene up
And everybody know she's mine so she extra plugged
We just praying the new fame don't get the best of us
But all good things gotta come to a en-a

Wicked  Wicked Awesome
And tune on into the frequency
Chill on out  love is the rule
Follow it to the frequency
Couple clubs and I'm in the zone
Rather take the party home  to get in the groove

Crazy
But what I might feel are the sounds of sanity
Hoping what I hear loops itself continuously
Why must it feel so wrong
When I try and do right? Do right
Soaring through paradise
When I'm closing my eyes
I'm Mr. Solo Dolo
Oh  oh
Look at me  you tell me just what you see
Am I someone whom you may love  or enemy?
Am I speaking for you and yours  or someone else?
Why must it feel so wrong
When I try and do right? Do right
Soaring through paradise
When I'm closing my eyes
I'm Mr. Solo Dolo

Look at where I stand at  tall
Clutchin' my Kid Cudi bizzalls
Mute motherfuckers back home  quick pause
Gargle on my mayo
Look at me  I bet I'm the one you think to fail
Floating in my mind  no sail
Ahoy  ahoy
Listen good  I don't need nobody
Hoping what I hear loops itself to finish me
Why must it feel so wrong
When I try and do right? Do right
Soaring through paradise
When I'm closing my eyes
I'm Mr. Solo Dolo
Why must it feel so right
When I know that it's wrong? It's wrong
When will I ever learn
From the words in my songs?
Please shut the front door and walk right in
In the land of the man who rock it hard for them

You never seen a nigga like me?
I just tell 'em I'm an oxymoron when I open my mouth

But for sure these Cleveland boys is ill
But pretty soon your gutter bitches wildin' for real  it's such a trip
Hoes around the globe  I'm known to have a fet'
I don't do a thing and these bitches lickin' they lips
Me and Chip reflect on all the hate and jibber-jabber

Cursed  but the demons I confronted would disperse
Have you ever heard of some shit so real?
Beyond  from the heart  from the soul  you can feel

Brush my teeth
Find that clip I been looking for since last night
I feel so caught up in the bud
I float somehow in my bedroom
Turn around
And those happy thoughts in my head
I'm feeling like I'm Peter Pan
Minus the tights and the fairies
Happy to see how far I've come
To the same place it began
My dreams and imagination
Perfectly at peace
So I move along a bit higher
I see the dreams I made
So I'm cooler now
I can take care of my mom and my little niece Zuri
I provide for friends and fam and fans
Who gives a fuck? If a nigga don't like your steeze
