" I love you more now
 I love you more now
 I love you more now
 I love you more now
 I love you more now
 by the middle
 by the middle
 oh oh oh oh -
 no oh oh oh 
 oh alright oh 
 by the middle
 no oh oh oh 
I know you see me over here  so dance on me real slow
We've been goin' for about two hours
And I don't even know your name
Your friends are calling you  baby  stay with me instead
I know you're sayin' that you're tired
There's a little dance in ya left
Even if I go  I'll still think of you in my bed
Of the good time  good time  good time we had. 
The scent of your perfume has got me lost in a haze
And  oh  this moment depends on the records that the DJ plays
Baby  move a lil bit closer 'cause I wanna feel you  babe
I wanna feel you babe 
Your friends are calling you  baby  stay with me instead
I know you're sayin' that you're tired
There's a little dance in ya left
Even if I go  I'll still think of you in my bed
I'm just trying to see you in your moment baby
I could be down on it
You could be all we need
I could be down on it
You could be all we need
I was thinking you and I could
Skip the part where we small talk each other
Hold me to my word this time
I'm gonna take another ride
Call me on my bitter side
Call me on my cell at night
Don't ask me to commit a thing

I could be down on it
You could be all we need
I could be down on it
You could be all we need
Just wanna fast forward
Just give me the damn controller
Or should I leave it behind me?
Looking for something  don't wanna live for nothing
I could tell right now or I can jump somehow
One route  like there is no way out
They never teach you to reach the stars
No doubt  I'm feeling better now
Gave it a try  and I'm enjoying the ride
So what if I fall?
Better that I tried instead of nothing at all
And I can say it's my fault
I really don't mind  at least I gave it a go
So what if I fall?
Better that I tried instead of nothing at all
And I can say it's my fault
I really don't mind  at least I gave it a go
Been trying to fix it and find out what's been missing
I wanna live a life that is worth living

Oh  no  no-oh
I gave it a go
We run into the sun
We run into the corners of
The love we choose to make
Tonight  we show
We show where we belong
The places I have never been
The places we are strong
Tonight  we're golden
We fall towards each other
We fall to the edges of the Earth
We burn tonight as one
Tonight  we run
Through love we never knew
Our love to everyone
We love tonight for love
We're golden
We're golden
We're golden
 tell me your version
 but
 a great exhibition
 we all wanna listen
 I can’t relax
 moving too fast
 what can I do? I can’t relax
 moving too fast
 or we moving too slow?
 or we moving too slow?
 or we moving too slow?
No need to feel worried  I’m all at ease
Its echoed in my voice
Misguided in the colors rainbow phase  oh sunlight haze
Underneath the moonlight  watch it invade me
I’m overpowered by relentless beauty  beauty
Its echoed in my voice
Misguided in the colors rainbow phase  oh sunlight hey
Y no hiciste nada para entender
Lo puse todo a tus pies
Y mis labios siempre contaran
La gran falta que tu me harás
Y mis ojos siempre guardaran
La farsa que encontré en tu amor
Siento que vives en mi corazón
Se muy bien que no vas a salir
Te extrañara toda mi piel
Does the water feel too deep?
Lie awake 'cause you can't sleep without it
Ever feel like you're alone?
When you're lost but you're already home?
Lie awake 'cause you can't dream without it
It's gonna be alright
I'm never gonna leave your side
You've just gotta hold on tight
We're gonna make it through this time
You've just gotta hold on tight
We're gonna make it through this time
Ever feel like it's too much?
Do you feel like you're not enough
When you feel like it's gonna take forever?
To feel alone at the end of the night

How society says her life is already over

 this strange ticking

 it begins to feel like torture
Don't struggle too much now while I kill you in your sleep
What is lust if it's not being by yourself?
I won't be gentle to the body on the shelf
I heard the news today that you weren't mine to save
I hope that you're comfortable in the quiet lasting grave ()

Threw away the sheets that we used
All your towels are getting laundered
All our pictures in the desk drawer
But I want you back in the middle of the night
I want you back in the middle of this fight
I never sleep in the middle of the night
I want you back in the middle of this fight
With me
I don’t do the things I used to do
And I don’t drink the way I used to
When you’re not 'round to see me do it
But I want you back in the middle of the night
I want you back in the middle of this fight

(Say goodbye to everybody)
(Goodbye)
Each second slipped away  did not know what to do
Was always drawing secrets on your wall
My clothes were always falling on your floor
A reckless heart could never be much more
I always snuck in late
Running through the front gate
Light  floating on a feather
Light  landing on forever
Our trip surreal  so high
We flew right through the roof
Those nights you never came home
I stayed up needing you
Was always writing poems in math books
My idols were the clever fast crooks
This reckless heart could never be much more
I always snuck in late
Rushing through the front gate

Let’s go out on the street
You take me away
Cross my heart and hope to die
If you ever catch me in a white lie
I lay me down in the tall grass
Tangled in the weeds in my messy bed
If you come and you come
Let’s go out on the street
Bring me under the soil in the roots I toil
Break through watch as I grow
Cross my heart and hope to die
If you ever catch me in a white lie
I lay me down in the tall grass

Did we make a mistake healin'?
