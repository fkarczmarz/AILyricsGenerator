lyrics
"Send you roses when they think you need to smile
I can't control myself because I don't know how
Give them all that they can drink  and it will never be enough
Grab a glass  because there's going to be a flood
A celebrated man amongst the gurneys
They can fix me proper with a bit of luck
The doctors and the nurses  they adore me so
I gave you all that you can drink  and it has never been enough
Would you drink the wine while watching television?
Watch the animals and all the tragedies
Sell your arteries and buy my casket gown
(Well) It better be black  (Well) it better be tight
(Well) It better be just my size
I'm stalking these metro malls and airport halls
And all these schoolgirls
I'm not asking  you're not telling
He's not dead  he only looks that way
Out nowhere  take me out there
Far away and save me from my
Self-destruction  hopeless for ya
Sing a song for California
I buy my enemies rope to hang me and the knives to gang me
You can watch them stab me on your television
Stalk the halls because the bathroom walls
Would have a lot to say about the lines you're putting down
(Well) It better be white  (Well) it better be cut
(Well) It better be just my size (Well)
Until my capillaries burst of boredom
I'll be waiting

I'm not laughing  you're not joking
I'm not dead  I only dress that way
Out nowhere  take me out there
Far away and save me from my
Self-destruction  hopeless for ya
Sing a song for California
Wherever you are  wherever you are
Way out nowhere  take me out there
Far away and save me from my
Self-destruction  hopeless for ya
Say a prayer for California
We got the bomb
We got the bomb
We got the bomb
These pigs are after me  after you
Run away like it was yesterday and we could run away
If we could run away  run away from here
I got a bulletproof heart  you got a hollow-point smile
Me and your runaway scars
Got a photographed dream on the getaway mile
Let's blow a hole in this town
And do our talking with a laser beam
Gunnin' out of this place in a bullet's embrace
Then we'll do it again
'Cause everybody knows you don't ever wanna come back
Let me be the one to save you
Gravity don't mean too much to me  I'm who I've got to be
These pigs are after me  after you
Run away like it was yesterday when we could run away
When we could run away  run away from here

Stop your preaching right there

Tell the truth and God will save you
Gravity don't mean too much to me  I'm who I've got to be
These pigs are after me  after you
Run away like it was yesterday and we could run away
If we could run away  run away from here
And though I know how much you hate this (Ooh-ooh)
Are you gonna be the one to save us
From the black and hopeless feeling?
Will you mean it when the end comes reelin'?
Hold your heart into this darkness
Will it ever be the light to shine you out?
Or fail and leave you stranded?
I ain't gonna be the one left standing
You ain't gonna be the one left standing
We ain't gonna be the ones left standing
Gravity don't mean too much to me
Is this our destiny?
This world is after me  after you
Run away like it was yesterday and we could run away
Yeah  away from here
 get me a drink
 still
 my agony
 I'm just soggy from the chemo
In a solitary style and crash the cemetery gates
In the dress your husband hates
Way down  mark the grave
Where the searchlights find us drinking by the mausoleum door
And they found you on the bathroom floor
And the collision of your kiss that made it so hard
Back home  off the run
Singing songs that make you slit your wrists
It isn't that much fun staring down a loaded gun
So I won't stop dying  won't stop lying
If you want  I'll keep on crying
Did you get what you deserve?
Is this what you always want me for?
And the collision of your kiss that made it so hard

Did you get what you deserve?
The ending of your life
And if you get to Heaven
Did you get what you deserve?
Then your heart can't take this
Have you heard the news that you're dead?
No one ever had much nice to say
I think they never liked you anyway
Wouldn't it be grand? It ain't exactly what you planned
And wouldn't it be great if we were dead?

'Cause now you've got
Maybe just two weeks to live
Is that the most the both of you can give?
And then I'd say to you  We could take to the highway
With this trunk of ammunition  too
I'd end my days with you  in a hail of bullets
I'm trying  I'm trying
To let you know just how much you mean to me
And after all the things
We put each other through and
I would drive on to the end with you
A liquor store or two keeps the gas tank full
And I feel like there's nothing left to do
But prove myself to you  and we'll keep it running
But this time  I mean it
I'll let you know just how much you mean to me
As snow falls on desert sky
Until the end of everything

Our phantoms forever  forever
Like scarecrows that fuel this flame
We're burning forever and ever
Know how much I want to show you
You're the only one
Like a bed of roses
There's a dozen reasons in this gun
And as we're falling down  and in this pool of blood

And when the lights all went out  we watched our lives on the screen
I hate the ending myself  but it started with an alright scene
It was the roar of the crowd that gave me heartache to sing
It was a lie when they smiled and said  You won't feel a thing
If I'm so wrong (So wrong  so wrong)
How can you listen all night long? (Night long  night long)
Now  will it matter after I'm gone?
Because you never learned a goddamn thing
You're just a sad song with nothing to say
About a lifelong wait for a hospital stay
And if you think that I'm wrong
This never meant nothing to you
I spent my high school career spit on and shoved to agree
So I could watch all my heroes sell a car on TV
Bring out the old guillotine  we'll show 'em what we all mean

And dressed in red and blue  I squeezed
Imaginary wedding gown
That you can't wear in front of me
A kiss goodbye  your twisted shell
As rice grains and roses fall at your feet
Let's say goodbye the hundredth time
And then tomorrow  we'll do it again
Tomorrow  we'll do it again
I dragged her down  I put her out
And back there  I left her where no one could see
And lifeless  cold into this well

And if you say  all I'm asking for is
A thousand bodies piled up

And I'll keep on making more
Just to prove that I adore every inch of sanity
All I'm asking for is  all I'm asking for is...
Come on!
These hands  stained red
From the times that I've killed you and then
We can wash down this engagement ring
With poison and kerosene
We'll laugh as we die
And we'll celebrate the end of things
With cheap champagne
Without  without a sound
Without a sound  and I wish you away
Just like my favorite scenes
Then holding hands and life was perfect
Just like up on the screen
And the whole time while always giving
Counting your face among the living
Up and down escalators
Pennies and colder fountains
Elevators and half-price sales
Trapped in by all these mountains
Running away and hiding with you
I never thought they'd get me here
Not knowing you changed from just one bite
I fought them all off just to hold you close and tight
But does anyone notice? But does anyone care?
And if I had the guts to put this to your head
But would anything matter if you're already dead?
But does anyone notice? But does anyone care?
And if I had the guts to put this to your head
And would anything matter if you're already dead?
And now should I be shocked by the last thing you said?
And these words changing nothing as your body remains
But does anyone notice? But does anyone care?
And if I had the guts to put this to your head
But does anything matter if you're already dead?
And these words changing nothing as your body remains
But where's your heart?
But where's your heart?
But where's your—
And I know there's nothing I can say
To change that part
To change that part
To change
So many bright lights to cast a shadow
But can I speak?
Well  is it hard understanding
I'm incomplete?
A life that's so demanding
I get so weak
A love that's so demanding
I can't speak

I am not afraid to walk this world alone
Nothing you can say can stop me going home

But I miss you more than I did yesterday

That immortality meant never dying
Take my fucking
