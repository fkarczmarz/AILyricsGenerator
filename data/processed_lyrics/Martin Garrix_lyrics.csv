We're the fuckin' animals
Is your heart racin'?
Is that fire in your veins?
Are your bones burnin'?
Is your skin yearnin'?
'Cause you're drivin' me insane
Can we stay right here in this atmosphere
Like we're flyin' out in space?
Don't look down
Don't look down
Do you feel the lightnin' inside of you?
Will you follow through if I fall for you?
Don't look down

Are your hands shakin'?
Are your fears breakin'?
Are you climbin' over walls?
Are the times changin'?
Is the noise fadin'?
'Cause I wanna get it all
Can we stay right here in this atmosphere
Or are you afraid to fall?
Don't look down
Don't look down
Do you feel the lightnin' inside of you?
Will you follow through if I fall for you?
Don't look down
Don't look down
Do you feel the lightnin' inside of you?
Will you follow through if I fall for you?
Don't look down
Don’t tell me not to dream
I got freedom
And that's everything to me
It don't matter
What I’ve got or where I go
I'll find shelter a million miles from home
It ain't easy to keep going when it's hard
Keep shining in the dark
When you wanna fall apart
But I'm a dreamer
So don't tell me not to dream

Feeling trapped inside
So afraid of the darkness talking
In my mind
It's been a long time coming
But it wasn't for nothing
Soul searching for something  for something
I'm down on my knees in the dust
I scream from the top of my lungs
I find my way back to a higher ground
Yeah  I just want to feel alive
Deep in my bones
I know I'm not there but I'm close
I'll find my way back to a higher ground
Yeah  I just want to feel alive with you
Yeah  I just want to feel alive with you
Yeah  I just want to feel alive
Try to speak but my voice keeps breaking
Need to say what's wrong
So many smiles you have seen me faking
On and on

After I lost it all
Felt I was falling down
Still I chose to be proud
Until I hit the ground
You got me back on my feet again
You said that lovers come and they go
You said that time will pass but I'll stay your friend
I’ll help you up when you feel alone
I was lonely
But after all you told me I'd be okay
Cause friends are worth a whole lot more than money
I hope that everyone who's felt like me
Can hold on and believe

You pull hope from defeat in the night
There's an image of you in my mind
Could be mad but you might just be right

Out of the ruins of hate and war
Army of lovers never seen beforе
We are the pеople we've been waiting for
We are the people of the open hand
The streets of Dublin to Notre-Dame
We'll build it better than we did before
We are the people we've been waiting for
