"We rededicate this song to you
Fuck a silver lining
Fuck a silver lining
'Cause only gold is hot enough  hot enough
Fuck a silver lining
Fuck a silver lining
'Cause only gold is hot enough  hot enough
One more  one more
It's just cherries  cherries
Everything is cherries on top
No wings of wax or endless mountains
Tragedies with penniless fountains
It's just cherries  cherries
It's coming up cherries on top
Sunset shadows through the trophies
I guess it just ain't big enough
Fuck a silver lining
Fuck a silver lining
'Cause only gold is hot enough  hot enough
Fuck a silver lining
Fuck a silver lining
'Cause only gold is hot enough  hot enough

We've been falling  falling
It's like we fell to the top
I was born to cut a million
Cut my teeth and made a killing
Now I'm dodging  dodging
Everything you think that I'm not
Archetype of television
Was lost in thought but held the vision  hey
When you gonna say my name?
When you gonna say my name?
When you gonna say my name?
When you gonna say my name?
Silver lining
Fuck a silver lining
'Cause only gold is hot enough  hot enough
Fuck a silver lining
Fuck a silver lining
'Cause only gold is hot enough  hot enough
It's just cherries  cherries
Everything is cherries on top
It's just cherries  cherries
Everything is cherries on top
Silver lining
Fuck a silver lining
 I'll be your levee
 lonely little life
 the castle's under siege
 Leave me alone
Corner of 4th and Fremont Street
Appealing only 'cause they're just that unappealing
Any practiced Catholic would cross themselves upon entering
The rooms have a hint of asbestos
And maybe just a dash of formaldehyde
And the habit of decomposing
Along with the people inside
What a wonderful caricature of intimacy
Inside  what a wonderful caricature of intimacy
Tonight's tenants range from a lawyer and a virgin
Accessorizing with a rosary tucked inside her lingerie
She's getting a job at the firm come Monday
The missus will stay with the cheating attorney
Moonlighting aside  she really needs his money
A wonderful caricature of intimacy
Yeah  yeah
And not to mention the constable
And his proposition for that virgin
Yes  the one the lawyer met with on strictly business
As he said to the missus
She was fixing her face in a compact
There was a terrible crash
There was a terrible crash
Between her and the badge
She spilled her purse and her bag
And held a purse of a different kind

Raindrops on roses and girls in white dresses
It's sleeping with roaches and taking best guesses
At the shade of the sheets and before all the stains
And a few more of your least favorite things
Raindrops on roses and girls in white dresses
It's sleeping with roaches and taking best guesses
At the shade of the sheets and before all the stains
And a few more of your least favorite things
Inside  what a wonderful caricature of intimacy
Inside  what a wonderful caricature of intimacy
Raindrops on roses and girls in white dresses
It's sleeping with roaches and taking best guesses
At the shade of the sheets and before all the stains
And a few more of your least favorite things
Raindrops on roses and the girls in white dresses
And the sleeping with the roaches and the taking best guesses
At the shade of the sheets and before all the stains
To be forgetting you in a cabaret
Somewhere downtown where a burlesque queen
May even ask my name
As she sheds her skin on stage
I'm seated and sweating to a dance song on the club's PA
The strip joint veteran sits two away
Smirking between dignified sips of his dignified
Peach and lime daiquiri...
And isn't this exactly where you'd like me?
Praying for love in a lap dance
And paying in naivety?
Praying for love in a lap dance
And paying in naivety?
And I wouldn't be caught dead
And I wouldn't be caught dead in this place

Who are these people?
I just woke up in my underwear
No liquor left on the shelf
I should prob'ly introduce myself
You shoulda' seen what I wore
I had a cane and a party hat
I was the king of this hologram
Where there's no such thing as getting out of hand
Memories tend to just pop up
Drunk pre-meds and some rubber gloves
Five thousand people with designer drugs

They don't look very human-like
Now I wish that I could find my clothes
Bedsheets and a morning rose
I wanna wake up
Can't even tell if this is a dream
How did we end up in my neighbor's pool
Upside-down with a perfect view?
Bar to bar at the speed of sound
Fancy feet dancing through this town
Lost my mind in a wedding gown
Don't think I'll ever get it now

Oh yeah  don't threaten me with a good time
I'm a scholar and a gentleman
And I usually don't fall when I try to stand
I lost a bet to a guy in a Chiffon skirt
But I make these high heels work
I've told you time and time again
I'm not as think as you drunk I am
And we all fell down when the sun came up
I think we've had enough

The sun was in your eyes  you couldn't believe it
Riches all around  you're walking
Stars are on the ground  you start to believe it
Every face along the boulevard
Is a dreamer just like you
You looked at death in a tarot card
And you saw what you had to do
But nobody knows you now  when you're dying in LA
And nobody owes you now  when you're dying in LA

Give me one last kiss while we're far too young to die

 sexy looking back from a night that time forgot
 carafes of blood red wine
 don't you wonder when the light begins to fade?
 growing older just the same
 the air was sauna hot
 don't you wonder when the light begins to fade?
 growing older just the same
 but it'll take the pain away
 I won't let it fade away
A moment you'll never remember
And a night you'll never forget!
Ohh!
Say your prayers
Say your prayers
Say your prayers
(Hallelujah!)
My life started the day I got caught
Under the covers
With secondhand lovers
In a state of emergency
Who was I trying to be
Then the time for being sad is over
And you miss them like you miss no other
And being blue is better than being over it (Over it)

Tonight is my appraisal
'Cause I'm a hooker sellin' songs and
My pimp's a record label
This world is full of demons stocks
And bonds and bible traders
So I do the deed  get up and leave
A climber and a sadist  yeah
Are you ready for the sequel?
Ain't ready for the latest

In a golden cathedral

All the guests at the party  they're so insincere
They just intrude and exclude  this impossible year
There's no you and me  this impossible year
Only heartache and heartbreak and gin made of tears
The bitter pill I swallow   the scar's souvenir
There's never air to breathe  there's never in-betweens
These nightmares always hang on past the dream...
There's no sunshine...

Am I who you think about in bed
When the lights are dim and your hands are shaking
As you're sliding off your dress?
Then think of what you did
And how I hope to God he was worth it

As your fingers touch his skin
Exchanging body heat in the passenger seat?

Found another victim
You put a sour little flavor in my mouth now
You move in circles  hoping no one's gonna find out
But we're so lucky  kiss the ring and let 'em bow down

The hospice is
A relaxing weekend getaway where you're a cut above all the rest
Sick and sad patients on first name basis
Dès le premier jour  ton parfum enivra mon amour
Et dans ces instants  j'aimerais être comme toi par moments
Mais depuis ce jour  je n'ai qu'un seul et unique regret...
My wing tips waltz across naive wood floors
They creak innocently down the stairs
Drag melody  my percussive
Feet serve cobweb headaches as a
Matching set of marching clocks
The slumbering apparitions that they've come to wake up
Here I am composing a burlesque
Out of where they rest their necks
Sunken in their splintered cradles
And ramshackle heads  they asked for it
As a girl
You have set your heart on haunting me forever from the start
It's never silent

Ever since we met  I only shoot up with your perfume
It's the only thing that makes me feel as good as you do
Ever since we met  I've got just one regret to live through
And that one regret is you
How does a heart love if no one has noticed
Its presence  and where does it go?
Trembling hands play my heart like a drum
But the beat's gotten lost in the show
You have set your heart on haunting me forever from the start
It's never silent
Ever since we met  I only shoot up with your perfume
It's the only thing that makes me feel as good as you do
Ever since we met  I've got just one regret to live through
And I regret never letting you go!
Ever since we met  I only shoot up with your perfume
It's the only thing that makes me feel as good as you do
Ever since we met  I've got just one regret to live through
And that one regret is you!
Mona Lisa  pleased to please ya... (And that one regret is you!)
Mona Lisa  pleased to please ya... (And that one regret is you!)
Mona Lisa  pleased to please ya... (I've got just one...)
Ooh-ooh  ooh  ooh  ooh  ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh  ooh-ooh
I feel the salty waves come in  I feel them crash against my skin
And I smile as I respire because I know they'll never win
There's a haze above my TV that changes everything I see
And maybe if I continue watchin'  I'll lose the traits that worry me
Can we fast-forward to go down on me?
Stop there  and let me correct it
I wanna live a life from a new perspective
You come along because I love your face
And I'll admire your expensive taste  and
Who cares? Divine intervention
I wanna be praised from a new perspective
But leaving now would be a good idea
So catch me up on gettin' out of here
Ooh-ooh  ooh  ooh  ooh  ooh-ooh-ooh  ooh-ooh  ooh
(Can we fast-forward to go down on me?)
Ooh-ooh  ooh  ooh  ooh  ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh  ooh-ooh

Catch me up on gettin' out of here
More to the point  I need to show
How much I can come and go
Other plans fell through
And put a heavy load on you  I know
There's no more that need be said
When I'm inching through your bed
Take a look around instead  and watch me go
Ah  ah  ah  ah-ah-ah  ah  ah
Stop there  and let me correct it
I wanna live a life from a new perspective
You come along because I love your face
And I'll admire your expensive taste  and
Who cares? Divine intervention
I wanna be praised from a new perspective
But leaving now would be a good idea
So catch me up on gettin' out of here
It's not fair  just let me perfect it
Don't wanna live a life that is comprehensive (All on me)
'Cause seein' clear would be a bad idea
Now catch me up on gettin' out of here

Ooh-ooh  ooh  ooh  ooh  ooh-ooh-ooh  ooh-ooh  ooh

Ooh-ooh  ooh  ooh  ooh  ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh  ooh-ooh
Cross my heart and hope to die
Burn my lungs and curse my eyes
I've lost control and I don't want it back
It's a fucking drag
I taste you on my lips and I can't get rid of you
So I say damn your kiss and the awful things you do
Yeah
It's better to burn than to fade away
It's better to leave than to be replaced
It's a fucking drag

Then we should feed our jewelry to the sea
For diamonds do appear to be
Just like broken glass to me
And then she said she can't believe
Genius only comes along in storms of fabled foreign tongues
Tripping eyes and flooded lungs
Northern downpour sends its love
Hey moon  please forget to fall down
Hey moon  don't you go down
Sugarcane in the easy morning
Weathervanes my one and lonely
The ink is running toward the page  it's chasing off the days
Look back at boat feet and that winding knee
I missed your skin when you were east
You clicked your heels and wished for me
Through playful lips made of yarn  that fragile Capricorn
Unraveled words like moths upon old scarves
I know the world's a broken bone
But melt your headaches  call it home

We were swallowin' the nights like we had nine lives
Dead and gone so long  seventeen so gone
Dead and gone so long  seventeen so
We were borderline kids with a book of disorders
Medicatin' every day to keep the straightness in order
Dead and gone so long  seventeen so gone
Dead and gone so long  seventeen so gone
It's the false side of hope where believers concede
And there's only memories when it's over
So pour out some liquor  make it an old-fashioned
Remember your youth  in all that you do
The plank and the passion
They were the best of times  they were the best of times
They were the best of times  they were the best of times
Of your life
Once upon before  we were brilliant and bored
Two dashes of the bitters  add some ice and you pour

Everyone raced to the suburbs
And I'm on the rooftop with curious strangers
This is the oddest of summers

My Tell-Tale Heart's a hammer in my chest
Cut me a silk tie tourniquet
I don't even know me
Roll me like a blunt 'cause I wanna go home

So unaware of my status

Waiting for the sky to fall
Then you called and changed it all  doll
Velvet lips and the eyes to pull me in
We both know you'd already win
Mmm  your original sin
You fooled me once with your eyes now  honey
You fooled me twice with your lies  and I say
Sarah smiles like Sarah doesn't care
She lives in her world so unaware

Been trav'lin' in packs that I can't carry anymore
Been waitin' for somebody else to carry me
There's nothin' that's there for me at my door
All the people I know aren't who they used to be
And if I try to change my life one more day
There would be nobody else to save
I pray for the wicked on the weekend
And every mornin' when I wake up
I wanna be who I couldn't say I'd ever been
But it's so much more than I ever was

But she didn't ever hold me
Spun the stars on her fingernails
But it never made her happy
'Cause she couldn't ever have me
She said she'd won the world at a carnival
But she could never win me
'Cause she couldn't ever catch me
When I look in her eyes
You could love me if I knew how to lie
But who could love me? I am out of my mind
Throwing a line out to sea to see if I can catch a dream
The sun was always in her eyes
She didn't even see me
But that girl had so much love
She'd wanna kiss you all the time
She said she'd won the world at a carnival
But I'm sure I didn't ruin her
It just made her more interesting

Fall on your ears from criminal dimes
They spill unfound from a pretty mouth

Now I’m the only one to blame
