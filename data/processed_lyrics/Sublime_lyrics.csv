lyrics
"Screaming that second gear was such a turn-on
And the fog forming on my window tells me that the morning's here
And you'll be gone before too long
Who taught you those new tricks? Damn  I shouldn't start that talk
But life is one big question when you're starin' at the clock
And the answer's always waiting at the liquor store
40 ounces to freedom so I'll take that walk
And I know that
Oh  I'm not going back
Oh  not going back
Oh  I not going
But I know which way the wind blows
A 40 ounce to freedom is the only chance I have
To feel good  even though I feel bad
And I know that
Oh  I'm not going back
Oh  I'm not going back
Oh  God knows (God knows) I'm not going back
You might also like
Oh  ah (ah) I'm not going back
Oh  I'm not going back
Oh  God knows (God knows) not going back
And give it to a police man?
I'm not a fool to hurt myself
But I was innocent to what they done to me
One more time

Cause we're jillin' it and we're chillin' it into the club all night
'Cause some jealous punk
Snuck up around the back
Tried to take the lovin' over me
And wound up in jail all night
Give it to me two times
Give it to me three time
Give it to me four time
Part II:  Ball and Chain
I've got something that you all should hear
Form a little part of history
I was always taught that boy meets girl
I don't feel no pain
I don't have no time
To listen to conflicting points of view
It's a crazy world to live alone
A ball and chain I call my own
Ba-na-na-na-na
I've got something that you all should know
Holy Matrimony's not for me
Rather die alone in misery
'Cause I was always taught that boy meets girl
Isn't that what they used to say?
When the girl you knew
And the bonds that we grew
Turned into a ball and chain
I step into the great unknown
On a ball and chain I call my own
Ba-na-na-na-na
A crazy world to live alone
When a girl you knew
And the bonds that we grew
Turned into a ball and chain
I step into the great unknown
On a ball and chain I call my own
Because marriage doesn't work in the world today
It's an institution that is in decay
And if I have love I wish to portray
I will surely find another way
Because I was always taught that boy meets girl
Kiss him on the cheek and life's okay
I don't feel no pain
I don't have no time
To listen to conflicting points of view
I step into the great unknown
On a ball and chain I call my own
 budda-by  budda-by!
 budda-by  budda-by!

The address is 1934  East Anaheim
All the windows are busted out  and it's like a free-for-all in here
And  uh  the owner should at least come down here
And see if he can secure his business  if he wants to
April 26th  1992
There was a riot on the streets  tell me  where were you?
You were sitting home watching your TV
While I was participatin' in some anarchy
The first spot we hit it was my liquor store
I finally got all that alcohol I can't afford
With red lights flashing  time to retire
And then we turned that liquor store into a structure fire
Next stop we hit it was the music shop
It only took one brick to make that window drop
Finally  we got our own P.A
Where do you think I got this guitar that you're hearing today?
Hey!

Homicide  never doin' no time
When we returned to the pad to unload everything
It dawned on me that I need new home furnishings
So  once again  we filled the van until it was full
Since that day  my living room's been much more comfortable
'Cause everybody in the hood has had it up to here
It's getting harder  and harder and harder  each and every year
Some kids went in and stole with their mother
I saw her when she came out  she was getting some Pampers
They said it was for the black man
They said it was for the Mexican  and not for the white man
But if you look at the street  it wasn't about Rodney King
And this fucked up situation  and these fucked up police
It's about coming up and stayin' on top
And screamin'  187 on a motherfuckin' cop
It's not in the paper  it's on the wall
National Guard  smoke from all around!
(Bo  bo  bo!)

When you grab a hold of me
You tell me that I'll never be set free
But I'm a parasite
Two pints of booze
Ain't got no money to spend
I hope the night will never end
Lord knows I'm weak
Won't somebody get me off of this reef?
Grab the reef when all duck divin' fails

I would take it if I could
And I would not lie to you
Because Sunday mornin' soon will come
When things will be much easier to say
Up on the microphone like a boss DJ

I don't wanna take the doggy for a walk
I don't want to look at naked chicks and drink beer
I don't want to do a bong load
And go and wrench on the car
I don't want to hose the dog shit down
'Cause I ain't even gonna get out of bed

I’m hornier than Ron Jeremy
And if you wanna get popped in your knee
Just wipe that look off your batty face
You hate me 'cause I got what you need
A pretty little daughter that we call  Mexi
If you wanna get beat physically
It will be over in a minute if ya...
So  she told me to come over and I took that trip
And then she pulled out my mushroom tip
I didn’t know she had the G.I. Joe kung-fu grip
Uh  and that’s that loving sound
Uh  and that’s that loving sound
When I kiss Mexi  she makes me feel horny
'Cause I’m the type of lover with the sensitivity
When she kiss my neck and tickle me fancy
She give me the right kind of lovin on' Sunday morning
En otro lado  es donde viví
Y su hermana  sí me quiere
Y ahorita  tenemos un bebé
But they did not get too far
Un poco después tuve que regresar

Had a drink about an hour ago
And saw a man she'd never seen before
A double-chin and a plastic smile
And took an empty seat next to her at the bar
My brand new car is parked right outside
How'd ya like to go for a ride?
And they left and got into his car
And they drove away some place real far
How'd ya like to have a little fun?
I would not run
That's when things got out of control
She didn't want to

Date rape stylee
Looked up her local attorney at law
Went to the phone and filed a police report
And then she took the guy's ass to court
The judge knew he was full of shit
And he gave him twenty-five years
And now his heart is filled with tears
But the guards paid no attention to his cries
That's when things got out of control
The moral of the date rape story:
It does not pay to be drunk and horny
But that's the way it had to be
They locked him up and threw away the key
Even though he now takes it in the behind
That's the way it had to be
They locked him up and threw away the key
Even though he now takes it in the behind
Date rape!
She didn't want to

My place is not a home
It don't make no difference  but I have found
That I need a place to stay
I never listen what the landlord man say
You should've seen all the flops in my house
We was jumping on walls and kicking ceilings
Nowadays  people listen to me
When I say  Get out!
Hold me and don't let go
It don't make no difference that you're a ho
'Cause I need a place to stay
A new disease was just the price I paid
In days of old  that's how it used to be
Oh yes  indeed
That girl is dead to me now
And I sing  Get out!

Well  that's exactly what I'm gonna do. I'm gonna go to the psych ward and so I'm gonna shoot my fuckin' mouth off  so get out of here. You're cutting into my commercial.
You understand?

This is the last warning  Raleigh.
Good  shut up! (laughs)
Any more out of you and you're going to the psych ward.
See  you lie. You don't eat your feedback.
You need to understand that.
I understand that!
As long as you understand that  that's the rules  Raleigh.
Whoever comes in this fuckin' room  I'm gonna kill em! That's what I'm gonna do.
Oh are you? I'm in your room  Raleigh.
Well  you've come in against... this is my room.

Back out! Back out! Back out! Words don't bother me  man  actions do.
Let's do it. Go for it  dude.
Well  if you come at me  you're gonna fuckin' die!
Go for it.
I ain't going for nothing!

You fuckin' reach for me  and I'm gonna take your arm off!
Come on. Come on!
I ain't coming  you come!
Cool it  Raleigh. You understand that? You got it? Either you cool it or you're out of here  that's the only choice you have.
Try it!
You're gone  dude.
Who's gonna enforce it? Call the cops  motherfucker! Call the cops!
You got witnesses right now?
No witnesses  call the fucking cops! I'll call the fuckin' cops on you  you cocksucker  right now!
Good. Call 'em.
911  just like that  and you will never get out of this!
Good. Come on.
Your girlfriend said so
But I don't really know
That don't mean we fucked around
Was tweakin' by myself one night
That's when I wrote this tune
Didn't have no need for that bed in my hotel room
Feels like I'm right back there again
Sometimes I pray
And I'm right back
Right back where I'm from
Sleepin' by yourself at night can make you feel alone
That don't mean I fuck around
I like to keep that higher ground

Ah  woman hold your man tight
Every day I love him just a little bit more
A little bit more  a little bit more
Every day I love him just a little bit more
And he loves me the same
Every day I love her a just little bit more
A little bit more  a little bit more
Every day I love her just a little bit more
And she loves me the same
Baby  if ya wanna get on
It makes no sense at all
I saw red
One more sacred lover that I shot dead
Every day I wake up just a little bit more
Feelin' like a dog out on the yard  because it's just how we are
And every day I wonder if it's over
You say it's black  but I can't believe you
And if I say it's white  you say I'm trying to deceive you
And baby  I'm aware of the high and the low
And I'd be waiting for you in the middle  but I just lack control

Ah  woman hold your man tight
Not a chill to the weather but a nip to the air
From another direction she was caught in my eye
Might as well try
She had rings on her fingers and bells on her shoes
And I knew without asking she was into the blues
She wore scarlet begonias tucked into her curls
(Like other girls)
It seldom works out the way it does in this song
(Hey)
'Cause once in a while you get shown in the light
In the strangest of places if you look at it right
Because the woman took the lovin' over me
Because I sold up all my personal property
We sold some mushroom tea
We sold some ecstasy
And now I hear the police coming after me
She's got the police coming after me

I had to learn the hard way just to let her pass by
Let her pass by

But I hope her parents love her so
If I got that brain
I made her bleed
And if you never knew that we get old
That every people that's the same thing everyday

What did you do for me?
I made her bleed
But I knew we could make it
I hope her parents love her so
If he had to go
I know I'm barely lovin' my holy bleed
You never knew punishment's what he needs
Always leaves me waiting by the phone
She told me more than once to take it slow
And I said okay
But lately I've been sleeping all alone
I'm not breaking up inside
I'm much to proud to moan
I feel a little lucky so I try to play it cool
I think she laughs inside
With the words that burn like fire in my mouth
Try to be a man like I got the master plan
Night out on the town
Drink and dance and we can turn it out
I just don't know
Maybe it's just the way you move so slow
Hello?
Click
Ask me why I play myself
Play myself for a fool
Swear I would do most anything
Walk a mile to see her smile
Walk a mile just to rock for a while
Now I just don't know
Maybe just the way you move so slow
Maybe 'cuz you move so slow
Maybe 'cuz you move so slow
But sitting on the verge of tears does not become my 22 years
You took my shame and you took my pride
And now you gonna take me for a slowride
Got the words that burn like fire in my mouth
Come on down reggae style
Wind up your body like a bass line wild
Drink and dance and we can turn it out
Maybe 'cuz you move so slow
Maybe 'cuz you move so slow
Maybe 'cuz you move so slow
Like love
Move nice and low
Slowride

I smoke two joints in the morning
I smoke two joints at night
I smoke two joints in the afternoon  it makes me feel alright
I smoke two joints in time of peace  and two in time of war
I smoke two joints before I smoke two joints
And then I smoke two more
Smoke cigarettes 'til the day she dies!
Toke a big spliff of some good sinsemilla

Their minds weren't all the same
To conquer was their goal
And he slaughtered his own kind
He died a confused man
Killed himself with his own mind

Clock says half past one
I have no sunglasses
As I step into the sun
There's no recollection
Of the evil things I've done
It feels like I musta had some fun
*Sniff-sniff*
What happened?
Last thing I remember
I was chillin' at a party
Pinchin' girlies' asses
I was drinkin' recklessly
I know I did something
Woke up in the morning
And all my friends hate me

Pissed in someone's drink

Early in the mornin'  risin' to the street
Light me up that cigarette and I'll strap shoes on my feet
Got to find the reason  reason things went wrong
Got to find the reason why my money's all gone
I got a dalmatian and I can still get high
I can play the guitar like a motherfuckin' riot
'Cause you might get run over or you might get shot
Never start no static  I just get it off my chest
Never had to battle with no bulletproof vest
Take a small example  take a ti-ti-ti-tip from me
Take all of your money  give it all to charity-ty-ty-ty
Love is what I got  it's within my reach
And the Sublime style's still straight from Long Beach
It all comes back to you  you're bound to get what you deserve
Try and test that  you're bound to get served
Love's what I got  don't start a riot
You'll feel it when the dance gets hot
Lovin' is what I got
I said  remember that
Lovin' is what I got

We're not that far off
So  that's
See  but
Nobody ever told her it's the wrong way
Don't be afraid with the quickness you get laid
For your family  get paid  it's the wrong way
I gave her all that I had to give
I'm gonna make it hard to live
Salty tears running down to her chin
And it ruins up her makeup and never wan' give
A cigarette pressed between her lips
But I'm staring at her tits  it's the wrong way
Strong if I can  but I am only a man
So I take her to the can  it's the wrong way
The only family that she's ever had
Is her seven horny brothers and a drunk-ass dad
He needed money  so he put her on the street
Everything was going fine  until the day she met me
Happy are you sad  wanna shoot your dad?
I'll do anything I can  the wrong way
We talk all night  tried to make it right
Believe me  shit was tight  it was the wrong way

But I'm gonna make it hard to live
Big  salty tears rolling down to her chin
And it smears up her makeup an' never wan' give
So  we ran away and I'm sorry when I say
That straight to this very day it was the wrong way
She did the hike  don't matter if I like it  or not
Because she only wants the wrong way
I gave her all that I had to give
She still wouldn't take it  whoa  no
Her two brown eyes are leaking like a sieve"
