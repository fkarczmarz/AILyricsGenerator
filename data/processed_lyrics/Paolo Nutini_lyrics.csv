lyrics
"Other people wanna try you girl
And I hope you tell them where to go
And some people wanna speed it up
I wanna get myself dressed up
And take you out on the town
I wanna get ten out of ten
I wanna get ten out of ten
Their own versions of a good idea
But the best one I can think of now
Is to make sure that I keep you near
And I know that I've got to keep it up
'Cause I can see you're feeling down
And take you out on the town
I wanna get ten out of ten
I wanna get ten out of ten
Get an A in the taxi
A in the restaurant
And get ten out of ten
Get an A in the kitchen
And an A in the bedroom
And get ten out of ten
And turn it into something
And give it to you all for free
With far too much time
Lost a lot of my rhythm
In this bubble of mine
I would sure like to help you
I will give you my word
Float away like a bird
You don't get much dignity
You don't get much sense of pride
When your mind gets too narrow
And your nose gets too wide
I breathe and I'm tryin'
In my cauldron tonight
Though a part of me's dyin'
There's a part come alive
'Cause I had a dream last night
That you were beside me
Two kids in the garden
And your love behind me
Though today may tastе bitter
Maybe tomorrow is gold
Bеfore I get old

So I took out some paper
And I dug out a pen
Poured myself out some water
And I rinsed out the gin
I spoke of my dream that night
In the greatest detail
Of my beautiful children
And my sweet Abigail
Before I can let her in
Before no sweet happy endin'
Let the battle begin
Let the trumpets blow Valhalla
Let the soldier arise
When I fall from the skies
'Cause I had a dream last night
That you were beside me
Two kids in the garden
And all this behind me
Though today may taste bitter
Maybe tomorrow is gold
Before I get old
Before I get old

 and I looked

 the memories are melting on the broken flowers and the cicadas sang the chorus

Babe
You know
Baby
Ooh
Mmm
You know
What I want
Amid the chaos of that day
When all I could hear was the thunder of gunshots
And all I could smell was the violence in the air (You know that I want you)
I look back and I'm amazed
That my thoughts were so clear and true
That three words went through my mind endlessly
Repeating themselves like a broken record
You're so cool
You're so cool
You're so cool
You're so cool (Would you look at that?)
You're so cool

I got your call on a red telephone
I was laid out still beside the ashtray
Trying to save a memory of you and mе in a better time
Carnage in good night despair
A deep dive into an open mind
On the lost highway of the caustic night
When we held each other's hand
And then afterneath a neon motel light
You said
Let's knock 'em all down
So I kissed your lips
This will be the end
This will be the end
This will be the end
You're so cool
You're so cool
You're so cool
You're so cool

Coming home again to see a girl thats prettier than a diamond shining in the sun
Oh what fun
I wonder if she's been naked in her room since I've been gone
I wonder if she's said to them as she said to me before
And I wonder if she's been pressed against an unfamiliar wall
And said to all those men as she has said to me before

Arriving at the door just to be told the girl I'm missing's been in London for a while
No more northern skies for her
An' they say she's left a letter up the stairs for everyone
It's pinned against her bedroom door for all the world to see an' it says
And I guess it's true
However much she loves me I will always love her more
Part II
I have returned to the Northern skies
Where the summer had not touched the clouds that pass above
Of the days too early to come and too early to stay
And I have left a million stars
And I have left the warmth of the sun
And a million adventures not yet begun
The great sense of passing through
The great sense of passing through
The great sense of passing... through
Under these white Northern skies
And I felt the green was blacker and the blue was darker still
My roots are lying deeper than I ever think they will again
Heartache and poetry
Under these Northern skies
The great sense of passing through
The great sense of passing through
The great sense of passing... through
Part III / Hidden Track: Last Request Acoustic Reprise
Remember it's just you and me
Remember how this used to be
I just want you closer
Is that alright?
Grant my last request and just let me hold you
Don't shrug your shoulders
Lay down beside me
Sure I can accept that we're going nowhere
But one last time let's go there
To wander down that one-way road
And I'm no wiser than the fool that I was before
I just want you closer
Is that alright?
Grant my last request and just let me hold you
Don't shrug your shoulders
Lay down beside me
Sure I can accept that we're going nowhere
But one last time let's go there
Lay down beside me
Grant my last request and just let me hold you
Lay down beside me
And sure I can accept that we're going nowhere
But one last time let's go there

Don't shrug your shoulders
Lay down beside me
And sure I can accept that we're going nowhere
But one last time let's go there
Lay down beside...
Hungry hands turning soft and old
My hero cried as we stood out there in the cold
And I hear him singing while he sits there in his chair
While these autumn leaves float around everywhere
And I look at you
And I see me
Making noise so restlessly
But now it's quiet
And I can hear you saying
My little fish don't cry
My little fish don't cry
Autumn leaves have faded now
'Cause you still live on in my father's eyes
She thinks the way I think
That girl makes me wanna be better
Took her down Bleecker Street
Saw she drank the way I drink
I kissed the sky to send  the blue a letter
That girl makes me wanna be a better man
Gonna treat her like a real man can
Oh she is a real live wire
And that girl
She's got me feeling so much better
Oh you'd trade all the money in the world
Just to see this girl smile
All the while
She'll make you feel so much better
Oh make me feel alright
Oh make me feel alright

But the reflection in your eyes
Gonna look so much better
In these last few days  I've been afraid that I might drift away
So I've been tellin' old stories  singing old songs
That made me think about where I came from
That's the reason why I seem so far away today
Let me tell you that I love you and I think about you all the time
Caledonia you're callin' me and now I'm going home
And if I should become a stranger
You know that it would make me more than sad

Well I've been moved  and I've kept on movin'
And I've proved the points that I needed proovin'
And I've Lost the friends I needed loosin' found others on the way
And I have kissed the ladies and left some cryin'

Although not the most honest means of travel
It gets me there nonetheless
And a helpless one at best
I'll even wash your clothes
Just give me some candy before I go
And lay you down on your rug
Just give me some candy after my hug
But to her it plays out all the same
And although I'm left defeated
It gets held against my name

All the cutthroats and their jagged ends
All of them have got me waiting and waiting
All the cheap and the sugary philosophies
Have got me on the fence just waiting and waiting
All the angels and their halos

And even angels can get caught in the end
With their halos round their ankles
Must be something in the water
Part time lovin' on the primitive scale
Both trying to come together
You see me down on easy street
Just trying to find my feet
Feels like I'm doing all the same old shit
Over a different beat
Let us go somewhere
Where all the dogs can't see
Alone and alive
My little cherry blossom

And all the rest seems circumstantial
Scattered cross a less predictable stage

All has been forgiven
For the first and the last time  it will all be alright
To this point we have been driven
They drink their brandy and they smoke their cigars
While their old friends scream out their names
And she says:
We are all just children of the stars

You are not to blame
No-no  no-no

In you
Do you believe in passion and romance?
Needing to be within us and around us
No innocence or compromise
The only way she knows
When the soul's in flight
You set your body free
And under your lightning glistens
In all it's fantasies
And there's a shiver of velvet tension
From an astralised dimension
Emanating beneath our liberty
While for some love is whips and chains
And perpetual parlour games
She said she wants the loneliness to go
Ah ha ha
But she won't give up for nothing

And there's no rich teas or custard creams
Just cigarettes and skins
And then he handed me a bag of green
The biggest bag I've ever seen
And I rolled my first funky cigarette
And since that day I seldom have declined
And I maintain this love affair
With these green herbs of mine
You can keep your pills and trips and lines
Expensive beers and fancy wines

And nowadays it's harder to disguise
That wondering old sedated look
That glares across my eyes
That you don't really seem to mind

Yours looked exactly like the photograph
I don't always get the way you feel
But now I've learned to live with that
It's like I'm a part of something real
And the sun sets the scene
While the rain misses me
Head's all fuzzy  laid there like a loaded gun
I'm a helpless romantic  I could just dream the day away
Alone and nostalgic  dreaming of yesterday
Heart filled up  I can't wait to see your face
Heart filled up  I can't wait to see your face

Give me something to believe
Gime me something to believe
I've got lucky in life I've had plenty to eat and
I saw this world as one big pool of opportunity
But there's too much mind corruption
Too little remedy (or that's how it seems to me)
Yeah we need a moral education to
Set the young minds free...
So let us change what we can and
Accept what we can't
Impart some of the wisdom
From that tried and tested man
There'no harm in being wrong you know no
So take that feather from you cap sir
And pass that feather around...
My hopes are high but my eyes can't
Believe what they see
Give me something to believe in
Gime me something to believe
My hopes are high but my eyes can't
Believe what they see
My hopes are high
Give me something
Living for the city
But the flames couldn’t go much higher
We find Gods and religions
To paint us with salvation
Over hate
Through this iron sky that’s fast becoming our mind
Over fear and into freedom
That’s dripping down the walls
Of a dream that cannot breathe
In this harsh reality
Mass confusion spoon fed to the blind
Serves now to define our cold society

I sit around and wonder
About the fire in your eyes
The movement of your fingers
The way you slowly complicate my life
How the time we spent together
Was what led to our demise
And how we never can say never
But I struggle just to make it through most nights
But please never change  never change girl
Could it be January 'cause it feels so cold without you here

That are more adequate in the age department
I did not think you cared
There'd be no problems here

And when you're loving me  I'm loving you and that's when we've got it goin' on
Oh going on and I was so distracted I was lost and abandoned
Ay  and I needed another home and you flew in my arms
You just flew right into my arms
And when you're loving me  I'm loving you
And I love the prowess in the things that you do

On and on
On
It's your flawless soul that bleeds my stone
It's the last thing I hear at night
And the first thing in the morning
And as I let it start to burn my head
You slowly creep into bed
And I'm done with all the talking
You say you know how I'm feeling
I just need to try to settle down
Though a million faces pass my way
Oh  they're all the same
Nothing seems to change anytime I look around
Though who knows just what the future holds
All I want to know is if it's with you
Tired as hell and falling up the stairs
Filled with a thousand cares
As you walk out from the bedroom
And though it feels like all my fire has gone
Girl  you just turn me on
Can't believe how much I want you

I'm looking tired and feeling quite sick
I felt like there was something missing in my day to day life
So I quickly opened the wardrobe
Pulled out some jeans and a t-shirt that seemed clean
Topped it off with a pair of old shoes that were ripped around the seams
And I thought these shoes just don't suit me
And suddenly everything is right
Slowly strolling in the sweet sunshine
And I'm running late and I don't need an excuse
'Cause I'm wearing my brand new shoes
Woke up late one Thursday
And I'm seeing stars as I'm rubbing my eyes
And I felt like there were two days missing as I focused on the time
Then I made my way to the kitchen
But I had to stop from the shock of what I found
The room full of all o' my friends all dancing round and round

My frustration
Like five rapid to the gut it's not so easy to see.
To expect you not to change even a little bit
And I guess I hope I'm still the kind of guy
You're needing for your fool.
Cause life's a ball here on the road and these four wheels
Oh but something about the whole thing
It doesn't feel real
Work my days for you
I need you
And I can't see no other way
Darlin'
I work my days for you

It really gets you thinking
And all those used up clichés
Well they've worn enough in the wind
Or if you thank him for his time and just never call again

And after all the lights and shows and long hope lanes
It'd be you and me again

I'm home
So love me
And I'm home babe
Oh so touch me

Cause you bet

That I'll do it to you
I want you babe
So take me in your arms
Love me like you do
Oh kiss me like you do
And baby you bet I'll do it for you
Oh no
If the cement don't stick
But I've been told
That it only gets harder from there!
I don't second guess too much
Shed my ties and I'm not that wise
I'm all grown up as such
But all the talk about the ring and the baby
Gets me every time
Building a house so we can fall at the first brick
If the cement don't stick
But I've been told
That it only gets harder from there!
That I don't know just how good I get it
That it's plenty of men out there with money and muscle
What we left within the end?
If the cement don't stick
But I've been told
That it only gets harder from there!
I'm only trying to keep my head above the water
If the cement don't stick
But I've been told

Ooh
Ooh
To the back of my mind
I recognized what you mean to me
And though the corners of our picture
Are a long time frayed
They still symbolise what you mean to me
You ask me to remember
A kiss is but a kiss
That I'd be a fool to want more from you
And I'm gone in a while
I'll be gone in a while
I'll be gone in a while
It's all that I do
Till the rain turns black
The devil moon clings to us
Sometimes it feels that it's all I've gotten
It's all that's real

I got money in the meter
And a two bar heater
Oh now it's getting hotter

We leave ourselves a lot to answer for
I've left myself and now I wanna go home
And up there in your treehouse
Pigs and politicians go bump in the night
It'll take more than a superman (Oh)
To make us think that everything's alright
And there's nothin' on the radio
They're all talkin' like they're fallin' in love
And then it hits me like a fist from above
I'm singin'
We half-remember all the promises we make
But they're like white noise to us now
These days are written on our face
And in the faith that we can change the script tonight

Woah
Lips like they've been singing sexed up strawberry songs
(Just funk my life up)
With a shotgun in her hand
(Funk my life up)
(Just funk my life up)
Beats are dripping on me like spider milk
And I never heard the warning when I woke up in the morning
With my sunshine on a drip
Makes you wanna scream hallelujah
How could I refuse? I'm not fit to choose
(Just funk my life up)
Said the only way I win is the way I lose
(Just funk my life up)
Got a little bit wet up in my brain
And in the climax she would scream with me
So I pour it over her like gasoline
Light a match and then I'm back in my teens
Me and super girl smoking my green
Me and super girl smoking my green
And the girl so fine makes you wanna scream hallelujah
Hallelujah
Someone other from the lost and found
You're dancing with the Devil with your long dark hair
How are you? Let's dance like there's no one here
You say you want a lover and you need them now
You're dancing with the Devil with your perfect smile

Then you'll get a lot more done
Be more inclined to take the reins
Than turn away and run
It's very rare it seems to get a lifetime guarantee
So I suppose self satisfaction be the key
But his wealth does not consist of riches or acres of land
Instead he has a family who are
His biggest fans
That's something that I one day hope to have
So I'll cherish the simple things
The easy took for granted things
Like going round my Mum's house for my tea
And argue with my sister
Only God knows how I missed her
It's the simple things that mean the most to me
Starts the car and makes the drive
Serves out food to all the buyers in the town
As they stand there in the same old line
Get there every day at the same old time
Cause they're the people in the line that he built it on
And like me he cherished the simple things
The easy took for granted
Things like going round his Mum's house for his tea
And argue with his sister
Only God knows how he missed her
A chick came walking through the door
That I had never seen before
At least I never saw her down at Smokey Joe's Cafe
And I started shaking when she sat right down next to me
Her knees were almost touching mine at Smokey Joe's Cafe
A chill was running down my spine at Smokey Joe's Cafe
And I could smell her sweet perfume
She smiled at me and my heart went boom
And everybody in the room at Smokey Joe's Cafe
And from behind the counter I saw a man
A chef's hat on his head and a knife in his hand
He grabbed me by the collar and began to shout
Oh  I know I'll never eat again at Smokey Joe's Cafe
And so we'll never meet again at Smokey Joe's Cafe
And I'd rather eat my chips and beans at Jim's or Jack's or John's or Gene's
Than take my chances eating down at Smokey Joe's Cafe
Or confined or even met eye to eye
Just there to be explored and then all the while adored
Someone like you was so beautifully designed
From the hands all the way to the mind
Just there to be explored and then all the while adored
For I cannot complain
And the riot at the sunset
Paints the colour of the rain
I built my days on consequence
And now nothing's ringing true
It always clears my thoughts
Like the saints become the sinners
The haves become the nots
Have I shown you enough of me?
You know yourself can be so hard to be
I need you
I need you
I need you
Like a pair of blinded birds
Don't spill me or leave me alone in your tree
Never thought it would look like this
A plane so happy and kind (oh)
No place that I'd rather be
Lost in your resplendency
When you cannot find peace of mind
And when you get lost in control
Know that there's somewhere to go
When you cannot find peace of mind
In the valley
We got so cavalier
Replaying mistakes and revoking our fears
Never thought I would feel like this
Though I cannot deny I try

Go slow
We don't need anymore
Go slow
Where it takes you 'bout an hour just to cross the road
Just to stumble across another poor old soul
From the dreary old lanes to the high-street madness
I fight with my brain to believe my eyes
And it's harder than you think to delay this sadness
That creeps up my spine and haunts me through the night
Life is good and the girls are gorgeous
Suddenly the air smells much greener now
And I'm wondering around with a half pack of cigarettes
Searching for the change that I've lost somehow
These streets have too many names for me
I'm used to Glen Field road and spending my time down in Orchy
I'll get used to this eventually I know  I know
Where'd the days go when all we did was play?
And the stress that we were under wasn't stress at all
Just a run and a jump into a harmless fall
From walking by a high-rise to a landmark square
You see millions of people with millions of cares
And I struggle to the train to make my way home
I look at the people as they sit there alone

And we can see life hand in hand
Oh how our glory may fade
Oh you took me from my bubble knowing my defense was weak
And you sat there and you listened anytime I chose to speak
No fear only a hero can defeat these demons now
And oh how our glory may fade
And as time shall inevitably move on
And it rests with your eyes
Please don't fade and please don't cry
'Cause it's all white lies
Grab too much and lose it all
Now I've lost my disguise
It was all white lies
An' hide with me
Hide
Would it help if I tried
Or has it sailed and passed me by?
First love grows and then it dies
And its all white lies

 the one who can make you
 I'll promise that I'll never change
 but I'll still say the same
 your old weathered tradition
 or miss me
 or risk me
