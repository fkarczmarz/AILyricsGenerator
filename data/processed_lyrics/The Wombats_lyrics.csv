lyrics
"I knew of no downfalls
Though war was breaking out all around me
My concerns were with prank calls
Right in front of the older kids
Wasn't scarred by the modern itch
'Cause now it feels like
We kiss with one eye on our TV set
Needing fairground rides just to spark a smile
There's little here to miss
We were cloning sheep in the 1990s
We were building telescopes
And sugar filled the whole of my body
As I urged it on to grow

Just to impress the older kids
Wasn't lost in the modern glitch
'Cause now it feels like
We kiss with one eye on our TV set
Needing fairground rides just to spark a smile
There's little here to miss
I'm not cut out for the modern life
I'll never beat those teenage kicks
I'll never beat those teenage kicks
I'll never beat those teenage kicks
Bring back 1996
The one you never shut up about
I heard you got that job  and the extra pay works well for you
Are you getting high and not coming down?
I need  to decipher the differences between
What I'll always want and what I'll never need
I don't need your
I don't need your swinging moods
Your Twenty-first Century blues
I want hugs not your scissor kicks
I don't need your
Your broken plans or your panda eyes
Your help to improve my social life
If my head's in the clouds  in the clouds I'll live
In the clouds I'll live
They say you've found some one with style to match their charm and wit
But are you having sex in the morning sun?
And is your head screwed tight or has success began to loosen it?
Is the tip of the iceberg that much fun?

I don't need your
Your broken plans or your panda eyes
Your help to improve my social life
If my head's in the clouds  in the clouds I'll live
If my head's in the clouds  then in the clouds I'll live
And I don't need your swinging moods
Your Twenty-first Century blues
And if nothing comes. then nothing has to leave
If my head's in the clouds  in the clouds I wanna be
I don't need your love
To be your anti-depressant
As any decongestants
We kick back and let the pills do the talking
People hear a distinct rattle when we're walking
Then there's the extra two stone
That's our only guarantee
Our vivid dreams are just like big production movies
They get entangled well within our daily routines
So please rethink
Or use my trademark strategy
And please allow me
To be your anti-depressant
As any decongestants

It's hard to smile when you're as flattened as a panc-c-cake
The only tears come from our heads when we concentrate
Perhaps I'm being unjust
Or perhaps you agree?
I needed more than what was in those forty milligrams
So cast away with the doctor's plans
And please allow me
To be your anti-depressant
As any decongestants
Although I felt as grim as the Reaper Man
In different towns but in similar ways
Tonight we'll scratch each other's face
If it's in the moment no one complains
I've tried my best to move along
Kiss me with your fist  it's alright
Wrap your hands around my throat  I won't mind
I just want to be your shadow
Just one more up-tempo tune
The suits don't care if their feet aren't blue
Are you aware of what's going on
Those machine gun eyes
Have fired crystals into me
You're such a violent high

Kiss me with your fist  it's alright

The sum of your broken parts
And I just want to be
I just want to be your shadow...
Kiss me with your fist  it's alright
Wrap your hands around my throat  I won't mind
I just want to be your shadow
I just want to be your shadow
And fishing with dynamite
I thought that I was in the green
But it turns red every time
You drive me crazier than a wingless bee
You drive me crazier than I ought to be
I'm going out but I'm not coming back
Hit by a lightning bolt
Now there's tire marks on the street
I think I quite like this tune
But couldn't you find a bigger beat
You drive me crazier than a wingless bee
You drive me crazier than I wanna be
I'm going out but I'm not coming back
I'm not coming back
I don't know where I fit anymore
I snapped the key when I tried to lock the door
The canyons are up in flame
And England's misspelt my name
I don't know where I fit anymore

Quick out the gates but slow out the pack  oh
I took the fish out of the sea
Burnt down our house and asked the queen around for tea
I wanna stay here but the time slips away from me
Black flamingo  black flamingo
Up with the drawbridge  but down the hatch
The thoughts I juggle are made out of glass  oh
Always a pleasure  never a chore
We break our legs and then hit the dancefloor
And it takes it out of me
Wherever I go  there I am indefinitely
We took a backflip and we landed on our teeth

I can't think straight and my mouth is numb
Don't shut your eyes till we fade to black
Cause maybe this time the good stuff could last
You won me over
My orange cola got black flamingos crying for ya
Well I'll see you later
I could be your faker
My hands shake like jellyfish when you're near
I cut off my head and my cheetah tongue
I can't think straight and my mouth is numb
Don't shut your eyes till we fade to black
Cause maybe this time the good stuff could last
Stumbling through Chinatown
Somewhere between Chinatown and here
I cut off my head and my cheetah tongue

Than you in your underwear removing mine
And I've never felt this good

When the paintings I paint start to leap out their frames

 we were made out of sunshine

 we were made out of stars
With your tongue abseiling down my neck
It's a bullet-proof offer and I can't accept
It's tough to maintain focus  baby
Now all my elephants are in the room
We crave the fiction when we need the truth
You need to find a different boy's heart to
Chew
Chew
And all these emoticons and words
Try to make it better  but they only make it worse
It's tough to feign indifference  baby
Now I'm spending all the money I have
Trying to impress you is kinda driving me mad
And I don't blame the pressure or the vultures in the sky
I blame what happens every time we're under neon lights
We crave attention in a room with a view
You need to find a different boy's heart to
Chew

But I like it here so much I might stay
The edge of nowhere's such a beautiful place
I jumped up and I grabbed the coin
I drowned out the noise
There's no room for mistakes out here
Everybody wants to be the man
The singer of the band
Sometimes I go to sleep in my bed
Everything I love is going to die
So baby keep your big mouth shut and stop wasting my time
Icarus was my best friend
So I'm gonna make him proud in the end
Everything I love is going to die
Is going to die
There's no еxperimenting herе
No threesomes like we talked about
When we were blacking out
And we spent most of it kissing teeth
Locked in a quarantine

Then the moment starts to pass
And I start reverting back
Swap my happiness for cheques
Sell my spine to save my neck
Everything I love is going to die
So baby keep your big mouth shut and stop wasting my time
Icarus was my best friend
So I'm gonna make him proud in the end
Everything I love is going to die
It's been a rough week
It's been an unproductive month
I swapped contact with reality
For a country house in a bright translucent daydream
Don't you get bored of them giving you nothing?
I only press pause when you press play in my stomach
How can you waltz through my bloodstream and then never call?
You make me shake like a waveform
You're my work of modern art and I want more
I'll take the punch if you'll sell the kick?
It's been a while since we tripped the light fantastic
I wanna hear guitars and cymbals sing

Flowerball
How can you waltz through my bloodstream and then never call?
You're my work of modern art and I want more
That I like to let excess succeed
But I just need you in that fur coat
With only my necklace on underneath
And I don't care why
This apartment's always cold
London can try
It'll never swallow me whole
And I swear…
Vicodin on Sunday nights
This could be the drug that doesn't bite
Just give me a try

You're running late with half your make-up on
This method acting might pay our bills
But soon enough there'll be a different role to fill
Cars are flipping  I'm in hot pursuit
She hits like ecstasy
Comes up and bangs the sense out of me
The tarot cards say it's not so bad
And the blades rotate  there's just no landing pad
I'm just tired of falling up the Penrose steps
She really wants to make it work and I clearly want to let it start
We'll build a water slide as soon as I get home…

There's a war in here and I need you to take
Take her out of my headspace
Up the ocean road until it runs out of gas

I laugh and I joke but I'm hurt
So all the bright young sparks have got a tune they can hum
But it'll hurt
I'll dance if they ask but it'll hurt
Headspace  I need her out of my headspace
There's a war in here and I need you to take
Take her out of my headspace
Did these 5.5 litres of blood
Have too sour a taste
For your sweet tastebuds?
From the 1970s all dusty and worn
And it hurts
I reflect the light  but it hurts
I used to wrestle with bears and kiss poisonous snakes
I didn't care
They scratch and they'd bite  I didn't care

You put a war zone inside me
Above and below the neck
Above and below the neck
Someone flick a light on
The dark just makes it worse
I'm running out of options and I'm lost for words
Little life wrecker  are you gonna let me know
Or keep showing me the compassion of a talkshow host?
I'm not acting my age here and I'm  growing up too fast
If these streets are paved with gold
I want my money back
'Cause Liverpool feels like a clouded memory
Now the Californian air has wrapped her claws around me
(Headspace  my headspace)
She wrapped her claws around me
No hint of a smile or the usual quirky anecdote
I hope that no one ever leaves
'Cause I don't wanna be alone with me
Not with the things that rush up and down
This infamous spine (Down this infamous spine)
Here comes the love anxiety
Why do you have to wear skirts and heels like that?
I hope that no one ever leaves
'Cause I don't wanna be alone with me
Not with the things that rush up and down
This infamous spine (Down this infamous spine)

Spring in my step  knife in my back
It's just what I'm like  I keep it inside
Pills in my pocket  head in the sky
I only wear black
I moved to LA and it rained every single day
But I don't really care whether its grey skies or blue
We camped at the beach  learned to surf and broke my knees
But I don't really care  they couldn't walk me back to you
Sometimes you win but generally  you lose
Black  I only wear black
Spring in my step  knife in my back

A church with a locked door

Melting like an ice cream in the sun

I only ever did it once in a while
Is this what it feels like to feel like this?
Is this what it feels like to feel like this?
I hear the daffodils are all in bloom
I summon monsters to the door of your hotel

Champagne in an overnight kit

The kind of place you should bring your own UV ray
I'm only here because
I wanna twist the structure of my average day
In the hope that we hit the ground upright
In the hope that we hit the ground upright
What a great achievement it was
To find someone that shared such little self-restraint
I believe in these dirty little wicked games
The climb's too rough just to slide back down again
I'm only here because
I feel the day deserves a truly sordid end
In the hope that we hit the ground upright
In the hope that we hit the ground upright
It's just that life tastes sweeter when it's wrapped in debauchery
Because there's not an ounce of faith in this leap

I can fool myself just like no other person can

I haven't got time for any selfless deeds
There's nothing here that you can break or destroy
Then as I count sheep in my bed
A train of worry bullets through my head
Through all my talk of self-defeat
A fearful bomb ticks underneath
Seems that dream has sent the biggest chill through me
Someone once said I don't have any feelings
I might have nailed the coffin shut with that
As I tend to cry in a room full of laughter
Is the cheese finally sliding off of its cracker? I don't know

There must be some method to the madness

Just one more smile and then I'll go
There must be some method to the madness
Tourist traps and museum food
Saying thanks in a language that's never been used
This could be a holiday or an intersection
There must be some method to the madness
Method to the madness
Just one last smile and then I'll go
There must be some method to the madness

The 17 missed calls and the key you can't find
Desperation does as desperation feels
I'm the alarm that doesn't sound and the cork in your wine
Your snapped heel on the town and all transactions declined
You were the one song that I could not perform
You used to be my shelter from the storm
And its cold out on the West Coast and it's lonely by the sea
And the unemployment's rising and the pigeons never leave
And you said we were forever as you held me to your chest
I was your lump of lead
I'm the speed camera in the tree and the fine you can't pay
The spinning beach ball on your screen and the crap excuse when you're late
You were the only book to ever put me in a trance

No lifeless kisses in my car
No awkward chats to family
No Type A personalities
No same two albums on repeat
Endlessly rolling in the deep
Spending each Friday night at home

I have more fun when I'm alone
And the unemployment's rising and we're still off to Tenerife
Because we know we're not forever
We'll do no more than try our best
We'll be their lump of lead

Words buzz but certainly don’t sink in
The rain hits the tiles on the bathroom floor
Hissing little rattlesnake
All fired up and ultimately afraid
So slam the door
Cos baby when you talk like that
The pain moves from my chest to my lower back
Are we trying to sell the ocean to the sea?
I thought we could communicate
Perhaps do a few things the old fashioned way
Are we trying to sell the ocean to the sea?
I'm praying for a soft exit
Good neighbours who occasionally baby sit
Then double-cross behind the scenes
It needs to stop
Cos baby when you talk like that
The pain moves from my chest to my lower back
Are we trying to sell the ocean to the sea?
I thought we could communicate
Perhaps do a few things the old fashioned way
Are we trying to sell the ocean to the sea?

We don't admit it  but we've never seen eye to eye
And it's not through a lack of trying
It was the perfect disease we had
Something to argue and scream about
Who do I see about contracting it back
And locking it somewhere it can't get ripped out?
It was the perfect disease we had
And in its absence lies a painful fact
We all need someone to drive us mad

I didn't say it  but you never were the honest type
You tried to fabricate a bedtime story
And now I miss those games we had of Jekyll and Hyde
Ever since the day that we parted company
Don't send a helping hand  I need a battering ram
To beat the reasons that I miss you so sorely
I didn't say it  but we never saw eye to eye
Now life is carefree and equally as boring
It was the perfect disease we had
Something to argue and scream about
Who do I see about contracting it back
And locking it somewhere it can't get ripped out?
And in its absence lies a painful fact
We all need someone to drive us mad
I need you in the TV  I need you on the train
I need you every single which way
I need you in the mirrors  I need you in my bed
I need you here to wreck my head
I need you in the TV  I need you on the train
I need you just to stand in my way
I need you in the mirrors  I need you in my bed
It was the perfect disease we had
Something to argue and scream about
Who do I see about contracting it back
And locking it somewhere it can't get ripped out?
Eating sushi all alone
I disappear
Did I put myself here?
Snowflake in a desert
I'm her beacon and fluorescent
Is this real?
What's happening here?
I try to be human
But that never works
I'm lost in a gift shop
With hours to burn
I'm losing my grip here
I'm off the deep end
I wanna come back to me
I wanna come back
I wanna get out of my head
Drinking caffeine till I'm flying like a kite
I'd try anything twice
Frozen thirty-something
Am I here or here for nothing?
I don't mind
And I'm losing my mind

 Patricia
 you are my sunshine
I think I'll sit this one at home
But please go ahead
I don't wanna be
The blinking rabbit to your wildebeest
The jaded lover to his sex machine
You should go ahead
And please give those recycled house tracks my warmest regards
And does he kiss you 'til your lips explode?
And does he take you places I can't afford to go?
Know behind that sugar there's only lies
Another magical Friday night
I wonder what state you're in
In the powder or in the gin?
This one's ending bad

And that's alright and that's okay
If I can write this song I can play that game
And it's all good with me if I know it's all good with you
'Cause getting lost in the middle of the in-between
Is only half as frightening as it first may seem
So do whatever you must and I'll do whatever it must take

You were 9 and I was 10
All I had was a middle part and a pen
Whatever happened to her?
Then it all went downhill
You grew tall  I stayed the same
I guess that that's just puberty
Making us boys all play a losing game
I always found it hard to work
Things through
Those school uniforms made a joke
I'm glad I'm not back in school...

And my body never quite this fat
I'll pay well over the odds
Just to have some teenage abandon back
I hit the ice on the 5th of Jan
And I swear it was an act of fate
But I don't get angry when I'm feeling down
I just take my bubbles to the centre of town
And Schumacher the champagne
Whoever needed good cause to celebrate?
Schumacher the champagne
You might as well be proud of last place
We used to set ourselves on fire
When chemistry was twice a week
And now I pay for it over a counter
Whilst they become fitness freaks
My bad habits are taking over
All the good left inside

Or not at all
I squeeze a little lime into a massive rum
You were my fuse box
You controlled my mood
Oh what bliss it was to have nothing to prove
When all I really needed was sex and question marks
Life was euphoric when we didn't know much
And now I'm a ghost and you have lost your spark
With low hope and little charm
We halved a cigarette and overthink where it went so wrong
You were my Swiss watch
We made our moves on cue
What bliss it was to have something to lose
When all I really needed was sex and question marks
Life was euphoric when we didn't know much
And now I'm a ghost and you've lost your spark

She said I should come over
Though the music's not my type

Before I put up a fight
I didn't queue for an hour to leave straight away
The lasers fill our minds with empty plans
I never knew I was a techno...
We are the 1980s
We are the Detroit lights
I'm in debt to you
But don't feed me plant food
I didn't spend twenty sheets to not cut a shape
The lasers fill our minds with empty plans
I never knew I was a techno fan

Maybe it's the atmosphere
But it's got me seeing stars when I'm with you
Maybe this is all theatrics
Maybe it's very clear
That I'm tripping over your every single move
And there's an animal inside of me
And he's feeding off every word you say
Into a world where romance is just a game
And this awkward feeling is getting in the way
Maybe it's about your future
Maybe it's about your past
Maybe I should do the maths
'Cause on paper I'm way too soft a touch for you
And there's an animal inside of me

Under the weight of your advice
I wear a suitcase
Under each one of my eyes
It takes money and aeroplanes
Where the demons from my past leave me in peace
I'll be animated every night
The grass'll be greener on the other side
And the vampires and wolves won't sink their teeth
I'm sick of dancing with the beast

Watering plastic plants in the hope that they'll grow

The kind of shivering wreck that I adore
I can't offer you a rescue
But I can tell you what I'd do
I'd tell my mother that I love her dearly
And tell my father that I need him back again
And if these words don't drop from your lips
I will be your Freudian slip
And flowers might wilt when we walk past
And self-help might help when it makes us laugh
Only finding questions in answers

Where flashy people flash around
It's extortionate and I don't care
You can taste the pretense in the air
And I wonder what you'll wear tonight
The shiny black dress with the slit at the thigh?
Is it such fantasy that I should think
Someone like you could love a creep like me?
And it makes me wanna cry
My body is a temple of doom
Doomed not to be by your side
I like my job when I do it well
It's freelance work and it pays like hell
But I can get us a place with one bedroom
Who needs a friend when I've got you?
