"Baby  touch me right there
– Right there? You like that?
– Oh shit. Now mama  let's see what mama taste like. Tell me what she taste like
Damn
Sipping on that Henny got me going crazy with two ladies
Looking so good  don't you want to be my baby
You lay it down  don't play around  don't make a sound
Let me see that ass bounce  yeah
And I want you to kiss her  and I want you to kiss her back
Ooh  girl  just move girl  and I want you to move it just like that
Damn baby  you movin' it so good
I like the way you talk  I like the way you move
I like the way you scream  I like the way you do what you do
The way you talk to me  the way you talk
The way you talk to me  the way you talk
– Hello

– I'm fucking you bitch. And she with my bitch. I'm fucking both of them bitches
– Hello? Hello?
Pretty bad bitches making love to my posters
In my Cartiers  two lugged teeth
Threw ice in it  so I feel the breeze
Two thug bitches  thinkin about them G's
Who love the hood  they'll never leave
Four model bitches stay popping E
On that booger sugar  rolling up the trees
Spit hella game in her skinny frame
Versace frames  and her dirty bangs
She fuck her friends  then fuck my friends
And if I die before I wake  I pray that A$AP will be great
My mama good and my girl be late
So there will be another me and the world be straight
Damn that nigga did his thang  he took over and changed the game
His big ass smile  his eyes is chinked
His brown ass skin  he was looking gold
He really lived  God bless his soul

And my Diet Butcher  Vera Wang
Vera Wang slang bitches for their brain
And 40 ounce bounce  thug bitches with the fangs
Who fill the block up with cocaine

I never had a ghostwriter  I'm afraid of Casper

Big bowl of money  I look like big bowl of money
Got a Tommy on the Kawasaki  blowing out an onion

And they drinking on Actavis what a feeling
Momma told me drink water  flush out my kidney
Your bitch a happy camper got an iPhone she a snapper

My Louboutins stomp you out like I'm a Kappa
I’m gonna do my dab like the Heisman
I wanna coach  I’m Quavo O'Ryan
Look at the feds I know that they spying
I'm gonna disappear like I'm the Mayans
Hop in my rocket I bet they can't find me
Fuck all that bullshit and stop with this nonsense
These Benjamins and Jacksons got something in common
All of my niggas about money and violence
Fuck how a nigga gon' feel  I'm just gripping on the steel

The fragrance of a riding soldier (Uh)
ODB was his persona (I've seen a lot of bullshit go down at the park)
I got an uncle and his name Psycho
He had a dance and they scream Go  Psycho
And he got two sisters preggo
He fucked the other one to get one jealo'
And he took both kids to the ghetto-ass park (On the hill  shit'll get really real)
He used to have the braids with the cuts in his body
Most thugged out  kept the hammer with his mami
Grandma had the arthritis pain in her body
Kept the burner in the mattress  so her son don’t catch a body (Come on)
Danced and he danced  smoked crack with his posse
Front flipped through a building window  land in the lobby
He was cut like Bruce Lee  but he didn't know karate
Nobody can stop me  I'm the baddest survivor on this planet
Checked out of the psych ward  I am nothing to manage

No matter what day  you found his ass at the park
Hungry Ham  fuck around and get killed
When he got kicked out of his bitch crib
And he had nowhere to li-zive
Always find his ass on the benches laying at the park
After dark
Just wanna get a couple of things off of my chest
Growing up  you always was buck-wilding with stress
And though I'm older now  I don't know how to forget
I used to wear your Timbs around the house when you left
And if you had an open soda  I would finish the rest
Pretend I'm older  I like the liquor odor you left
Then put your camouflage vest on like I'm holding a TEC
Then point it at the mirror like I'm holding your rep
Through that mirror wasn't me  but it was you I reflect
Wanted to be like you  jail tat on the chest
With the rugged cornrows and a stab on my neck
I'll rob shit like that  you know?
It was a nine to five for me  you know
It was like a hobby to me  I was the gunman
Like I said I had a death wish  I'll rob anybody

And I'm startin' to feel like I'm Tank
Chasin' the commas on commas
Embracing the drama that come with the fame
Put that on my momma  the llama’ll
Hit ya designer and pardon your brain  so stay in ya lane
I bust in her mouth cause she parched
She throwin' it back with an arch
You cuffin' that bitch like a narc

Two birds on my boat  I'ma start
