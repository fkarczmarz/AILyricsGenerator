"Nothing feels like home
I'm so alone
Trying to find my way back home to you
I'm so alone
Nothing feels like home
I'm so alone
Trying to find my way back home to you
I'm so alone
Trying to find my way back home to you
I'm so alone
Trying to find my way back home to you
I'm so alone
Nothing feels like home
I'm so alone
Nothing feels like home
I'm so alone
Trying to find my way back home to you
I'm so alone
Nothing feels like home
I'm so alone
Trying to find my way back home to you

 I know I'm finally free
 I know that I'll never fall
 I find it harder to breathe
 but I know that it's gonna show
 I find it harder to sleep
 I know I'm finally free
Check this out
Phone blown like a tailpipe
Today's schedule airtight
I turn a short day into a long night
See you soon if you got the heart
Meet you outside Rennie Park
Hurry up if it's gettin' dark
We don't say much and that says a lot
Hopped into that old Benz
Drive through where that road ends
Good times with some old friends
I got just the thing if you so tense
She got me stoned as Medusa
Zoned out with a blank stare
I'm lookin' into the future
Put the devil to the side
Got an angel on my shoulder
And I'm like hello
It's good to finally let go
I ain't worried 'bout a thing
I just like to keep it mello

It's like 4 am and I'm bored again
When that 40 end
When that dream team all played out and they hit the bench
Waiting for that one spark
My one hope to catch fire
Light rain through that sunshine
Tryin' to man this old boat
I'm the captain now and it's crunch time
I don't care if I'm gettin' paid
Need the week but I get the day
Wide awake when I need sleep
I'm knee deep but I set the way
Put the devil to the side
Got an angel on my shoulder
And I'm like hello
It's good to finally let go
I ain't worried 'bout a thing
I just like to keep it mellow

I'm at one  and I've been quiet for too long
I found peace in your violence
Can't tell me there's no point in trying
I'm at one  and I've been silent for too long
I've been quiet for too long
I've been quiet for too long
I found peace in your violence
Can't tell me there's no point in trying
'Cause all my life  I've been fighting
Never felt a feeling of comfort
All this time  I've been hiding
And I never had someone to call my own  oh nah
I'm so used to sharing
Love only left me alone
But I'm at one with the silence
I found peace in your violence
Can't tell me there's no point in trying
I'm at one  and I've been quiet for too long
I found peace in your violence
Can't tell me there's no point in trying
I'm at one  and I've been silent for too long
I've been quiet for too long
I've been quiet for too long
I'm in need of a savior  but I'm not asking for favors
My whole life  I've felt like a burden
I think too much  and I hate it
I'm so used to being in the wrong  I'm tired of caring
Loving never gave me a home  so I'll sit here in the silence

I just wanna hear you scream again
Time I spent with you deceiving me
I don't care if you believe in me
I still wonder why you're leaving me
I don't care if you believe me
I still wonder why you teasе me
And if I'm taking this the wrong way
I hope you know that you can tеll me whatever you're thinking
