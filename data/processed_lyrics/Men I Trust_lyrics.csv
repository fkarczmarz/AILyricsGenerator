"I know I
Don’t Own Much
I Know I
Don't Say Much
I know I
Don't Own Much
Known limits shall give away
Fresh apples that won’t decay
Breathing craft and will
Sun pursues eternal extols
Deposed kings and queens
Against new competing machines
Standing marveled… in awe
Massive tides carefully smooth domain(s)
Nature reveals itself to mankind again
Cirrhosis removed from patient men
Who dare… come back flesh and bone
Rising with ease
And it's gradually stretching
In fair daylight view
As cool winds
A quiet journey
Oh I embrace again
Slowed my pace down
(Somatic burden)
I see a wide sphere
A table I thought
Things now look idle
Leaving reserved
Sparsely aware
Of this new lapse
As cool winds
A quiet journey
Oh I embrace again
As cool winds
A quiet journey
Vampire town
No one out
You were there and cold
Didn’t smoke
Made it count
So I thought you could come over mine sometime
Our loneliness now gone
So I thought you could come over mine sometime
Have we ever been old friends?
I didn’t think
Late in time
We’d meet again
You looked a bit old
In this cold
You stood out

So I thought you could come over mine sometime
Our loneliness now gone
So I thought you could come over mine sometime
So I stay here all night
You keep the one with many moons and stars
It’s always for my shoulders
So I stay here till waking hours
Tell me how do you make everything feel a little easier
So I stay here till waking hours
Who could ever be this good to me
I just can’t help but wonder
You put a shirt on the ceiling light
So the room won’t be too bright
You give me time to be what I can be
So I stay here till waking hours
Tell me how do you make everything feel a little easier
So I stay here till waking hours
Who could ever be this good to me
You take away and leave alone
I’m not the one
To shy away and moan
And though I am
A deeply flawed human
I feel the shame
When you lay your eyes on me with pain
It’s not hard to see you’re getting cold
Where I’m proud
Where the scales are plane
And It’s sane
We can play your game
Such a cruel way
To keep you entertained
It’s hard to see who gains
And who plays
I’d rather be the one who got fooled
Than to have my heart cooled

Staring high

Fixing light
Must be ‘live
And I'm breathing
Lost in time
I'm fine
And I'm feeling
And I'm bleeding
I'm not so sure about it...
So many things we don't have...
If you think about it...
Come in here...
No way! Say no more!
I'm not so sure anymore!
“Same”
“We're the same”
“Different times”
Near my bed
Still love you
He’s got you
Do you miss me too?
Yeah
I’m not through
Are you?
“Almost blue”
You feel it too?
She’s not you…
Still love you
I miss you
Do you miss me too?
But I found I'm bound and headed upside down
Billie dressing easy
And I do enjoy the way he tucks me now
Pulley Bee'
Dragging me around
Billie cares to wake me
And I'll bend my knees neatly to its needs
Billie will be tidy
Pulley Bee'
Hauling is your creed
Heels twist in a ballet
You see a lamb who's fast asleep
Please don't go out to stray
Billie by my lips dear
I can almost taste the smoky trail of myrrh
Whispers in my left ear

You see a lamb who's fast asleep
And be true
So that our eyes
Be bound in affection
Aware of our lust
And our shared trust
We can know each other
And hear nature’s words
My dear friend
But let’s not talk this through (I used to)
Cause long words widen gaps between lovers
Until we have each other we’re strangers
I know there’s a reason
We use such curves
Riddles in smiles
Rather than small talk
I know we both want
Things to be done
In a truthful manner
There lies our rest

Let’s not talk this through (I used to)
Cause long words widen gaps between lovers
Until we have each other we’re strangers
I’ve been waiting something new
But it felt true
My heart is true
Curious fish sought distant light 
Shiny trophies caught its sight
I fell to love
I’m fond of love
As if limestone wore my heed
It seemed fair to trust this lead
But it felt true
My heart is true
Blushing means I know too well
Fish meets light from its lone shell
I fell to love
 without you
 hang through
 oh I
 without you
Before heading nearby to quench my thirst
Writers and few musicians among the local drunk
So I dream about C.R.E.A.M. tonight
White flag night
Wicked night
'Cause
I miss October nights in Parc
Miss the corner store small talk
Smoke indoors past four
Come on Jean-Talon
I miss October nights in Parc
Miss the corner store small talk
Smoke indoors past four
Thoughts  like bursts of youth taking me places
Living  the best outcome of myself
‘Cause I do remember where I come from
I’m happy my home found me
By  which force I do not know
I  found my home and it grows by me in beauty
I feel air from another planet akin
Like  a sense of truth that comes from within
A budding sapling reaching through
Giving rise to higher fruit and view
I’m happy my home found me
By  which force I do not know
I found my home and it grows by me in beauty
I’m happy my home found me
By which force I do not know
In love
My heart may be
Laced
Girl
My bird
Tell me stories ‘bout a better place to be
Let yourself free
J'ai cru t'entendre à plein d'endroits
Mais les paroles fuyaient mes pas
C'est le malheur ou bien la chance
Ça n'a plus d'importance
Mais je ne l'ai pas encore trouvé
Cette liberté dont tu m'as tant
My friend
You changed
A while ago
Estranged
Pride stiffens like dough
(You're) closing in your cage
Proud sparrow
Hard to let go
I know
The slows
That break you low
You chase
Small embers that glow
Hunching close by night
Sleep deprived
Hard to let go
The little voice
That told you so
Good fiend
I'll never let go
To watch you wash the rain
How long did I see him stay?
Days or months  I couldn’t say
Yet it bustles me  and what for?
I swear I saw him moan
But my window’s thick and cloudy
And I won’t disdain a sentry’s duty!
Fleeing my home for venture lone!?
Amid the gate  he stares at my door
How long did I see him stay?
Days or months  I couldn’t say
Yet it bustles me  and what for?
That drone haunts me from abroad
A middle tone  a new norm
A safe zone  applauding form
My yard is steep and deep  thank God!
You moan
I saw you moan
You moan
The day we grasp in truth
The nature of mind
In a midway I stand where many stood
Only to come home again
Walking through these streets I know too well
But my thoughts stray away
I dream of my future
Remote from time bounds
Becoming myself without any end
I dream of my future
Remote from time bounds
Becoming myself in truth
I wonder at this light
And bid our clay remain

How could someone not turn insane
Whistling your lifelong song
Solace is your lifelong song
Whistling your lifelong song
Solace is your lifelong song
You fenced yourself from the crowd
Clear metal taste in your mouth
Nights howl
Three times the echoes of my name
Can one man be an island
Whistling your lifеlong song

She would've end just like her son
Bitter man now turned insane
Day his dog took on the train
Had she lost another one
She would've end just like her mom
Dyed the hair to look as young
Inhaled fumes and spoiled a lung
Had she lost another one
Insurance lawyers would have won
Didn’t bother to go deep
I saw the home she's from
No place for one to hum
That pride so dear to some
She learned to overcome
Fate unearned

Our hearts talking low
A fading Morse code
Fierce is nature’s way
Trophies bared up high
Strong men do have firm grips
And though I seize the high-prized advise
Distracted by labor and wraiths
I just can’t set my mind with it
Keeping me away from heap

My life and our true love is all we need
All we need

I don't want to feel a world against our love
I don't want to grow old alone and broken heart
We need

I'll be your candle  burn me upside down
From now on  I won't sleep on my arms
Numb  is how I feel deep inside my soul
Need to feel that I am on the line
I'm sorry that I dragged you down my way
Hon'  I never meant to cheat you out of time
In cold mornings when our sheets are warm
I see a flower with no needles on (So far)
Stung  and there's a bee that gave it all away
Pretty eyes now filled with pain
You just broke a bone
Oh dove
You’re not the one that’s gone
To be ours
Like the trees on our shores
All tweezed
The cliffs eat away at our knees
On my knees
Soon we’ll roam
There’ll be shade oncе more
We’ll stray
Oblivious of boats sailing home
My blood
I owe
I bear
The past
My heirs

A haven for insight
Mind a self-aware thought
In dread cabalist night
I hear a standing rumble
In expansion and contraction
Our mutual awe is subtle
Delicate in higher action
Relax
Are those thoughts sincere?
I Relax
My inner tone is clear
Relax
Are those thoughts sincere?
I Relax
Rare witness of my sphere
Loves I found delightful
Poised in any likely way
Pulses I know are joyful
They never caused dismay

Delicate in higher action
Relax

Say  I hope you understand?
Pierre  you’re my friend
There’s a place you can call home
Those eyes
Tell me something’s odd
You’re there but you’re not here
You understand?
You care
It might not look this way
Couldn’t be less true
You understand
Pierre  you’re not lone
Say  I hope you understand?
Pierre  you’re my friend
There’s a place you still call home
My friend
You have a vivid quill
A gift you need to use
To feel alive
Those hands
Look like crooked roots
Pour them the right stuff
It’s rainy outside  you know
Don’t wanna get cold
Bae  you’re leaving again?
It’s rainy outside  you know
Don’t wanna get cold
“Bye  I’m running late”
Didn’t say where she went
God knows
Bae  you’re running away
Lost in the eye of men
You’re roaming your way
And he waits
While she is so close to home
Warmed up so that she stays
His bae
He told her Bae  the porch is unlocked
Even if no one else
Comes by the front
Now  I sense why the men
Who live in these empty lands
Don’t use them

Singing she moves
By deserted pines
Who stand tall unstirred
Ran out of milk
Wearing her nice shoes
She likes coffee dark
He said Bae  you’re running away
Lost in the eye of men

And he waits
While she is so close
Warmed up so that she stays

“Edelweiss“ 
I  couldn’t catch
Your eyes
“Mama
What  went wrong?
Forgot  why I’m still here
Silent calls”
You  slowly bend over the table
Our sleepless bodies tumbling down
Still watching scenes from 1994
I don’t feel anything at all
Morning 
Red like wine
Got me trapped under
Venetian blinds
One more
Piece of cake
Round and round they go
I’m porcelain

You slowly bend over the table
Our sleepless bodies tumbling down
Still watching scenes from 1994
Retired in some place
Containing its mood
From urging its pace
Shoulders and neck

I breathe
Intone
And I rest…

And then

Fingers clap. Snap!
Add my tepid talk
To the rowdy flock?
I care only to loose
Myself in reserve
If waves around clash
I leave in mild thoughts
And then
I breathe
Intone
And I rest…

I dive through memories that are locked around thee
The dreams that we cherished foremost soar through me
I'll always love you
Forever with you
Reliving youth through
You
Spin in a ring of past
Solace in believing that we will repeat
What might be and what's lost
The thought of the one I loved most brings me heat
I'll always love you
Forever with you
Reliving youth through
You
I'll always love you
Forever with you
Reliving youth through
Is there a meaning to your grief?
Where there is pain you see grace
As if sacrifice was a meaningful end in itself
Your trial and error is error and error
Staying at the end of a hallway
Dozens of doors you never tried to open
Narrow vision  you’re the scapegoat
Try to fix things that have never been broken
You’re self-absorbed
Raving about your cryptic ways
Aren’t willing to change
Old grudges
Hoping for your turn
All the basement stories you heard
Waiting for the world
To bend around you
Staying at the end of a hallway
Dozens of doors you never tried to open
Narrow vision  you’re the scapegoat

Fire
He’d never done that with a lover before
Before
Meanwhile everyone else got lost in quiet
By the river
Seeking for more  of course he found better
He saw them  they saw him
But everyone just kept on going
What he saw was different
He should have gone to bed
But instead he stuck around for the mood
In the shadows he saw four eyes  lit by fire
Fire
He’d never done that with a lover before
Before
He was seeking for more
Either early or too late  it was number seven
And it happened
High like a bird with his beak through the window

They got here unsafe
Winter’s monsters...
...adopted my place
I don’t know how you’ve been
I don’t know who she is but I can tell
She’s ‘got delicate hands
That must dance around you with the grace
Of a free bird
Of a song
Time won’t you ease me?
I wonder if you’re still waiting with
Pride for the sun  for the one
To tell you to go to sleep

Tell me how you loved before
Show me how you smile
Tell me why your hands are cold
Show me how
But then I understand
The friend I’m dreaming of is far away
Show me how you’re proud
Tell me how you reach the moon
My thoughts err away tonight
My heart fell to love again
Show me how
But then I understand
The friend I’m dreaming of is far away
And doesn’t feel my love
Left  me dreaming so long
Hiding  in my sleep
Twenty of your hands left on
Must be something in water
In  this land with no sea
Hoping  time forgot me
‘Cause I can’t hold your love
Only  your full weight on me
Must be something in water
I should go away
Far from the Dashoa
Far  from the same stairs
Your bathroom drawn in fake vanilla smell
Knowing I don’t want better
In this land with no sea
Hoping time forgot me
‘Cause I don’t need your love
Pantry uphill
Curtain child within
Ride through Hyrule fields
Roaming scuffing
Mileage on my bike breezing
The freedom
I enjoyed through flames
I owe it
Mother and bygones
Remember
Days that gave me aim
So I can feel the same
I don’t know about your love
I don’t know about your past
My finite means tune the world to its will
My higher verb is forever fulfilled
If I live old
To see my grey days
My heart will stay true - and forever young
This minute of gold
I won't let it daze
Catching the fleeing moment bid it remain
If I live old
To see my grey days
My heart will stay true - and forever young
This minute of gold
I won't let it daze
Catching the fleeing moment bid it remain
I have these thoughts going on in my head
My hopes are placed in some future ahead
My finite means tune the world to its will
My higher verb is forever fulfilled
I contemplate this immortal outcome
A timeless trace of future times to come
I know I'm more than the span my life
I know I'm more than my own local strife
If I live old
To see my grey days
My heart will stay true - and forever young
This minute of gold
I won't let it daze
Catching the fleeing moment bid it remain
If I live old
To see my grey days
My heart will stay true - and forever young
This minute of gold
I won't let it daze
I’ve been waiting forever
How can you call me with such conviction?
You get yourself out of situations
‘Cause I don’t have the time for indignations
It goes on and on and on
And it goes on and on and on again
It goes on and on and on
And it goes on and on and on again
Can you find just one thing you cherish?
Would you hold me just like you mean it?
Am I the one with much imagination?
Give me one reason
As it gets older
You keep pulling and pushing away
But you never promised me
To be wiser or better

Said men over the news
Doomers far out
Their plea was fair and sound
Oh Mama I love you
Strong like I fear devouts
Who never doubt
Their righteous fervor
Oh how sublime
To marvel at an ugly world from home
They made it to midnight
They know they're right
Awake forever
I see brave men walking hand in hand again
With angels by their sides
Who’ll dare put on a fight?
Happy forever
To make it all in-line
Happy togеther
As folks gather ‘round
Like shadow hounds
Eyes seem unsound
As folks gather ‘round
And please you aloud
And I now believe that no one asked
About your secret past
The pain to match your strength
And I now believe that no one thought
You had a lonely past
The pain and strengths so vast
From mellow seas
To houses on wheels
To slabs in West lands
Hand in hand
From yellow bills
To slabs in West lands
Like bones in your hands
But I see a tree that's standing high among the shrubs
So only one hand may rest its palm upon my cheeks
You might also like
The only one that I'll need
To know why no one asked
About your secret past
The pain to match your strength
And I now believe that no one thought
You had a lonely past
And pain to match your vein
With ease they allow
The flow of my will
And good sake for you
And good sake for you
This is your past
Before you’re born
For you to see
You deserve it
These things I won’t change
They keep me relaxed
It’s always my way
They keep me relaxed"
