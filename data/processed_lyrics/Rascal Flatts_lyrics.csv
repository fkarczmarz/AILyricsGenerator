lyrics
" how your knight in shining armor let you down
 I told you so
 but you gave that up
 are you happy now?
 are you happy now?
 you're gonna  spend some sleepless nights
 baby now you got it
 but you gave that up
Likes coffee with her sugar in the morning
She likes to leave little red lipstick love notes on the mirror
Loves the rain on a tin roof when it's pouring
Doesn't matter what we're listening to
Spinning her around the living room
And I fall apart every time
She puts that beat in my chest
My dreams come alive when I wake up and look in her eyes
She brings me back to life
She's got her feet on the dash
Making up half the words that she's singing
And she takes an hour to pick a  movie out
Five minutes in and she's passing out
And I wouldn't dare wake her up when she's sleeping
You might also like
I'd stay there forever if I could
Doing nothing never felt so good
And I wish that I could stop time
She puts that beat in my chest
My dreams come alive when I wake up and look in her eyes
She brings me back to life
She puts that beat in my chest
She brings me back to life
I don't mean what I say
It's almost like ain't it me that keeps pushing you away
How many nights have you laid here with me feeling like I left?
Waking up in a stranger's bed
Don't know how I got lost
I don't know how to get back
Don't know how you haven't hit the door with your bags all packed
Every morning I hear you pray for the old me
Instead of waking up in a stranger's bed
I'm gonna run straight back to us baby
No more same old someone else
Back to the one you used to love like crazy
When the sun comes around again
You won't be waking up in a stranger's bed
I know I say too little
I don't even remember the last time we touched
Every night it's like you're sleeping with someone you've never met
And waking up in a stranger's bed
I remember the words that you haven't heard for so long
You're not gone yet
You might also like
I'm gonna run straight back to us baby
No more same old someone else
Back to the one you used to love like crazy
When the sun comes around again
You won't be waking up in a stranger's bed
I don't say what I mean
I don't mean what i say
It's almost like it ain't me that keeps pushing you away
I'm gonna run straight back to us baby
No more same old someone else
Back to the one you used to love like crazy
No more same old someone else
Back to the one you used to love like crazy
When the sun comes around again
You won't be waking up in a stranger's bed
In a barbecue joint in Tennessee
When this old boy walked in
And he sat right down next to me
I could tell he'd been through some hard times
'Cause there were tear stains on his old shirt
When you play a country song backwards?
You get your house back
You get your dog back
You get your best friend Jackson back
You get your truck back
You get your hair back
You get your first and second jobs back
Your front porch swing goin' ding-a-ling-a-ling
You get your farm and the barn and the boat and the Harley
That old black cat named Charlie
But that's what you get when you play a country song backwards
It hit me in the face 'cause that's where I'm at
I almost fell flat out on the floor

You get your mind back
Get your nerves back

You get your life back
You get your first real love back
You get the pond and the lawn and the rake and the mower
You go back when life was slower
But that's what you get when you play a country song backwards
Woo
We sat there and talked about how it would be
If we could just rewind it all and go back in T-I-M-E
You get your house back
You get your dog back
You get your best friend Jackson back
You get your truck back
You get your hair back
You get your first and second jobs back
Your front porch swing goin' ding-a-ling-a-ling

You get the pond and the lawn and the bale and the mower
You go back where you don't know her
But that's what you get when you play a country song backwards
When my thoughts get jumbled
When the air and BS get too thick
Can’t take a breath
Without getting sick
I’ve had enough
With this concrete jungle
I drop my truck in drive
I pick up my baby
She jumps in with a kiss and a hey
We exit off that old highway
Sometimes you gotta go
Beyond the pavement
You gotta go deep
Way on back
Cross a few creeks
And a couple little shacks
You gotta get lost
Way on out
Crickets and frogs
Yeah you’re gettin’ close now
And you kick it into four wheel drive
When you run out of road
‘Til you hear a banjo

And a couple little shacks

When you run out of road
‘Til you hear a banjo
‘Til you hear a banjo
Hoping I would find true love
Along the broken road
But I got lost a time or two
Wiped my brow and kept pushing through
I couldn't see how every sign
Pointed straight to you
That every long-lost dream
Led me to where you are
Others who broke my heart
They were like northern stars
Pointing me on my way
Into your loving arms
This much I know is true
That God blessed the broken road
That led me straight to you
I think about the years I spent
Just passing through
I'd like to have the time I lost
And give it back to you
But you just smile and take my hand

Raised my hands up to the Father
Gave it all to him that day
Felt a new wind kiss my face
Could finally see where I was going
It didn't matter where I'd been
I'm not the same man I was then
I got off track
I made mistakes
Back slid my way
Into that place
Where souls get lost
Lines get crossed
And the pain won’t go away
I hit my knees
Now here I stand
There I was
Now here I am
Here I am
Changed
The things I’ve done
I wish that I could take it all back
I just want to tell em’ that

Changed
I'm changed for the better
I'm even starting to forgive myself
I hit my knee
I’m here I stand
There I was
Now here I am
Changed
Yes I am
I’m changed for the better
But I miss you tonight
I can normally push you right out of my heart
But I'm too tired to fight
Yeah the whole thing begins
And I let you sink into my veins
And I feel the pain like it's new
Everything that we were
Everything that you said
Everything that I did and that I couldn't do
Plays through tonight
Tonight your memory burns like a fire
And I can't get over it
I just can't put out this love
I just sit in these flames
And pray that you'll come back
Hope that I'm dreaming
Come wake me up
Turn the TV up loud just to drown out your voice
But I can't forget
I'm down to my last cigarette
While I'm sitting here crying and trying to see
And aren't thinking twice about me and you tonight

I know I should give you up
But I keep hopin' that you'll trip
And fall back in love
Time's not healin' anything
I know that you can't hear me
But baby I need you to save me tonight
Tonight your memory burns like a fire
With every one it grows higher and higher
And I can't get over it
I just can't put out this love
I just sit in these flames
And pray that you'll come back
Hope that I'm dreaming
Come wake me up
Come wake me up
Nearly took the house down with it
Now she's in assisted living
We all knew that day would come
We knew she was too gone to drive
The day she parked on I-65
She didn't know where she was
Its like her mind just quit
It's like someone flipped a switch
A front porch light and a blue Desota
Couple of straws in a Coca-Cola
You can see it all going down
A handsome boy in army green
She'll put you in that town
She takes out his medals
A cigar box of letters
Sits and scatters pictures
Black and whites of days gone by
We started losing her when she lost him
You might also like
Football games and leaves a'crackling
Walking her home in his letter jacket
You can see it all going down
A perfect night on a front porch glider
Saying goodnight for the next three hours
Her tired eyes grow wide and bright
When she talks about that town
While the world is fading all around her
Sharing a sundae at the counter
He's going on and on about her
Bet she's right there right now
Wondering why you even put it on
Wish that you could see what I see when it's gone
I see a dust trail following an old red Nova
A T-shirt hanging off a Dogwood Branch
You don't look a day over fast cars and freedom
I'll just sit right here and let you take me back
On my way to pick you up
You're standing on the front porch looking just like that
Remember that
I see a dust trail following an old red Nova
A T-shirt hanging off a Dogwood Branch
You don't look a day over fast cars and freedom

But I know something is coming
You save me
My time is coming
And I'll find my way out of this longest drought
It's the one thing that's missing
The one thing I'm wishing
It feels like today
Feels like today
You treat life like a picture
But it's not a moment that's frozen in time
So while this storm is breaking
While there's light at the end of the tunnel
Keep running towards it
Soon this dam will break

I miss you so much
And everything about us
Now you're gone
You're still here in my heart  in my tears
Yeah  you sure left your mark
And we were just getting started
It wasn't long enough
It wasn't long enough together
But it was long enough
Yeah  it was long enough to last forever
'Cause this isn't how we planned it
I sit here in a cold room
Prayin'  waitin' on you
To run back through that door
To the way is was before
You left
It wasn't long enough
It wasn't long enough together

Yeah  it was long enough to last forever

Of a courthouse down in Montgomery
Now they want to kick him out of school
And take him off our money
They can take those words off of paper and stone
He ain't the leavin' kind
He'd never walk away
Even from those who dont believe
And wanna leave him behind
He ain't the leavin' kind
She stayed mad at him for a lot of years
For taking her husband
Started losing her faith and thinking that
Her life meant nothin
But when she looks at those kids
She raised all by herself
She knows she had some help
Yeah she knows

He'd never walk away

Woah  woah
Sittin' here stuck in traffic  five o'clock madness
Shoulda took the long way home
Like some Copperfield magic  showed up like a rabbit
Stopped like a runway show
Dark sunglasses
Gonna pull right over
Gotta take my chances
I was hopin' you were lookin' at me  woo
Hey girl  tell me
What you doin' later tonight?
Call me crazy
But I was thinkin' maybe we might
I'll take you downtown  table for two
I keep it laid back  just me and you right now
I'm trippin' over my feet
'Cause the way that you were lookin'
I was hopin' you were lookin' at me

Carved it in an old cottonwood tree
Signed a bunch of high school yearbooks
So they wouldn't forget about me
It wasn't 'til I saw my daddy's name in stone I knew
It ain't a question of if they will
It's how they remember you
Did you stand or did you fall?
Build a bridge or build a wall
Hide your love or give it all
What did you do? What did you do?
Did you make 'em laugh or make 'em cry?
Did you quit or did you try?
Live your dreams or let 'em die?
What did you choose? What did you choose?
When it all comes down
When you're down to your last dollar
Will you give or will you take?
When the stiff wind blows the hardest
Will you bend or will you break? (Will you break?)
It ain't a question of if they will

Tears should be rolling down my cheek
And I don't know why I'm not falling apart
Like I usually do
And how the thought of losing you's not killing me
I feel bad
That I can stand here strong
I can't explain it
Maybe it's just
I've cried so much
I'm tired and I'm numb Baby I hate it
I feel bad that I don't feel bad
I can let myself be angry over wasted time
And sad about just throwing love away
Yeah I almost wish my heart was breaking
But I can't lie
All I want to do is turn the page
I feel Bad
That I can stand here strong
I can't explain it
Maybe it's just

Bet there's nothing but a towel on on you
You sing along with some Timberlake bumping
But he ain't got nothing on you
I don't wanna hear the coffee pouring
It's a little too loud on the highway
I wanna pull back in your driveway
It's way too quiet at my place
I just wanna hear that ringtone
I like it turned up when you're blowing up my phone
Wanna hear you say come on over
'Cause when you tell me to come on over
I like the sound of that
Oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh

 setting the mood
 I just lie there staring
 I can feel the heat
 every time you look at me that way
 any place
 every time
 the more my body aches
 every time you look at me that way
 any place
 every time you look at me that way
 any place
That cuts a path
It breaks your will
It feels like that
You think you're lost
But you're not lost
On your own
You're not alone
I will stand by you
I will help you through
When you've done all you can do
And you can't cope
I will dry your eyes
I will fight your fight
I will hold you tight
And I won't let go
It hurts my heart
To see you cry
I know it's dark
This part of life

To stop the rain

Please have snow and mistletoe
And presents under the tree
Christmas eve will find me
Where the love light gleams
I'll be home for Christmas
If only in my dreams
If only in my dreams
If only in my dreams
I'm dreaming tonight of a place I love
Even more than I usually do
And although I know it's a long road back
I promise you
I'll be home for Christmas
You can count on me
Please have snow and mistletoe
And presents under the tree
Christmas eve will find me
Where the love light gleams
I'll be home for Christmas
If only in my dreams
Finally content with a past I regret
I've found you find strength in your moments of weakness
I've been burdened with blame
Trapped in the past for too long
I'm movin' on
I've lived in this place and I know all the faces
They'll never allow me to change
But I never dreamed home would end up where I don't belong
I'm movin' on
I'm movin' on
At last I can see (At last I can see)
Life has been patiently Waiting for me
And I know
There comes a time in everyone's life
When all you can see are the years passing by (All the years passing by)
And I have made up my mind that those days are gone

I sold what I could
And packed what I couldn't
Stopped to fill up on my way out of town
I had to lose everything to find out
Maybe forgiveness will find me somewhere down this road
I'm movin' on
I'm movin' on
8 seconds before it all sinks in
Put your best face on for the world
Fake another smile and just pretend
But you're just putting off the pain
Nothing's ever really gonna change
Let it take ya right down to your knees
Let it burn to the worst degree
May not be what ya want
But it's what ya need
Sometimes the only way around it
Is to let love do its work
3:28 in the morning
Counting up the spaces between the rain
You're getting used to the rocks at the bottom
Your heart goes numb
But the lonely stays the same
And that's the price you're bound to pay
And there's really nothing anyone can say

Sometimes the only way around it

Ya might just find you're better for it
When ya let go and you learn
Let it take ya right down to your knees
Sometimes the only way around it
Is to let love do its work
7:42 in the morning
When there is one day here and the next day gone
Sometimes you turn your back to the wind
There is a world outside every darkened door
Where blues will not haunt you anymore
Where brave are free and lovers soar
Come ride with me to the distant shore
We won't hesitate
To break down the garden gate
There's not much time left today
Life is a highway
I want to ride it all night long
If you are going my way
I want to drive it all night long
Through all these cities and all these towns
It is in my blood and it is all around
I love you now like I loved you then
This is the road and these are the hands
From Mozambique to those Memphis nights
The Khyber Pass to Vancouver's lights

Yeah  I've got big plans tonight
I been waitin' all day long
It's become an old routine
It's Friday  you know where I'll be
Gonna stop by that old bar when I'm on my way back home
Gonna fill up that old jukebox with all our favorite songs
Order up a couple whiskeys  sit down in our corner booth
Lookin' back is all that I look forward to
Yeah  I know there's a dozen parties
And people say that I should go
But I got a dozen reasons
Why I keep sayin' no
I  I'm pretty busy tonight
Gonna take out your old sweater  get a hit of your sweet perfurme
Got a box of our old pictures I gotta get to flippin' through
Crawl in that empty bed and  and just start dreamin' 'bout you
'Cause lookin' back is all that I look forward to

No  lookin' back is all that I look forward to
Lookin' back is all that I look forward to
Where you like to do your hair
I find it everywhere
It's like you leave your mark so everybody knows I'm yours
And I don't mind at all
When you gotta go
Don't you leave me all alone
Leave your perfume on my pillow and your picture on my phone
Leave the towel on the shower and that empty shampoo bottle
That make-up on the counter
Just don't leave me without leaving a trace
Cause I love what you've done
That smile sure brightens up the room
And those eyes go perfect with the view
All the stars outside the window getting closer just to see
This little piece of heaven leaving lipstick on my cheek
And I don't mind

Hang around
You like to sleep
Your Sunday morning on my couch
Like everything about you
I can't stop thinking about
And I don't mind at all
Don't you leave me all alone
Leave your perfume on my pillow and your picture on my phone
Leave the towel on the shower and that empty shampoo bottle
That make-up on the counter
You can take but you ain't gotta
Just don't leave me without leaving a trace

What you've done with the place

Sometimes it feels like this world's spinning faster
Than it did in the old days
From the strain of a fast pace
Sunday was a day of rest
And we can't slow down (and we can't slow down) 'cause more is less ('cause more is less)
It's all an endless process

Where everything is black and white
Pickin' on the six string
People pass by and you call them by their first name

Went by so fast oh so sweet
Make me wanna remake a memory
Wish I had me a time machine
Oh

Put a cork back into that sweet red wine
Put your midnight hair back up so you can let it fall one more time
Untouch your skin
Unkiss your lips and kiss 'em again

To hear what the doctor will say
She hasn't been well
Since the day that she fell
And flips through an old magazine
'Til the nurse with a smile
Stands at the door
Sarabeth is scared to death
'Cause the doctor just told her the news
Between the red cells and white
Something's not right
But we're gonna take care of you
It's just been approved
It's the strongest there is
And I think we caught it in time
Sarabeth closes her eyes
And she dreams she's dancin'
And her very first love is holding her close
And the soft wind is blowing her hair

Sarabeth closes her eyes
And she dreams she's dancing
And her very first love was holding her close
And the soft wind is blowing her hair
And her daddy ushers him in
'Cause this morning where his hair had been
They go dancin'
Just like a picture with a broken frame
'Cause when push comes to shove
You taste what you're made of
You might bend 'til you break
'Cause it's all you can take
On your knees you look up
Decide you've had enough
Life's like a novel with the end ripped out
The edge of a canyon with only one way down
Take what you're given before it's gone

Where your hopes and dreams and wishes live

Norma Jean  ain't that the song we'd sing in the car?
Checking out the bands on Doheeney Avenue
Yeah  life throws you curves
But you learned to swerve
Me  I swung and I missed and the next thing ya know
I'm reminiscing
Dreaming old dreams  wishing old wishes
Like you would be back again
I wake up in teardrops that fall down like rain
I put on that old song we danced to and then
I head off to my job
Guess not much has changed
Punch the clock  head for home
Check the phone  just in case
Go to bed  dream of you
That's what I'm doing these days
Yeah  that's what I'm doing
Someone told me after college  you ran off to Vegas
You married a rodeo cowboy
Wow  that ain't the girl I knew
Me  I've been a few places
Mostly here and there  once or twice
Still sortin' out life  but I'm doing alright
Yeah  it's good to see you too
And those planes  they don't wait
But if you ever come back around this sleepy old town
Promise me you'll stop in to see an old friend
And until then...

Can't get enough of this everyday love
Each morning the sun shines through my window
Lands on the face of a dream come true
I shuffle to the kitchen for my coffee
And catch up on the front page morning news
Then she walks up behind me
And throws her arms around my neck
Just another normal thing
I've come to expect
Everyday love
Nothing about it too peculiar
Every afternoon I make a phone call
Listen to the voice that warms my heart
I drag myself through a few more hours
Then head on home to try and beat the dark
Her smile will be right there
When I step through that door
And it will be that way tomorrow
Just like every day before

Walked down the road a little sideways
Cracked a brick when you hit the wall
Yeah  you've had a pocketfull of regrets
Pull you down faster than a sunset
Hey  it happens to us all
When the cold  hard rain just won't quit
And you can't see your way out of it
You find your faith that's been lost and shaken
You take back what's been taken
Get on your knees and dig down deep
You can do what you think is impossible
Keep on believing  don't give in
It'll come and make you whole again
It always will  it always does
Love is unstoppable
Love  it can weather any storm
Bring you back to being born  again

So  so you made a lot of mistakes
Walked down the road a little sideways
Eyes on you like a spotlight
Going off of what I know-know
Killing me with what I don't know
But when I get close I feel the cold
Coming on like a storm
Why can't you say if you you feel the same?
Just give me something
'Cause I can't read the thoughts in your head
Every time I turn the corner
I'm feeling like I know less and less
I give you all of my time (Time)
Feeling like what in the world girl
Did I do to make you reclusive?
But I know what the truth is

So baby don't lie (Don't lie)
That don’t bother me
I can take a few tears now and then and just let them out
I’m not afraid to cry every once in a while
Even though goin' on with you gone still upsets me
There are days every now and again I pretend I’m okay
But that’s not what gets me
What hurts the most
Was being so close
And havin' so much to say
And watchin' you walk away
And never knowing
What could've been
And not seein' that love in you
Is what I was tryin’ to do
It’s hard to deal with the pain of losing you everywhere I go
But I’m doin’ It
It’s hard to force that smile when I see our old friends and I’m alone
Still harder
But I know if I could do it over
That I left unspoken

Reachin' for you through
That stormy cloud
Now here we are
Gathered in our little hometown
This can't be the way
You meant to draw a crowd
Was there anything I could've
Said or done
What went wrong and why
You would leave the stage
In the middle of a song
Now in my mind I'll keep you frozen
As a seventeen-year-old
Rounding third to score the winning run
You always played with passion
No matter what the game

You'd shine just like the sun

I hear a mockingbird sing
This old world really ain't that
Bad of a place
And who am I to try to judge or explain
Who told you life wasn't worth the fight
Now you're gone and we cry
Cause it's not like you to walk away
In the middle of a song
Your beautiful song
Have you ever seen me this way
I've been fumbling for words
Through the tears and the hurt and the
Pain
I'm gonna lay it all out
On the line tonight
And I think that it's time
To tell this uphill fight goodbye
Have you ever had to love someone
That just don't feel the same
Trying to make somebody care for you
The way I do
Is like trying to catch the rain
And if love is really forever
I'm a winner at a losing game
I know that baby  you tried
To find me somewhere inside of you
But you know you can't lie
Girl  you can't hide the truth
Sometimes two hearts
Just can't dance to the same beat
So I'll pack up my things
And I'll take what remains of me

In a line in a song I once heard
In a moment on a front porch late one June
In a breath inside a whisper beneath the moon
There it was at the tip of my fingers
There it was on the tip of my tongue
And I let it all slip away
What do I do now that you're gone
And no one else to blame
All I can hear in the silence that remains
Are the words I couldn't say
There's a rain that'll never stop fallin'
There's a wall that I've tried to take down
What I should have said just wouldn't pass my lips
And it's too late now
What do I do now that you're gone
And no one else to blame
All I can hear in the silence that remains
Are the words I couldn't say

What do I do (now that you're gone)
What do I say (no second chance)
And no one else to blame
All I can hear in the silence that remains
A lonely star hangin' in the sky with a wish left on it
And it's yours if you want it
And this wildflower from the neighbor's yard
A real slow dance in the moonlight dark
This hand in my pocket
Cause it's yours if you want it
That's been waitin' on a girl like you
I know it ain't much
But it comes alive with every touch
Every kiss already feels like you own it
Half of this rickety front porch swing
Every word of every song I sing
My jacket when it's cold
You've got a place to lay your head
On the other side of my empty bed
And it's just made for fallin'
And it's yours if you want it
It's yours if you want it

Every blade of grass under our feet

Every kiss already feels like you own it
Baby it's yours if you want it"
