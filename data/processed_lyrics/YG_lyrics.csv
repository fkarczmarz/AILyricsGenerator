lyrics
"Bang my line when you know what’s up
Unnamed Caller: Fo sho  alright
It was 1 in the mornin' and I was up yawnin'
Moms asked where I'm goin'  to the hood if you ain't knowin'
Pops locked up so mama couldn't stop me
I was out the house  ASAP Rocky
And it wasn't cause she couldn't control us
We was her babies  she just wanted to hold us
And we ain't get disciplined  her friend started whisperin'
About how she was a bad mama  mama said fuck 'em then
I was in the streets stylin'  nobody could tell me nothin'
Grandpa or grandma  not my auntie or my favorite cousin
I was buzzin'
Fuckin' all these hoes wearing no condoms  no nothin'
I used to ditch school when the homie had the Chevy
I used to sneak and smoke stress weed
But now I'm rollin' on dubs
Now I'm rollin' on dubs
All these hoes showin' love
All these hoes showin' love

SKKKRRRT  I was on a mission
On a mission to the money  sun down till it sunny
Know my family love me
Ridin' in the car with two niggas and a pistol
This ain't funny  I do it all for the money  hold up
Slowly as I pull up to the donut stand  I already know the plan
Hop out and get on your mans and take what he got
Go through pockets  wallets and socks  dig all the knots
It's a stick-up  phone ring  it's my mama
In the middle of some drama  so I don't pick up
Thinking I gotta get my shit up  I gotta pick my bitch up
Let's hurry up and leave  I feel the police near us
So we left with a thousand dollars cash
It was me and my nigga  so you know I went half
Then shit get real when niggas get greedy
 sittin' in the Wraith
 lifestyle too much for ladies
 hoops my nigga don't make
 damn this beat got bass
 I been on the A
 a nigga need a little space
 that's too much drugs and drank
 a nigga need a little space (uh-huh)
 fuck what you think (fuck you bitch)
 don't come inside my gate
 I can shoot you in your face
 they tell me it ain't safe
 this shit out my range
 damn this beat got bass
 I been on the A
 a nigga need a little space
 that's too much drugs and drank
 a nigga need a little space
 fuck what you think
 that lil' nigga on some cocky shit
 rrah)

Fuck the police  niggas better call the SWAT
I ain't never played with the pot
I was in your house tryin' to find a spot to extend my knots
I went to jail for a flock  came home with a strike
You went to jail as a bitch  came home as a dyke
Nigga  yikes! I don't play that shit
Wifey like SEGA  I don't play that bitch
I’m a real Bompton nigga with a motherfuckin' attitude
Walk up in the spot  you would think that a nigga mad at you
I was on the block chillin'  homies  what's the mission?
Came back in a quickness  hoping there wasn't no witness
And they came back shootin'
My homies went back shootin'
And my homies with the news  so they grabbed that tool
This all started from a day of niggas bicken back being bool

Verse two  the sun come down
You know when the sun come down them guns come out
I used to rob niggas
That's probably why they try to rob my style
And karma is a motherfuckin' biatch
You got your homie in jail  you sniatch
All in the court telling the judge who it is
Like a bitch when you get to the pen  niggas on your wig
Niggas be lurkin'  bitches be slurpin'
Niggas got caught up on them Nextels chirpin'
Did some months in the county  I ain't have no patience
My bitch wouldn't come see me  I was in there masturbatin'
Smoking on a bigarette  eating a bowl of bereal
Niggas on the block selling O's like Cheerios
I got a whole zone right now
Like  what you tryin' to do right now?

“Man you better tear off your sock and use your sock nigga”
“Man I’m trying to be in and out of this mother fucker like real fast this look funny out here”
Couldn't hit it if you niggas had aim
Lames can't call and you a lame
I don't fall in love 'cause I be lovin' hard

Hit the purp then eat that pussy for dessert
It gets worse  just watch when she squirt
I got this bitch who act Sidity
She live in the 60s
Every time she hear I got a new bitch  she says she miss me
Every time we go to Crenshaw Mall  she have a rumble
Got this bitch in the Hoovers  I don't wanna lose her
Ass so fat to measure it  I need a ruler
Got this bad bitch  that go to Northridge
She always wear Gucci  but she can't afford it

She got a buddy named Young JB and now you know the deal
We turnt up in the studio late night
That's why the songs that you hear are comin' real tight
And man shout my nigga Game he just rolled through
Eatin' crab out in Malibu at Nobu
A lot of fools puttin' salt in the game
Until these women get the notion that they runnin' the game
They got money that they jumpin' on the pole to make
But I'm big on the West like I'm big in the South
I'ma crush that ass even if it ain't too big
I would pinky swear but my pinky ring too big

Or maybe it was the nigga that I socked out
I'm about to say fuck it and start squeezing without aiming
I got trust issues if I don't fuck with dude
My body language gon' tell him I don't fuck with you
Having nightmares of me coming for dude
Having a hard time putting together two and two

Hate always comes from up close
But they can't stand me though
Nigga bounced up that motherfuckin' hospital the same night
Who shot me?
After all the wicked shit I did
I knew karma was gon' catch up with a nigga
Some niggas really tried to set me up
I know shit get wicked in the street sometimes
But I guess God has some other plans for me
Give me space  we might rob your shit
Most hated  baby they don't love the clique
I thought they love you when you make it
This some other shit  yeah
Friends and business don't mix  so I'm brotherless

Bitch you sick  ho you trifling
I heard in the ‘hood your pussy be cyclin'
Nobody wifin' your ass
Young nigga got dick  no yak
 fast bitches takin' ho baths
And me and relations don’t last
My nigga Mustard got the benzo my clips got extendos
I’m hangin’ out the window  bangin' out the window
Throw it up chunky — wrists on chunky
I heard the homie fucked and your pussy smell funky
And I ain’t used to what you used to
The only thing in your ear is a Bluetooth
You niggas ain’t blinged-out  20 racks I blow that
5-10-15  I let my niggas hold that
Bitch you broke  shut up
