lyrics
"Got me questioning what I think is important
I can't even lie  think of you when I'm with her
Look me in my eye  tell me that you feel different
Drove two hours just to stay the night with you
Haven't seen you in a year  but I still get you
Hurts to see you laugh 'cause I know I'll fucking miss that
How could I forget that?
You made me feel alive
Forget them other bitches  I will put 'em to the side
Girls in L.A. couldn't be more dry
Now I'm runnin' with you 'round East Lansing
Tito's in your dorm  we're dancing
It's a quarter after three
Sayin' everything we mean
Now I'm on a flight in my feels  thinkin' 'bout you
Hope you know you fire  fuck anyone who doubts you
Life out in Cali has been great  I'm committed
You the only thing that makes me wish things were different
I might fly you out  get your ass on a one-way
If I had it my way
You might also like
Girl  you'd be by my side
Forget them other bitches  I will put 'em to the side
Girls in L.A. couldn't be more dry
Now I'm runnin' with you 'round East Lansing
Tito's in your dorm  we're dancing
It's a quarter after three
Sayin' everything we mean
Maybe I'm stuck in the past  girl
Not willing to let it all go
You can't ignore the fact  baby
You made me feel alive
Fuck them other bitches  I will put 'em to the side
Now I'm runnin' with you 'round East Lansing
Tito's in your dorm  we're dancing
It's a quarter after three
Sayin' everything we mean
For a moment  I was feeling like I had you
Didn't wanna leave  I had to
It's a quarter after three
Maybe I'm cold
Don't get too close
And I hope you don't judge me
All I know is how to be who I am
And if you start to touch me
I hope you know the place where we stand
Don't tell me that you love me
'Cause I won't love back
Don't tell me that you need me
'Cause I don't need that
Don't tell me that you want me
'Cause I'm on my own
So when we finish touching
You might also like
Maybe I'm fine
Maybe I'm not trying
Trying to have nobody else
I'm not
And I hope you don't judge me
All I know is how to be who I am
And if you start to touch me

Don't tell me that you love me
'Cause I won't love back
Don't tell me that you need me
'Cause I don't need that
Don't tell me that you want me
'Cause I'm on my own
So when we finish touching
All alone
All alone

You feel perfect when you on me now
I don't want to leave you now
Guess I gotta go right now
Ten more minutes turn into an hour
Yeah
Wish I could stop the hands of time
And lay right here for life
Tell the truth
They can't love you like I do
And we both know that
So wait until I'm back
Yeah
Overtime
I've been working overtime
And when I'm done with that
I'ma be right back
Lose myself when I'm inside of you

 you were my homie
 I think that you need to hear it
 you way more than your appearance
 damn
 drowned out in the thunder
 I miss your mom and your dad (And your dad)
 ever had a family so that shit was cool
 I felt like one of they own
 wish you lived in my home
 man
 I just want you to know
 I think I'd explode
 go
 drowned out in the thunder
That thing right there
I lose my mind when you say that
Balmain silk slip off your back
You get so impatient
I know you got your cravings
So tell me you didn't tell all of your girlfriends about this (yeah)
Nothing on you when you naked
Except a Cartier bracelet
Silhouette through the shower
Fuck you 24 hours
Sun peeking through the curtains
Know I'm with you when you're hurting
Fuck you 24 hours
In that shit like oh
Fuck you 24 hours

Sun peeking through the curtains
Know I'm with you when you're hurting
Fuck you 24 hours
In that shit like oh
Fuck you 24 hours
In that shit like oh
Nothing on you when you naked
Let's have a toast while we sit and we watch
We lost our minds (Lost it)  we going cray (Cray cray)
We let a racist orange man be the president
Ain't that just fuckin' great? (The fuck  man)
But we just runnin' around  chasin' the lettuce
I bought a Bentley  still feel pathetic
Ice on my wrist  still feel depression
Music my therapy  it's my obsession
Spittin' these bars  handin' out lessons
Don't go to church  but I'm makin' confessions
Fly like a bird  makin' impressions
I got the answers  just give me your questions
We've been caught in the fire
We've lost our desire
We're beaten and blue
I feel like—
And I feel like Steph Curry with the finger roll
And I feel like Aaron Rodgers with the give and go
Hope this click inside your head like a metronome
How many times do the kid gotta rhyme
To let all of you know I'm the truth
Not chasing people's opinion of me
'Cause I really got nothing to prove
Not even ill when I'm makin' these songs
My soul is up in the booth
Found my place  I'll never leave
My generation is the truth (Ayy-Ayy)  yeah
I believe in me and you (Ayy)  yeah
Let me show you what we do
Let me show you what we—

Yeah  and even though it's all your fault
You the one I run to by default
I'm thinking all about the things you said
That shit is on repeat inside my head
Makin' me feel like a fool
Every sacrifice I made for you
For you  yeah
Starting over is hard to do
'Cause starting over is without you
Alright  I can't keep pretending I'm fine
Fine  yeah
Do you think about me?
Can you live without me?
Baby  when they doubt me
Tell me  do you doubt me?
Yeah  and even though this shit is all your fault
Baby  when they call
Silence to 'em all
'Cause all these women wanna see me fall  yeah
They don't know me like you do
Yeah  I'm just an object they can use
I'm not out here playing games
I do this for the music  not the fame
So don't you say that I'm the same
'Cause I'm the only thing that hasn't changed
Or if I have the strength to persevere
Sometimes I feel like I’m somebody else
Who's going mental with they mental health
Sometimes I wonder if I'll die alone
’Cause lonely people tend to have lonely souls
Sometimes I think about a younger me
If he'd be proud of the man he sees
Mama cry every time we on the TV
And you couldn't even dream of the girl that you with
Remember all your idols and the people that we love
We's all doin’

So excuse my insensitivity
How'd you get so out of your mind?
When did this get so out of line?
It's like a child that's in denial
How'd you get so out of your mind?
A world on fire and you couldn't care less
'Til we can't take a breath (Oh no)
And the air in our chest is some air full of death (Oh-oh)

Tell me what is a man supposed to do
With that Gucci black dress
And pearls 'round your neck
Thinking 'bout how they would look upon my floor
So by any little chance
You wanna take a chance
Leave here with me (leave with me)
'Cause you look too fine to be waiting in line
Just to hear the same song a thousand times
The same old pick-up lines
Leave here with me (leave with me)
'Cause you look too good to be misunderstood
'Cause the music is turned up way too loud
Can you hear me now?
 that luxury flow
 but I say what I know
 it's too late for me
 Cali air what I breathe
 so please excuse me
 blame it on the Hennessy
 for me

 I'm covered in that Gucci
 V for Vendetta

 float like a feather
 big moves

They always end up alone
How you supposed to eat  get all that you need
Then leave your homies just the bones?
I said selfish people  girl
Can never keep them by your side

Stopped smokin' weed but I'm takin' a drag

It's like I'm running in place
How you keep staying the same?
And I'm okay with that
I can't fake no more smiles
That shit gon' drive me mad
I'm focused on the future
Don't care 'bout nothin' else
I'm better by myself
I'm better by myself
I don't need no one else
I'm better by myself
Myself
Don't wanna answer questions
Just want your company
It's all good on the surface
Show me what's underneath
I'm not concerned with drama
I left that shit in school
I'm more concerned with commas
Than keeping up with you
Keep that away from me
I put the Heisman up to bad energy
Fake friends to me make my mood go south like Tennessee

Too young to know it hurts
Found love in empty bottles
I guess we'll never learn
Inside you I found faith
I apologize if I say
Anything I do mean
'Cause I've been drinking too much
Faded off the gasoline

Put on for my family
That's on everything
Girl we can do anything
