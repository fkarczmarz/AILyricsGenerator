"Yeah-yeah
Yeah-yeah
All I ever tried to do was help you understand and grow
I wish you would own up to your flaws
And just say that you're wrong when you're wrong
Breathe
I tell mysеlf I'm not that into you
I tell myself I'm not that into you
You're in my head like

Maybe I just wanna leave before they try to leave me first
Maybe I don't wanna need 'em 'til they say they need me first
I know
They say love's a song for fools who are wise enough to sing along
But now it's hard to breathe (Yeah)
I tell myself I'm not that into you
And now it's hard to breathe
You're in my head like
Da-da-da
Are you gon' use me?
I'm tryna (Yeah)
 no
 I'm ready
 though
 I got a dream going
 open flight
 she'd admit that
Just 'cause I don't say anythin' doesn't mean I don't see it
It's funny how they change up quick
It's funny how they act now
It's funny 'cause they ain't on shit
I'm laughin' like lalalalalala
Nanananananananana
Nananananana
It's funny how they act now
And I don't talk to women 'less it's sex these days
I'm on my second presidential Rolex these days
I could chill but I would rather flex these days
You got now but I think that I'm next these days
I passed my test 'cause all I see is checks these days
Say it direct these days with your chest these days
Got some real life monsters on the text these days
I saw the gross but I wonder what you net these days
A few legends but way too many trends these days
Runnin' the game but you won't ever see me sweat these days
I be gettin' everybody's girl wet these days

150 on me casually
Hope they see the truth is what I tell myself
No one felt me until I felt myself
These poppin' girls got way too many rapper bodies
I can't wife a girl who's fucked half of my colleagues
This is for every dude that hates me
'Cause women wanna date me
I'm like the Yankees
I swear lately I been tryna wrap my head around this life
Your first and last name don't mean shit
So I got women that I only know by zip code

I gotta room up in the city we can play finish the bottle
Cause ain't nobody takin' my baby
Cause ain't nobody takin' my baby
Your heart weighs a ton
Girl watch me heavy lift
How many more times we gon' argue over petty shit
I mess up but shit you mess up too
The way you answer makes me question you
I guess your body ain't the only thing that's flexible
Open wounds we still poke even tho we know it's sore there
You got me tempted to say fuck it where my hoes at
I don't care about an argument I'll still be here tomorrow for you
I gotta room up in the city we can play finish the bottle
Cause ain't nobody takin' my baby
Cause ain't nobody takin' my baby

It was me and you in love for a quick summer
Now we textin' question marks cause we switched numbers
Lookin' back you were the perfect fit
Didn't let me fuck right away you made me work for it
Use to ride around drunk you brought out the worst in me
Damn I went to jail with you and that was a first for me
Heaven knows that I was hell bent
First time we said we love each other was through cell vents
Guess I should've known then
But I'm stubborn I'll admit that
At least I got some classic rap songs from your mishaps
No matter what tho I stayed put
Till it wasn't funny anymore like Dane Cook
I'm a lover not a fighter but I'll fight for what I love
I don't care about an argument I'll still be here tomorrow for you
I gotta room up in the city we can play finish the bottle
Cause ain't nobody takin' my baby
I'm beggin' you
Take all my pain away
Take all my pain away
Take all my pain away
Take all my pain away
Take all my pain away
Take all my pain away
Time goes on
I hope I stay strong
Don't you stop right now
You can't stop right now
Time goes on
I hope I stay strong
Don't you stop right now
You can't stop right now
I'm scared that I'ma turn out like that when I'm older
Haven't been in love since I was droppin' mixtapes
I don't wanna spend my 20s on the road
To spend my 30s wondering why I'm alone
I won't even feel it and they won't even trace it
Guess I gotta pray that I will not engage that
Middle finger aimed at anywhere the pain's at

She always puts me first  ayy
And I know I've been around
Uh  I got drip on the floor and it's gettin' nasty
He ain't keepin' his hands up off my asscheeks
I got somethin' to give him and if he asks me
Yeah
Her ass fatter than fat and she got good throat
Sit that cat on my lap  I give it good strokes
I might have to fly her out to Mykonos
Or maybe to Japan so I can hit her like I'm Ichiro
She knows what the fuck is up  I don't gotta dumb it down
Tatted like Rihanna  pussy singing like it's Run The Town
I love her  she's a freak
I promise if I could  I'd fuck her seven days a week
Face from the Middle East  ass from the West Indies
Suckin' the soul up out of my body  rest in peace
Head got me wobblin'

How you get my mind before my body and my trust now?
He say life is too short and he think that we should fuck now
I think I'm finna break him  it's gon' be quick
He know I ride that dick 'til I get seasick

Feelin' lonely in this room since I was 17

Y'all gon' have to do better  I can't believe what I'm seein'
All this bullshit goin' on  the industry is deceivin'
All the masses pitchin' rappers as these independent grinds
Meanwhile  there's been a label right behind 'em the whole time
I was puttin' in work  you were gettin' worked on
Your fans are fickle 'cause your come-up is a mystery
My fans gon' stick with me 'cause me and them got history
Longer than two songs  you don't know how to build
I don't fuck with crews unless you're the one who put the crew on
The rest of y'all got buzz because he put you on a few songs
If the shoe fits  then wear it
They tell the rapper  Don't announce it so the people keep rootin'
Try to keep me on the hush  but I do not give a fuck

You ain't really seen shit  just wait 'til I'm on

You're an industry artist  I'm an artist in the industry
I partnered with Columbia  partnered is the keyword
We split the profits fifty-fifty  better do your research
Came in with my own fan base
Sold out tours around the world before the handshakes
You don't know your own power  you think the label saved you
Couple things  you dropped one song and signed a deal
You have less than ten songs out  you're not real
So the song became bigger than the artist
People know the song  but they don't know the artist
Not enough songs to become their favorite artist
Not enough songs to be a headline artist
I could do a week-long set if I performed my whole catalogue
Every single song  the crowds sing and rap along
Fuck a summer  I'm a decade rapper
You're here now  I'll be here a decade after
I put out eleven albums produced by Russ

You looked like the devil when you waved at me
Bitch  I got something to say to you
Goodbye  bye

And I'm feeling drunk in this hotel room trying to ask you
'Bout all of your past dudes and why they stay so present
'Cause bitch if I'm the future  then why they in yo' presence?
And if I'm the king and you the queen
Then why you acting like a peasant?

All her calls would be ignored  he's on his own time
Should've ended it before it started

He was cheating on her  trying to flip it
Back on her like a victim
Now she all alone and starting over
Now she got baggage on her shoulder
But the new guy really loves her
She loves him  but she doesn't trust herself anymore
She's falling in love now  losing control now
Fighting the truth  trying to hide
But I think it's alright  girl
She's falling in love now  losing control now

Despite her past  she can't help the attraction
He tells her that he's nothing like the last one
He redefines in every way what love is
She fell for him and hasn't gotten up since
Beating on his chest like a bongo
He understands she's coming from a hurt place
Answers all the questions on her survey
Doesn't get jealous  doesn't break trust
Doesn't call her  Ho after hang-ups
Give her everything she ever wanted
And even though she still feels haunted
She's falling in love now  losing control now
Fighting the truth  trying to hide
But I think it's alright  girl

Back when I would talk about
Things that hadn't happened yet
But now I get to talk about
Just got back from South Beach
Always celebrating what I want to see more of
Took my mom with me
Let her soak up all the sunshine
Let her watch the rain stop
All because her son shined
That's what I call foresight
That's what I call manifest
Movin' to the rhythm
Of my intuition
Anything I want I
Speak into existence
That's how I'm living
That's how I'm winning
Five bands a show now
And you know it's going up
Plays in the millions
Guess I'm finally blowing up
Oh what a feeling
Ten years makin' beats
Patience taste bitter
But that after taste is so sweet
Could've stopped at anytime
Wouldn't have believed this
People used to talk down
But now I got 'em speechless
That's what I call foresight
That's what I call manifest

No rap name to hide behind  this the real me
Before the plaques  I was certified
I do business  I keep my income diversified
I counted 35 thousand with my family last night

Riding round the town and staying out  don't wanna say goodbye

But I know that I can't have you back  I guess I'm trippin' now
Sometimes I start missin' you crazy  ain't nothing quite like you (yeah)
Love like this keeps goin' and goin'  I cannot forget you (no)
Yeah  yeah  yeah
Ride around town in a hoopty (uh)
Way before I ever had a groupie (uh)
Back when I used to wear the same five shirts
Way before I ever had Gucci (uh)
Way before I ever had a Rollie on
Talking back when I dropped Corleone
Picking up an eighth that my homie got
Fuckin' in the car  that's the only spot
Back when I felt more free  back when I smoked more weed
Back when I drove up and down 92  with a view of the moon and you in my passenger seat
That was so good  now it's all gone
It is what it is 'cause we both moved on
At least we  have memories  and we also got this song (yeah)

It's gettin' harder to tell the difference between reality and dreams
The lines keep blurrin' like I'm drivin' half asleep
I'm invitin' you to see who's next up in this rap shit
It's easy to pass judgement when you comfortable in life
Hope their word has good credit like a FICO
Only time will tell but I been feelin' like it's my time
How long you gonna keep a star player on the sidelines?
Guess I'm just waitin' for that tap on my shoulder
Your boy buzzin' in I swear this life is like a game show
I hope every album that I drop has Carter III buzz
I'm careful with who I include in all of this
'Cause most want a free ride but I ain't handin' out scholarships
Went to college for a semester
All it taught me was that college ain't for everyone
My mom still supported but she was upset
'Till she saw the crowd scream my name out on Sunset
She got to watch her son light up the whole spot
Right there in that moment it's like she understood my whole plot
I could see the reason why some people wanna hate now
'Cause my past 24 been more action packed than Jack Bauer
Made 100 thousand in the past hour
Barely in the industry and I already got trust issues
I gave 'em all my trust and I ain't never get this shit back
Now I'm talkin' to myself like they gon' try and break you
Of course they lookin' at my table tryna find a place to sit
Funny 'cause you used to laugh when I would say I'm ready
Now the ones who doubted me are gonna tell you how they met me
I need a vacation to where the real people live
But the truth is hard to swallow when you chokin' on your pride
That goes for the girls I swooped in on
This gon' be a funny story couple months from today
