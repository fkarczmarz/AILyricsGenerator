lyrics
"And where have you been  my darling young one?
I've stumbled on the side of twelve misty mountains
I've walked and I crawled on six crooked highways
I've stepped in the middle of seven sad forests
I've been out in front of a dozen dead oceans
I've been ten thousand miles in the mouth of a graveyard
It's a hard rain's a-gonna fall
Oh  what did you see  my blue-eyed son?
And what did you see  my darling young one?
I saw a newborn baby with wild wolves all around it
I saw a highway of diamonds with nobody on it
I saw a black branch with blood that kept dripping
I saw a room full of men with their hammers a-bleeding
I saw a white ladder all covered with water
I saw ten-thousand talkers whose tongues were all broken
I saw guns and sharp swords in the hands of young children
It's a hard rain's a-gonna fall

And what did you hear  my blue-eyed son?
And what did you hear  my darling young one?
I heard the sound of a thunder that roared out a warning
I heard the roar of a wave that could drown the whole world
I heard one hundred drummers whose hands were a-blazing
I heard ten-thousand whispering and nobody listening
I heard one person starve  I heard many people laughing
I heard the song of a poet who died in the gutter
I heard the sound of a clown who cried in the alley
It's a hard rain's a-gonna fall
Oh  what did you meet  my blue-eyed son?
And who did you meet  my darling young one?
I met a young child beside a dead pony
I met a white man who walked a black dog
I met a young woman  her body was burning
I met a young girl  she gave me a rainbow
I met one man who was wounded in love
I met another man who was wounded in hatred
It's a hard rain's a-gonna fall
And what will you do now  my blue-eyed son?
And what will you do now  my darling young one?
I'm a-going back out 'fore the rain starts a-falling
I'll walk to the depths of the deepest dark forest
Where the people are many and their hands are all empty
Where the pellets of poison are flooding their waters
Where the home in the valley meets the damp dirty prison
And the executioner's face is always well hidden
Where hunger is ugly  where the souls are forgotten
Where black is the color  where none is the number
And reflect from the mountain so all souls can see it
And I'll stand on the ocean until I start sinking
But I'll know my song well before I start singing
Said the joker to the thief
There's too much confusion
I can't get no relief
Plowmen dig my earth
None of them along the line
Know what any of it is worth
No reason to get excited
There are many here among us
Who feel that life is but a joke
And this is not our fate
So let us not talk falsely now
The hour is getting late
All along the watchtower
Princes kept the view
While all the women came and went
Barefoot servants too
A wildcat did growl
Two riders were approaching
With your pencil in your hand
You see somebody naked
You try so hard
But you don't understand
Just what you will say
When you get home
Because something is happening here
But ya' don't know what it is
You raise up your head
And somebody points to you and says
It's his
But something is happening here
But ya' don't know what it is

You hand in your ticket
And you go watch the geek
Who immediately walks up to you
When he hears you speak
Be such a freak?
As he hands you a bone
And something is happening here
But ya' don't know what it is
You have many contacts
Among the lumberjacks
To get you facts
When someone attacks your imagination
But nobody has any respect
Anyway they already expect you
To all give a check
To tax-deductible charity organization
And they've all liked your looks
With great lawyers you have
Discussed lepers and crooks
You've been through all of
F. Scott Fitzgerald's books
You are very well read
It's well known
But something is happening here
But ya' don't know what it is
And then he kneels
He crosses himself
And then he clicks his high heels
And without further notice
He asks you how it feels
Thanks for the loan
And something is happening here
But ya' don't know what it is
Now you see this one-eyed midget
Shouting the word Now
And he screams back You're a cow
Give me some milk or else go home
And you know something is happening here
But ya' don't know what it is
Like a camel and then you frown
You put your eyes in your pocket
And your nose on the ground
There oughtta be a law
Against you comin' around
You should be made
To wear earphones
'Cause something is happening here
But ya' don't know what it is
Before you call him a man?
How many seas must the white dove sail
Before she sleeps in the sand?
Before they're forever banned?
Is blowin' in the wind
The answer is blowin' in the wind
Before it is washed to the sea?
Before they're allowed to be free?
And pretend that he just doesn't see?
Is blowin' in the wind

From the place that I'll be landin'?
No  there's nothin' you can send me  my own true love
There's nothin' I'm a-wishing to be ownin'
Just a-carry yourself back to me unspoiled
From across that lonesome ocean
Ah  but I just thought you might want somethin' fine
Made of silver or of golden
Either from the mountains of Madrid
Or from the coast of Barcelona
But if I had the stars of the darkest night
And the diamonds from the deepest ocean
I'd forsake them all for your sweet kiss
For that's all I'm wishin' to be ownin'
Well  I might be gone a long old time
And it's only that I'm asking
Is there somethin' I can send you to remember me by
To make your time more easy passin'?

Oh  how can  how can you ask me again?

The same thing I would want today

Oh  I got a letter on a lonesome day
It was from her ship a-sailin'
Sayin'  I don't know when I'll be comin' back again
It depends on how I'm a-feelin'
If a-you  my love  must think that-a-way
I'm sure your mind is a-roamin'
I'm sure your thoughts are not with me
But with the country to where you're goin'
So  take heed  take heed of the western winds
Take heed of the stormy weather
And  yes  there's somethin' you can send back to me
They're painting the passports brown
The beauty parlor is filled with sailors
The circus is in town
Here comes the blind commissioner
They've got him in a trance
One hand is tied to the tight-rope walker
The other is in his pants
They need somewhere to go
As Lady and I look out tonight
From Desolation Row
And puts her hands in her back pockets
Bette Davis style
You'd better leave
And the only sound that's left
After the ambulances go
Is Cinderella sweeping up
On Desolation Row

Now the moon is almost hidden
The stars are beginning to hide
The fortune-telling lady
Has even taken all her things inside
All except for Cain and Abel
And the hunchback of Notre Dame
Everybody is making love
Or else expecting rain
He's getting ready for the show
He's going to the carnival tonight
On Desolation Row
For her I feel so afraid
On her twenty-second birthday
She already is an old maid
She wears an iron vest
Her profession's her religion
Her sin is her lifelessness
And though her eyes are fixed upon
Noah's great rainbow
She spends her time peeking
Into Desolation Row
With his memories in a trunk
Passed this way an hour ago
Now he looked so immaculately frightful
As he bummed a cigarette
Then he went off sniffing drainpipes
And reciting the alphabet
You would not think to look at him
But he was famous long ago
For playing the electric violin
On Desolation Row
Inside of a leather cup
But all his sexless patients
They're trying to blow it up
She's in charge of the cyanide hole
And she also keeps the cards that read
Have mercy on his soul
They all play on the pennywhistle
You can hear them blow
If you lean your head out far enough
From Desolation Row
Across the street they've nailed the curtains
They're getting ready for the feast
The Phantom of the Opera
In a perfect image of a priest
They are spoon feeding Casanova
To get him to feel more assured
Then they'll kill him with self-confidence
After poisoning him with words
And the Phantom's shouting to skinny girls
Get outta here if you don't know
Casanova is just being punished for going
To Desolation Row
At midnight all the agents
And the superhuman crew
Come out and round up everyone
That knows more than they do
Then they bring them to the factory
Where the heart attack machine
Is strapped across their shoulders
And then the kerosene
Is brought down from the castles
By insurance men who go
Check to see that nobody is escaping
To Desolation Row
Praise be to Nero's Neptune
The Titanic sails at dawn
Everybody's shouting
Which side are you on?
And Ezra Pound and T. S. Eliot
Fighting in the captain's tower
While calypso singers laugh at them
And fishermen hold flowers
Between the windows of the sea
Where lovely mermaids flow
And nobody has to think too much
About Desolation Row
About the time the doorknob broke
When you asked me how I was doing
Was that some kinda joke?
All these people that you mention
I had to rearrange their faces
And give them all another name
Not unless you mail them
From Desolation Row
If'n you don't know by now
And it ain't no use to sit and wonder why  babe
It'll never do somehow
When your rooster crows at the break of dawn
Look out your window and I'll be gone
You're the reason I'm a-traveling on
But don't think twice  it's all right
And it ain't no use in a-turning on your light  babe
The light I never knowed
And it ain't no use in turning on your light  babe
I'm on the dark side of the road
But I wish there was something you would do or say
To try and make me change my mind and stay
But we never did too much talking anyway
But don't think twice  it's all right
So it ain't no use in calling out my name  gal
Like you never done before
And it ain't no use in calling out my name  gal
I can't hear you anymore
I'm a-thinking and a-wondering  walking down the road

I give her my heart but she wanted my soul

You just kinda wasted my precious time
Blowing like it's gonna sweep my world away

Blowing like she never blowed before
Blowing like she's at my chamber door
You smiling through the fence at me
Just like you always smiled before

Blowing through another no good town
The lights on my native land are glowing
I wonder if they'll know me next time 'round
I wonder if that old oak tree's still standing
Listen to that Duquesne whistle blowing
Another ship goin' out
I know how it happened

No stars in the sky shine brighter than you
You girls mean business and I do too
An enemy of strife
I'm the enemy of the unlived meaningless life

Just a cool breeze that's encircling me
Let's go for a walk in the garden
So far and so wide
We can sit in the shade by the fountain-side
I search the world over
For the Holy Grail
I sing songs of love
I sing songs of betrayal
Don't care what I drink
I don't care what I eat
I climb the mountain of swords on my bare feet
You never would guess
I'm nothing like my ghostly appearance would suggest
I ain't no false prophet
I just said what I said
I'm just here to bring vengeance on somebody's head
Put out your hand
There's nothing to hold
Open your mouth
I'll stuff it with gold
The city of God is there on the hill
Hello and goodbye
You ruled the land
But so do I
You lusty old mule
You got a poisoned brain
I'll marry you to a ball and chain
The kind of life that I live
When your smile meets my smile
Something's got to give
I ain't no false prophet
Can't remember when I was born
Where the winds hit heavy on the borderline
Remember me to one who lives there
For she once was a true love of mine
If you go when the snowflakes storm
When the rivers freeze and summer ends
Please see she has a coat so warm
To keep her from the howling winds
Please see if her hair hangs long
If it rolls and flows all down her breast
Please see for me if her hair's hangin' long
For that’s the way I remember her best
I’m a-wondering if she remembers me at all

In the darkness of my night
In the brightness of my day

They told him he could identify the guilty men

Here’s the story of the Hurricane

And the cops are putting the screws to him

Rubin could take a man out with just one punch
But he never did like to talk about it all that much
And when it’s over I’d just as soon go on my way
Up to some paradise
Where the trout streams flow and the air is nice
And ride a horse along a trail
But then they took him to the jailhouse
Where they try to turn a man into a mouse
All of Rubin’s cards were marked in advance
The judge made Rubin’s witnesses drunkards from the slums
To the white folks who watched he was a revolutionary bum
And to the black folks he was just a crazy nigga
No one doubted that he pulled the trigger
And though they could not produce the gun
The D.A. said he was the one who did the deed
And the all-white jury agreed
Rubin Carter was falsely tried
Bello and Bradley and they both baldly lied
How can the life of such a man
Be in the palm of some fool’s hand?
To see him obviously framed
Couldn’t help but make me feel ashamed
To live in a land where justice is a game
Now all the criminals in their coats and their ties
While Rubin sits like Buddha in a ten-foot cell
An innocent man in a living hell
Yes that’s the story of the Hurricane
But it won’t be over till they clear his name
And give him back the time he’s done

 and I fight blood feuds
 and I paint nudes
 what's next? What shall we do?
 like Indiana Jones

 I go right to the end
 and I eat fast foods
 red blue jeans
 and all the old queens
 I'm a man of many moods
 I'll show you my heart
 only the hateful parts
 I’ll put a price on your head
 the path in my mind
 Chopin’s preludes
The lonesome organ grinder cries
The silver saxophones say I should refuse you
The cracked bells and washed-out horns
Blow into my face with scorn
But it’s not that way
I wasn’t born to lose you
The drunken politician leaps
Upon the street where mothers weep
And I wait for them to interrupt
Me drinking from my broken cup
And ask me to
Open up the gate for you

'Cause I don’t think about it

And because I

Whoever it is I wish they’d cut it out quick

And took his wife to Italy
She inherited a million bucks
And when she died it came to me
I can’t help it if I’m lucky
People see me all the time
And they just can’t remember how to act
Their minds are filled with big ideas
Images and distorted facts
You had to ask me where it was at
I couldn’t believe after all these years
You didn’t know me any better than that

Who said beware of lightning that might strike
I haven’t known peace and quiet
There’s a lone soldier on the cross
Smoke pouring out of a boxcar door

After losing every battle
I woke up on the roadside
Daydreaming about the way things sometimes are
Visions of your chestnut mare
Shoot through my head and are making me see stars
You hurt the ones that I love best
And cover up the truth with lies
One day you’ll be in the ditch
Flies buzzing around your eyes
Blood on your saddle

Blowing through the flowers on your tomb
Blowing through the curtains in your room
Idiot wind
Blowing every time you move your teeth
It’s a wonder that you still know how to breathe
It was gravity which pulled us down
And destiny which broke us apart
You tamed the lion in my cage
But it just wasn’t enough to change my heart
Now everything’s a little upside down
You’ll find out when you reach the top
You’re on the bottom
I noticed at the ceremony
Your corrupt ways had finally made you blind
I can’t remember your face anymore
The priest wore black on the seventh day
And sat stone-faced while the building burned
I waited for you on the running boards
Slowly into Autumn
Idiot wind
Blowing like a circle around my skull
From the Grand Coulee Dam to the Capitol
Idiot wind
Blowing every time you move your teeth
It’s a wonder that you still know how to breathe
I can’t feel you anymore
I can’t even touch the books you’ve read
Every time I crawl past your door
I been wishing I've been somebody else instead
Down the road to ecstasy
I followed you beneath the stars
Hounded by your memory
And all your raging glory
I been double-crossed now
For the very last time and now I’m finally free
I kissed goodbye the howling beast
On the borderline which separated you from me
You’ll never know the hurt I suffered
Nor the pain I rise above
And I’ll never know the same about you
Your holiness or your kind of love
And it makes me feel so sorry
Idiot wind
Blowing through the buttons of our coats
Blowing through the letters that we wrote
Idiot wind
Blowing through the dust upon our shelves
She left here last early Spring  is livin' there  I hear
Say for me that I'm all right though things get kind of slow
She might think that I've forgotten her  don't tell her it isn't so
We had a falling out  like lovers often will
And to think of how she left that night  it still brings me a chill
And though our separation  it pierced me to the heart
She still lives inside of me  we've never been apart
If you get close to her  kiss her once for me
Always have respected her for doing what she did and gettin' free
Oh  whatever makes her happy  I won't stand in the way
Though the bitter taste still lingers on from the night I tried to make her stay
I see a lot of people as I make the rounds
And I hear her name here and there as I go from town to town
And I've never gotten used to it  I've just learned to turn it off
Either I'm too sensitive or else I'm gettin' soft
Sundown  yellow moon  I replay the past
I know every scene by heart  they all went by so fast
If she's passin' back this way  I'm not that hard to find
Leave at your own chosen speed
I'm not the one you need
You say you're looking for someone
Who's never weak but always strong
To protect you and defend you
Whether you are right or wrong
Someone to open each and every door
Go lightly on the ground
I will only let you down
You say you're looking for someone
Who will promise never to part
Someone to close his eyes for you
Someone to close his heart
Someone who will die for you and more

Eclipses both the sun and moon

Person crying

Can be seen in the eyes of those that call
To make all that should be killed to crawl
While others say don't hate nothing at all
Except hatred
Disillusioned words like bullets bark
As human gods aim for their mark
Make everything from toy guns that spark
To flesh-colored Christs that glow in the dark
It's easy to see without looking too far
That not much is really sacred
While preachers preach of evil fates
Teachers teach that knowledge waits
Can lead to hundred-dollar plates
Goodness hides behind its gates
But even the President of the United States
Sometimes must have to stand naked
And though the rules of the road have been lodged
It's only people's games that you got to dodge
Advertising signs that con
You into thinking you're the one
That can do what's never been done
That can win what's never been won
All around you
You suddenly find you got nothing to fear
Alone you stand with nobody near
Startles your sleeping ears to hear
That somebody thinks they really found you
A question in your nerves is lit
Yet you know there is no answer fit
To keep it in your mind and not forget
That you belong to
But though the masters make the rules
For the wise men and the fools
For them that must obey authority
That they do not respect in any degree
Speak jealously of them that are free
Do what they do just to be
Nothing more than something they invest in
While some on principles baptized
To strict party platform ties
Social clubs in drag disguise
Outsiders they can freely criticize
Tell nothing except who to idolize
And say God bless him
While one who sings with his tongue on fire
Gargles in the rat race choir
Bent out of shape from society's pliers
Cares not to come up any higher
But rather get you down in the hole
That he's in
On anyone that lives in a vault
Old lady judges watch people in pairs
While them that defend what they cannot see
It blows the minds most bitterly
For them that think death's honesty
Won't fall upon 'em naturally
Life sometimes must get lonely
My eyes collide head-on with stuffed
At pettiness which plays so rough
Walk upside down inside handcuffs
Kick my legs to crash it off
What else can you show me?
And if my thought-dreams could be seen
They'd probably put my head in a guillotine
While the eyes of the idol with the iron head are glowing
Distant ships sailing into the mist
You were born with a snake in both of your fists while a hurricane was blowing
Freedom just around the corner for you
Jokerman dance to the nightingale tune
Bird fly high by the light of the moon
So swiftly the sun sets in the sky
You rise up and say goodbye to no one
Fools rush in where angels fear to tread
Shedding off one more layer of skin
Keeping one step ahead of the persecutor within

You're going to Sodom and Gomorrah
But what do you care? Ain't nobody there would want to marry your sister
Jokerman dance to the nightingale tune
Bird fly high by the light of the moon
The law of the jungle and the sea are your only teachers
In the smoke of the twilight on a milk-white steed
Michelangelo indeed could've carved out your features
Half asleep near the stars with a small dog licking your face
Jokerman dance to the nightingale tune
Bird fly high by the light of the moon
Molotov cocktails and rocks behind every curtain
False-hearted judges dying in the webs that they spin
Only a matter of time till night comes stepping in
Jokerman dance to the nightingale tune
Bird fly high by the light of the moon
A woman just gave birth to a prince today and dressed him in scarlet
Take the motherless children off the street
And place them at the feet of a harlot

Tonight as I stand inside the rain
Everybody knows that baby's got new clothes
But lately I see her ribbons and her bows
Have fallen from her curls
And she aches just like a woman
But she breaks just like a little girl
Nobody has to guess that baby can't be blessed
'Til she finally sees that she's like all the rest
And she aches just like a woman
But she breaks just like a little girl

And I was dying there of thirst
So I came in here
And your long-time curse hurts
But what's worse
Is this pain in here
I can't stay in here
Ain't it clear that I just can't fit
Please don't let on that you knew me when
I was hungry and it was your world
Then you ache just like a woman
But ya' break just like a little girl
When it's Easter time too
And your gravity fails
And negativity don't pull you through
Don't put on any airs
When you're down on Rue Morgue Avenue
They got some hungry women there
And they really make a mess outta you
Now if you see Saint Annie
Please tell her Thanks a lot
I cannot move
My fingers are all in a knot
I don't have the strength
To get up and take another shot
Won't even say what it is I've got
Sweet Melinda
The peasants call her the Goddess of Gloom
She speaks good English
And she invites you up into her room
And you're so kind
And careful not to go to her too soon
And she takes your voice
And leaves you howling at the moon

Up on Housing Project Hill
It's either fortune or fame
You must pick one or the other
Though neither of them are to be what they claim
If you're lookin' to get silly
You better go back to from where you came
Because the cops don't need you
Now all the authorities
They just stand around and boast
How they blackmailed the Sergeant-at-Arms
Into leaving his post
And picking up Angel
Who just arrived here from the coast
Who looked so fine at first
But left lookin' just like a ghost

But soon hit the harder stuff
Everybody said they'd stand behind me

One of toil and blood
When blackness was a virtue
The road was full of mud
I came in from the wilderness
A creature void of form
Shelter from the storm
And if I pass this way again
You can rest assured
I'll always do my best for her
On that I give my word
In a world of steel-eyed death and men
Who are fighting to be warm
Shelter from the storm

There was little risk involved

Had been left unresolved

Where it's always safe and warm

Buried in the hail
Poisoned in the bushes
And blown out on the trail
Hunted like a crocodile
Ravaged in the corn
Shelter from the storm
Suddenly I turned around
And she was standing there
With silver bracelets on her wrists
And flowers in her hair
She walked up to me so gracefully
And took my crown of thorns
Shelter from the storm
Now there's a wall between us
Something there's been lost
I took too much for granted
I got my signals crossed
Just to think that it all began
On an uneventful morn
Shelter from the storm
And the preacher rides a mount
But nothing really matters much
It's doom alone that counts
And the one-eyed undertaker
He blows a futile horn
Shelter from the storm
I've heard newborn babies wailing
Like a mourning dove
And old men with broken teeth
Stranded without love
Is it hopeless and forlorn
Shelter from the storm
In a little hilltop village
They gambled for my clothes
I bargained for salvation
And she gave me a lethal dose
I offered up my innocence
And I got repaid with scorn
Shelter from the storm
But I'm bound to cross the line
Beauty walks a razor's edge
Someday I'll make it mine
If I could only turn back the clock
To when God and her were born
As the evening sky grew dark
She looked at him and he felt a spark
Tingle to his bones
'Twas then he felt alone
And wished that he'd gone straight
And watched out for a simple twist of fate
They walked alone by the old canal
And stopped into a strange hotel
With a neon burning bright
He felt the heat of the night
Hit him like a freight train
Moving with a simple twist of fate
A saxophone someplace far-off played
As she was walking on by the arcade
As the light bust through a beat-up shade
Where he was wakin' up
She dropped a coin into the cup
Of a blind man at the gate
And forgot about a simple twist of fate

He didn't see her anywhere
He told himself he didn't care
Pushed the window open wide
Felt an emptiness inside
To which he just could not relate
Brought on by a simple twist of fate
He hears the ticking of the clocks
And walks along with a parrot that talks
Hunts her down by the waterfront docks
Where the sailors all come in
Maybe she'll pick him out again
How long must he wait?
People tell me it's a sin
To know and feel too much within
I still believe she was my twin
But I lost the ring
She was born in spring
But I was born too late
Up and down the block
I'd ask him what the matter was
But I know that he don't talk
And the ladies treat me kindly
And they furnish me with tape
But deep inside my heart
I know I can't escape
Oh  Mama
Can this really be the end?
To be stuck inside of Mobile
With the Memphis blues again
With his pointed shoes and his bells
Speaking to some French girl
Who says she knows me well
And I would send a message
To find out if she's talked
But the post office has been stolen
And the mailbox is locked

Mona tried to tell me
To stay away from the train line
She said that all the railroad men
Just drink up your blood like wine
But then again  there's only one I've met
And he just smoked my eyelids
And punched my cigarette

Grandpa died last week
And now he's buried in the rocks
But everybody still talks about
How badly they were shocked
But me  I expected it to happen
I knew he'd lost control
When I sp— he'd built a fire on Main Street
And shot it full of holes
Oh  Mama

Now the senator came down here
Showing everyone his gun
Handing out free tickets
To the wedding of his son
And me  I nearly got busted
And wouldn't it be my luck
To get caught without a ticket
And be discovered beneath a truck
Oh  Mama
Is this really the end?
To be stuck inside of Mobile

Now the tea preacher looked so baffled
When I asked him why he dressed
With twenty pounds of headlines
Stapled to his chest
But he cursed me when I proved to him
You see  you're just like me
I hope you're satisfied

Now the rainman gave me two cures
Then he said  Jump right in
The one was Texas medicine
The other was just railroad gin
And like a fool I mixed them
And it strangled up my mind
And now people just get uglier
And I have no sense of time

Now when Ruthie says come see her
In her honky-tonk lagoon
Where I can watch her waltz for free
'Neath her Panamanian moon
You know you know about my debutante

But I know what you want

Now the bricks lay on Grand Street
Where the neon madmen climb
They all fall there so perfectly
It all seems so well timed
And here I sit so patiently
Waiting to find out what price

Going through all these things twice
Oh  Mama

I'm on the pavement  thinkin' about the government
Says he's got a bad cough  wants to get it paid off
Look out kid  it's somethin' you did
God knows when  but you're doin' it again
You better duck down the alleyway  looking for a new friend
The man in the coon-skin cap in a pig pen
Wants 11 dollar bills – you only got 10
Maggie comes fleet foot  face full of black soot
Talkin' that the heat put plants in the bed  but
Phone's tapped anyway
Maggie says the many say
They must bust in early May
Orders from the D.A
Look out kid  don't matter what you did
Walk on your tip toes  don’t tie no bows
Better stay away from those that carry around a fire hose
Keep a clean nose  watch the plainclothes
You don't need a weather man to know which way the wind blows
Hang bail  hard to tell if anything is gonna sell
Look out kid  you're gonna get hit
Hanging 'round the theaters
Girl by the whirlpool's looking for a new fool
Don't follow leaders  a-watch the parking meters

I was laying in bed
Wondering if she'd changed at all
If her hair was still red
Her folks they said our lives together
Sure was going to be rough
They never did like Mama's homemade dress
Papa's bankbook wasn't big enough
And I was standing on the side of the road
Rain falling on my shoes
Heading out for the East Coast
Lord knows I've paid some dues
Getting through
Tangled up in blue
She was married when we first met
Soon to be divorced
But I used a little too much force
We drove that car as far as we could
Abandoned it out west
Split up on a dark sad night
Both agreeing it was best
She turned around to look at me
As I was walking away
I heard her say over my shoulder
We'll meet again someday
On the avenue

I had a job in the great north woods
Working as a cook for a spell
But I never did like it all that much
And one day the ax just fell
So I drifted down to New Orleans
Where I lucky was to be employed
Working for a while on a fishing boat
Right outside of Delacroix
But all the while I was alone
The past was close behind
I seen a lot of women
But she never escaped my mind
And I just grew
Tangled up in blue
She was working in a topless place
And I stopped in for a beer
I just kept looking at the side of her face
I was just about to do the same
I muttered something underneath my breath
She studied the lines on my face
When she bent down to tie the laces
Of my shoe
Tangled up in blue
She lit a burner on the stove
And offered me a pipe
You look like the silent type
Then she opened up a book of poems
And handed it to me
Written by an Italian poet
From the thirteenth century
And every one of them words rang true
And glowed like burning coal
Pouring off of every page
Like it was written in my soul
From me to you
Tangled up in blue
I lived with them on Montague Street
In a basement down the stairs
There was music in the cafes at night
And revolution in the air
Then he started into dealing with slaves
And something inside of him died
She had to sell everything she owned
And froze up inside
I became withdrawn
The only thing I knew how to do
Was to keep on keeping on
Like a bird that flew
Tangled up in blue
So now I'm going back again
I got to get to her somehow
All the people we used to know
They're an illusion to me now
Some are mathematicians
Some are carpenter's wives
Don't know how it all got started
I don't know what they're doing with their lives
A-heading for another joint
We always did feel the same
We just saw it from a different point
Of view
Out o'er the Western town
Of the great ship that went down
T'was the fourteenth day of April
Over the waves she rode
Sailing into tomorrow
To a gilded age foretold
The night was black with starlight
The seas were sharp and clear
Moving through the shadows
The promised hour was near
Lights were holding steady
Gliding over the foam
All the lords and ladies
Heading for their eternal home
The chandeliers were swaying
From the balustrades above
The orchestra was playing
Songs of faded love

As the ballroom dancers twirled
He dreamed the Titanic was sinking
Into the underworld
Leo took his sketchbook
He was often so inclined
He closed his eyes and painted
The scenery in his mind
Cupid struck his bosom
And broke it with a snap
The closest woman to him
He fell into her lap
He heard a loud commotion
Something sounded wrong
His inner spirit was saying
That he couldn't stand here long
He staggered to the quarterdeck
No time now to sleep
Water on the quarterdeck
Already three foot deep
Smokestack was leaning sideways
Heavy feet began to pound
He walked into the whirlwind
Sky splitting all around
The ship was going under
The universe had opened wide
The roll was called up yonder
The angels turned aside
Lights down in the hallway
Flickering dim and dull
Dead bodies already floating
In the double bottom hull
The engines then exploded
Propellers they failed to start
The boilers overloaded
The ship's bow split apart
Passengers were flying
Each one more weary than the last
The veil was torn asunder
'Tween the hours of twelve and one
Could undo what had been done
The watchman lay there dreaming
At forty-five degrees
He dreamed that the Titanic was sinking
Dropping to her knees
Wellington he was sleeping
His bed began to slide
His valiant heart was beating
He pushed the tables aside
Glass of shattered crystal
Lay scattered roundabout
He strapped on both his pistols
How long could he hold out?
His men and his companions
Were nowhere to be seen
In silence there he waited for
Time and space to intervene
The passageway was narrow
There was blackness in the air
He saw every kind of sorrow
Heard voices everywhere
Alarm-bells were ringing
To hold back the swelling tide
Friends and lovers clinging
To each other side by side
Mothers and their daughters
Descending down the stairs
Jumped into the icy waters
Love and pity sent their prayers
Kissed his darling wife
He had no way of knowing
Be the last trip of his life
Gambled in the dark
Not one of them would ever live to
Tell the tale or disembark
Brother rose up 'gainst brother
In every circumstance
They fought and slaughtered each other
In a deadly dance
They lowered down the lifeboats
From the sinking wreck
Broken backs and broken necks
The bishop left his cabin
To help all those in need
Turned his eyes up to the heavens
Davey the brothel-keeper
Came out dismissed his girls
Saw the water getting deeper
Saw the changing of his world
Jim Backus smiled
He never learned to swim
Saw the little crippled child
And he gave his seat to him
He saw the starlight shining
Streaming from the East
Death was on the rampage
But his heart was now at peace
They battened down the hatches
But the hatches wouldn't hold
They drowned upon the staircase
Of brass and polished gold
Leo said to Cleo
I think I'm going mad
But he'd lost his mind already
Whatever mind he had
He tried to block the doorway
To save all those from harm
Blood from an open wound
Pouring down his arm
Petals fell from flowers
Tell all of them were gone
In the long and dreadful hours
The wizard's curse played on
The host was pouring brandy
He was going down slow
He stayed right to the end and he
Was the last to go
Nameless here forever more
They never sailed the ocean
Or left their homes before
The damage had been done
He dreamed the Titanic was sinking
And he tried to tell someone
Kneeling at the wheel
Above him and beneath him
Fifty thousand tons of steel
He looked over at his compass
And he gazed into its face
Needle pointing downward
He knew he lost the race
In the dark illumination
He remembered bygone years
He read the Book of Revelation
And he filled his cup with tears
When the Reaper's task had ended
Sixteen hundred had gone to rest
The loveliest and the best
They waited at the landing
And they tried to understand
But there is no understanding
For the judgment of God's hand
The news came over the wires
And struck with deadly force
The love had lost its fires
All things had run their course
The watchman he lay dreaming
Of all the things that can be
He dreamed the Titanic was sinking
And admit that the waters around you have grown
And accept it that soon you'll be drenched to the bone
If your time to you is worth saving
And you better start swimmin' or you'll sink like a stone
For the times  they are a-changin'
Come writers and critics who prophesize with your pen
And keep your eyes wide  the chance won't come again
And don't speak too soon  for the wheel's still in spin
And there's no tellin' who that it's namin'
For the loser now will be later to win
For the times  they are a-changin'
Come senators  congressmen  please heed the call
Don't stand in the doorway  don't block up the hall
For he that gets hurt will be he who has stalled
The battle outside ragin'
Will soon shake your windows and rattle your walls
For the times  they are a-changin'
Come mothers and fathers throughout the land
And don't criticize what you can't understand
Your sons and your daughters are beyond your command
Your old road is rapidly agin'
Please get out of the new one if you can't lend your hand
For the times  they are a-changin'

Tricks when you're trying to be so quiet?
We sit here stranded
Though we're all doing our best to deny it
Lights flicker from the opposite loft
In this room the heat pipes just cough
The country music station plays soft
Just Louise and her lover so entwined
And these visions of Johanna that conquer my mind
In the empty lot where the ladies play
Blindman's bluff with the key chain
And the all-night girls
They whisper of escapades out on the D train
We can hear the night watchman click his flashlight
Ask himself if it's him or them that's insane
She's delicate and seems like the mirror
But she just makes it all too concise and too clear
That Johanna's not here
The ghost of 'lectricity howls in the bones of her face
Where these visions of Johanna have now taken my place

But like Louise always says
We see this empty cage now corrode
Where her cape of the stage once had flowed
He writes everything's been returned which was owed
On the back of the fish truck that loads
While my conscience explodes
The harmonicas play the skeleton keys and the rain
My age  it means less
The country I come from
Is called the Midwest
I's taught and brought up there
The laws to abide
And that the land that I live in
Has God on its side

They tell it so well

The Indians fell
The cavalries charged
The Indians died
Ah  the country was young
With God on its side

War had its day
And the Civil War too
Was soon laid away
And the names of the heroes
