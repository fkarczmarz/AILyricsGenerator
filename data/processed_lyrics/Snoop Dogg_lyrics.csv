"All from the turf and they bangin' out lives
Far from a scrub cuzz from the Eastside
Where they don't die they just multiply
So.. don't give them niggas a reason
To turn it into spray season
Don't give them niggas a reason
Because they'll turn it into Crip season
It's all similar to gettin laid
On ya back when the motherfuckin' K sprays
I grind for my shine about my bidness
Lunatic on the shit and I get ignit (ignit)
Gonna proceed to squeeze with ease
Look into a mind of a nigga that's crazy
Seventeen years old and still a baby

Ten little Crip niggas runnin' outside
All from the turf and they bangin' out lives
Far from a scrub cuzz from the Eastside
Where they don't die they just multiply
So.. don't give them niggas a reason
To turn it into spray season
Don't give them niggas a reason
Because they'll turn it into Crip season
Wake up in the morning lookin funny and shit
Fuck a honey dip.. cause I got money to get
Keep a strap in ya pocket when you trip through the towns
There's a million motherfuckers tryna get you down
If ya money right then you might get you a chain
Jack a rapper at a local rap radio show
And they thought we just gangsta rapped
It's like that!
Ten little Crip niggas runnin' outside
All from the turf and they bangin' out lives
Far from a scrub cuzz from the Eastside
Where they don't die they just multiply
So.. don't give them niggas a reason
To turn it into spray season
Don't give them niggas a reason
Because they'll turn it into Crip season
It's a whole lot of fillin when you on the Eastside
And it's a whole lot of dealin when you on the Eastside
And it's a whole lot of stealin when you on the Eastside
And it's a whole lot of killin when you on the Eastside
Ten little Crip niggas runnin' outside
All from the turf and they bangin' out lives
Far from a scrub cuzz from the Eastside
Where they don't die they just multiply
So.. don't give them niggas a reason
To turn it into spray season
Don't give them niggas a reason
Because they'll turn it into Crip season
This is DJ EZ-Dicc
On WBallz
And this one goes out to the ladies from all the guys
A big bow-wow-wow
'Cause we gon' make it a little misty in here tonight
This is DJ EZ-Dicc
On the station that slaps you across your fat ass with a fat dick
Before you opened up your gap
But now I take it all back
'Cause you gave me all your pussy
And you even licked my balls
Leave your number on the cabinet
Next time I'm feelin' kinda horny
You can come on over and I'll break you off
Just lay back and open your mouth
'Cause I have never met a girl
That I love in the whole wide world

I'd never have no motherfuckin' indo to smoke
I have no love for hoes
To pay this ho just to lay this ho?
And then I'm through with it
'Cause she ain't nothin' but a bitch to me
Approach her with a different proposition
Trick-ass bitch
It ain't no fun if the homies can't have none
It ain't no fun if the homies can't have none
It ain't no fun if the homies can't have none
It ain't no fun if the homies can't have none
Guess who's back in the motherfuckin' house
With a fat dick for your motherfuckin' mouth?
'Cause when bitches get scandalous and pull a voodoo
What you gon' do? You really don't know
So I'd advise you not to trust that ho
Silly of me to fall in love with a bitch
Knowin' damn well I'm too caught up with my grip
Now as the sun rotates and my game grows bigger (Uh-huh)
How many bitches wanna fuck this nigga
Named Snoop Doggy? I'm all the above
I'm too swift on my toes to get caught up with you hoes
These motherfuckin' nuts in your mouth
It ain't no fun if the homies can't have none
It ain't no fun if the homies can't have none
It ain't no fun if the homies can't have none
Does it  baby?
Yeah  rub my back for me
Where do you want me to rub it  baby?
Right here
Okay

Everything fucked about right about now  Dogg

And reason why niggas with problems keep on steppin'

For me? It's blasphemy  you fuckin' around

This is just a small introduction to the G-funk era
Everyday of my life I take a glimpse in the mirror
And I see motherfuckers tryna be like me
Ever since I put it down with the D-R-E
Foamin' at the mouth and waggin' his tail
Searchin through the yard with a keen sense of smell
Lookin' for the bitches in heat
And when he find it he'll be sniffin her seat
We travel in packs and we do it from the back
How else can you get to the booty?
We do it doggystyle
All the while we do it doggystyle
Yo motherfuckin' hoe!
He fucked the fleas off the bitch  he shaked the ticks off his dick
And in the booty  he buries his motherfuckin' bone
And if there's any left over  he'll roll over and take a doggy bag home
Damn  that Tanqueray is talkin' to a nigga

Niggas gotta pay they dues on the crews or with the uzi spray

She shook up  look up and then she put me on the move
I tried to get away  but I couldn't get far
'Cause the homies had the loop-loop that night at King Park
And I got into a squab  got caught and went to jail
Straight to the County with no motherfuckin' bail
4800 with this Crippin'  oh well
My big homie Boy Blue snatched me by my coattail
Eyes open cause niggas get stuck on seez-ight

We gon go to a live remote  licking wit my main man Mr Doggy Dogg
A day in the life  of a Rollin' 20 Crip
I'm just a stubborn type of fella with a head like a brick
Now just because I sip Moet  they say that I'm hopeless
But I don't give a fuck  so blame it on the loc'ness
Now this is how we do it when we checking the grip
Snoop Dogg is in this bitch  so don't even trip
I bust a funky composition that's as smooth as a prism
So check it while I kick off in this funky-ass rhythm
It's six dub  the phone is ringing off the deck
And it's some homies talking about I disrespected they set
Aww nah  Dogg ain't diss y'all
I got a couple relatives up off of Crenshaw
This is about me and Simon  not me and y'all
I got love for a bunch of real B-Dogs
And the homie Heron rest in peace
Big Jay from Campanella Park
He used to blaze with his nephew after dark
On and on  rocking big Neckbone
Mausberg I had to put you on my song
It's so real  I had to show some love
Now back to this scrub  it ain't about Crip or Blood
It's about you bein' jealous of what I does
Cause I does it the most  the king of the coast
In the paint playin' post - I back you down
Like Shaq-Daddy  and bust on ya out the new Caddy
And skirt up Wilshire Boulevard
I fucked all your groupies
When you was doing time in Camp Snoopy
With the fags and snitches  no killers just bitches
You so hardco'  why you ain't go to level fo'?
Oh I know (bitch!)
But I walk the mainline every time I go down
You can check my G Files I do it L.B.C. style
I got the word on you Simon
You need to just start rhymin'
Cause you the biggest star on your label
And them other niggas just crumbs off my table
You're not able  to compete with the heat that I drop
And I still ain't been paid  for 1-8-7 on a cop
I started yo' shit and I will end yo' shit
If you keep talkin shit on Crip!

But it was no need for me to rush to bust one
'Cause I wanted her to have an eruption
Sensual seduction

It's time to escape  but I don't know where the fuck I'm headed
I see myself in a mist of smoke
Death becomes any nigga that takes me for a joke
We hit a five dollar stick  now we putting in work
Unaccountable amounts of dirt
Death becomes all niggas  anybody killer
I see some off-brand niggas on the corner flaggin' me down
Is that nigga Snoop alright? Ayo  what's up with the crew?
Is them niggas in jail  or are them niggas through?
I said  If you ain't up on thangs
Snoop Dogg is the name  Dogg Pound's the gang
It's like this  they don't understand
It's an everyday thang to gangbang
What's up with you? I represent the Pound and Death Row
And can't no other motherfucker in L.A. or Long Beach
Or Compton and Watts see D-O-Gs  now
You can't come and you can't run  and you can't
See long to the G of the gang  one gun
Is all that we need to put you to rest
(Pump-pump) Put two slugs dead in your chest
Now you dead then a motherfucker creeping and sleeping
Six feet deep in  fucking with the Pound is

Until you get the full comprehension
And when you do  that's when the mission
Or survival becomes your every thought

And I'm still rocking on the microphone
People love me everywhere
And I know why
It's not that I'm dope and my style is so fly

I was dazed and amazed
That's why I keep my shit in ponytails or either braids
With a fifth of Seagrams
Mixed with some sacco

My sack in the back
My strap in my lap
Room to the back
And put it in the E-I
And let's stay way fucked up til we D-I

This one is called Tha Shiznit
Right here on the station that plays only platinum hits

How can I makes my grip?
And how should I make that nigga straight slip?
