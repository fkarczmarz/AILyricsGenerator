"Chased a lot of crazy things
Left behind my share of broken pieces
This morning I turned 36
When you just remember half of it
You wonder how you outlived Hank and Jesus
But you kept me from goin' under
When that current got too heavy
I always thought I'd be a heap of metal
Sold for parts like a junkyard rusted-out Chevy
What the hell made you wanna love
A man who was gonna die young
In the mirror I saw my surprise
Who knew gray hairs liked to hide on a head
That didn't think he'd live past thirty
If I make it thirty more
It's the brown that you'll be looking for
As you run your fingers through it and say

But you kept me from goin' under
When that current got too heavy
I always thought I'd be a heap of metal
Sold for parts like a junkyard rusted-out Chevy
What the hell made you wanna love
A man who was gonna die young
Just thought by now I'd be pushing up daisies
But I'll gladly stick around if we're together
Could you tell the Lord I've changed my mind?
Why’d you come draggin’ in here?
And I’ll let you bend my ear
Love is a bitch  ain’t it buddy
When baby turns the tables on your head
I know you came in here to bring back her leaving
I’ll leave you with this instead
I know every hole in the Clinch River
And I know how to find them bass
I know how to tune a six string Martin
And kick Saturday in the ass
I know how to make that moonshine
I know you want your sunshine back
I know a whole lot about a lil’ somethin’ somethin’
And a whole bunch of nothing ‘bout that
A whole bunch of nothing ‘bout that
Before my mind took a vacation
I had a situation like you got
They tell me that I had a good woman gone bad
But I can’t remember what I forgot

Now just kick back and listen up  son
I’ll help you get to where I am
Get you goin' full-throttle and leanin’ on the bottle
And some bait in a coffee can
I know every hole in the Clinch River
And I know how to find them bass
I know how to tune a six string Martin
And kick Saturday in the ass
I know how to make that moonshine
I know you want your sunshine back
I know a whole lot about a lil’ somethin’ somethin’
And a whole bunch of nothing ‘bout that
A whole bunch of nothing ‘bout that
I know where to go
And you know how to get there
Off you go  hit the road
Buzz and a pole  a wing and a prayer
I know every hole in the Clinch River
And I know how to find them bass
I know how to tune a six string Martin
And kick Saturday in the ass
Yeah  I know how to make that moonshine
I know you want your sunshine back
My grandpa built on your land
Your mountains are a canvas
For the makers hand
Tonight I'm fishing Elk River
If only in my mind
I carry you in my heart
Your memory comes over me like the dark and
Like a phone call from my baby
Saying' honey I miss ya like crazy
Like the sound of a siren song
Calling' me home
Sometimes I grow weary
From going' all the time
I love to take a minute
Let you ease my mind
I'd love to see my mama
Maybe go for a drive
But I got to play the star in some little town again tonight
Don't get me wrong
I love what I do
It's just another song about missing you

A siren with gold eyes  she'll cut you with her kindness
She will lead you with her lies
She's been called a glistening meadow
She's good at keeping score
If you make it she's your savior  if you don't she's a whore
The roads to and from her heart are littered with creative souls
They gave all of their all and all they got in return is empty holes
She'd smiled on the Johnny's  the Merles and the many music-row billionaires
Like a beacon she goes seeking seed  her loins so fertile
To a free man she's a prison  to a caged one she's a fire
She's the reason there's a Sunday morning coming down
The pill and 16th avenue
The Ryman  oh she's a diamond the brown eyed mickey
She was Roy Acuffs castle and Elvis Presley's broken dream
It's not all bad it's not all dark it's not all gloom and crass
But to mine gold in this silver mine it does take balls of brass
For she's seem 'em come and seen 'em go
And came herself a time or two. no matter
How satisfied her scream sounds she always wants someone new
The next him or her or them or all... With stamina to last the night. To be a star in this lady's town...
You can f*** or you can fight

Not romantic art of days gone past  if you forget that rule
You can bet your backside she will bury it in your ass
A nasty little needle to a vein that feeds a singers heart
She lurks in friendly shadows  but she's a junky with a limp
The agents are her bookie and the labels are her pimp
I'll tell you a well-known secret of a place known far and wide
The devil walks among us folks and Nashville is his bride
All the chaos he has caused  and done
His greatest trick is to every guitar-totin' dreamer
The devil don't exist... but me  I shook his hand
And I know that he is real
THE SONG: (Devil  Devil)
Got nine things going wrong right now
And her leaving makes a dime
Tonight  I guess we’ll see
I got a hanker for an anchor to steady up my bow
I got one foot on the platform and the other’s on a train
Be careful what you wish for  you might get what you don’t need
I’m a brush fire on a drought land in a Santa Ana breeze
I got one foot on the platform and the other’s on a train
On second thought  get over here and wrap me in your wings
Throw caution to the wind and honey  give me what I need
 I work work work but I don't climb climb climb
 I'm a simple man
 warm up the band
 I'm ready to roll
 that hair of a dog is howling hey there man
Don't wanna hear about your mountain
How the good life is a peach
You drink your sunsets from a fountain
I just wanna get right down at the fire light
You honky tonk nighttime man
Drink away this crazy world
Hold tight to a longneck-holdin' girl
Won't you give it all boys? The fed-up give a damn

Put the seed in the ground

Main street and the high school lit up on Friday night
Down there it's another touchdown
Man  this year's team is stout

And up here so am I
Thinking about you sitting there saying I hate this  I hate it
If you couldn't stand living here why'd you take it  take it
Give me back my hometown
'Cause this is my hometown
All the colors of my youth
Are beating me black and blue cause you're in every scene
My friends try to cheer me up  get together at the Pizza Hut

I'd play in that bench back seat and listen to the songs get sung
He couldn't carry a tune in a bucket but he'd sing at the top of his lungs
Carry On My Wayward Son on the hippie radio
Songs about the flower babies and the birth of rock and roll
A boy and his dad in a Pontiac and a hippie radio
But I'll never forget those baby blues in the glow of that dashboard light

And these days  I show off my scars
With one arm around my baby
And one arm around my boys
A heart that's still pretty crazy
And a head that hates the noise
If the world comes knocking
Tell 'em I'm not home
I'm finally holdin' my own
I've burned up the fast lane
Dodging drugs and divorce
If I'm proof of anything
God sure loves Troubadours
Sometimes  late at night
I miss the smoke and neon
Sneak out of bed  grab a six-string
Play what's still turnin' me on
Like that tight old-time rock and roll
Or that right-down-home country gold
I miss blues and soul
But not more than I miss being home

Ain't never been the kind to back down
I’ve thrown a punch or two and gave a few black eyes
But Jack Daniels kicked my ass again last night
I hung in pretty good for a round or two
But he don’t fight fair like daddy taught me to
Her memory turned my head
And then he snuck up from behind
Always thought this heart was made of steel and bulletproof
But the memory of her taillights fading breaks it right in two
Guess every superman has got his kryptonite
Jack Daniels kicked my ass again last night
Well I didn’t bleed and I ain't black and blue
But it ain't hard to tell who got the better of who
Cause in the morning light I’m hard to recognize
Yeah Jack Daniels kicked my ass again last night

But as far as we've came
When it comes to love and to blame
And the breaking of a loved heart
I think we're sorely lacking methods
So I'm going with old time-tested
A jukebox and a bar
One pushes me up the mountain
And one rolls me down the hill
While I sit in a phosphorescent dark
So you can keep your fancy potions
And your incandescent notions
As for me and my barely-beating heart
There's no better prescription
For my broken disposition
Than a jukebox and a bar
We got pinpoint GPS
All you need is an address
But her love is the one thing I can't find
Meanwhile no one has a clue
How to make her memory turn loose
So much for academic minds

With a hammer and vice
If I could undo some things
And grow me some wings
Fly out of this quarter tonight
Is seeing a man with my clothes and my face
In the last thirty minutes
I've gone from a person of interest
To a full-blown manhunt underway
I did what I did
I have no regrets
When you cross the line
You get what you get
Tonight  a bleeding memory
Is tomorrow's guilty vein
Your auburn hair on a faraway sea wall
Screams across the Pontchartrain

I'ma find out what that house is made of
Been too many nights since it's felt us make love
I wanna rock some sheetrock  knock some pictures off the wall
Love you baby  like a wrecking ball
You  look at you
Send me one more shot sitting on a bathroom sink
Damn you really turn me on painting your toenails pink
Easy baby before you say

Was born in 70-something  'tween Sweet Home and You Got That Right
His mama met his daddy at a Tallahassee show
But just like Tuesday  daddy wound up gone on down the road
Lynyrd Skynyrd Jones hailed from Gadsden  Alabama
Born to carry on who his mama was a fan of
Don’t ask me no questions and I won’t tell you no lies
That’s what she always told him  right up 'til the day she died
Oh  oh-oh-oh
Oh  oh-oh-oh
Lynyrd wasn't black or white  he was somewhere in-between
Throw in abandoned and confused  and you get the blues when you’re just 13
Well  he found his salvation in a pawnshop-bought guitar
You can't teach that kind of pickin’  it’s gotta come right from your heart

Put on some this or that
Maybe I won't feel so bad

To drown out this little voice

Screamin' louder than the pain

My resolve is reeling
I can tell by the heavy in my heart
I'm goin' down soon
No use fightin' the fight
It's no contest tonight
My figured out has never been more confused
Havin' mixed drinks about feelings and you

Put on a brave face and face the night

Or the cold spot in our bed

First time I met Alabama Hannah  I was skinny as a rail
Red hair tied up in a blue bandanna
She was hotter than the Devil's hell
She turned me on to Back Porch Pickers
Jackson Pollock  and gin
Her daddy didn't trust my intentions
So he turned to his daddy's old .410

With Mr. Misunderstood  Mr. Misunderstood
So I went with it like a colt on my Plymouth
Through the glass behind my rear-view
Took a left when the world went right down 16th Avenue
Played with fire and I played on ledges
They tried to file my points  sand my edges
And I just grew out my hair

Called the Cross-Eyed Cricket Watering' Hole
Where you can hear the sound of a steel guitar
An' get loud an' rowdy on PBR
An' tip our hats
They say country's fading
But we still wavin' that flag around here
Where the people pledge allegiance to the Hag
When the weekend comes an' the weather's clear
There's a high spot fifteen miles from here
Where you can always find a few dusty trucks
With the windows down an' the radio up
But you can bet your boots that when Haggard comes on
We tip our hats
They say country's fading
But we still wavin' that flag around here
Where the people pledge allegiance to the Hag

Keepin' this turntable spinnin'
Everything from Jones to Jennings
Slowly plannin' my survival
In a three-foot stack of vinyl
Since you had to walk on outta here
