lyrics
"But I can't hear a word they say
Life just keeps moving
The world gets stranger every day
That's what people tell you
But I got to let you go
My head is saying that this is for the better
I just want you to know
I can't hold on forever
When all I wanna do is let go
All I wanna do is let go
Sirens are screaming
But I can't hear a single sound
And I'm feeling uneasy
I get the feeling that this is for the better
And I just want you to know
I can't hold on forever
When all I wanna do is let go
All I wanna do is let go

Roll through my heart is lost Lover's Refrain
To the way that we were on that runaway track
I see in my soul that I know you were lying to me
Why do I feel so old?
'Cause I'm still so young

To hear you knocking at my door
'Cause if I could see your face once more
When you said your last goodbye
I died a little bit inside
I lay in tears in bed all night
Alone without you by my side
All I want is and all I need is
So you brought out the best of me
A part of me I'd never seen
You took my soul and wiped it clean
Our love was made for movie screens

We dried our tears and we said goodbye
Another angel gone before her time
But she's still alive in our hearts and minds
What you've got until it's gone
But heaven knows that when we're old
She will be forever young
Sing out and celebrate her song
And there are things in life we can't explain
So just appreciate the little things
'Cause you never know what tomorrow brings
What you've got until it's gone
But heaven knows that when we're old
She will be forever young

On a Wednesday morning in July
Try to understand what’s in your head
I’m hearing what you said
Cause I wanted to say
When I see you this way
Don't ever let it break your heart
It feels like an empty space
You don't enjoy the taste
I just need a place to hide
Somewhere to make it right
If this isn't what you want
Head back to your own haunt
And you'll find the missing piece
Not just a big release
Maybe you lost control
Fallen into a hole
The way that it was before
Is all that you're looking for
You just need to take a step back
Is Autopilot kicking in?
You’re feeling like you'll never win
Hey maybe I can help you out?
Don't fall into your doubts
I hear you screaming out

Someone that you can read
Day in and day out

Maybe it's just too late but this is keeping me awake all night
Maybe say yes or maybe say no
Maybe I'm just too shy to admit that it is time to go
Carrying our dreams and all that they mean
Trying to make it all worthwhile
Maybe believe or maybe don't care
Maybe live long or maybe die young
Or maybe live every day like it's your last day under the sun
Carrying our dreams and all that they mean

I wish someone explained to me
How losing you was gonna make me feel
Like someone shot a hole in me
And left me out for the wolves to eat
You're in my blood
You're in my bones
On my mind wherever I go
Can you hear me?
I miss you today
(Hey-hey-hey) It's just not the same
(Hey-hey-hey)
And I still drive by your old house
Fight back tears and turn the music loud
Your favorite song  my LCD Soundsystem is always on repeat
You're in my blood

Can you hear me?

Reaching for the light
I fall back down to earth
Every single time
It always looks like you
Looks like you
You make me want to be better
Taking me back to the line
We'll always be stronger together
Take on the world when you're mine
I never believed in heroes
How darkness could turn into light
I know they say never say never
I won't stop fighting
But not fighting with you
I'll be fighting for you like I'm
And I'll keep believing

'Til my heart stops beating
'Cause you got me feeling like I'm
I wanna travel the world but I  I just can't do it alone
So I'm just waiting on fate to come wrap around me
Think about all the foreign places we could be
I'll be flicking stones at your window
I'll be waiting outside 'til you're ready to go
Won't you come down? Come away with me
Just think of all the places we could be
I'll be waiting  waiting on a brand new day
Riding on waves  walking on sand
Digging in caves to find the treasures of the land
We can write stories 'bout the journeys that we made
(We could be big in Japan)
I'll be flicking stones at your window
I'll be waiting outside 'til you're ready to go
Won't you come down? Come away with me

It's harder to lose
To admit that you're wrong when
It's easy to win
It's harder to lose
To admit that you're wrong when
You've got something to prove
You said it was easy
I tell you they're wrong
So get busy learning
What you already gone?
And people will tell you
What you want to hear
But the people who know you well and make it all clear
Life isn't easy
You got to be strong
So get busy learning

This is the hardest thing (Hardest thing)
We tried to stitch it up and now I wonder why
Why is this happening to me?
We were young but we never quite took flight
We'll be walking down the aisle dressed in white

Say goodbye and let it be

I couldn't read the signs
But I know that it means nothing
But you are always on my mind

You were the only one for me
But the truth can be deceiving
And I was just too young to see
They told me
Everything works out in the end

They told me
Everything works out in the end

You got me treading on the water
Because I've never learned to swim
And now that it's all over
I better learn to start again

Back when we were seventeen
We couldn't get enough
I see you layin' there with me
Like my missing puzzle piece
Dreaming of what we could be
We couldn't make you up
We had the songs that we sang along to
You had the moves to make me dance with you
I always saw you reaching and catching stars
We had the thing that everyone wanted
Did you get out? I'm wondering where you are
We had the songs that we sang along to
You had the moves to make me dance with you
I always saw you reaching and catching stars
We had the thing that everyone wanted
Did you get out? I'm wondering where you are
Did you follow your fire?

To be there when we're not

Ever had a feeling that you can't go on?
Trying to be strong but getting weaker
Carrying the weight of every single day
Having lost your way  feeling defeated
Sat staring  counting spiral patterns on the wall
You wonder if your luck is ever gonna turn around  but  oh
You need a little light to guide the way
Waiting on the sun to shine again
You gotta keep your head up high
You gotta keep your head up high
You need a little hope to carry on
In the middle of the night  when you're all alone
You gotta keep your head up high
You gotta keep your head up high
Your bedroom carpet stained with rosé wine
Empty's left behind  the morning after
The distant purr of cars on soaking roads
And the street echoes the noise of laughter

Confused and battered by the motion of the changing tides
You're nearing empty and you've barely got the will to fight
You wonder if you're gonna live or if you will survive
Oh

Waiting on the sun to shine again

One in every small crowd too afraid to open up  and talk
Feeling like a lost child  crying for mother's love
No one really knows why  happens to the best of us
Tell me it's a long way down
Tell me 'cause I'm with you now
And you're not broken
So keep your heart open now
Tell me that you lost yourself
Wishing you were someone else
And you're not broken
So keep your heart open now
People on the outside  they don't understand what's up
(People on the outside  they don't understand what's up)
But can they understand when you don't even know enough? Enough
Feeling like a lost child  crying for mother's love
Tell me it's a long way down

Man  you're not broken
I got a picture on my telephone of you
This tree will never grow again
Our hearts are dominoes
Tumble weeds on a desert road somewhere
Our love is coming to an end
And there's a part of me wishing
That you were standing here with me
But now my mind is moving down the road
It's a new day beginning
But there's a piece of me clinging
To all the memories and episodes
I would do anything for you
But I won't do that again
We might never get closure
Heaven knows it had to end
There's a part of me wishing
That you were standing here with me
But now  I'm looking through another lens
Maybe if hell froze over
We could be in love again
Maybe if hell froze over
We could be in love again

Bought a ticket for an aeroplane
My golden getaway
I would do anything for you

Being someone else is not my style
There's a missing piece I'm trying to find
I've had such a week
I just wanna take off flying
Words are only words
Take my hand and go there with me
There's no hide and seek
What's the mystery?
Somewhere in between
Real and make believe
You've got what I need
I'm hanging on to see if we collide

Seems to me like I'm just scared of never feelin' it again
I know it's crazy to believe in silly things
But it's not that easy
To when it all first started
But I only got myself to blame for it
And I accept it now
But It's not that easy
But I've got high hopes
It takes me back to when we started
High hopes
High hopes
When it all comes to an end
But the world keeps spinning around
And in my dreams I meet the ghosts of all the people
Who've come and gone
But they leave you far too soon

I wouldn't sing the way I sing  without you
You fill my eyes up with color
And you'll always be my mother
I wouldn't be who I am
I wouldn't be the son that I am
Without a father who showed me I can
Face all the bullies at school
You taught me how to keep my cool
I wouldn't be who I am
I wouldn't be the brother I am
Without a sister who understands
My ambitions and dreams
We always were on the same team
I wouldn't be who I am

Even pushed away my father
I was caught up in the rat race
Living in a dark place
I was standing there in silence
In a church somewhere in Ireland
It was there I was reminded
In the stakes that I corrected
And the people I affected
And the one's that I respected
 you enchant me even when you're not around
 there are boundaries
 your love
You light up my cold heart
We're running round like love is what we found
Like nothing else could matter in our life
The sun will stop shining soon
And you'll be dark from my life
It's as simple as a change of heart
A love like this won't last forever
I know that a love like this won't last forever
Slipping into the night love
It grows dark but you don't mind
All that I was thinking is cleaning up my conscience
I got lost in the memory as it shakes up the corners of my heart
Was it my mistake?
Or maybe it was just as simple as a change in your heart

All that I was thinking about was cleaning up my conscience
Lost in the memory as it shakes up the corners of my heart

Is now alright
Where has the time gone?

If you’re ever feeling lonely
If you’re ever feeling down
You should know you’re not the only one
Because I feel it with you now
When the world is on your shoulders
And you’re falling to your knees
Oh please
You know love will set you free
I took a long and lonely walk
Up to an empty house
That's where I've come from
Where have you come from?

I've got to live without

Life has to go on

I'm making my way up to the street where we last kissed
In one hand  I hold a picture of you
In the other  I hold the pieces of my heart
In the other  I hold the pieces of my heart
Was my love not enough? Did I ask too much?
As my heart turns to rust over you
And so long  I've got trouble sleeping
I can't help but feeling a little insecure  so unsure
Was my love not enough? Did I ask too much?
I can't accept we’re growing older but I guess that's just the way it has to be
I wondered how you still remembered me
I heard you settled down and that you married happily
And reminisce about the days when we were still together
Maybe someday further down the line
And I will meet you there
Sometime in the future we can share our stories
But until that day comes along I'll keep on moving on
I’ll keep on moving on
It's funny how but it still bothers me
I know it's been so long but I did not expect to see oh how beautiful you are
I guess that all that time apart has done you well
But hey I wish you all the best and maybe someday we might even meet again
And reminisce about the days when we were still together
Maybe someday further down the line
And I will meet you there
Sometime in the future we can share our stories
But until that day comes along
Until that day comes along
Until that day comes along
I'll keep on moving on

How are you still holdin' on?
You felt this way for far too long
Waitin' for a change to come
You know you're not the only one
And life passes you by
Don't be wastin' your time on your own
You're always tryin' to see yourself
Through the eyes of someone else
Through the eyes of someone else
Too shy to say that you need help
You and everybody else
You and everybody else
Oh  life passes you by
Don't waste your time on your own
Yeah  life passes you by

I always knew you had a heavy heart
Brother  brother  you're taking me back to the start
I saw your face in a photograph
Painting a picture of a better time
In a perfect world  in a perfect world

I'll pray for you
Do you pray for me?

And you slipped away from me without talking
The look in your eye was stronger than this
And I drink alone to stop me from weeping
What's left of my heart is forever yours
Forever yours
I'll pray for you
Do you pray for me?
I'll pray for you
Still you hurt on everyone
In the dips of you  the sparks are good
But you're not even trying trying
You feel the knife in your gut
But you're so scared of what you want
You bite you lip  and hold your tongue
What are you hiding? (hiding)
We got tired of your charms
And tired of your false alarms
You're just a book that never turns its page
You can stand on the edge shouting out that you're ready to change ready to change
You can say what you want

Where the stars were shining or the sun was blinding our eyes
But I still find pieces of you in the back of my mind
And all of the things that we once said
They're not in my heart they're in my head
That was the time to say goodbye
That was then and this is now
I heard you made your way downtown to the place I'd been hanging around
I was looking for your face in the crowd but trying to keep my head down
Over time our wires crossed when you changed and the truth got lost

Grab your coat and make a call
I'll meet you down in Temple Bar
People come and people go
So raise a glass to who you know
Winter hasn't taken hold
So why do I feel so cold?
Like a question without an answer
Like music without its dancers
Like a bird without a song
Like a frame without a picture
Like God without a scripture
Like me when I know you're gone
Saw a girl that I used to know
It's funny how the heart moves on
She's got a home and a family
I get the feeling she's forgotten me
People leave their mark and go
Like footprints in the winter snow
When winter hasn't taken hold
Why do I feel so cold?

You might think you found the one
Until your heart gets ripped and torn
But I'm not searching for the answer
I'm not looking for the truth
I'm just talking through a speaker
Because that's all that I have ever learned to do
Use your mind and make it talk
Cause in this world it's all you've got
We all fall down from the highest clouds to the lowest ground
The loneliness is worst of all
When you've got no one else to call

I wish you could be here

Walking on water but the seas got rough
I wish you could be here

Be fighting for no reason  I wouldn't change it for the world

I was never gonna let you
Let you slip away
And I still remember feeling nervous
Trying to find the words to
Get you here today
You make my heart feel like it's summer
When the rain is pouring down
You make my whole world feel so right when it’s wrong
That’s how I know that you are the one
That’s why I know you are the one
Life is easy to be scared of
With you I am prepared for
What is yet to come
Cause our two hearts will make it easy
Joining up the pieces

We are caught up
Stuck in the middle of our love
Chasing the riddle of what we need
We are all we need
It's your touch  gives me a shiver and a wild rush
Chasing the riddle of what we need
We are all we need
We are all–
Come on  do it again
Hold me like you did before

A curious feeling no one can explain
And I just don't know if I'll risk it again

So we just lay around in someone's house
Someday I'll have it all again just like way back when
Back then we'd sleep until the afternoon
Then we'd just get up and go outside
When I'm old and when I'm grey and when I stop working
Well we'd go drinking in the afternoon
Lie out on the grass and fall asleep
And throw together everything we had
And then go driving in my parents' car
We never strayed too far
