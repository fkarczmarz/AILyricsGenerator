"Come from way above
Her eyes
She's on the dark side
You are my angel
Come from way above
This time is fixed  let's sweeten our facilities
It took all the man in me
To be the thug you wanted me to be
Shall we take a spin again  no witnesses?
This time is fixed seven three seven is
You won't feel a thing
Begging until you give it up and sing
Fish like little silver knives
Make the cuts on my inside
My blood will slide in metal studs
Tourniquet will hold its groove
Tourniquet will keep its grip
It took all the man in me
To be the thug you wanted me to be
Yeah  let him feast my heart is big
My heart is big  my blood will slide
You let him feast my heart is big
My heart is big  my blood will slide

Got nothing to lose but my chains
Internet feeds on my brains
Head in the sand  feet in the clay
And time is still like grease it slips
Nothing to lose but my chains
Internet beats on my brains
Head in the sand  feet in the clay
A place to piss  a place to pray
A little money should get me on my feet
This gun of smoke is slaying me
And time is still like grease it slips
My heart was big and like my pride
Let them feast on my insides
And when the filled had spilled its guts
Gently open then it shuts
I'm in the hole
Three thousand days
A buried soul
They live the dream
In terminal
No war too mean
I know the drill
Got cells to burn
I'm dressed to kill
A mortal coil
And time is still
On secret soil
Yeah  pay the bills
Cells to burn
Mouths to fill
On Boeing jets
In the sunset make glowing threats
Say it was my babel
It was my babel
Tell your people
Now you know it's over
Rolling off her shoulder
You can take a ladder to the shadows
And forget
Was it how she kissed you?
And then dismissed you?
Was it purposeful and
Was it just to hook you in?
Well you lost your girlfriend
She was not going
Where you were going
You were on your own
He was quick to burning
He was slow to learning
Though his eyes were misted
He still kissed her when she cried
You did your best to please her
You didn't up and leave her

Would you listen to see
She led you to me
We felt it truly
As we could in love
I wanna be the one who should've said truth and not dare
I'm running so far out of my head
This rain of heart that ripples my pain
 TV antennas in the back

Just cause you're blue don't make me too
And though you've found you need more than me
Don't talk to me about being free
That's freedom without love
And magic without love
And magic without love
Hear me say
Better things will surely come our way

Better things will surely come our way
And save your line about needing to be free
You want freedom without love

Light from pages
Paper thin thing
Protected by the naked eye
Pearly sunrise

Don't stand by the door  come near me
We've been here before  don't fear me
Don't stand by the door  come near me
Quick thought  left or right
Could it be a strong case of fight or flight?
We'd never know you're slightly overworked and self-conscious
Sweating beads of doubt
This ain't like on TV
Pretty for an aftershave
I'm scared life will leave me
Strung out  in need of love
Surely I'm as overcome but brimstone won't come to lungs
But I ain't done  surely I ain't done
Oh  but my mind's on the run
Caused by your never-ending dream
And it ain't what it seems
Ain't what it seems
Know what I mean?

Mad  this monkey on my back
Pulling hair like puppet strings  slow to react
Life's drive slow-mo
Front crawl in Speedos
Fight against the rising tide
Breathe deep  never stop clawing at the light
Clinging on to what we got
But I ain't done  I ain't done
But my mind's on the run

Caused by your never-ending dream

Yes  Daddy
Daydreaming
I quietly observe standing in my space
Daydreaming
Way that we say 'em in style that we writ 'em in
Massive Attack  we keep it strong just like a vitamin
Going for the positive  wiping out the negative songs
The passer's picking up all the lyrics on the dance floor
That raise your spirit level 'cause it demands for
Attitude is cool  degrees below zero
Up against the wall  behaving like De Niro
Tricky's performing  taking his phono
Making a stand with a tan  touch it like cocoa
Smooth to keep you moving at the back now
Free is the needle  it's moving through the track now
Dance to the drummer's beats  we need new sticks
Bounce around the vibes like acoustics
A paper which you use my tongue to lick with
Trouble and strife ain't no sunshine in my life
Wiseguys get protection when they carry a knife
They shouldn't have been born  they're making me yawn
But I just take it easy  it's a Sunday morn'
So  you come on light my fire and
Together we'll grow forever  watch my Akai rig go
Because my Akai rig goes boom  boom
My Akai rig goes boom
In case you never know us if we don't give a damn and uh
And it's hard to handle  keep your distance
Resist and the posse gets the pleasure of this dance
The cool breeze that you welcome in the heat
You don't see it but you feel it when it's blowing on the street
If I was a rich man
Da da dada
I quietly observe  standing in my space
It's the devious days they call the rat race
It's a concrete jungle  evil in the town
But what happen when the bomb drops Down
Don't make sound  yes
'Cause the dance floor's a desert and the dancers are parched
Do a rain dance and your brain's still marsh
My heavy  my brother get lighter than helium
Float above the world to break the tedium
Living in my headphones  Sony's what I say to 'em
The surreal boom of the Budokan stadium

Well  I'm floating on air when I'm daydreaming
I quietly observe standing in my space
Can't be with the one I love  I love the one that I miss
I'm very down to earth but brain sits on top floor
Don't need another lover just need  I'm insecure
The weather is a-changin'  the storms be shakin'
The love that you take is equal to the love you're makin'
Here comes the sun little darlin here comes the sun (It's alright)
I like the beat so we need another copy
We're natives of the massive territory and we're proud
Get peaceful in the dance  adapt the glory and the crowd
The problem ain't a different kind of skin tricks
I love my neighbor  I don't wait for the olympics
See you go hooligan  you're trying to play the fool again
Caught you in the lost and found
When your posse weren't around
No craft
So  you're going for you tool again
Daydreaming
I quietly observe standing in my space
Daydreaming
My swaying tide
Conveying my
That swaying time
Tapestry
I see tapestry
I see tapestry
Golden tapestry
What would it take to get back to the blackness?
When we gonna be like stars?
What would it take to know?
In the beauty of the night sky
Taking a peep at the history
Messages in the mystery
Further to what the eye may see
Eye to eye with these reasonings
More to gain from believing in
Watching you wave that dependency
'Cause to live or to die for
We all search for some kind of truth
Hurt will make it inclined to be
Type the type for self righteous
Black it before and behind us
Nature might remind us
Fear for fear but where time lives
Secretly in those eyelids
All for one with one iris
Black it before and behind us
Nature might remind us
Fear for fear but where time lives
Secretly in those eyelids
All for one but one iris

Flashing light years
Flashing light years
Flashing right here
Flashing light years
Dancing upon these timelines
Knowing that the time lies
Before and ahead of us
Lose your head then head it up
Just now we get perspective
Deep love for the unexpected
That special request is
Made for the sole investments
The bank upon these fortunes
That just can't be exhausted
Those infinite resources
Where you just don't need to force it
The work is where the force is
The transport for sport lives
Amongst and beyond it
The seekers and the finders
Sure as death can find us
One inside the tapestry
Flashing light years

I think I kinda lost myself again
Day  yesterday
Really should be leaving  but I stay
Say  say my name
I need a little love to ease the pain
I need a little love to ease the pain
It's easy to remember when it came
'Cause it feels like I've been
I've been here before
You're not my savior
But I still don't go
Feels like something
That I've done before
I could fake it
But I'd still want more
Fade  made to fade

Blessed by the drink upon the corners where we've seen it
Chased by the plaintiff  haunted by the medium
Too high to flow toward to break the tedium
Glow from my TV set was blue like neon
Activated the remote  I put the BBC on
I've seen this city somewhere  I'm looking out for no one
Pallor in my eyes it get blue like neon
Hell is round the corner where I shelter
Isms and schisms  we're living helter-skelter
If you believe I'll deceive then common sense says  Shall you receive.
Let me take you down the corridors of my life
And when you walk  do you walk to your preference?
No need to answer till I take further evidence
I seem to need a reference to get resident
A reference to your preference to say I'm a good neighbor
I try to say judge me for my labour
I walk in a bar and immediately I sense danger
Hard to get a drink or a girl to relax
Upon phono  no go zone I go through
Aching awaits just to relocate you
Be careless with your fist
Now baby mix it with me
You see me function better when I get approximately
High by my typical flyby
I function better with the Sun in my eyes  so goodbye

Sitting in my daycare  me diego painted
Colliding with the jam
Until the drink got dated
Window indigo when they go boom
I run outside my room
No sensing you can trust me
I climb on my sofa
I roll in a daydream
You see a man's face
But you don't see his heart
You see a man's face
You will never know his thoughts
Everywhere you go
There's a man to say love
Never neither  never neither take it to heart
For your heart is your heart
And your thoughts is your thoughts
Never mix love with hatred
You see a man's face
You will never see his heart
You see a man's face
But you will never know his thoughts
You see a man's face
You will never know his thoughts
Paints the views in no-man's news
Blades will fade from blood sport
The heroin's cut these fuses short
Smokers rode a colonial pig
Drink and frame this pain I think
I'm melting silver poles my dear
You bleed your wings and then disappear
The moving scenes and pilot lights
Smithereens have got 'em scaling heights
Modern times come talk me down
And battle lines are drawn cross this town
Parisian boys without your names
Ghetto stones instead of chains
Talk them down cause it's up in flames
And nothing's changed
Parisian boys without your names
Riot like 1968 again
More pretty flames
And now your words they strike me down
The flags are false and they contradict
They point and click which wounds to lick
On avenues this Christian breeze
Turns it heart to more needles please
Our eyes roll back and we beg for more
It frays this skin and then underscore
The case for war you spin and bleed
The sales you feel screensavers feed
The girls you breed the soaps that you write
The graceless charm of your gutter snipes
The moving scenes and suburbanites
And smithereens got us scaling heights
Modern times come talk me down
The battle lines are drawn across this town

I could be yours
We can unwind
All these half-floors
All these half-floors
All these half-floors
Will lead to mine
We are the curious
We can unwind
All these half-floors
All these half-floors
Will lead to mine
We'll see to

We can unwind all our floors

And I know our love will last forever
You I love and not another
And I know we'll always be together
Four and five and six love
But I believe in one love
I believe in one love
Some men don't feel secure
Unless they have a woman on each arm
They say don't lay your eggs in one basket
If the basket should fall all your eggs'll be broken
But I believe in one love
I believe in one love
I believe in one love

We can roll ourselves over 'cause we're uncomfortable
But we like it when we're spinning in his grin
For the ones that feel it the most
Look at her with her eyes like a flame
She will love you like a fly will never love you again
It's unfortunate that when we feel a stone
We can roll ourselves over when we're uncomfortable
But we like it when we're spinning in his grin
For the one that feels it the most
Look at her with her smile like a flame
A system failure left behind
And their necks crane
As they turn to pray for rain
And their necks crane
Dull residue of what once was
A shattered cloud of swirling doves
And their eyes change
As they learn to see through flames

Drops on rocks fall fast and fleeting
Hearts and wings commence to beating
What's unseen with all believing
Vision walls fall all receding

Drops on rocks come fast and fleeting

Usher us into the dreaming

Hearts and wings commence to beating
Vision walls fall fast and fleeting
Vision walls fall all revealing

In deepest hollows of our minds

Dull residue of what once was

But she don't believe anyone can help her
But you don't wanna get involved
You tell her she can manage
And you can't change the way she feels
But you could put your arms around her
I know you wanna live yourself
But could you forgive yourself
If you left her just the way you found her?

Looking for you in my flashlight  I'm searching
From in the high or down the ocean
And I face myself in reason
Gain the wolf
Gain the wolf
Conjure me as a child
Slipping down a wet side
Stretch up  I cannot reach him
Jumping up  they drag him from the water
I watch them march him into life
I watch them take him from the pain
Into the sky for your eagle eye
The sun seeds a sickle and a scythe
Ridicule they won't allow
Quench abuse and let love flower
Rip the cage out of your chest
Let the chaos rule the rest
Show without showing
What you know without knowing
Twigs snap  I catch
No canoe  only you and me
Alone on the old teal sea

We're on a foreign shore
It was the mark of falling
I was the car still running

The sunset begging me

You lick a shine upon your forehead or
Check it by the signs in the corridor
You light my ways through the club maze
We would struggle through the dub daze
I see myself in there upon my lover
It's how you go down to the men's room sink
Sad we talk of how madmen think
I see myself in there upon my lover
I don't know her from another miss
I don't know you from another
Why you want to take me to this party and breathe?
I'm dying to leave
Every time we grind we know we severed lines
Where have all those flowers gone?

It's hard to decide what is real these days
When things look so dizzy to me
I already know my children's children's faces
Voices that I've heard before
There's always more
There's always more
To my home which everybody owns
I feel like a thousand years have passed

I feel like the world is my home at last
I know everyone that I meet

I heard a thousand years before

Nor tell him all the things that make you cry

You see such bad things happening
There are many good men
The deadliest of sin is pride

But there are always two sides
Take a look around the world
You see such mad things happening
There are few good men
The evening it chokes the candle it burns
This disguise covers bitter lies
Repeating the joke the meaning it dies

I'm letting you know I know what you need
I'll turn you around this beautiful town
And then you'll believe it when your eyes then deceive you
Don't lose It
Its getting colder outside your rented space
They shadowbox and they paper chase
It never stops and we'll never learn
No hope without dope the jobless return
The bankers have bailed the mighty retreat
The pleasure it fails at the end of the week

To what you receive is eternited leave

Honey scars I'll keep you near

We killed the time and I love you dear
A kiss of wine we'll disappear

Divisible invisible
The last of the last particles
You stay by yourself
You avoid all weakness
Just because you are rasta
You move to the country
You live in the hills
You avoid all company
They want to know all your business
You live in the city
You mind your own business
They never mind their own business

You live in the hills
You think you're far from the weak
They want to know rasta business
