lyrics
"To ditch myself and get outside
Dancing women throwing plates
Decapitating their laughing dates
Swirling chickens caught in flight
Out of focus  much too bright
Coming down
Shiny teeth
Game show suckers trying to bleed
But I got a drug and I got the bug
And I got something better than love
How you like me now?
Pretty good
Going on  feeling strong
I quit my job blowing leaves
Telephone bills up my sleeves
Choking like a one man dust bowl
Freedom rock slime ball talking in code
Went down
Lit up the shack
Grab me a beer out of the sack
Everybody bent over twice
Painting the walls  throwing some dice
Leaping up into the air getting juiced up beyond belief

Winos throwing Frisbees at the sun
Put my soul between a bun
Now I'm hungry  now I'm drunk
Now I'm running like a flaming pig

Scraping off the attitude
Old man eating all my food
Don't be kind  don't be rude
Just shake your boots and let it all get loose
(Oh yeah  my goodness)
Fluffy clouds
Jumping rainbows

What's happening?
What'd I mean?
The songbird calling
Across the water
Outside my silent asylum
Left me standing all alone
So cut me down to size
So I can fit inside
Lies that will divide
Us both in time
See the turncoat on his knees
The vagabond that no one sees
When that moon stole your shadows
When you can't save the ones you caught in battle
Left me standing all alone
Cut me down to size
So I can fit inside
Lies you tried to hide
Behind your eyes

I can feel it minute by minute by day
I don't want it running all night this way
Why you got to get it on my mind this way?
Saying what I feel
What can I tell you? Don't know
Why you have to be like that?
Alligator teardrops fall
Burning wears off like a miracle
I don't need anyone to turn me on
And when the feeling is over
There's no explanation
Shock to the system
Infatuation
Shake like a flower
Strange revelation
Crown of a nation
(I'm) Saying what I feel

As they made mincemeat of the dreams you hung your hopes on
So you counted out what your sins cost
How long must I wait
Before the thrill is gone
You drove your Rolls into the swamp
Of the price they put upon your soul
You buy it back from the burning ashes of the devil you know
How long must I wait

Hammer my bones on the anvil of daylight

See me down at the station by the lane with my hands in my pocket
Jingling a wish coin
That I stole from a fountain that was drowning all the cares in the world
When I get older
Climbing up on the back porch fence just to see the dogs running
With a ring and a question
And my shivering voice is singing through a crack in the window
Na na-na na-na na
Down on the corner
See me standing on a makeshift road with the dust storm blowing
In a long black shadow
Pull a hammer from a coal mine down where your daddy was working
Comb my hair back
Strike a match on a bathroom wall where my number is written
Driving on the sidewalk
Looking back and the sky is burning in my rear-view mirror

Yellow roses in the graveyard
Got no time to watch them grow

Skeleton boys hyped up on purple
Smoke rings blow from across the disco
Bank notes burn like broken equipment
Making their dreams out of papier-mâché
Cliche wasted hate taste tested

With magic markers running out of their ink

Someone will sweep up my lazy bones

With the plastic eyeballs  spray paint the vegetables
Dog food stalls with the beefcake pantyhose
Kill the headlights and put it in neutral
Stock car flaming with the loser in the cruise control
Baby's in Reno with the vitamin D
Got a couple of couches  sleep on the loveseat
Someone came  saying I'm insane to complain
About a shotgun wedding and a stain on my shirt
Don't believe everything that you breathe
You get a parking violation and a maggot on your sleeve
So shave your face with some mace in the dark
Saving all your food stamps and burning down the trailer park

Ban all the music with the phony gas chamber
'Cause one's got a weasel  and the other's got a flag
One's on the pole  shove the other in a bag
With the rerun shows and the cocaine nose job
The daytime crap of the folksinger slob
He hung himself with a guitar string
A slab of turkey neck  and it's hanging from a pigeon wing

This morning
Won't you show me the way it used to be?
We've gone all around
Till there's nothing left to say
We've worn it all down
Into something that couldn't be saved
You tore it all down
And bury me underneath the weight

This morning
I let down my defenses
This morning
It was just you and me
This morning
I've run all out of guesses
This morning
It’s not the tension that I feel
It’s not the face that I’m showing you today
What I need
What I need
What I need right now is right here
Right in front of me
What I need
What I need
What I need right now is right here
Only you and me
And I really don’t know what I want
And everything that I know went wrong
And if it means that it’s done and I’m a fool
But I want to forget what we’ve been through
Just to save us both from what we knew

A throwaway from an open grave
Cut you loose from a chain gang and let you go
And on the day you said it's true
Tried to tell you I never knew it could be so sweet
Who could ever be so cruel
Blame the devil for the things you do
It's such a selfish way to lose

When the moon is a counterfeit
Better find the one that fits
Better find the one that lights the way for you
When the road is full of nails
Garbage pails and darkened jails
And their tongues are full of heartless tales

You fade into a shaded room

Torn apart by idle hands
Through the helter skelter morning
Fix yourself while you still can
No more ashes to ashes
No more cinders from the sky
Let all the laws of creation
Tell a dead man how to die
And storms up above
Like a stray dog gone defective
Like a paper tiger in the sun
Looking through a broken diamond
To make the past what it should be
Through the ruins and the weather
Capsized boats in the sea
And storms up above

Tonight the city is full of morgues
And all the toilets are overflowing
There's shopping malls coming out of the walls
As we walk out among the manure
That's why
I pay no mind

Give the finger to the rock n roll singer
As he's dancing upon your pay check
The sales climb high through the garbage pail sky
Like a giant dildo crushing the sun

 a burden of hope
 a low life laugh

I didn't have no teeth so I stole his gun

Standing right here with a beer in my hand
And my mouth is full of sand and I don't understand
Fourteen days I been sleeping in a barn
Better get a paycheck tattooed on my arm
Whistling Dixie with the Dixie cup filled
With the barbecue sauce and the dental floss chill
Big fat fingers pointing into my face
Telling me to get busy cleaning up this place
I got bent like a wet cigarette
And she's coming after me with a butterfly net
Riding on a bloodhound ringing the bell
Black cat wrapped in a road map of hell
Pencil on my leg and I'm trying not to beg
Taking turns baking worms with the bacon and eggs
Now they got me in a birdcage flapping my jaw
Like a pretzel in the stars just waiting to fall
So give me what I got to get so I can go
Cause I ain't washing dishes in the ditch no more

From the sound of your own voice
Calling no one
Just a silence
Learn to see around the edge
Follow the avalanche

Keeps you under
Takes you over
The wall that love divides
Between
Waking and slumber
Turn away
Turn
