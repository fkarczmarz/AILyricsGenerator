lyrics
"Take your time  rather than hurry
Never too late to write the best of your story
Remember to breathe or else you're gonna be sorry
Life's no race  it's a companion
Always face with reckless abandon
The ticket to life as my mother once told me
Stick with your pride and you're gonna be lonely (gonna be lonely)
Everybody says that life takes patience
But nobody wants to wait
Everybody says we need salvation
But nobody wants to be saved
The light in the tunnel is just another runaway train
The blue skies we wait on
Are gonna have to come after the rain
Spend your days happy and grateful
Avoid the taste of wanting and wasteful
Every good thing will come in moderation
Envy and greed will only lead to frustration
Choose your friends  carefree and kindly
Choose your words  careful and wisely
Always be there to lend a comforting shoulder
One will be there to share a day when you're older (a day when you're older)

Everybody says that life takes patience
But nobody wants to wait
Everybody says we need salvation
But nobody wants to be saved
The light in the tunnel is just another runaway train
The blue skies we wait on
Are gonna have to come after the rain
All mistakes  committed upon us
Always take a toll on the conscience
Every regret is a debt that you live with
Never forget to remember forgiveness
Everybody says that life takes patience
But nobody wants to wait
Everybody says we need salvation
But nobody wants to be saved
The light in the tunnel is just another runaway train
The blue skies we wait on
Are gonna have to come after the rain (ra-ai-ai-ain)
Gonna have to come after the rain (ra-ai-ai-ain)
Gonna have to come after the rain (ra-ai-ai-ain)

Just got my license back
I got this feeling in my veins this train is coming off the track
I'll ask polite if the devil needs a ride
Because the angel on my right ain't hanging out with me tonight
I'm driving past your house while you were sneaking out
I got the car door opened up so you can jump in on the run
Your mom don't know that you were missing
She'd be pissed if she could see the parts of you that I've been kissing
Screamin'
No  we're never gonna quit
Ain't nothing wrong with it
Just acting like we're animals (Animals)
No  no matter where we go
'Cause everybody knows
We're just a couple of animals (Animals)
So come on baby  get in
Get in  just get in
Check out the trouble we're in
You're beside me on the seat
Got your hand between my knees
And you control how fast we go by just how hard you wanna squeeze
It's hard to steer when you're breathing in my ear
But I got both hands on the wheel while you got both hands on my gears
By now  no doubt that we were heading south
I guess nobody ever taught her not to speak with a full mouth
'Cause this was it  like flicking on a switch
It felt so good I almost drove into the ditch
I'm screamin'

Look at the trouble we're in
We were parked out by the tracks
We're sitting in the back and we just started getting busy
When she whispered What was that?
The wind  I think 'cause no one else knows where we are
And that was when she started screamin'
That's my dad outside the car!
Must have wound up on the floor while we were switching our positions
I guess they knew that she was missing
As I tried to tell her dad it was her mouth that I was kissing

I got a fist full of whiskey  the bottle just bit me
Oh  that shit makes me bat shit crazy
We got no fear  no doubt  all in  balls out
We're going out tonight (Hey!)
To kick out every light (Hey!)
Take anything we want (Hey!)
Drink everything in sight (Hey!)
We're going 'til the world stops turning
While we burn it to the ground tonight
Ooh

We're screaming like demons  swinging from the ceiling
I got a fist full of fifties  tequila just hit me
We got it lined up  shot down  firing back straight crown

My buddy Bradley's in the middle
Darcy's lookin' out the window
We just got high and hopin' no one can tell
But with the icky of the sticky
It don't matter where the wind blows
Lighter in my hand and I've got nothing to burn
Except a little turpentine inside of those five paint cans
Get grandpa's shotgun and we'll all take turns
But don't you ever say a word
Cause you know momma's gonna hate that
The dice that we've been rollin'
With our lives are better stolen
When you're walking through the fire for fun
Tidal wave in motion
You can't hide from the explosion
We're smokin' dynamite
Too many fuses to light
A thousand fahrenheit and we're about to ignite
So keep the throttle to the bottom
We may never see tomorrow
We'll need a coin for the ferryman
Leave us a coin for the ferryman

And Main Street's dying now
It's like there's nothing left of it
No more high school grounds
They tore that building down
And everything with it I miss
I call up my old friends
So lost since I've seen them
Feels like we're back there instantly to me
We'd all meet at Shawn's
The backyard fire's on
And we'd start telling tales of how life used to be
The years have come and gone
But these stories carry on
'Cause you should've seen the size of the guys we were fightin'
And we shouldn't be alive at the speeds we were driving
But Momma always taught us never to tell a lie
And every ten yard pass always turned into twenty
Every girl we were with never cost any money
And we drank more tequila than any man alive
Every time we're together

Just one chance  just one breath
Just in case there's just one left
'Cause you know

Been far away for far too long

Convincing his belief for what you love

Another charlatan to idolize
Is this suppression just in my mind? (Just in my mind?)

To find the one in this life
The one we all dream of
But dreams just aren't enough
So I'll be waiting for the real thing
I'll know it by the feeling
The moment when we're meeting
Will play out like a scene
Straight off the silver screen
So I'll be holding my breath
Right up 'til the end
Until that moment when
I find the one that I'll spend forever with
'Cause nobody wants to be the last one there
'Cause everyone wants to feel like someone cares
Someone to love with my life in their hands

'Cause nobody wants to do it on their own (Their own)
And everyone wants to know they're not alone (Not alone)
There's somebody else that feels the same somewhere (The same somewhere)

Could this be the end?

I find the one that I'll spend forever with?

Need a brand new view in front of me
Don't need no map  no need to pack
And don’t care much if we come back

'Cause every time we cross state lines
The grass we find on the other side
Always seems to twist up twice as green (Hey!)

And four bald tires still rollin' right

That you finally fall in love? (That you finally fall in love)
If today was your last day
If today was your last day
Would you make your mark by mending a broken heart?
You know it's never too late to shoot for the stars
Regardless of who you are
So do whatever it takes (Takes)
'Cause you can't rewind a moment in this life
Let nothin' stand in your way (Way)
'Cause the hands of time are never on your side
If today was your last day
And tomorrow was too late
Could you say goodbye to yesterday?
Would you live each moment like your last?
Leave old pictures in the past?
And would you call old friends you never see?
Reminisce old memories?
Would you find that one you're dreamin' of?
Swear up and down to God above
Like wounded soldiers in need of healing
Time to be honest  this time I'm pleading
Please don't dwell on it  'cause I didn't mean it
I can’t believe I said I'd lay our love on the ground
But it doesn't matter 'cause I've made it up  forgive me now
Every day I spend away  my soul's inside out
Gotta be some way that I can make it up to you now  somehow
By now you'd know that I'd come for you
But only if you told me to
And I'd fight for you
I'd lie  it's true
Give my life for you
You know I'd always come for you
I was blindfolded  but now I'm seeing
My mind was closing  now I'm believing
I finally know just what it means to let someone in
To see the side of me that no one does or ever will
So if you're ever lost and find yourself all alone
I'd search forever just to bring you home
Here and now  this I vow

And now the ring that's on my hand
It was given to me by her

And dream of ways to get higher

Of finding yourself stuck out on the ledge
And there ain't no healing
From cutting yourself with the jagged edge
I'm telling you that  it's never that bad
Take it from someone who's been where you're at
Laid out on the floor
And you're not sure you can take this anymore
So just give it one more try to a lullaby
And turn this up on the radio

And if you can't tell  I'm scared as hell
'Cause I can't get you on the telephone
So just close your eyes (Close your eyes)
Your very own lullaby
Please let me take you
Out of the darkness and into the light
'Cause I have faith in you
That you're gonna make it through another night
Stop thinking about the easy way out
There's no need to go and blow the candle out
Because you're not done
You're far too young

Wings are growing out of me
The floor is floating underneath
I can see the future burning bright

The ceiling has us mesmerized
It feels like we could never die
Heading for the dark side of the moon
As we lift off into the sky
Invincible and so alive
Ten feet tall and fucking bulletproof

'Cause time itself is standing still
Why's the room still spinning just the same?
Turn off your phone so no one calls
'Cause you and I are tripping balls

See no signs of ever coming down

Finger on the trigger  loaded bullet
He hit the stage so full of rage And let the whole world know it
Please God  don't let him pull it
How could you put us through it?
His brother watched you do it
How could you take his life away? (What made you think you had the right?)
How could you be so full of hate? (To take away somebody's life)
And when I heard you let him die and made the world all wonder why
I sat at home and on my own  I cried alone
And scratched your name on the side of a bullet
And in the wake of his mistake So many lives are broken
Gone forever from a loaded bullet
And no excuse that you could use Could pull somebody through it
And to this day so many say  God why'd you let him do it?
How could you let him do it?
How could you put us through it?
His brother watched him do it

A coward can save the day
When the bravest of men just stand by
So what if we all stand up?
What if we don't give in?
What if we traded all complacency for a voice that won't be ignored?
How can we just give up?
How can we just give in?
What if the silent majority wasn't silent anymore?
A candle's the smallest light
But a handful becomes a lighthouse
The one with the loudest voice is rarely the one to follow

Need the wallet of a baller for this appetite
Unsafe and unwise to be going after mine
Fallin' for her every night

And I can see this song will be about you
I can't believe that I can breathe without you
But all I need to do is carry on
The next line I write down
And there's a tear that falls between the pages
I know that pain's supposed to heal in stages
But it depends which one I'm standing on
Describing love can't be this tough
I could throw it in the river and watch it sinking slowly
Tie the pages to a plane and send it to the moon
Unless I sing this song to you
I'm dying to show you
This could end happily ever after
There doesn't ever have to be disaster
And all you have to do is sing along

Serving up the worst regret
Waiting for the chance
Serpents love the circumstance
Speaking to the sky
Sleight of hand and cheap disguise
Naming of your price
Payment for the sacrifice
Demon in your ear
Evil on your breath
You've brought the wolves right here
You've brought the kiss of death
You just betrayed him (You just betrayed...)
The moment we've all been waiting
No one can save him (No one can save...)
You won't believe until he's gone
Your noose is waiting (No need to wait)
You just betrayed him (You just betrayed...)

Lookin' like another Bob Marley day
Hittin' from the bong like a diesel train
And I'm down with hangin' out this afternoon
We got weeds in the backyard four feet tall
Cheech and Chong probably woulda' smoked them all
So I'm out on the couch this afternoon
Beer bottles layin' on the kitchen floor
So I doubt we'll go without this afternoon
Ohh!
You better hang on if you're taggin' along
'Cause we'll be doin' this 'till six in the mornin'
Nothin' wrong with goin' all night long
Tough to put the brakes on
Doesn't matter when you'd rather
Me and all my friends
And then we do it all again

Landlord says I should buy a tent
But he can kiss my ass 'cause I paid the rent
So I doubt he'll kick me out this afternoon
Down on the corner in a seedy bar
Juke box crankin' out the CCR
Had a few to Suzy Q this afternoon
Ohh!
You better hang on if you're taggin' along
'Cause we'll be doin' this 'till six in the mornin'
Nothin' wrong with goin' all night long
Tough to put the brakes on
Doesn't matter when you'd rather
Me and all my friends
And then we do it all again
Me and all my friends
And then we do it all again
Don't want a wristwatch or an alarm clock
To see what time it is
From the moment I wake up
I just love being with my friends
And hope it never ends
We drink all day till we fall down
So we can do it all again
It's not the human walk
It's the human race
If you ain't livin' on the edge
You're takin' too much space
So I doubt I'll figure out just what to do
'Bout to kick it around
Hanging out this afternoon
Ohh!
You better hang on if you're taggin' along
'Cause we'll be doin' this 'till six in the mornin'
Nothin' wrong with goin' all night long
Tough to put the brakes on

Remember when Elm Street came on? Couldn't watch it alone
Remember every prank call we made and star-sixty-nine?
Remember tryna hit eighty-eight to go back in time?
Remember when they played Purple Rain to our first slow dance?
Remember when we thought that first base was just holding hands?
Those days come back in the dead of night
Those days that felt like another life
What would you be doin' back in those days?
We'd be turnin' up the stereo
And play it everywhere we'd go
And so did everyone we'd know in those days
And everybody got to fall in love
With every movie made for us
Remember every poster we had hangin' on the wall?
Remember every T-shirt we stole from the local mall?
(Ace of Spades by Motörhead)
Remember Guns n' Roses came out? We were standin' in line
Remember front row at that show? Camped out all night

From long days in the field
And mothers hands are serving meals
In a café on Main Street
With mouths to feed
Just trying to keep clothing on our backs
And all I hear about
It's too bad that we had no time to rewind
(Let's talk)
You left without saying goodbye
Although I'm sure you tried
You call the house from time to time
To make sure we're alive
But you weren't there
Right when I needed you the most
And now I dream about it

Father's hands are lined with guilt
For tearing us apart
Guess it turned out in the end

We made it out
We still got clothing on our backs
And now I scream about it
It's too bad that we had no time to rewind
It's too bad that we had no time to rewind
How could anyone ask for more?
(How could anyone ask for more?)
And our time apart  like knives in my heart
How could anyone ask for more?
(How could anyone ask for more?)
But if there's a pill to help me forget
God knows I haven't found it yet
But I'm dying to  God I'm trying to
'Cause trying not to love you  only goes so far
And trying not to need you  is tearing me apart
Can't see the silver lining  from down here on the floor
And I just keep on trying  but I don't know what for
'Cause trying not to love you
Only makes me love you more
Only makes me love you more
And this kind of pain  only time takes away
That's why it's harder to let you go (That's why it's harder to let you go)
And nothing I can do  without thinking of you
That's why it's harder to let you go (That's why it's harder to let you go)

Was it something that I did? Was there somebody else?
When a voice from behind me  that was fighting back tears
Sat right down beside me  whispered right in my ear
Said  I've been dying to tell you
Trying not to love you  only went so far
Trying not to need you  was tearing me apart
Now I see the silver lining  from what we're fighting for
We just keep on trying  we could be much more

And we all look away
People pretending everywhere
It's just another day
There's bullets flying through the air
And they still carry on
We watch it happen over there
And then just turn it off
We must stand together
There's no giving in
Hand in hand forever
That's when we all win
They tell us everything's alright
And we just go along
How can we fall asleep at night
When something's clearly wrong?
When we could feed a starving world
With what we throw away
But all we serve are empty words
That always taste the same
