lyrics
"When the savior sang from the fire escape on the second floor
You were always sayin' we would make it to the catacombs
In the end  it came when you wrote my name on the bathroom stall
If the photograph doesn't bring you back
If the final chapter isn't ever after
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
I remember wakin' up the neighbor like a stadium
Yeah  he ran upstairs screamin' no one cared
And thе band played on
Even in the limo you wеre feelin' like an animal
At the traffic light  where you blew your mind on a mobile phone
Day and night  my love
You said the blood was on my hands
Long as you run
I couldn't give you up
Forever run
I couldn't give you up
You might also like
In the minivan with your headphones in
Did you write your letters to your shitty friends?
Long as you run
I couldn't give you up
Forever run
I couldn't give you up (And the daylight in my eyes)
Long as you run (And the silence on the street)
I couldn't give you up (And the low light in my head)
Forever run (And I was incomplete)
I couldn't give you up (And the daylight in my eyes)
Long as you run (And the silence on the street)
I couldn't give you up (And the low light in my head)
Gone  no goodbye (And I was incomplete)
And the wilderness inside
Let the exits pass  all the tar and glass
'Til the road and sky align
The strangers in this town
They raise you up just to cut you down
And your Volvo lights lit up green and white
With the cities on the signs
But you held your course to some distant war
In the corners of your mind
From the second time around
The only love I ever found
Oh Angela it's a long time coming
Home at last
Were you safe and warm in your coat of arms
With your fingers in a fist
Did you hear the notes  all those static codes
In the radio abyss?

Home at last

Home at last
(Ooh ooh ooh ooh  ooh ooh ooh ooh)
Won't you stay  stay with me
All my life I was blind
I was blind  now I see
Lovely girl  won't you stay
Won't you stay  stay with me
All my life I was blind
I was blind  now I see
Fleet of black  fleet of black limousines
All tinted machines  here comes the cavalcade
With the armored cars  armored cars like Berettas
Flags on antennaes designed to keep me safe  keep me safe
And oh my my  oh hey hey
Here he comes  the candidate
Blue eyed boy  United States
Vote for him  the candidate
Diamonds cut  diamonds cut for the carats
Plaster of Paris  the floats fill up the street
And the beauty queens  beauty queens with the white gloves

And oh my my  oh hey hey
Here it comes  the big parade
Marching bands and barricades
Make way  for the big parade
Oh-oh
Canvas covered  canvas covered in resin
The violent men who dance the blood ballet
And the bookies say  bookies say it's the third round
Oh  when Louie will go down
If he don't  there's hell to pay and hell to raise
And oh my my  oh hey hey
Here he comes  the welterweight
Take a dive  for goodness sake
Or say goodbye to the welterweight
Catholic priest  Catholic priest in a crisis
Torn between romance and Jesus
Who will win the civil war?
Yeah  this is my confession
And oh my  oh hey hey
There he goes  the man of faith
Left the church for a fiancee
Let him love  the man of faith
Oh-oh
TV cameras  TV cameras and stage hands
American Bandstand  electric guitars
And he's singin' songs  singin' songs for the lonely
All the girls with the room keys
They know all his words by heart  by heart and they all sing
Lovely girl  won't you stay
Won't you stay  stay with me
All my life I was blind
I was blind  now I see
Lovely girl  won't you stay
Won't you stay  stay with me
All my life I was blind
I was blind  now I see
Lovely girl  won't you stay
Oh my my  oh hey hey
Here she comes  by saving grace
Burn the car and save the plates
The manifest and destiny
And everyone was in the band
And I was on another planet
And you were all alone
And you wanna be a big shot
You wanna be the big man
You wanna hold a big gun
You gotta have a quick hand
You wanna be the big shot now
The chosen one your mother loved the most
After all
You hate yourself for what you said
'Cause you could never admit you were wrong
And every song was out of key
And I was in the in-between

I'll be so blue thinking about you
Decorations of red on a green Christmas tree
I'll have a blue heartache for certain
And when those blue memories starts hurtin'
You'll be doin' all right with your Christmas of white
And when those blue heartaches start hurtin'
I'll have a blue memory for certain
Every word was like smoke from a cigarette
You were blowin' in your hands
The heater broke in the Oldsmobile
And the light in your eyes
Alone on the freeway
I was stranded in the bed
You were listening to The Dark Side of the Moon
I could barely see your eyes
Psilocybin in a hotel room
And the light in your eyes
The waves on the ceiling
Tonight
You were tired of Tacoma
I was tirеd of believing we were right
Losing every other friend
Finding nothing in the afterlife

But the light in your eyes
Alone on a feeling
Tonight
You're stranded on the bridge
You're crying for your kids
Tonight
Tonight
I could see it in the air
Every word was like smoke from a cigarette
Sun is coming up ahead
Get your crack in the windshield shine
And the light in your eyes
Alone on the freeway
Tonight
You're stranded on the bridge
The cops are closing in
Tonight
First born in '44
And Kennedy made him believe
We could do much more
And Lillian  don't hang your head
Love should make you feel good
In uniform  you raised a man
Who volunteered to stand
Play the bugle  play the taps (and)
Make your mothers proud
Raise your rifles to the sky  boys
Fire that volley loud

The news was bad on Upland Ave

 Hello  how do you do?
 I made a pass
 That's pretty cool
 you fool
 they don't!)
 later on  the crowd calmed down
 picture my surprise when I had tried
 and she replied
 don't kiss in bars like this
 classy girls don't kiss in bars
 the hardest part is through
 through
 through
 through
When you knelt by my mattress  and asked for my hand
But I was sad you asked it  as I laid in a black dress
With my father in a casket  I had no plans
And I left the footprints  the mud stained on the carpet
And it hardened like my heart did when you left town
But I must admit it  that I would marry you in an instant
Damn your wife  I'd be your mistress just to have you around
And the church discouraged  any lust that burned in me
When a man's rejected  but he can fight for your affection
And he can act like he never met you and leave low to the ground
So I drive a taxi  and the traffic distracts me
From the strangers in my backseat  they remind me of you
But it's all a daydream  but it's you who's behind me
But you never recognize me  it brings me to you

And the only gifts from my Lord were a birth and a divorce
But I've read this script and the costume fits  so I'll play my part

And the nurse in white shoes leads me back to my guestroom
It's a bed and a bathroom
And a place for the end
When you knelt by my mattress  and asked for my hand
But I was sad you asked it  as I laid in a black dress
With my father in a casket  I had no plans
And I left the footprints  the mud stained on the carpet
And it hardened like my heart did when you left town
But I must admit it  that I would marry you in an instant

I was Cleopatra  I was taller than the rafters

 they were playing their salsa in the rain
 I was a man on the move
 I needed the truth
 but if I did I would bet on us
 like the Dead Sea
 I'm like the Dead Sea
 I was born to be
 it never suited you like a suitcase
 there are times we live for somebody else
 you felt
 'cause you with cats
 I'm your Dead Sea
 I'm like the Dead Sea
 I was born to be
 I've been defeated
 I will heed it
 ooh
 I'm so Dead Sea
 I'm like the Dead Sea
 I was born to be
From those nights in Tiananmen Square
It's coming from the feel that this ain't exactly real
From the wars against disorder
From the sirens night and day
From the fires of the homeless
From the ashes of the gay
Democracy is coming to the USA
It's coming through a crack in the wall
On a visionary flood of alcohol
From the staggering account of the Sermon on the Mount
Which I don't pretend to understand at all
It's coming from the silence on the dock of the bay
Democracy is coming to the USA
It's coming from the sorrow in the street
The holy places where the races meet
From the homicidal bitchin'
That goes down in every kitchen
To determine who will serve and who will eat
From the wells of disappointment
Where the women kneel to pray
For the grace of God in the desert here
And the desert far away
Democracy is coming to the USA

O mighty ship of state
To the shores of need
Past the reefs of greed
Through the squalls of hate
It's coming to America first
It's here they've got the range
And the machinery for change
And it's here they've got the spiritual thirst
It's here the family's broken
And it's here the lonely say
That the heart has got to open
In a fundamental way
Democracy is coming to the USA
It's coming from the women and the men
We'll be going down so deep
That the river's going to weep
And the mountain's gonna shout Amen
It's coming like the tidal flood beneath the lunar sway
Democracy is coming to the USA
O mighty ship of state
To the shores of need
Past the reefs of greed
Through the squalls of hate
Getting lost in that hopeless little screen
But I'm stubborn as those garbage bags that time cannot decay
To the USA
To the USA
I saved a picture where your hair was braided
They found your wallet in the cemetery
You told your daughter she was ordinary
You hate the name Junior
Your husband loved his computers
Your mother never was one
The eldest of seven children
If you don’t have it  then you'll never give it
And I don't blame you for the way you livin’
A little boy was born in February
You couldn't sober up to hold a baby
You hate the name Donna
You love to judge strangers' karma

The trucks always made you worry

You're praying for a funeral
You sang it like Hallelujah
You sang it like Hallelujah
You sang it like Hallelujah
You sang it like Hallelujah
And she listens to him
Flicks her cigarette's ash
And smoke hangs velvet curtains
And hides her lips
And she hopes to hell it's worth all her health risks
I know it was you
I know it was you
'Cause everyone requires a plan
I can give you
It's all been a sleight of hand
I know it was you
And everything about you
Won't you stay away
And maybe in the meantime
You and me will be fine
If you just relax
And check your eyes for cataracts
Its plain to see
That I was meant for you and you were meant for me
Darling hold me tightly
I think you and me we might be
In love
Drama queen
Like when you see a fire
You grab the gasoline
Now honey please calm down
Yes don't make a scene

And calling the police now

 lovers go
Everyone was on our side
Then we grew a little bit
And romanticized
The time I saw
Flowers in your hair
It takes a man to pretend he was there
So then we grew a little
And knew a lot
And how we demonstrated
It to the cops
And all the things we said
We were self-assured
'Cause it's a long road to wisdom
But it's a short one to bein' ignored
Be in my eyes
And be in my heart
And be in my heart

So now I think that I could
Love you back
And I hope it's not too late
'Cause you're so attractive
And the way you move
I won't close my eyes
'Cause it takes a man to live
It takes a woman to make him compromise
So be in my eyes
Be in my heart
And you can see it in their faces
And you'll be home in spring  I can wait 'til then
I heard you're on the big train
This loneliness won't last for long
I wasn't there to take his place
I was ten thousand miles away
So when you hear my voice
When you say my name
May it never give you pain
But I don't wanna go  but it's time to leave
You'll be on my mind  my destiny
And I won't fight in vain
I'll love you just the same  oh
I couldn't know what's in your mind
But I saw the pictures  you're looking fine
And there was a time when I stood in line
But I let you go  oh
I let you go

Said some things to wounded men that they could not allow
Everyone knew what the man had done
Jimmy believed in the American way
Jimmy loved Bonnie and he fathered a kid
It was a struggle just to cover the rent
His jail cut hours and now his little baby was sick
He needed money and he needed it quick
It was 3 AM
Jim woke his son and buckled him in the car
They drove an hour from town and found a gambling hall
He took his kid and his winnings as the dealer just laughed
His thumb was up and his son asked if the man was alright
Jim said you never give a hitcher a ride 'cause it’s us or them
It was 3 AM

Now Jimmy's son is trying to make his way home
His graveyard shift had ended and it was starting to snow
He sees an old man walking barefoot alone
It was 3 AM
His old man waved his hands with tears in his eyes
But Jimmy's son just sped up and remembered daddy's advice
'Cause it’s me or him

 I was feeling so alone
 I was shaking in the knees
 you crossed your legs
 it was all falling apart (Falling apart)

 all still falling apart
 you left for Denver
 they draw the lines around your eyelids now
 all still falling apart?
 you left for Denver
Woo  woo
And if the city's skyscrapers rise over this island
Would you be glad to see Manhattan for once?
But I'd be glad to see Manhattan for once
Woah-woah  living life in the city
Woah-woah  we can plan if we make it
Woah-woah  we won't let 'em
Woo  woo

And I miss my dad and Cleopatra sitting on a phone
So take me back off these streets and we'll never be apart
Together from the start
Never  never falling back alone

God and medicine take no mercy on him
Poisoned his blood  and burned out his throat
Enough is enough  he's a long way from home
Days of my youth wasted on a selfish fool
Who ran for the hills from the hand you were dealt
I flew far away  as far as I could go
Your time is running out
And I'm a long way from home
Laid up in bed  you were laid up in bed
Holding the pain like you're holding your breath
I prayed you could sleep  sleep like a stone
You're right next to me
But you're a long way from home
Hospital gowns never fit like they should
We yelled at the nurse  didn't do any good
“More morphine”  the last words you moaned
At last I was sure
 while my heart sinks
 it's you who's late again
 all the kids that you hold
 while I walk away
 'cause I cut the brakes

You opened the door  you gave him a ride
Too young to know  too old to admit
That you couldn't see how it ends
What did you do to my eyes?
What did you sing to that lonely child?
Promised it all  but you lied
It's all or nothing to you
The glow of Hollywood signs
They sold you a bridge
They fed you the lines (they fed you to lions)
You always confused your servants for friends
But you couldn't see how it ends

Others are born into royalty and can never behave
Some priest insisted it's a test of the faith

We built a wall to keep the devils at bay
A distant army was marching through the night and the day

Searched the heavens and the Earth below

Love is deep as the road is long
It moves my feet to carry on
Beats my heart when you are gone
Love is deep as the road is long
Nobody knows how the story ends
This is only where it begins

That you held so deep in the night?
On the back staircase
You fell to your knees with tears in your eyes
All that you suffered  all the disease
You couldn't hide it  hide it from me
All alone  scared in your room
Would you swear there's nobody home?
On the bed  laying awake
As you prayed he'd leave you alone
I'll let the darkness swallow me whole

If the subways flood and the bridges break
Jesus Christ can't save me tonight
Put on your dress  yes wear something nice
Decide on me  yeah decide on us
Pack yourself a toothbrush  dear
Pack yourself a favorite blouse
Take a withdrawal slip  take all of your savings out
'Cause if we don't leave this town
Wash off my hands 'til it's gone
With velvet curtains
Some love was made for the lights
Some kiss your cheek and goodnight
Lift up a red high heel
Lock up your doors with steel
They're makin' noise in my street
Smashed in my car window
Didn't touch the stereo
Act like you've been here before
Smile less and dress up some more
Tie up your scarf real tight
These boys are out for blood tonight

And when she stood she stood tall
She'll make a fool of you all
Don't ask for cigarettes
She ain't got nothing left for you
That wasn't what we were good at
And when it came to love
We were not good enough on
Don't you frown when you're feelin' like that
And beg you from her knees
Make you think she means it this time
She'll tear a hole in you
The one you can't repair
It's better to feel pain
Than nothing at all
The opposite of love is indifference
So pay attention now
I'm standing on your porch screamin' out
And I won't leave until you come downstairs

For runnin' like you did all these years
And the highway signs say we're close
But I don't read those things anymore
I never trusted my own eyes
Underneath deep blue sea
No one will believe me
Ran back to the town bar and
I told the people how
I had seen a submarine
And everyone laughed aloud
I did spy a periscope
Dead of night on the eastern coast
The police made them jokes
Told me I'd seen a ghost
Everyone thinks I'm a liar
No one knows the truth
If it was a bigger fire
I would be on the roof
Ships will rust in Baldwin Bay (Let me go)
No one trusts what I say (I don't know)

Pick me up and turn me round
I go numb- born with a weak heart
Guess I must be having fun
The less we say about it the better
Make it up as we go along
Feet on the ground
Head in the sky
It's alright I know nothing's wrong . . nothing wrong
And you're standing here beside me
I love the passing of time
Never for money
Always for love
Cover up and say goodnight . . . say goodnight
Home- is where I want to be
But I guess I'm already there
I come home- she lifted up her wings
I guess that this must be the place
I can't tell one from the other
There was a time before we were born

Out of all those kinds of people
You got a face with a view
I'm just an animal looking for a home
Share the same space for a minute or two
And you love me till my heart stops
Love me till I'm dead
Cover up the blank spots
Some days are rocks
Some doors are open
Some roads are blocked
Sundowns are golden
And they fade away
But if I never do nothing
I'll get you back someday
’Cause you got a heart so big
It could crush this town
And I can't hold out forever
Even walls fall down
All around your island
There's a barricade
It keeps out the danger
It holds in the pain
Sometimes you’re happy
Sometimes you cry
Half of me is ocean
Half of me is sky

I've never seen nobody quite like you
And if you ever change your tune
Oh  the world's got the best of you
You can always find me where the skies are blue
Wanted to change  turn into what you love  mama
And I woulda gave all of my best to you
So  if you ever need a fool
Who will give you a love so true
You can always find me where the skies are blue
Lay your dreams  little darlin'  in a flower bed
Let that sunshine in your hair  in your hair
You're gonna bleed somebody's brand new love  mama
Who's gonna feel just like it always do

When you asked me I denied it
I've told lies that never came true
And I have stolen  so have you
If we can make it through another day
With you believing in my innocence
And we can make it through another year
'Cause we both need it to forget this fear
If it's all the same to you
Then it's just a little white lie
Then it's all the same to me
And it's just a little white lie
If I was to blame would you?
Would you still believe?
I don't want you to forget
Just pretend that it never happened
And it's just a little white lie
And it's just a little white lie
