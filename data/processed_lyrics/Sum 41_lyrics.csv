lyrics
"Left to be unwritten like memories to unfold
Cause lies make it so much fun
So sing the praise of insincerity
Make this your last prayer
As the dream becomes your worst nightmare
I'll be there just to put the bullet in your head
I left the world this evening just to kill the sun
Especially before my mind fades like the stars at dawn

Well I bet you got a lot to say
So have it your way and crucify me
Make this your your last prayer
As the dream becomes your worst nightmare
I'll be there just to put the bullet in your head
And I don't believe in redemption
And no one will be spared
There's 32 ways you can die here tonight
It's a fucking family affair
I'll be there just to put the bullet in your head
Someone so twisted and sick as can be
It wasn't the plan  we gave it a shot
You've proven a real man is something you're not
So tell me  is this what the future primitive world's supposed to be?
A total abomination is what it looks like to me
No reasonable explanation  can't call it a declaration
I believe that I
Am losing faith in all of humankind
But then I realize it's plain to see
That a number is all you are to me
Not worthy of name  a number you'll get
A symbol of meaningless  void of respect
A matter of time  you get what you've earned
We'll take pleasure in watching you burn
So tell me  is this what the future primitive world's supposed to be?
A total abomination's what it looks like to me
It's a masochist fascination  a character assassination

 I know it's true  can't beat it  don't want to try
 possessed by destruction

 and no one can help me
 the more it makes no sense
 too hard to not give in
 cause I'm the one to blame
 and no one can help me
 the more it makes no sense
 it feels like I need some help
 the more it makes no sense
I'll make everything alright
All these things that I've done
I don't mean to hurt just to put you first
I won't tell you lies (I'm sorry)
I will stand accused with my hand on my heart
I'm just trying to say
And I'd fix all that I've done if I could start again
I'd throw it all away to the shadows of regrets
And you would have the best of me
I know that I can't take back
All of the mistakes but I will try
Although it's not easy
I know you believe me cause I would not lie

And I'm over you! Congratulations!
And thank you for all the pain  'cause it made it be so much more fun
There's nothing to say now
The feelings are already dead (They're dead)

I'm waiting for another day  another way
I don't believe that you can make all the pain go away
So  I'll leave it all behind (Behind)
But I'm leaving with blood in my eyes!
Seen through the lines  while believing the lies for too long a time

Just trying to find a way
It's all just too much for me to take

Seems to be that I'm a wanted man these days
I'm down that rabbit hole
But I don't want to go
Rot in peace down a dead-end street

May God rest your soul
Got a lease on borrowed time
It's catching up to me  now let it bleed!
It's off with his head  and on with the show
The old king is dead  gone in one fatal blow (I don't believe!)
And I don't believe he'll come back for more

You can't stop the bleeding  it's almost too late
You're leaving us all behind with hell to pay
All of the dearly beloved

Misery made us so hopelessly faithless (Hey)
