"Looking up from your eyes
Everything that you ever wanted
You fight  but why?
Fold it up just like a piece of paper
Take your sweet little time
You can write on the sidewalk
But you’ll find it’s not right
And now you’re walking through the door
Just like 2024
Said I gotta believe
Someday you’ll see  someday you’ll see
That there’s something more
Yeah  there’s something more
That’s why you’re so bored
Oh  there’s something more
And now I'm standing at your front door
Nowhere better to be
But I can see you tie your own shoelaces
You bleed
Fall in love just like a newborn baby
Blonde hair and blue eyes
Taking pictures with your Polaroid camera
You're fine  it's right

Oh  there’s something more

Just like 2024
Said I gotta believe
Someday you’ll see  someday you’ll see

Yeah  there’s something more
That’s why you’re so bored
 long  long time

I saw a pretty little thing approaching me
And you can go and send me on my way.
She looked at me and this is what she said:
Oh there ain't no rest for the wicked
Money don't grow on trees
There ain't nothing in this world for free
Oh no there ain't no rest for the wicked
Until we close our eyes for good
Not even fifteen minutes later I'm still walking down the street
When I saw the shadow of a man creep out out of sight
He made it clear he wasn't looking for a fight
What made you want to live this kind of life?

Oh no there ain't no rest for the wicked
Until we close our eyes for good
Well now a couple hours passed and I was sitting in my house
The day was winding down and coming to an end
And so I turned on the TV and flipped it over to the news
And what I saw I almost couldn't comprehend
He'd stuffed his bank account with righteous dollar bills
But even still I can't say much because I know we're all the same
You know there ain't no rest for the wicked
Money don't grow on trees
There ain't nothing in this world for free
Though you know we wish we could
Oh no there ain't no rest for the wicked
Early in the morning
Rise to meet the sun
Work so hard to feed your wife
No time to show her love
And in the madness of the evening
With diamonds in your hand
Came home an hour early
Caught her with another man
It's always something before the late night
On your way back home again
A good samaritan
You see a man stuck in the rain
Stranded with no friends
And from the goodness of your heart
You saved him from the flood
A couple miles down the road
He's covered in your blood

It's always something before the late night
Burned by the light you thought that you were running
Why can't you see you can't control the weather?
With my eyeballs out and I'm looking at the fear
But it never works out the way I wrote it in my hands
(It's always something)
It's always something before the late night
You know it's always something
I just can't seem to get away from
Can you dig it?
You will never see it
No  you won't find it falling off my tongue
I take it downtown  finally lose it
I don't think it's very nice
To walk around my head all night  you
Got me tangled like a braid  tie-twisted
I don't think it's fair
Do you?
You
Out here on the flip side
You know I took the long way round
Cause all I really am is a homemade elevator
Blinded by your sunshine
Put you on a plane to Parí
Lay my cards down on the table

Said he's gonna send me something lovely
But even still  at times I wonder
What you're thinking of me
You're probably sure I lost my mind
I don't think it's very nice to
Walk around my head all night  you
Got me tangled like a bread tie twisted
I don't think it's fair
I don't think it's very polite to
Walk around my head all night  you
Got me tangled like a bread tie twisted
I don't think it's fair
Ah! Ooh
Ah! Ooh
Ah! Ooh
Buried beneath this house  my spirit screams and dies again
Out back  a monster wears a cloak of Persian leather
Behind the TV screen  I've fallen to my knees
I said  you've got me where you want me again and I can't turn away
I'm hanging by a thread and I'm feeling like I'll fall
I'm stuck here in between these shadows of my yesterday
I want to get away  I need to get away
Blanket of silence makes me want to sink my teeth in deep
Burn all the evidence of fabricated disbelief
Pull back the curtains  took a look into your eyes
My tongue has now become a platform for your lies
I said  you've got me where you want me again and I can't turn away
I'm hanging by a thread and I'm feeling like I'll fall
I'm stuck here in between these shadows of my yesterday
I want to get away  I need to get away

His woman truly was a devil
And she wasn't all that honest
She tore him down on every level
You're a no-good  lazy motherfucker
He don't like that  he wants his life back
He wants go back home
He tried so hard to please her
He sold his soul to keep her happy
But nothing he did impressed her
She always left him feeling shitty

 There's no one here who can touch you now

I was raised with a strap across my back
I was burned by the cold kiss of a vampire
I was bit by the whisper of a soft liar
Any good friend of yours is a good friend of mine
Tell me why I'm forced to live in this skin
Tell me why I’m forced to live in this skin
Tell me why I was born to live in this skin
Tell me how I’m supposed to be forgiven
I was born on the wrong side of the train tracks
Always born on the wrong side of the train tracks
I was burned by the cold kiss of a vampire
I was promised the keys to an empire

*Hidden Track  (Right Before My Eyes)
Timber shakes these trails  they all derail
An empty ocean lost our way with no direction home
Find it harder to remain
And nothing's sacred still waiting on that explanation
Right before my eyes
I saw the whole world lose control
The whole world lost control
Before my eyes uh-huh
I fell through the floor
I couldn't take it anymore
I can't take this anymore
It breaks my mind uh-huh
Holding dirty hands over the flames
Getting pleasure from the pain
Softly screaming the pistol that you raised has spoken
Golden needles names we take in vain
Find it harder to remain
Well nothing's sacred still waiting on that explanation
Everything I thought I knew fell to the side
Time went on and on I couldn't see past my own eyes
Past my eyes 
Held on too tight  you know I tried
But in the end  it left me paralyzed
Seems like yesterday I was a child
Just a ripple in the folds of time
I wish you well  I want to see you smile
It's alright  goodbye
Goodbye
Lord knows how hard we tried
So many things I want to say to you
So many sleepless nights I prayed for you
My heart's an ashtray and I lost my mind
You bring the smokes  I've got the time
I want to hide somewhere that's hard to find
Stop wasting time trying to shape your life
It's alright  goodbye

Wonder how much longer I can carry on

Still all these words I've spoken don't mean anything at all

Told me all your secrets  oh I never saw it coming

We ain't got the tunes that's gonna put us on the map
And I'm a phony in disguise  tryna make the radio
I'm an antisocial anarchist who sound like so-and-so
They say I'm just a stupid kid  another crazy radical
Rock 'n' roll is dead  I probably should have stayed at school
Another Generation X who somehow slipped up through the cracks
So it goes in one ear and right out the other
People talking shit  but you know I never bother
It goes in one ear and right out the other
People talking shit  they can kiss the back of my hand
Now I know I'm not a saint  I've been a sinner all my life
I ain't tryin' to hide my flaws  I'd rather keep them in the light

We don't do it for the money  we don't do it for the fame

A little time with you is all that I get
That's all we need because it's all we can take

I wanna take you to that place in the “Roche”
But no one gives us any time anymore
He ask me once if I’d look in on his dog
I got this picture of us kids in my head
And all I hear is the last thing that you said
'I listened to your problems
Now listen to mine'
And we will never be alone again
Cause it doesn't happen every day
Kinda counted on you being a friend

You got a hunger for destruction
Needed someone to bleed
You sealed the deal before the dawn

I found it tucked beneath the hills
I sat and watched it rise
It hit the sky and burst to flames
The lotus flower's
Got me thinking bout the way that we live
I've got this feeling
It's gonna stop
Driven by religion
Running backwards down a one way road
Trying to save your soul
Manifest Destiny
Is just a fancy word for murder
I've got this feeling
It's gonna stop
A billion faces running round my head
All got opinions but they don't mean shit
Keep dropping bombs until the whole world's dead
They said it's all been done and it's all been said
They'll turn this message into a pop movement

Fell into a daze
And found my mind was gone and laid to waste
A battle ground indeed
Where holy wars have taken place
I saw the sun set watched it travel down
And tear through the ground
The hate that drives us
From my fancy hotel suite
Where a soul can find some sleep
I can feel the warmth it brings

Boy you better hold your tongue
Talking like you're coming from kingdom come
The sound through the ceiling
Never got no money
But I'm running from the gun
My engines flooded
Cold blooded no money
Killing the moonlight with daylight
I got my X-ray eyes
And I'm feeling so fine
We're on the nightshade
Tell me what we're hiding from
Like someone could steal it
Are we waiting for some kind of feeling
Or saving it up for the morning?
Undercover
The cloak and dagger
Is there a creature in the attic?
Or just pretending?
Will it burn out by the morning?

We're on a night run
No telling who we're running from
In a world of secrets and demons and people hiding from the sun
Sending my message to everyone losing control
Better not stop 'til I get home
Sentimental flowers don't grow
Got to live through tidal waves
And parishes and biblical floods
I got the gris-gris love
And the streets in my blood
I'm on the final run

Take her love and then abuse her
Afraid of nothing and she carries a knife

On both sides  a vow was broken
Trying to hide this damage done
One day  all our secrets will be spoken
Times I wonder are we just a puff of smoke? Yeah
Underneath this bed of ashes  still withholding everything
Like we were never close
I'ma strike these matches  never had control
I’ma spread these ashes  never had control
Sun went down  sun went down over Pompeii
On holy ground  our vows were broken
We met up  we broke bread
I was blue  your dress was red
Ain't it strange?
We both knew this day was coming

Writing this song about some things that I saw
Trying to stand like a big strong tough man
Finding out fast that I'm sinking in sand
All I got is nothing but
A little bit of love and gonna
Give it to the people then they'll see
And then they'll see
Spinning the tops as the tables they turn
Made some mistakes but I still couldn't learn

Who knows now? Softly laying on the ground
Oooh not a lot of people left around oooh oooh
In my life I have seen people walk into the sea
Just to find memories plagued by constant misery
Their eyes cast down  fixed upon the ground
Their eyes cast down
I'll keep my eyes fixed on the sun
Shake me down  cut my head on a silver cloud
Broken sound  softly laying on the ground
Oooh not a lot of people left around oooh oooh

Slipped and fell into the deep end
All the empty words were flying
I never was alone
I've been running for so long
All that's left is skin and bones
Sometimes it makes no sense at all
Close my eyes and let the love-light guide me home
Let the love-light guide me home
One step fades and falls into another

Left here feeling like an alien
Lost myself while I was hiding

Everyone's been searching high and low
And your mother's worried sick
Dearest daddy lost his grip
While the whole world's watching
Candlelight vigils being held in silence
On the channel four
And they've knocked on every door
Every place you've been before
How long will we let it go?
I think we should just let go
I  I want you back (back)
Let's get back
Lay my weary head against your bones
Where all my troubles will be dead and gone
How long will we let it go?

Has melancholy taken you for good?
You know that I would save you if I could
Watched your laughter turn to tears
Then you vanished in thin air
Well we pinned your missing persons picture up
On every mother-loving post
How's it feel to be a ghost?
You're the one I love the most

I think I must confess  I'm starting to unwind
I've been tripping over you  so tell me something new
Take it or leave it

Watching the flames wither and fade

We live in an environment whose entire population of critics and no painters to be found
Where have all the storytellers gone?
Just when did I become so eaten up by moss and covered in a cloak of popularity?
And then I lose my voice in between the echoes of self-serving prophecy
A captain without his ship  a chief—a chief without a tribe
A raging megalomaniac who only speaks to hear his cheeks slap together and worship the sound of his own voice
A muffled cry—a muffled cry—a muffled cry—a muffled cry
Power concaved inside a woman
To configure through the mythical power of the trees  the graphics being paper th—
Paper thin garments and garments and garments and garments and garments and garments and garments and garments
Pray for summer days
The rain and wind is so strong outside my window
And winter's always searching for another
I hear—I hear his cheeks slap together and worship his own voice
Lou—louder? Okay  alright
I'm so tired of the demands of this world  her nagging voice
The song she sings  the songs that she desires
She cries out in the heat of her passions
Her legs spread ready for—ready for a stranger
The captain without his ship  a chief with—a chief without a tribe
A raging megalomaniac who only speaks to hear his cheeks slap together and worship the sound of his own voice
I dare not take another drink until it's gone
Just when did I become so eaten up by moss and covered in a cloak of popularity?
Inside my telescope I see
A pair of eyes peer back at me
He walks and talks and looks like me
He sits around inside his house
Fills his life with pointless things
And wonders how it all turns out
Do-do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do-do
It's safe to say that
I don't think you understand
Time is like a leaf in the wind
Either it's time well spent or time I've wasted
Don't waste it
Afraid of what the truth might bring
He locks his doors and never leaves
Desperately searching for signs
Too terrified to find a thing
He battens all the hatches down
And wonders why he hears no sounds
Frantically searching his dreams
He wonders what it's all about

A lost generation generically made
When amidst all the madness I saw a flower
A dream that was creeping I kept in my sight
Hand me down with the crooked back
Maybe you should lay down
Taught me how to fall
But you never told me I was supposed to stay down
Stick and move
Sharpen up the knife
Keep it tight
Stay between the lines
Make your mark
Take your own advice
Don't be surprised when you trip and stumble
I played the fool again
My old unfaithful friend
Stick and move
Sharpen up the knife
Don't be surprised if you can't stay between the lines
Quicksand color blind in the hourglass
All spun out 'cause you can't stop looking back
What'd you hope to find here?
Taught me how to fall
But you never told me I was meant to die here

No smoking guns
Fizzled and faded
Now back on the run
My sticks and stones
Tokyo smoke
I played the fool 'til I started to choke
My public smile
My double face
Half in the light
Half in the shade
Need some fresh air
No place tonight
Guess I'll stay in and continue to fight
Spiderweb spun
Pale white and blue
Now I'm coming undone
Play sticks and stones
Three shades of black
Two steps away
From the moment I first saw you  I was yours and you were mine
Deep down we both knew you were trouble by design
I was always playing the part
First love only set by a spark
There was no way changing my mind
Now I'm under your spell  trapped in a lie
Shouldn't have stood that close to the fire
It's too late to say goodbye
Push back from my heart
Wish we could go back to the start
But oh my god  is this real?
No more time
It's too late  it's too late to say goodbye

Forced to watch the ashes floating  softly drifting to the ground
