"Just banging on the front door?
You say you had enough
Now you're coming back for more
But that's alright
I may not want to admit it
And bring your girlfriends with you
But how could one be so thoughtless to try
And handle less than two?
But that's alright
I may not want to admit it
I'm just a fool for your stockings

It seems too good to be true
Sweet things can always get sweeter
I may not want to admit it
Down the highway at night
And you're feeling that wild turkey's bite
Don't give Johnny Walker a ride
'Cause Jack Black is right by your side
You might get taken to the jailhouse and find
You've been arrested for driving while blind
Now just the other night with nothing to do
We broke a case of proof 102
And started itching for that wonderful feel
Of rolling in an automobile
You could say we was out of our mind
And let me tell you we were flying while blind
Then they had us up against the wall
And there ain't no cause for alarm
We ain't out to do nobody no harm
How could anyone be so unkind
To arrest a man for driving while blind?
Let's do it one time
See that girl with the red dress on?
She can do it all night long
I know a girl that likes to flirt
She can do it in a mini skirt
Ain't it a shame when a girl goes bad
It's enough to drive you mad
But she played me for a first class fool
I'm gonna tell you like I told some friends
I'm going back to dig her again
Ain't it a shame when a girl goes bad
She's the one to drive you mad

I know a girl with a GTO
See the girl dressed in green
She's the one that's a mean machine
Ain't it a shame when a girl goes bad
She's enough to drive you mad
Yes she is
Not so long ago
There on a crowded island
In the gulf of Mexico
It didn't take too much money
You could dance all night
If you felt all right
Drinking whiskey and throwing dice
Everybody knows it was hard to leave
And everybody knows
It was down at the Balinese
I remember Ruby
She always dressed in red
Wearing skintight pants
With a rag wrapped around her head
Everybody knows it was hard to leave

With my favorite honky tonk in mind
With my can of dinner and a bunch of wine
And the crowd gets loud
When the band gets right
Steel guitar crying through the night
But everything's cool because they just tight
The joint was jumping like a cat on hot tin
Soundin' a lot like
They got House Congressional

Try my burger stand
If you need a slice of thrilling
I'm the baddest in the land

You see the hot sauce can't be beat
Sit back and open wide
And the light is hurt your head
The first thing you do
When you get up out of bed
Is hit that streets a-runnin'
And try to beat the masses
And go get yourself some cheap sunglasses
Spied a little thing and
I followed her all night
In a funky fine Levi's and her
Sweater's kind of tight
She had a west coast strut
That was sweet as molasses
But what really knocked
Me out was her cheap sunglasses
Now go out and get yourself
Some thick black frames
With the glass so dark
They won't even know your name
And the choice is up to you
Cause they come in two classes
Rhinestone shades
And cheap sunglasses
I thought I knew the place so well
Sometime you never can tell
You know I'm moving on in this fine machine
Rolling on through the night
Seeing things like I've never seen
And it's taking me outta sight

It's got me up and down
I been lost and found
Down in a deep dark hole
Looks like my luck has changed
I been rearranged
And I'm coming out on a roll
That happened not long ago
About the man with a tan
El Diablo de Mexico?
And this man played his hand
And he lived by the luck of the draw
Now and then and again
Found him stepping outside of the law
And his fortune he had made
Let him live high on the hog
'Til the day of the raid
When they hunted him like a dog
He was out on the run
Knowing he could get by
Because the men killed in sin
Were not there to testify
In La Casa de Calaboose
And readied for the noose
But the break he would make
It didn't turn out so well
And the hombre called Diablo
Bid his last farewell
Finest thing you ever seen
And I love her  she's all that I want
And I need her  she's all that I need
Do you love me and make me cry?
How I love her  she's all that I want
How I need her  she's all that I need
If I ever caught her with Stevie P
I'd throw her back in the Penitentiary  now
And if I caught her with my mother's son
I'll call her daddy and get my gun
My Francine just turned thirteen
She's my angelic teenage queen
And I love her  she's all that I want
And I need her  she's all that I need
And I love her  she's all that I want
And I need her  she's all that I need
And I love her  she's all that I want
And I need her  she's all that I need
And I love her  she's all that I want
 so sweet
She likes French cuisine
But she won't let me use my passion
Unless it's in a limousine
She got me under pressure
She got me under pressure
She likes the art museum
She don't like Pavlov's dog
She fun at the mind museum
She likes it in a London fog
She don't like other women
She likes whips and chains
She likes cocaine
And flipping out with Great Danes
She's about all I can handle
It's too much for my brain
It's got me under pressure
It's got me under pressure

Back in 1966?
Where I got my licks
From coast to coast and line to line
In every county there
Talking 'bout that outlaw X
He's cutting through the air
I heard it on the X
We can all thank Doctor B
He stepped across the line
The first one of it's kind
So listen to your radio
Most each and every night
Get to feeling right

Yes  it's me again
I have just returned
From the Island of Chandelier
What am I doing in town?
Well  I'm glad you asked
I'm just passing through in search
Of the ever elusive thunderbird
I got a job as a public relations man
Passing out handbills on Austin street
Merely an effort to improve
My financial situation
And ward off a case of the D.T.'s
So farewell  my darling
Perhaps we'll meet again
On some sin-infested
An angel called me aside
Hot  blue and righteous
Said  Stick by me and I'll be your guide
I heard the words as I closed my eyes
Down on my  down on my bended knees
It fit like a glove and I realized
Something good's happening to me
Hot  blue and righteous
An angel called me aside
Talkin' trash  sipping wine
I need something more substantial
New deck of playing cards
I don't like to work this hard
I think I'll have to cancel
I'm running out of time
I'm about to lose my mind
I got the six
Gimme your nine
Slow hand on the clock
I'm sitting here like a rock

I had a blues man on the back and a beautician at the wheel
We going downtown in the middle of the night
We laughing and I'm joking and we feeling alright
Yes I'm bad  I'm nationwide
Easing down the highway in a new Cadillac
I had a fine fox in front  I had three more in the back
They sporting short dresses  wearing spike-heel shoes
They smoking Lucky Strikes and wearing nylons too
'Cause we bad  we're nationwide
Well  I was moving down the road in my V-8 Ford
I had a shine on my boots  I had my sideburns lowered
With my New York brim and my gold tooth displayed

You might not see him in person
But he'll see you just the same

Because taking care of business is his name
We've been rolling all night long
Now  I just got back from baby's

But I feel like something wrong
Now  sometime I go see baby
And sometimes she come see me  mmm

Mmm-hmm  yeah

If her loving don't get me
I know her husband will
Mmm  yeah
Got me a pocket full of change

If you believe like working hard all day
Just step in my shoes and take my pay
I was born my papa's son
When I hit the ground I was on the run
I had one glad hand and the other behind
When the hound dog barking in the black of the night
I just got paid today
Got me a pocket full of change
Do you got some wool?
It's the root of evil and you know the rest
About that shack outside La Grange
And you know what I'm talking about
Just let me know if you wanna go
To that home out on the range
They gotta lotta nice girls
Have mercy
A-haw haw haw-haw
And the ten to get yourself in
And I hear it's tight most every night
But now I might be mistaken
Have mercy
She knows how to use them
She never begs
She knows how to choose them
She holding leg
Wonder how to feel them
Would you get behind them
If you could only find them?
She's my baby

That's right  that's right
Down from the county line
Just getting right on Saturday night
Ridin' with some friends of mine
They invited me to come and see
Just what was on their minds
And then I took my first long look
At the Master of Sparks on high
In the back of Jimmy's Mack
Stood a round steel cage
Welded into shape by Slim
Made out of sucker gauge
Strapped in there safe and sound
If that thing ever hit the ground
Slim was so pleased when I had eased
Into his trap of death
He had slammed the door but I said no more
And I thought I'd breathed my last breath
We was out in the sticks down Highway Six
And the crowd was just about right
Like a stick of rolling dynamite

When I hit the ground
You could hear the sound
And see the sparks a country mile
End over end I began to spin
But the ball started running wild
But it was too late as I met my fate
And the ball started gettin' hot
But through the sparks and the flame
I knew that the claim
And you ain't up to being alone
Don't spend all your money
On just any honey that's grown
Go find the Mexican blackbird
And send all your troubles back home
They all call her Puta
'Cause no one really knows her name
She works the cantina
Dancin' and a-lovin's her trade
Her mama was Mez'can
And her daddy was the ace of spades
Hand me another one of them brews back there
She's hot as a pepper
But smooth as a Mexican brew
So head for the border
And put in an order or two
The Mexican blackbird
Will be there waiting for you
I'm shuffling through the Texas sand
But my head's in Mississippi
The blues has got a hold of me
I believe I'm getting dizzy
 Help me now
I keep thinking 'bout that night in Memphis
I keep thinking 'bout that night in Memphis
I thought I was in Heaven
But I was stumbling through the parking lot
Of an invisible 7-11
What was I doing out there?
Last night I saw a cowgirl
She was floating across the ceiling
And last night I saw a naked cowgirl
She was floating across the ceiling
She was mumbling to some howling wolf
About some voodoo healing
Where's my head baby?
Somewhere in Mississippi
To see if you were at home
Your shade was down
There wasn't even a sound
But something told me you weren't alone
What in the world can a nasty dog do
But try to get next to you?
Well  don't laugh 'cause it ain't funny
Look how it happened to me
It could happen to you
You could be a fool too
And it'd leave you in misery
I guess there's nothing
More funky king can do
But to try to get next to you
I didn't give her what she likes
I don't know what to tell her
Don't know what to say
Everything got funky last night
She was really bombed
And I was really blown away
And when I asked her what she wanted
And this is what she had to say
A pearl necklace
She want a pearl necklace
She want a pearl necklace
She gets a charge out of being so weird
Digs getting downright strange
But I can keep a handle on anything
Just this side of deranged
She was gettin' bombed
And I was gettin' blown away
And she knew it in her head
And this is what she had to say

Get with Precious and Grace

Would sting you with the lovesick blues

Looking for someone to use
And I’m wondering why she left me
Such a long time ago
But she can break a heart
And take all the love she needs
And she wound up in El Paso

And she could step to the Cotton Eyed Joe
