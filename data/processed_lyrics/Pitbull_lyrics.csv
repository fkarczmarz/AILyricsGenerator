Woooo
Mr. Worldwide checking in
You know it’s history in the making
(Eeeyyyooo!)
I like her and she likes her
We gon' have a love fest
Let's get down to business
Back it up and drop it low
Tap that like a bongo
I like them and they like me
It takes three to tango
I open double doors 
Now go ‘head and come in
I got that Voli305 getting live
I'm in the iLov305 getting live
A little bit of Erika with extra on the side
More and more for me (Yeah)
More and more for them (Yeah)
Switch up and then (Yeah)
Switch it back again (Yeah)

Man I've been on the grind

The game is mine in due time
It's alright I'm patient man
I know how to play my position  I know how to play my part
I know how to play these bitches  I know how to play with they hearts
I've done some dumb things  but for the most I've played it smart
Who cares if you run things? Cause I'm as live as 106 & Park
This game is nothing but a pool of blood with a bunch of sharks
Only the strong survive  It's do or die get it right
That why I roll for my peoples
Cock back  go to war for my peoples
Break bread with my peoples
Man  I'll die for my peoples
Everybody knows it's the truth
That why they respect everything that I do  everywhere that I go
Man I sold it all
From the weed to the X  from the X to the blow
Mark my words  I'm next to blow
Me  Ima sell like ice cream in hell
This for my peoples that's locked up in jail
Ima succeed  I'm never gon fail
Papo just watch me

To my hustlers be careful when they murder in the blocks
To my killas be careful when you burnin up the Glocks
Last thing you wanna be is runnin from the cops

It's been a while and you found somebody else
They say you really doing good for yourself
But I know you out there feeling so lonely
As far as my eyes can see
Don't need no proof or no validation
You leave no wound on you second to none
You said you over me but you looking lonely
So as far as my eyes can see  you look better on me
You look better on me
As far as my eyes can see  you look better on me
Got a room with a mirror on the roof
Down in the keys keys keys
And I could bet the bank and almost guarantee
That you will always look better on me
I handle my business in the boardroom and the bedroom
My name ain't max but I always got headroom
G-g- get it  g-g- g-g- get it
Went from selling perico and reefer
To New Year's Eve with Snoop and Latifah
I shut down Spain
And I ain't even have to take a pill in Ibiza
I'm a beast bro
I love when you put on them sexy one piece outfits
With the hole in the middle
Now take a look in the mirror
And see you always look better on me

I told you once (Can't Have)
I tell you twice (Can't Have)
The grass looks greener on the other side
Til you get to the other side  haha
Well you're happy now
And I'm so glad  'cause you're so rad
But I guess we always want what we can't have
You know the loneliness hurts so bad
And girl I want you back
But I guess we always want what we can't have
Can't have

Ohhhhhh!
I see Central Park from my hotel room
And it's got me thinking
About the crazy things we used to do
For the fame  for the power  for the fortune
Ducked prison  ducked death  I'm fortunate
It was all a dream  now I wake up and live it
Thinking that the sky was the limit
'Til I figured out there's footprints on the moon
Now I'm like get out the way  bitch move

Looking at my backyard  now all I see the ocean
Not bad for a kid that grew up with roaches
Drama  chaos  and different cultures
That's what allows me to see through these vultures
First we shined the shoes
Then we own the shoe shop
First we make the sandwich
Then we own the restaurants
First then we clean the house
Then we own every house on the block
Not bad for some immigrants

Pero le gusta como yo le doy

Yo la pongo a volar cuando yo le doy besos
Pero no 'tá enamora de mí
Ella solamente quiere pasa' un momento lunático
And I blow her mind  ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
Everytime that I kiss her
But she said she's not in love with me
Yeah  all right
Ella siempre me llama a las tres de la mañana
Dice que soy su pana  el que le quita las gana' (Jajaja)
Y si ella supiera que me llama su hermana
Porque también soy su pana  el que le quita las gana' (¡Hu-wuh!)

Es que yo te hablo directo de Miami al Cibao

Going nowhere  telling everyone
I can't believe what we did last night
I wanna say oh my God  that was so much fun
I'll never forget it  telling everyone about last night
What happens in Vegas  stays in Vegas
What happens in Miami  never happened
Never happened
Last night we were off the chain
You name it  we did it
You loved it fo'sho

I grew up with no daddy  I’m from Miami Dade
I’m self-made  I’m self-paid
I grew up with no daddy  I’m from Miami Dade
Mouth signed check  ass can’t cash
One-time Lebron boss  D-Wade flash
I can’t forget that boy UD  Udonis Has
I’m from Miami Dade County  born and raised there
Mouth full of golds and diamonds  but talk is cheap
There’s rules and codes  in Dade Country streets
Y’all break rules and codes to talk shit on beats
No te equivoques mi hijito  Miami’ll bring the heat
I’m self-made  I’m self-paid
I grew up with no daddy  I’m from Miami Dade

Here's a deposition  watch what you speak
Who’s the definition of Miami? Me
I move cultures  don’t believe me – watch and see
Ask Barack Obama  he’ll bet the White House on me
But we all know Baby and Slim really eat
You talk Miami  if you talkin’ heat
Moral of the story: don’t shit where you eat
I’m self-made  I’m self-paid
I grew up with no daddy  I’m from Miami Dade

I had to do this for my city dog
It’s something that I love so deeply
I don’t wanna be 305 Miami Dade County
I am 305 Miami Dade County
I bleed 305 Miami Dade County
So when we show love to those
That get their city destroyed by a hurricane
And then they come down here
Y faltan al respeto
Hazme el favor y para de comer tanta pinga
Eso es lo que pasa cuando uno da la mano
Y quieren el brazo entero
Yo
Them 6 - 7 Boys
Welcome to Miami
Where them boys used to touch tourists on a daily basis
Duck charges therefore hardly caught cases
This is a city full of culture and different races
Where all the mami's come fully equipped at young ages
With the hurricanes cause even the biggest hurricane couldn't phase us
We got a dome for the Heat that put y'all to sleep
And we carry hits from night till morning
Like Marino strong armin' the game
But I'm not retiring till I got a championship ring
Poppin champagne simple and plain
Check the map and look where we at
I'm bringing it back to the fore-front
Like Luke in the 2 Live Crew days
He's the one that's got these mami's going two ways
Oye
God bless Uncle Al but knowin him MIA was probably engraved
On the tombstone that stands over his grave to this day!

When I'm downtown I check out the shoe gallery
Cause Danny always looked out for me
I went from the waterboy to the quarterback in the huddle
Watch where you hang out in the Grove cause you'll go from
Havin a grand in hand to layin stiff on Grand Ave
I can't forget Liberty City and those notorious pork n beanss
And Scott Projects where nothing's clean
Miami's where we double the money
Cause of course we triple the beams
If you live for die for this city

Pitts that chico from the bottom
That's about to take over the rap game thats if they allow him
You know the city of Miami got the country spooked
Thatls cause they didn't count all the bricks that came through the port
Live by the code die by the code
So much cane done came thru this city
We named 40th street Bird Road
Who made Opa-Locka? Who knows
All I know is you don't wanna get caught up in the triangle
Alapatah A.K.A. Dominican town
Dique cause there's nothing but Dominicans now
And to them little Havana boys that hold me down
To all the Haitians from Little Haiti that show me love
Sak Passe gracia dios ya llegue
Now I'm on my way to the top bringin the bottom with me
You got a problem with that
Then obviously you got a problem with me
