lyrics
"Just so we could have a chance of a life
We're not here so we can blow it all
We could bear witness to the rise and the fall
Ancient dreams in a modern land
I'm trying to get back as fast I can
Back to a time before I had form
Back to a time before I was born
You don't have to be like everybody else
You don't have to fit into the norm
You are not here to conform
I am here to take a look insidе myself
I live in the space between the stars and the sky
What's your purpose? Why were you put on Earth?
We're now living in a seminal age
The walls are being broken and we're ready for change

Ancient dreams in a modern land
I'm trying to get back as fast I can
Back to a time before I had form
Back to a time before I was born
You don't have to be like everybody else
You don't have to fit into the norm
You are not here to conform
I am here to take a look inside myself
I live in the space between the stars and the sky
From the heart of Malaysia
To the dark Himalayas
From the day you were born
You are not here to conform
You don't have to be like everybody else
You don't have to fit into the norm
You are not here to conform
I am here to take a look inside myself
Chemically calm
Was I meant to feel happy that my life
Was just about to change?
One life pretending to be
The cat who got the cream
People like to tell you
What you're gonna be
It's not my problem if you don't see what I see
And I do not give a damn if you don't believe
Are you satisfied with an average life?
Do I need to lie to make my way in life?
They say I'm a control freak
Driven by a greed to succeed
Nobody can stop me

'Cause it's my problem if I wanna pack up and run away
It's my business if I feel the need to smoke and drink and sway
And it's my problem if I have no friends and feel I want to die
Are you satisfied with an average life?
Do I need to lie to make my way in life?
Are you satisfied with an easy ride?
Are you satisfied with an average life?
Do I need to lie to make my way in life?
Are you satisfied with an easy ride?
Just another in a long line of men she knew
And while I'm not quite sure what she's trying to prove
They all say she's got low self-esteem
You can do better than that
I know you've been feeling sad
But you can do better than that
And I know that you're not to blame
But you can do better than that

She's the apple of everybody's eye
Got a sour face like a poisoned fruit
That the boys can taste 'til they're out of use
And she'll network 'til her dreams come true
Even if it means getting into bed with you
I know a little too much but I'll never tell
You can do better than that
I know you've been feeling sad
But you can do better than that
And I know that you've been feeling down
But you can do better than that
Hook up with other people 'til it all falls through
I'm not passing judgment on her sexual life
I'm passing judgment on the way she always stuck her knife
In my back ever since we were starting out
You can do better than
You can do better than that
I know you've been feeling sad
But you can do better than that
And I know that you're not to blame
But you can do better than that
I said goodbye when I shouldn't have said it (said it)
I even cried but I never meant it (I regret it)
Something good and true
I don't wanna feel blue anymore (Blue)
Gimme one more night
One last goodbye
Let's do it one last time
Let's do it one last time
One more time
I just wanna be held when I'm scared

Because your life is dark and it needs some light
Because you'll never see that the stars are free
We only own our hell
And if you don't know that by now
Then you don't know me that well
All my life I've been so lonely
All in the name of being holy
You keep buyin' stars
And you could buy up all of the stars
But it wouldn't change who you are
You're still living life in the dark
It's just who you are
It's just who you are
You bought a star in the sky tonight
And in your man-made dark
The light inside you died

But it wouldn't change who you are (Who you are)
You're still living life in the dark
It's just who you are
It's just who you are
You know only how to own me
You're buying stars to shut out the light
And no matter how hard you try
I'll always belong in the sky
(You could buy up all the stars)

It's just who you are

And I can be your clown
But you ain't got my number
Now I got your back up what do you not like?
Do you think I'm stuck up 'cause I'm always picking fights?

A day in the dark
To become your suicide blonde

Been different people many times
I lived my life in bitterness
And filled my heart with emptiness
There is no crime in being kind
Not everyone is out to screw you over
And now the time is here
The sky is clear
It's clear of fear
Don't wanna live in fear and loathing
I wanna feel like I am floating
Instead of constantly exploding
In fear and loathing
Got different people inside my head
I wonder which one that they like best
I'm done with tryna have it all
And ending up with not much at all

In fear and loathing
And when the time comes along
And the lights run out
I know a light will burn on
When they blow me out
Don't wanna live in fear and loathing
I wanna feel like I am floating
Instead of constantly exploding
In fear and loathing
I wanna be completely weightless
I wanna touch the edge of greatness
Don't wanna be completely faithless
Completely faithless
When the time comes around
When the lights will go out
When the time comes around
Ποθώ γλυκές νεράιδες να δω
Και από κορμί ξωτικό μαγικό χορό
Να χαϊδέψω μαύρα μαλλιά
Να φιλήσω χείλη μελιά
Ένα τραγούδι απ' τ' Aλγέρι
Τραγούδι του καμηλιέρη
I ran the marathon
The road had many bends
But we knew that all along
I think it made me stronger
But I would rather not
Betray myself just to keep
Your love at any cost
And it's most tempting to give in
When you hear the firing shots
When you're steps from winning back
Maybe I would've stayed
Maybe I would've stayed

The seeds we planted grew
But not like roses do
We had the thorns and leaves
And now my future gleams
With colors bold and bright
In a home that's filled with love and hope
And a life that just feels right
And it's most tempting to give in
When you're almost at the top
When you're steps from winning back
Maybe I would've stayed
Maybe I would've stayed
I wouldn't have walked away
I wouldn't have walked away
And there's no heartbreak left to feel
It happened years ago
After you made your choices
I melted away like snow
'Cause you like lying to yourself
And now I'll never know
What parts of your love were for real
And what parts were for show
Maybe I would've stayed
Maybe I would've stayed
I wouldn't have walked away
But there's a force that carries me on
Sick of the wounds that never heal (Never heal)
'Cause I have lived my life in debt
I've spent my days in deep regret
Ain't no time for regret
Ever since I can remember
Life was like a tipping scale
Like an abacus I played with
Counting every win and fail (Win and fail)
'Cause I have lived my life in debt
I've spent my days in deep regret
But I wanna forgive and forget

Ain't no time for regret
To be letting go
What I'm talking about
Got nothing to lose and nothing to prove
I love that he pretends to care
If I'll ever get to heaven
When a million dollars gets you there
Chasing rabbits down a hole
When I was born to be the tortoise
I was born to walk alone
Forget about it
Forget about it
Forget about it
Ain't no time for regret
I'm gonna leave the past behind
That chain of thought that followed me
I've put my money where my mouth is
For the first time in my life
I've made mistakes but I believe that
Everything was worth the fight
But only 'cause it makes you strong
It's filled with peaks and twists and turns
La-la-la-la-la-la
Ju-u-u-uice
La-la-la-la-la-la
I've seen seasons come and go
From winter sun to summer snow
This ain't my first time at the rodeo
Nature ain't a fruit machine
She's gotta keep her credits clean
Good things come to those who wait
But I ain't in a patient phase
It's summer time and I hang on the vine
They're gonna make me into sweet red wine
Hanging around like a fruit on a tree
Come on fill your cup up
Looking for some good luck
Hanging like a fruit
Ready to be juiced

I'm pinker than shepherd's delight
Sweet like honeysuckle late at night
Leave it too long I'll go rot
Like an apple you forgot
Birds and worms will come for me
The cycle of life is complete
Pick my petals off and make my heart explode
Come on fill your cup up
Looking for some good luck
Birds will sing their mourning song

Not ladylike to behave like a slime
Easy to be sleazy when you've got a filthy mind
Girls are not meant to fight dirty
Never look a day past thirty
Not gonna bend over and curtsy for you
Is there any possibility
You'll quit gossiping about me
To hide your insecurities?
'Cause I fall asleep when they speak
Of all the calories they eat

I feel I've been riding in a fast car
Burning dirty gas won't get you that far

But I'm gonna make sure I get the last laugh
Is there any possibility
You'll quit gossiping about me
To hide your insecurities?
'Cause I fall asleep when they speak
Of all the calories they eat
Up there in your lover's universe
Shine your light down on me
Somewhere between new and old
Another life waits to unfold
Maybe one day  if we're lucky
I fucked it up  I lost it all
And my life might not be what I thought
But I wouldn't change a thing
Goodbye to the girl that I'd been
Goodbye to the girl that I was
Goodbye to the girl that you lost
I will never be yours again
Never wanted our love to end
Goodbye  my friend
Maybе we won't meet again
But you'll always be my closest friеnd
I hope you'll always be happy

And broken hearts are quick to burn
And slow to heal easily

They live out their lives so purposefully
They all find their way automatically
Bluebirds forever colour the sky
'Cause birds of a feather fly together

I want to belong like the birds in the trees
The skyscrapers glow like they'll never fall down
Bluebirds forever colour the sky

Couldn't sit back
And let the sunlight
In my lap
I sang a hymn
To bring me peace
And then it came
A melody
It felt so sweet
It felt so strong
It made me feel like
I belonged
And all the sadness
Inside me
Melted away
Like I was free

Found a life worth living for someone else

Don't go out

A little company
So now you know
You know it all

Des-desperately alone
I haven't found
The one for me
But I believe
In divinity
I found what I'd been looking for in myself
Found a life worth living for someone else
I believe in possibility
I believe someone’s watching over me
From the concrete to the coast
I was looking for a holy ghost
Like the land joining the sea
Happiness it followed me
I believe in possibility
I believe someone's watching over me
We are the pieces in a puzzle called fate
Life takes its time in its own fashion
Emotions unfold like a superbloom in action
The universe hangs like a necklace from God
Jewels suspended in the cosmos
And it makes me believe
This is how we're meant to be
'Cause we're just highly emotional people
And you don't need to hide
I never see you cry
I never see you cry
All of the weight you have carried around
I feel your pain 'cause I know life is hard
But you can let go of the pain in your heart
'Cause we're just highly emotional people
And you don't need to hide
You know it's safe to tell me how you feel
I never see you cry
I never see you cry

American queen is the American dream
She is a Polish girl in America
Because I don't want to end up living in a dive on Vine
A dive on vine
Air hostesses doing gossip magazine
Crosswords on a flight to JFK
Thirty-nine years old with a mile-high sheen
Trying to stimulate a mind
That is slowly starting to decay
Hollywood infected your brain
Living in a movie scene
I'm obsessed with the mess that's America

I'm obsessed with the mess that's America
American dream is the American queen
American queen is the American dream

Hollywood infected your brain
I've been living in a movie scene
Hollywood infected your brain
I've been living in a movie scene
Until otherwise proven
Deception and perfection are wonderful traits
You'll find me in the lonely hearts
Under 'I'm after a brand new start'
And I don't belong to anyone
Girls and their curls and their gourmet vomit
Boys and their toys and their six inch rockets
We're all very lovely 'til we get to know each other
As we stop becoming friends and we start becoming lovers
And I don't belong to anyone

I guess you could say that my life's a mess
But I'm still looking pretty in this dress
I'm the image of deception
When everything is life and death
You may feel like there's nothing left
Instead of love and trust and laughter
What you get is happy never after
But deep down all you want is love
The pure kind we all dream of
But we cannot escape the past
So you and I will never last

Smoking a lot of cigarettes lately
It's okay to say you've got a weak spot

Like a god in the sky
I wanna be a silk flower
Like I'm never gonna die
I wanna live forever
Forever in your heart
And we'll always be together
From the end to the start
It's just another part of the human race
I'm forever chasing after time
If I could buy forever at a price
But if the Earth ends in fire
And the seas are frozen in time
There'll be just one survivor

It’s not enough to live out a lucky life
I'm forever chasing after time
If I could buy forever at a price
But if the Earth ends in fire
And the seas are frozen in time
There'll be just one survivor
The memory that I was yours and you were mine
To leave behind a little proof
I'm forever chasing after time
If I could buy forever at a price
But if the Earth ends in fire
And the seas are frozen in time
There'll be just one survivor
The memories of our lifetime (life)
But without you I am afraid I'll fall
I know I'm playing with your heart
And I could treat you better but I'm not that smart
It isn't fair and it isn't right
To lead you on like it's all alright
I played with your heart
And I could treat you better but I'm not that smart
But I wanna be free
I've been doing things I shouldn't do (Things I shouldn't do)
It's difficult to move on
When nothing was right and nothing's wrong
You still can't look me in the eye
'Cause you've been bitten once and now you're twice as shy
I've had my share of beautiful men
But I'm still young and I want to love again
It's difficult to say goodbye
And easier to live a lover's lie

I've been doing things I shouldn't do (Things I shouldn't do)
But I don't wanna say goodbye (Goodbye)
I'm a ruin
Getting off on bad behaviour
You're losing your temper
Do you think they won't remember?
(I know)
Real hearts don't lie
Take it from me (I know)
You'll see in time
Take it from me
It's funny how it all goes down

You're never gonna love me  so what's the use?
What's the point in playing a game you're gonna lose?
What's the point in saying you love me like a friend?
What's the point in saying it's never gonna end?
You're too proud to say that you made a mistake
You're a coward 'til the end
I don't wanna admit that we're not gonna fit
No  I'm not the type that you like
Why don't we just pretend?
Lies
I just want it to be perfect
To believe it's all been worth the fight
Lies

You're a coward 'til the end

No  I'm not the type that you like
Why don't we just pretend?
Lies
I just want it to be perfect
To believe it's all been worth the fight
Lies
Ooh  lies

One life with one dream on repeat
I'll escape if I try hard enough
Till King of the Jungle calls my bluff

That I must take the unforsaken road
Forsaken road
There's a fork in the road
I'll do as I am told
Who I wanna be
Cuckoo! (Cuckoo! Cuckoo!)
