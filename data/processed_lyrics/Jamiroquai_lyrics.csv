lyrics
"Could you love me? Don't hate me
Should be our destiny
There's a cold streak living inside us
Now don't you want to rise up?
We been giving hate a chance
And the love will be running out for us
Can you feel the dream's alive?
We're hoping we can still survive
As the wind carries every dove away
So why do we see these colors?
Can't you see it's killing me? Trigger happy fantasy
So stand up and be so strong now
Freedom is not so far away
If you know you want to rise up
(We've wanted to rise up for so long now)
We can make this hate stop
Now don't you want to rise up?
We been giving hate a chance
And the love will be running out for us
Can you feel the dream's alive?
We're hoping we can still survive
As the wind carries every dove away
The wind carries every dove away
The wind carries every dove away
Every dove away
Now you've been taking our dignity for too long
I want to save this sanctity that we hold
And who's right and who is wrong?
We're not so different anyway
Words are in this song
Can't we stop the fighting?
'Cause we been giving hate a chance
We have all this love to give
And the love will be running out for us
I feel the love is gonna run out for us
Can you feel the dream's alive?
We're hoping we can still survive
As the wind carries every dove away
(The wind carries every dove away)
Don't give this hate a chance
(The wind carries every dove away)
(The wind carries every dove away!)
Don't give this hate a chance
(As the wind carries every dove away!)
(And the love will be running out for us)
Until no more people have to cry
Don't give this hate a chance
(Just because you know you can!)
I need your love  I need your love
I need your love  I need your love
I need your love  I need your love
I need your love  I need your love
You  give me light
So tonight  take me there
I feel your sun
Start to glow and I know it  let me show you that
I want your love  I need your touch
Come fly with me  eternally
You and me  we were meant to be
Yeah hey
Alright (right now)
We'll spend the night together
Wake up and live forever
Yeah hey
Alright (right now)
We'll spend the night together
Wake up and live forever
Yeah hey
Ooh  it's alright now
I see your eyes
Hold the key  to my paradise
Summer in your smile
Well it makes me feel so real
You tell me things  and my heart sings to the world
From islands in the sky
Take my hand  as one we will stand
You know it's never never  to say hello to forever
Yeah hey
Alright (right now)
We'll spend the night together
Wake up and live forever
Yeah hey
Alright (right now)
We'll spend the night together
Wake up and live forever
Yeah hey
Alright (right now)
We'll spend the night together
Wake up and live forever
Yeah hey
Alright (right now)
We'll spend the night together
Wake up and live forever
Yeah hey
I need your touch
I want your love  so much
I need your touch
And I want your love  so much
We'll spend the night together
Wake up and live forever
Yeah hey
Alright
We'll spend the night together
Wake up and live forever
Yeah hey
Alright
We'll spend the night together
Am I love?
Every heart is beating
I'm all love
Can't you feel me feeling?
Take my hand (automaton)
Cold like a junkie (automaton)
I'm an ice cold man (automaton)
(I'm an ice cold man)
(Automaton)
Why am I crying for you?
All this love I felt for you
Has gone away to another place (It's a digital life)
I put my faith in a digital world
Where they've given me
Eyes without a face
I steal the moon on silver nights
Remind myself I am someone
My soul is null and void tonight
I'm automaton (I'm automaton)
I'm so tough
Can't you see me running?
Can you feel me coming?
I see the world
And cry for freedom
The fact that I
Need something to believe in
But then I'm dying for you
I said goodbye to the world I knew
And took off into inner space (It's a digital life)
Weren't you the ones who promised me
A very different place?
And tilt my head toward the sun
I'm automaton
Automaton
Automaton
Automaton
Automaton
Gettin' holed up in my cyber lounge
As if I had time to break that down
(Automaton)
Whatever you can do I can override it
Got a million ways to synthesize it
Fi-fi-fight it out
Automaton (It's a digital life)
Automaton (Digital life)
Automaton (A digital life)
Automaton
Feel like a man who fell to Earth
But this is not where I belong
They rule my life from a metal box
That's windowless
And I wonder where it all goes wrong
Maybe this dream will stay alive
But can the madness be undone?
Am I the new intelligence?
I'm automaton
I'm automaton
I'm automaton
I'm automaton
I'm automaton
I'm automaton
I'm automaton
It's a digital life
It's a digital life
(You were all I knew)
(I'm automaton)
I need something
(This was all I knew)

Lyrics - Bad Girls
Toot toot hey beep beep
Toot toot hey beep beep
Toot toot hey beep beep
Toot toot hey beep beep
Bad girls
Talking about the sad girls
Sad girls
Picking up on all kinds of strangers
If the price is right you can score
If you're pocket's nice
But you want a good time
Bad girls
Talking about the sad girls
Sad girls
Friday night and the strip is hot
Suns gone down and they're about to trot
Spirits high and they look hot
Do you wanna get down
You such a dirty bad girl
You such a dirty bad girl
But you call yourself by different names
Now you mama won't like it when she finds out
Her girl is out at night
Toot toot hey beep beep
I got what you want
You got what I need
I'll be your baby
Come and spend it on me
Hey mister
I'll spend some time with you
Bad girls
They're just bad girls
Talkin' about sad girls
Sad girls
Got a dime?
Hey  hey  let the rain come down on me
Hey  hey
Hey  hey
I see people and they're craving blood
And I'm so rarely understood
But I don't know what they want from me
It's gonna take some time just to let them see
I'm going through a black (hey)
Capricorn day
And though it doesn't seem so
I've got to get this way
I'm going through a black (hey)
Capricorn day
And though you wanna check me out
I'm not the man to
Play  play  play  play
Hey  hey
Don't you see I'm the not the man to play
Hey  hey
No way you can play with me today
Hey  hey
Just let me sing to ya  Capricorn day

My heart is a pincer  and the sky is black
And I can feel cold steel  when I turn my back
It stings like needles  with a jagged tongue
You know  this rain reminds me of when I was so young
I never had any of those

Capricorn days
And though it doesn't seem so
I've got to get this way
I'm going through a black (hey)

It's just too black for me  it's just too black for me
It's just too black for me  it's just too black for me
It's just too black
I'm stuck on the highway leading straight to hell
Like any other drifter with a soul to sell
You know I'm dealing with the devil in everyone I meet
And their faces tell a story that life is so sweet
And I'm going through a black (hey)

That now you blow my mind
Honey
You're sweeter
Want to get closer to you
I want you get closer to you now
Love ya
I need ya
I think I wanna squeeze ya
Nightly
So tightly
Girl you know you really blow my mind
Say it again
Just one more time
I've got to know
How you came to blow my mind
Closer
Tonight's the night I'm looking for your action
I want to hold you
Don't you know that now you blow my mind
Say it again
Just one more time
I've got to know
How you came to blow my mind
Closer
Help me wipe the sweat away from my brow
Sexy
Oh lady
Don't you know this time you blow my mind
Oh don't you know yeah
Don't you know by now that now you blow my mind
Oh yes you do
Oh yes you do
I thought I knew them all by name
But they started looking much the same
And it's no surprise
That I don't wanna listen too much
How can I give up on all the days I know I've won?
There's nothing but rainbows
I believe in the shadows
I am runnin' like another loser
Then I'm rolling like a rusty ship on a stormy sea
You know that people are saying
Strange things
Talk to the hand
'Cause I know you think the face is gone
I don't wanna listen too much
I'm not gonna give up on all the days I know I've won
There's nothing but blue sky
There's nothing but blue sky
Nothing's gonna stop me now
I am skimming like a skipping stone on a silver lake
I'll take it when the chips are down
But to play the perfect happy clown
You gotta make a mistake
And people are saying strange things
How can I tell you I know this won't be the last song?
I don't wanna listen too much
Not gonna give up on all the days that I know I've won
That's where I'm going
That's where I'm going
Nothing but rainbows falling down on me
'Cause there'll be nothing but blue sky
Can't you see that's where I'm going
Blue sky
That's where I'm going
Blue sky
I used to put my faith in worship
But then my chance to get to Heaven slipped
I used to worry about the future
But then I threw my caution to the wind
You know I heard that boogie rhythm
Dance!
Nothing left for me to do but dance
I know this anger's Heaven-sent
So I've got to hang out all my hang-ups
I don't know what to do
But then that's nothing new
But I'm gonna make it anyway
You know I got canned heat in my heels
You know this boogie is for real
Only the wind can know the answer
And she cries to me when I'm asleep
She says you know that you can go much faster
I've got this voodoo child in-veined on me
I'm gonna use my power to ascend
You know I've got these running heels to use
Sometimes there's no way I lose
I was born to run and built to last
You never see my feet 'cause they move so fast
But I'm gonna make it anyway
You know this boogie is for real
You know I'm gonna dance my blues away
You know this boogie is for real
Dance! Canned heat in my heels tonight
Dance!
I'm gonna live this party life (I wanna live this party life)
I'm gonna live this party life (I wanna live this party life)
I'm gonna live this party life (I wanna live this party life)
You know that this boogie is for real (Dance!)
Got so much canned heat in my heels (Dance!)
Make sure you’re well equipped to navigate
The world and its lies
I love the way you are my open book
I see your innocence in every look
You’re my sunshine
I feel music in your love
When I hold you in my arms  I feel your soft breath
See you close your eyes and watch your head rest
Right next to mine
I feel the rhythm of your precious little heart
Makes up for when I’ve had mine pulled apart
Now I’ve tried to give you a much better start
In this life

'Cause it was a quarter past eleven
On a Saturday in 1999
Right across from where I'm standing
On the dance floor she was landing
It was clear that she was from another time
Like some baby Barbarella
With the stars as her umbrella
She asked me if I'd like to magnetise
Do I have to go star-trekking
'Cause it's you I should be checking
So she laserbeamed me with her cosmic eyes
She's just a cosmic girl
From another galaxy
My heart's at zero gravity
She's from a cosmic world
Putting me in ecstasy
Transmitting on my frequency
She's cosmic
I'm scanning all my radars
Forty thousand million light years away
It's a distant solar system
I tried to phone but they don't list 'em
So I asked her for a number all the same
So I can teleport ya
All around my heavenly body
I should take care not to flounder
She's just a cosmic girl
From another galaxy
My heart's at zero gravity
She's from a cosmic world
Putting me in ecstasy
Transmitting on my frequency
She's cosmic
Sends me into hyperspace when I see her pretty face
Sends me into hyperspace when I see her pretty face
Sends me into hyperspace when I see her pretty face
Sends me into hyperspace when I see her pretty face
She's just a cosmic girl
From another galaxy
Can't you be my cosmic woman?
To be my cosmic girl for the rest of time
They gonna wreck it down  yeah
Something's come to rock me
And I can't keep my head
I get nervous in the New York City streets
Where my legacy treads
I know I'm better off standing in the shadows
Far from humans with guns
But now it's too late  there's no escape
From what they have done
Come on!
I'm going deeper underground
There's too much panic in this town

And the outer galaxies
Of Alpha Centauri
Shuttle departs  2.56 seconds
Feels good  I'm stranded on a spaceship hideaway
And something makes me think I'm here to stay
I'm so happy where I am
Feels good  I've journeyed to the other atmospheres
And every breath I take just makes it clear
I'm holding Heaven in my hands
It's automatic  baby
And it feels good
Well  it feels so good

Are causing me some complications

I'm coming down tonight to taste y'all
Maybe that's because you're the other half of me
Like the spring in bloom the summer of our love is soon
Every bird will sing the melody of our love tune
Stormy weather days make us go our separate ways
Where our love was so at ease
Yesterday I was brighter than the mornin' sun
Now my love is lost and lonely days have just begun
A solitary chair for a silent love affair
Yesterday I was half the man I'd used to be
Every bird will sing the melody of our love tune
Maybe that's because you're the other half of me
Every bird will sing melody of our love tune
Every bird will sing the melody of our love tune
Every bird will sing the melody of our love tune
Name in bright lights
You're a rockstar
And some tin foil
With a glass pipe
Is your guitar - now yes it is!
Little Angela
Suffers delusions
From these high times
She's been cleaning up
Since she was fourteen
On the main line
And her hunky funky junky
Of a boyfriend
Got her on late nights
With her skirt tight
God bless our high times!
Don't you know that last night
Turned to daylight
Last night
All my troubles
I'm searching
My reflection
For a glimpse of another me
I've got to get away from all these high times
'Cause these high times
Are killing me!
Now these high times go on and on and on
Where you live your nine lives
And your head spins
With purple cyclones
Made of Dexedrine
(Gimme some of that)
And when the phone rings
You think bad things
In any backstreet
When you take a hot seat
Make sure you check your flight times
Now drop it this time
Paranoia will destroy ya (x3)
Paranoia
Paranoia
This time!
La la la la la la
High times (oh yeah)
Last night
Turned to daylight
And a moment
Half a world away
Time can be so precious
When you throw your
Life away
I can't help living it up
Letting it all go wrong
I can't believe in these white lines
Knowing my life has gone
Kids wanna give it up
Kids wanna give it up
Time to let your mind be free
Searching for eternity (x3)
Kids wanna give it up
Kids wanna give it up

Her mind’s a razor blade
And now she knows she got it made because
She just killed a man

You better handle her with kid gloves
Handle her with kid gloves
She’s hot property
That girl is hot hot hot hot property
My baby’s hot hot hot hot property
I’ve got myself a little piece of hot property
Hot property

As I awoke from deeper dreams
All this evolution
And still I don't know what it means
And it gets so hard for me to change
When there's an easy way to earn
Why should I work my fingers to the bone? (to the bone?!?)
Is this what I truly deserve?
This is not another trilogy
It's just another story
Just another story baby
Nobody make a move  this kid's got you covered
He was just seventeen  trying to get on like his dead brother
Mama couldn't do a thing about him
Though she hurt inside and daddy wants his son back
While him knows he's still alive
Stick up kid  thinking you're a glory boy
Oh  fronting that stupid toy
But you don't get that it's yourself you will destroy
Like a speed freak king of amphetamine
Still running those rocks on the front line
Get up tight when its your turn
A bullet in the head is the lesson learned
One of these days you're gonna say goodbye
Telling everyone you've never been so high
Born the same time that you die
You're pushing that draw like you're superfly
Heaven help all with no way out
That's what this is all about
This is not another trilogy
It's just another story  baby
Hit him with it now
Come on now hit him with it now
Stick up kid
Come on
Ahaha-ha-ha  I got you where I want ya!
Nobody make a fucking move!
All these gangster kids are getting uptight
All these gangster kids are getting uptight
I got ya! I got ya where I want ya now  nobody make a fucking move
He was just seventeen  trying to get on like his dead brother
And Daddy wants his son back  while him knows he's still alive
Stick up kid  thinking you're a glory boy
Oh  fronting that stupid toy
But you don't get that it's yourself you will destroy
Still running those rocks on the front line
Like a speed freak king on amphetamine
Get up tight when its your turn
A bullet in the head is the lesson learned
One of these days you're gonna say goodbye
Telling everyone you've never been so high
Born the same time that you die
You're pushing that draw like you're superfly
This is just another story
All your broken glories
Somebody  somebody
Push it to the outer ridge
This is not another trilogy
It's just another story
Stick up kid
This is not another trilogy
I'm coming back to you
I just stopped to say
That everything we did is through
You tried to undermine
The better ranges of my nature
But soon you're going to find
You should have started talking straighter
Now don't you worry
I won't put you down
To see you go to ground
Because it's true what they say
You're only king for a day
I hope you're happy that way
There's no hope
For peace and reconciliation
You're quick to play your hand
But what you haven't learnt is patience
So look before you leap
To tell the world your coloured story
It's clear your talk is cheap
Do anything to get your glories
So spread your wings and fly
There is no doubt
Shout about
Because it's true what they say
You're only king for a day
I guess you're happy that way
And there's no love
Ever to be lost between us
I guess this is because
The damage you've done is so grievous
So I hang my head
To dwell on what might have been
But what you left instead
Pieces of a broken dream
Now don't you worry
I won't put you down
To see you go to ground
Because it's true what they say
You're only king for a day
I guess you're happy that way
So spread your wings and fly
There is no doubt
Something to shout about
Because it's true what they say
You're only king for a day
I guess you're happy that way
Don't you see that
You're only king for a day
Trying to get your head around
The fact that me and you and love is dead
See how I'm tripping out
'Cause you can't decide what you really want from me
Why does it have to be like this?
I can never tell
With a little L
There you were shouting out
Screamin' and hollerin'
How could this love become so paper-thin?
You're playing so hard to get
You're making me sweat just to hold your attention
I can't give you nothing more
If you ain't giving nothing to me
Don't you know that
With a little L
Why does it have to be like this?
I can never tell
Seems like you're stepping on the pieces
Of my broken shell
Why does it have to be like this?
I can never tell
With a little L
(Why does it have to be like this?)
You make me love you
You make me love you
You make me love you with a little L
You make me love you
You make me love you
You make me love you with a little L
You make me love you with a little L
Honey  honey  looks like a superstar  hey hey
She got a promise of lovestruck fascination  ooh
What am I to do? how am I to know who you are?
When this love foolosophy is killing
Previous illusions that (I'm a love fool)
I had in my mind about you (I'm a love fool)
Seems so true  all the lies you're telling
Tragically compelling and (I'm a love fool)
My love  it means nothing to you
So maybe I'm still a love fool
She shimmers like a California sunset
Lady lady  glitters but there's no gold
She carries sweetly infectious magic formulas
I'm so delirious  is she that serious?
Or is she bringing me on? I've been waiting so long
And this love foolosophy is killing
Previous illusions that (I'm a love fool)
I had in my mind about you (I'm a love fool)
Seems so true  all the lies you're telling
Tragically compelling and (I'm a love fool)

Don't you see they're killing me? Ah
It was 400 years or more
Since you came to crucify
And they were taken far away from home
There were promises of paradise
But if they had been told that they
That they would be sold this way
To satisfy the souls of chosen men
At the shame of my ancestry
To redefine the storyline again
And shown another way
Now every child can learn a different thing
Sadness was the best thing I could bring
On the inside he was dead
And this is what he said
Superiority was clearly meant to be
So destiny will manifest in time
So where has the love all gone?
A troubled trail of tears will tell the tale
For ethical slavery is just an absurdity
How can you be alive when you are dead?
With these chains of hypocrisy
The shame of my ancestry
If I was taken for a day
And shown another way
Now every child can learn a different thing
Sadness was the best thing I could bring
On the inside he was dead
And this is what he said
Superiority was clearly meant to be
So where has the love all gone?
Said I want to know why
Hey!
Won't you go to my morning glory?
All of my visions were untrue
Till I had a vision of you
And untimely end for all
Saw the morning glory
Away from soliloquies of sadness
And prophecies of pain and prophecies of pain
We're livin' for our own lives
For us all on this eve
I had a vision in my mind
I had a vision of peace
Have you gone astray or lost your way?
You should have seen me yesterday
Well I knew this kind of love was written in the stars
It's only once or twice that you're in line with Mister Moon
Then it was you  you took me on your cloud
And gave me flowers for my pain  but with some degree of certainty
My destiny seemed to slip away from me
Yeah  before I got to know your name  aw  honey
Just give me a chance  I'll do what you want me to
Everybody wants to dance  so how come I can't dance with you?
You really turn me on
You're the one that makes me smile
It's Mister Moon who plays in tune  Mister Moon who knows
And if it's Mister Moon who gives the sign  then that's the sign that goes
I never know what to do 'til I'm there with you
Yeah  I'm right on
Did you lose your mind for a day?
You don't remember anyway
Like the waters of a dream encapsulate my mind
A place I haven't seen sits at the end of space and time
So lost in love that I think I'm blind
To perchance upon this circumstance is something of a miracle
So spiritual  it's vergin' on the physical (How?)
Searchin' for a love I cannot find

This can never really end
It's infinitely sad
Can someone tell me when
Something good became so bad
So if you have a cure
To me would you please send
A picture of my life
With a letter telling how
It should really be instead
The precipice is there
But will I ever dare?
Throw myself in the sky
Holds nothing too dear
Who will mind?
If I just disappear?
This can never really end
It's infinitely sad
Can someone tell me when
Something good became so bad

Which I cannot define
Does your heart bleed like mine
For a place we can go where the
Troubles of our time are far away
And I had all my life in front of me
Now my darkest days are trouble free
There are so many wondrous things for you to see
If you find that something’s going wrong
Look around at what you’re running from
You can wait a thousand years in line
For that stillness in time
I found love in that way
Anything you give me today
I now will be thankful for
People find it hard to be strong
‘Cause they don’t know where they’re coming from
And there was nothing left to do but hang on
For that stillness in time
There’s a stillness in time
Search the spaces of my mind
If this world is turning too fast for your head
Just remember how bad times can roll instead
I guess I’ll have to search the spaces of my mind
For that stillness in time
I found love in that way
Anything you give me today
I now will be thankful for
People find it hard to be strong
‘Cause they don’t know where they’re coming from
And there was nothing left to do but hang on
For that stillness in time
Ooh
I know that this
Is the peripheral side of bliss
There is no name
For the love I have won’t stay the same
I have done wrong
If I don’t know where I’m coming from
Said I know
Said I want to find that
That summer girl  she keeps me dreamin'
While every heart is flutterin’
She walks the street outside
Sets every pulse a-racin’
They’re looking  she don’t mind
Summer girl
Oh that summer girl
And she don’t care for money
‘Cause she got all she needs
Got legs like liquid honey
Eyes the colour of the sea
Oh that summer girl
You know
While every wolf is whistling
And every dog’s a fool
She knows they're so bereft
Of everything she thinks is cool

Oh that summer girl
And I’ve got a midnight crisis
It’s taking over me

No stealing fantasies
From summer girl
No diamonds or pearls

Have you heard the news today?
People right across the world
Are pledging they will play the game
Victims of a modern world
Circumstance has brought us here
Foresight is the only key
To save our children's destiny
The hypocrites  we are their slaves
On each other  we depend
Oh  we depend
Mountain high and river deep
Stop it going on
We gotta wake this world up from its sleep
Yeah  yeah
Have you heard the news today?
Money's on the menu in my favourite restaurant
Well  don't talk about quantity
Cause there's no fish left in the sea
Greedy men been killing all the life there ever was
And you'd better play in nature's way
She will take it all away
And don't try and tell me you know more than her
About right from wrong
Done the only thing you can
Now my life is in your hands

You had a little thing I'd love to keep
And every movement carried much mystique
I knew right then I'd carry on
To you I knew my heart belongs
Something that nobody else can give
And my heart started thumping
You know now you're the one I truly know I dig
Like the sunbeams from a perfect summer day
And heaven only seems a step away
When I'm with you  I just celebrate
I'm hoping my message gets through
There's never been someone like you
I had nobody but on you  I lean
Cause you got those little things that I
I know I've never seen
Something that nobody else has got
And this love  that I've been wanting
Something that nobody else can give
See  my heart has started thumping
