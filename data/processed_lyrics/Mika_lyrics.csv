lyrics
"That is changing with the times
But it's oh so complicated
If your mother is like mine
All that she wants are the stars and the moon
A son with a wife and a big living room
All she wants
Is another little special arrangement
A peculiar engagement
To avoid any spectacle
It's another simple solution
For my mother's delusion
Get her some adorable pictures done
For her mother in Lebanon
All that she wants (All she wants)
All that she wants
All that she wants (All she wants)
All that she wants
All that she wants (All she wants)
All that she wants
Is another son

Let's be honest with each other
There's some things we always knew
All that she wants is the sun and the moon
The call of the wild and a big silver spoon
All she wants
Is another little special arrangement
A financial engagement
Social standing is stable
But no kids on the table
Just a little harmless diversion
An acceptable Persian
But I know my heart is in peril
Made a deal with the devil
All that she wants (All she wants)
All that she wants
All that she wants (All she wants)
All that she wants
All that she wants (All she wants)
All that she wants
Is another son
Heaven knows just what I've done
All these hateful conversations
Are not helping anyone
My dear wife I have to leave you
There is nothing you can say
You can keep the house without me
You'll be better off this way
All that she wants (All she wants)
All that she wants
All that she wants (All she wants)
All that she wants
All that she wants (All she wants)
All that she wants
All that she wants (All she wants)
All that she wants
All that she wants (All she wants)
All that she wants
You could tell the difference
And let it all unfurl
Into broken remnants
Smile like you mean it
And let yourself let go
Say goodbye to the world you thought you lived in
Say goodbye to the world you thought you lived in
To the world you thought you lived in
I tried to live alone
I had to give up my defences
So I smiled and tried to mean it
To let myself let go

Tell me what my penance should be
It's a beautiful disaster

I get this feeling I can't miss
You're getting harder to resist
And maybe by the time I know
It'll be too late to let you go
Who knew my heart could beat so quick?
My life I'd give away for this
Don't care what anybody sees

Walks into the room  feels like a big balloon
Diet coke and a pizza  please. Diet coke! I'm on my knees
You take your skinny girls  I feel like I'm gonna die
'Cause a real woman needs a real man  here's why:
You take your girl and multiply her by four
Now a whole lotta woman needs a whole lot more
Get yourself to the Butterfly Lounge  find yourself a big lady
No need to fantasize since I was in my braces
Of a watering hole where the girls are round and curves in all the right places
Ah-ah! Big girls  you are beautiful!
Ah-ah! Big girls  you are beautiful!

While it was all going accordingly to plan
Then Billy Brown fell in love with another man
He met his lover almost every single day
Making excuses for his dodgy holiday
On some religion that he said he’d newly found
They didn’t know that his faith was earthly bound
Brown  oh Billy Brown!
Don’t let the stars get you down
Don’t let the waves let you drown
Brown  oh Billy Brown!
Gonna pick you up like a paper cup
Gonna shake the water out of every nook
Oh Billy Brown!
Oh Billy brown needed a place  somewhere to go
He found an island off the coast of Mexico
Leaving his lover and his family behind
Oh Billy Brown needed to find some peace of mind
Then on his journey and his travels on the way
He met a girly who was brave enough to say…
When they made love  he shared the burden of his mind
“Oh Billy Brown  you are a victim of the times”

Oh Billy Brown had lived an ordinary life
Two kids  a dog and a cautionary wife
While it was all going accordingly to plan
He's got looks that books take pages to tell
He's got a face to make you fall on your knees
He's got money in the bank to thank and I guess
You could think he's living at ease
Like lovers on the open shore -- What's the matter?
When you're sitting there with so much more -- What's the matter?
While you're wondering what the hell to be
Are you wishing you were ugly like me?

I won't be in love for me

Then why does my heart not see?
Why do I keep on finding ways to be next to you
When no one makes me feel more alone than you?

That problem was already old in '94
Where have all the gay guys gone?
And to the romance when I was 14 years old
And to my heroes that were dressed up in gold
Only hoping one day I could be so bold
Where have all the gay guys gone?
Cause some of us in the gutter are looking up at the stars
Cause some of us in the gutter are looking up at the stars
So tell me
Where have all the good guys gone?
Where have all the good guys gone?

It's not the cowboys that are missing anymore
That problem was already old in '94
Got a two-seater sofa and some whiskey in a bottle
Broken in tears with the weight of the world on his shoulders
Says his wife's just left with his 2-year-old daughter
To live in Acapulco with some idiot she only met a couple months ago
I wish I could tell you that
If it was me  I would be a good wife
I would never doubt you  ours would be a good life
And we could be better than so many
I would never stress you about bringing home the plenty
For all these things another life I'll have to wait
Would have been perfect if only God had wanted it
But you'll never know and when we'll get old

They’re fighting someone else's war
They'll have so many stories to tell
In exchange for a hero's farewell
I wish I could
I wish I could make you return
And what if I’ll never discern?
As you walk to the toll of the bell
You’ll be fighting for our heaven with hell
And you don't understand
Why no one else can see
It's your blood on me
And my blood on you
But to make you bleed
The only thing I wouldn't do
So much harder to love when alive
You would think you were better off dead

The swimming pool is laughing with its shiny  bright blue teeth
Laughing at my body as it's sweltering with heat

Silent in your struggle  living life like there's nothing wrong

Drinking up the sunshine
Dancing in Sanremo?
We can be there in a couple of hours
To the place with the yellow flowers
Somewhere only we know
But stuck in my head is a picture of you
I wanna know if I'll see you again
Everything changes in the blink of an eye
Want you to know what you mean to me
I could put a little stardust in your eyes
Put a little sunshine in your life
Give me a little hope you feel the same
Will I see you again?
And pick up my heart that you left on the floor
Want you to know what you mean to me

Put a little sunshine in your life
Give me a little hope you feel the same
Will I see you again?
Funny how the time goes rushing by
And all the little things we leave behind
But even betting everything I do
Is a little bit of me and a little bit of you
When will I see you again?
When will I see you again?
When will I see you again?
When will I see you again?
I could put a little stardust in your eyes
Put a little sunshine in your life
Give me a little hope you feel the same
Will I see you again
Running out of time that’s rushing by
And all the little things we leave behind
But even betting everything I do
There’s a little bit of me and a little bit of you
When will I see you again?
When will I see you again?
Close as I get to being where you are
While there's light left  I sing this song for you
Here I stand  staring at the sun
Distant land  staring at the sun
You're not there  but we share the same one
Miles apart  staring at the sun
Distant town  staring at the sun
One thing's true just like you
There's only one
And I don't care if it burns my eyes
And I don't care cause my love is blind
From staring at the sun  oh oh
From staring at the sun
From staring at the sun  oh oh
From staring at the sun
Send my love down in those rays of light
Through your window on your tired eyes
Say good morning  say it to the sun
Like you're talking  talking to someone

I sit and think about the day that you're gonna die
Your wrinkled eyes betray the joy with which you smile
Care to see my reason?
Care to put your life in mine?
Looking at life from the perspective of a boy
Who's learned to love you  but has also learned to grow
Could we make it better  stormy weather?
It's so hard to know
Is there anybody home?
Who will believe me  won't deceive me
Won't try to change me?
Is there anybody home?
Who wants to have me  just to love me
Stuck in the middle
But my troops are bigger than yours
You'll never stand my fight

But with my careless words  I tread upon your vision
Are five kids better than one?

Is there anybody home?
Who wants to have me  just to love me
Stuck in the middle
Yeah
Yeah
Yeah...
This is just who I am
This ain't a greater plan
To break your heart
Of me
I know that what I've started
Means that when we have parted
I can live
In honesty
Is there anybody home?
Who will believe me  won't deceive me
Won't try to change me?

 but all I'm seeing is you
 one day they'll feel the same
 we're common people in love
 it's just a force from above
 some try to make me shut up
 that's what you made me
 all I do is wanna talk about you
 you've turned it upside down
 totally unprepared
 but I'm not even scared
 that's the way I wanna go
 and put me under your spell
 than normal people in hell
 all I do is wanna talk about you
 all I do is wanna talk about you
 all I do is wanna talk about you
 like normal people do
 all I do is wanna talk about you

I was born in 1983
It's just this thing that you do to me
You get me high on a tiny love
You get me high
And if it all goes bad
And our love sets like the sun
I'd give up a hundred thousand loves for just this one
You get me high with a tiny love
You get me high
But it's the greatest of them all
This tiny love would disappear
You can't forget that it was here

My name is Paloma
I was born in '81
But now I'm high with a tiny love
I will stay high
And if it all goes bad
And our love sets like the sun
I'd give up a hundred thousand loves
For just this one
And we'll stay high with a tiny love
It isn't bursting into song in Central Park
It's not the outline of your face drawn in the stars
It's a 'still-there-Monday-morning' kind of love
There's no dramatic declarations in the rain
It's not a love that finds its pleasure after pain
I couldn't train a bunch of doves to spell your name
It's a 'don't-know-what-they're-missing' kind of love
My life was dull
I used to walk in a different way
Don't care who can see me dancin'
This tiny love has spoken
And bigger hearts get broken
(Oh) Tiny love
So small that you can't find us
The world revolves around us
(Oh) Tiny love

Tomorrow

Really not so innocent
Consequences won't be easy
But if this ain't what you wanted
Then why'd you even come here? It's 2 A.M.  
If this isn't what you wanted
Then why'd you put a smiley in your message then?
So kiss me in the backseat of my vintage Benz
So kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
When you know how lucky we are

Stretching every second into more

So kiss me in the backseat of my vintage Benz
So kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
When you know how lucky we are
If you leave me all alone I'll make a mess for sure
I've a heart of gold in the smallest size
Leave me in the dark and never hear me cry
More than an illustration
Points of articulation
Come to life on a brass spring
Such a wonderful plaything
It's a cruel cross that I have to bear
If you come a little close I'm going to pull your hair
More than just a toy in a patched blue suit
Hold me in your arms I'm just a boy like you
But your momma thought there was something wrong
Didn't want you sleeping with a boy too long
It's a serious thing in a grown-up world
Maybe you'd be better with a Barbie girl
You knew that I adored you
But you left me in Georgia
Toys are not sentimental
How could I be for rental?

She's the meanest hag that has ever been
Pulled out my insides with an old safety pin
Clothes are made of rags and they don't even match
So she dressed me up as the man she loved
And threw me in a box when she had had enough
Now the light of day I no longer see
She stuck her voodoo pins where my eyes used to be
Accidentally tragic
Victim of her black magic
Had a boy once who loved me
Now he's so afraid of me
You'll be there remembering your old toy boy
When your oldest son's wondering what to be
Tell him the story of a boy like me
Ohohohohohohoh
Ohohohohohohoh
A slow landslide
And the world we leave behind
It's enough to lose your head
When I fall to my feet
Wearing my heart on my sleeve
All I see just don't make sense
You are the port of my call
You shot and leaving me raw
Now I know you're amazing
'Cause all I need
Is the love you breathe
Put your lips on me
And I can live
Underwater (Ooh)
Flying through a bright blue sky
With a space boy high
From the world I leave behind
It's enough to lose my head

Running around like a clown on purpose
Who gives a damn about the family you come from
No giving up when you're young and you want some
Running around again (running around again)
Running from running

Running from running
Waking up in the midday sun
What's to live for when you could see what I've done?
Staying out of motion in the light of day
I was hiding from the things that you'd say
We are not what you think we are
We are not what you think we are
Teenage dreams in a teenage circus
Running around like a clown on purpose
