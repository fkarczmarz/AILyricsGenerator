lyrics
"It doesn't seem that long but my whole world has changed
It's been seven minutes since I've lost the girl of my dreams
It's been half an hour now since I dropped you home
And I'm driving past the places we both know
Past the bar where we first kissed and that movie that we missed
'Cause we were hanging out in the parking lot
Looking at myself through these newfound eyes
Is it too late to turn around?
I'm already halfway out of town
Now I know how I let you down
Radio's playing songs for me and you
Chasing Cars reminds me of nights in your room
How the hell did I end up losing you? Mmm

Is it too late to turn around?
I'm already halfway out of town
Now I know how I let you down
If I came back now would you still be there?
If I come around would you even care?
If I came back now would you still be there?
If I come around would you even care?
Is it too late to turn around?
I'm already halfway out of town
Now I know how I let you down
You come into my room and you kiss my lips
But this hotel life  I'm not used to it
And you wear your heart right on your sleeve
But it took you a while to open up to me
I still love the way that you smile when you leave
And I know you get scared  when I'm away
But I think about you almost all the day
And I promise you that I'll be back again
Just can you remember? Oh  can you remember when we were
Dancing in hotel rooms  it was just me and you
We wouldn't sleep all night  with you sitting by my side
And every moment we had stolen was a feeling
'Cause it never mattered where we were
'Cause we were falling in love
Your heart is my home  your heart is my home
Your heart is my home  and I'm not letting go
When I was feeling down  you always picked me up
It didn't matter what I was doin' wrong  'cause
I've lived my life without you for too long

But when I walked through the door and I saw your face
Ooh  I knew in that moment that my world had changed
How could I live my life since you been and gone?
But can you remember? Just try to remember when we were
Dancing in hotel rooms  it was just me and you
And we wouldn't sleep all night  with you sitting by my side
And every moment we had stolen was a feeling
'Cause it never mattered where we were
'Cause we were falling in love
'Cause your heart is my home  your heart is my home
Your heart is my home  and I'm not letting go
But in any single moment you can change
'Cause I've been gone so long and I can feel you slip away  but...
I'm getting closer and closer
Can you remember? Just try to remember when we were...
Dancing in hotel rooms  it was just me and you
We wouldn't sleep all night  with you sitting by my side
And every moment we had stolen was a feeling
'Cause it never mattered where we were
'Cause we were falling in love
'Cause your heart is my home  your heart is my home
Your heart is my home  and I'm not letting go
'Cause your heart is my home  your heart is my home
Your heart is my home  and I'm not letting go
'Cause your heart is my home  your heart is my home
I'm just gonna walk home kicking stones at parked cars
I'm just gonna stand with my bag hanging off my left arm
I want the entire street out of town just so I can be alone with you
Now go when you're ready
I adore you
Found by you
I want the entire street out of town just so I can be alone with you
Now go when you're ready
I'm known as a right-hand slugger
Anybody else wanna touch my lover?

We're layin' here with nothin' to do
Wish you'd open up and say what's on your mind
Then you would know  all I wanted was you
If you could only see you through my eyes

Worthy of the light you bring
That blocks out the darkness
And if you're really needin'
Some space to find who you are
You can take it
And I'll love you until your heart breaks
Until you can open up and see
That I want you with all your mistakes
My girl  I'm fallin' in you
Would you fall into me too?

Till you came around and made me believe
You showed me that there's beauty in this world

You pull away again
And I wonder what's on your mind
And then you say to me you made a dumb mistake
You start to tremble and your voice begins to break
You say the cigarettes on the counter weren't your friend's
They were my mate's
And I feel the colour draining from my face
And my friend said
It'll be alright
So I still look back at all the messages you'd sent
But it's not the fact that you kissed him yesterday

For the last time
I remember the dark brown of your eyes
And your olive skin and the look of sin
When I put my hands on you
I fell in love with you
For the last time
Because the brighter that we shine
Leaves a bigger shadow in our wake
A story we can tell another time
But if this was love and I was wrong
Then I'll admit the mistakes we made were always mine
Were always mine
'Cause I put a spell on you
When I put my eyes on you
For the last time
And maybe I'm too young to settle down (Oh-oo)
'Cause I know that you'd be good for me
But that I wouldn't stick around

And you tell me you don't like your father

I've been away a couple years
I’ve been chasin' all my dreams
But avoidin' all my fears
So I said goodbye
’Cause I'll be runnin' from myself
For the rest of my life
Why do these birds fly into the breeze?
Why do the open arms of someone who loves me make me wanna leave?
Why is it so hard to see what I could be?
Why can't I open up my heart and fill the emptiness
Inside of me?
Sittin' in my kitchen
I've been caught inside my head
Thinkin' 'bout thе past and all
The good times that we had
’Causе I’ve been so many places
Most of which I've never seen
I guess happiness is inside me
Not livin’ in some dream

'Cause time moves so slowly
When you're still holding on to blame
I tried but can't forget the day
You were reachin' for my hand as I touched your face
When your secrets were still safe from me
Till your eyes gave you away
'Cause we are drowning above the water
In a movie drained of colour
Luckless lovers with a past that's
Just a string of small disasters
I'd give it all just to feel somethin' real
And now I see the warning signs
To the way you'd make me feel so crazy
Just to protect your lies
And all I wanted was the truth
The better part of you that I still see
'Cause love is all we have to give
But you took my best for free

Stacked up against the door
I still feel your breath on my lips
As you're walking out the door
But my hand starts to slip
Never felt like this before

All packed up

I'm sleeping by myself
And I’m lying in the spare room
Thinking I should be somewhere else
You should know when we've been drinking
We can sabotage ourselves
Like smashing up the kitchen
And I don’t want to wake you up
Tell you that I'm leaving town
I already packed my stuff
Can't go back now
But the way you look brings me straight back down
I don't want to wake you up right now
I don't want to wake you up right now
I don't want to wake you up right now
You're breaking out the windows
While I was tearing down the doors
And now I'm picking up the ashtray
That you threw against the wall
I have no idea what we’re fighting for
No we're standing right here outside your door

Through your neighborhood at night
And I saw you by your window
And you ran to me outside
And I watched you put your suitcase in my car
You smiled back at me
You said The hardest love is worth the fall (Mm)
But your fall is worth the fee
Do you know it ain't hard to love you?
You're not afraid of who you are
I stopped lookin' for the answers
'Cause you gave me all your love
Won't you close your eyes?
You've got work in the mornin'
Need you to close your eyes
And I remember
We were laying on the floor
When the doctor said
They hadn't seen somethin' like this before (Mm)
And I held you tight
And you looked in my eyes and said Easy come
But I'm scared till you go
You're not alone
That darkness has got to get through me

It was never hard to love you
You weren't afraid of who you were
I stopped looking for the answers
'Cause you gave me all your love
I'm saying goodbye to the love of my life like we didn't exist
I hope you find someone who makes you feel like you're good enough
'Cause this is the last  this is the last bit of us
Stay in this moment  I just wanna hold it as long as we can
I'll always be lookin' for you in the distance wherever I am
And someday  I'll see your face in a crowded place  and it won't hurt as much
'Cause this is the last  this is the last bit of us
So goodbye  my love (Ooh-ooh  ooh-ooh)

When I'm in the darkness  the sadnеss  it hits me when I think I'm fine
It's hard not to tеxt you  have someone to talk to in the dead of the night
When I'm goin' under  you're always there to pull me up
But this is the last  this is the last bit of us

Tried my best to not even call
'Cause if you're not here by my side
I'll come knocking at your door
Did you mean what you had said?
'Cause it's fucking with my head
I'd give it all to get you back
'Cause I can feel you when I'm low
I can feel you when I'm high
'Cause I can't get you out of my mind

And so we walk home in hands
It's just me and you

I guess they turned off the lights

You bring it up towards your lips
You breathe and push the smoke away just like you do with all your friends
Your room is messy and full of clothes
When did the person that I love turn into someone I don't know?
'Cause there's a light gone from your eyes
Like the whole world's not as bright until you find another high
There's so much pain inside your voice
And you try to drown it out with anything to fill the void
You always were the strongest
But I'm not gonna promisе that this won't hurt
You were lying in the bathroom
Wе almost thought we lost you
'Cause tryna numb the pain only makes it worse
I'm not giving up on you
I say it's time we have the talk
Make a move towards the door
And you deny there's anything you've got to hide or answer for

The boy I used to know
But there is a light in the dark
And I feel its warmth
But why can’t I hold on?

It always does
