lyrics
"But it's so cold and I don't know where
I brought you daffodils in a pretty string
But they won't flower like they did last spring
I'm just so tired to share my nights
I wanna cry and I wanna love
But all my tears have been used up
All my tears have been used up
All my tears have been used up
And I'd sing a song that'd be just ours
But I sang 'em all to another heart
But all my tears have been used up

Gonna rent a bicycle and ride
I think today is the best day of my life
Fuck thinking about the future all the time
Movie stars in black and white pictures (Mm-mm)
Warm beer and valium mixtures (Mm-mm)
Am I in a dream? Crazy as it seems
I think today is the best day of my life
I think today is the best day of my life
My girlfriend looked worried and asked me why
I've got scars they don't see
I think today is the best day of my life
Last night all I wanted to do was die
Wanna be happy  could you show me how it's done?
You look so pretty  pretty like the sun
I could watch forever while you shine on everyone
It's Black Friday  we're in a black taxi
You take my hand and hold it gently on the middle seat
It's all in my head  it's all in my mind
I'm so selfish  you're so kind
I look in the mirror  what is happening to me?
I want a better body  I want better skin
I wanna be perfect like all your other friends
You look so pretty  pretty like the wind
Every time you touch me  I feel adrenaline
It's Black Friday  the end of the week
You take my hand and hold it gently up against your cheek
It's all in my head  it's all in my mind
I see the darkness where you see the light
It's all in my head  who do I trust?
I thought that you loved me  what is happening to us?

More pillows I could ever use
Think they call it luxury
But it doesn't make a difference to me
'Cause I'd sleep on a bed that's made of concrete
Just the two of us and no sheet
Just your feet rubbing up against mine
Staring at the picture on the wall
Show me your masterpiece

You're telling me a story  some lover that you had
The piano man is playing  some old melody
It don't mean much to anyone what it does to you and me
It's just some bitter love song  that everybody's heard
It's the same old constellation
Of stars up in the sky
Yeah  I've got a feeling
They're gonna look different tonight
Maybe I'm just crazy  maybe I'm just high
You could kiss my lips a thousand times and they would never dry

London in the rain
Driving real slow in the fast lane
Feelin' kinda stressed
Tryin' to get drunk
Problem with the rich kids is that they're no fun
Right now I'm flying
So come and take a shot at me
Not scared of dying
It's sad how sad this life can be
Driving through the clouds
Picking all the bad ones out the crowd
Had a bad month
Had a bad year
Had a bad time getting over my fears
Right now I'm flying
So come and take a shot at me
Not scared of dying
It's sad how–

Starting out my daily blues
(Hmmm)
I'm sick to death of spilling coffee on my phone
(Oh)
Scrolling through pictures of you
I'd like to say that maybe we could work it out
But I know that it's no use
If I ever find anyone half as good as you
I think maybe that would do
I kissed a stranger in the hallway late last night
He was wearing purple shoes
But he just looked at me confused (Oh)

Never let me go
The street lamps are shining
Up in my bedroom
There's a mighty big fight
Between the thunder and lightning
Wonder who will lose
I see a party balloon
And I ain't been invited
There ain't nothing like it
All grey and gold
Down on Jubilee Road
Can see Mr. Bouvier
In his two-bedroom basement
In his purple dungarees
He's grumpy and he's grey
Always sweeping off the pavement
Cigarettes and leaves
His kid's up in China
His wife's up in Heaven

The neighbours they sigh
At that new generation
Just getting stoned
Down on Jubilee Road
And we'll fill up our cups with that bitter wine
And I'll show you
I'll show you
The mice are still here
Your wardrobe's still empty
And the walls are still paper thin
I think they still hate me
For all these songs I endlessly sing
'Cause it ain't no perfect street
I ain't no perfect lover
Life it is brief
I don't think we get no other

Talking of times
With our eyes a-glowing
Like the city lights

Walk a different way back home  it would all make sense
If I fell in love a thousand times  would it all make sense?
'Cause I've been feeling pretty small
Sometimes feel like I'm slipping down walls
And every line I ever get a hold  it seems to break
Could call you up  I could tell you just how much
Or if I weren't so nice  I'd convince my friends that you weren't right
I could promise you my heart don't cry  but would it all make sense?

And all I can do is pray
These sirens
Sirens don't come our way
Or we'll be
All run run running away
Or we'll be
All run run running away
All run run running away
When sirens they come our way
It's raining down
It's raining on someone's fears
I've heard the rain is the city's tears
But these sirens
These sirens are all I hear

Saw you driving past
In somebody else's car
I'm thinking to myself
I bet you're probably breaking
Somebody else's heart
Blow a kiss
I am happy that you exist
Feel that light-headed feeling
That I've missed
I wonder where you are
You're probably waking up
In somebody else's arms
We tried to make it work
But all you really needed
Was somebody else's love
Shut my eyes
That your heart will heal
It just needs timе (Need some time)

There's​ some words I know I'll never reach
But when I see  you smiling back at me
Somehow  somehow
I know exactly what you mean
Somehow  somehow
I know exactly what you mean  oh
When you look  when you look a little hurt
Sometimes I sing  a song that I have learnt
I swear to god  there's no way you could've heard
But somehow  somehow
You sing every single word

 baby sitting nice
 she's quite a sight
 I'm cross
 I'm yours
 yea-ea-ea-eah
 no doubt
 out of shame
 smile
 yeah
Won't you tell me why I'm sad?
Sing us both a melody  the best that you can
Fly  sparrow  fly
Won't you sit on my hand?
Sing it in that language we both can understand
And you sit on that tree  you look in my eyes
And I wonder what goes on in your mind
Speak  sparrow  speak
Please  won't you try?
Tell me why you'd walk if you knew that you could fly
Speak  sparrow  speak
Oh  please  won't you try?
Tell me all the answers to this meaningless life
And you're up on that tree  and you look in my eyes
And I wonder what goes on in your mind
(Louder and louder and louder and louder)
Stay  sparrow  stay
Won't you stay in my window?
I'd never been so close to anything so beautiful
Wait  sparrow  wait
Oh  please don't you go
I love the way your feathers move as the wind it blows

Sing away our pain
When you get the bones of it  we are just the same
Sing away our pain
I'll never hear a melody as sweet as today
Because you're up on that tree  and you look in my eyes
When you take off your shirt
You make me see the stars late at night
You love me at my worst
But we can't be together
And we can't be apart
We're gonna spin 'round forever
With two broken hearts
You tell me that you'd take your own life
Just to see if it hurts
You are my universe

The person I picture in my head has always been you
But these days are different  you're with some other guy
Stubbornly I still write every word as if you're still mine
And people think I'm crazy  people think I'm stoned
I'm just getting used to being on my own
When it's cold and it's raining  I'm laying there at night
I don't lay in the middle of the bed  I lay on the right
And I leave the light on  the phone up on loud
A key underneath the stone outside in case you come around
And people call me crazy  people say I'm stoned
I'm just getting used to being on my own
On my own
If I can still  feel you laying in my arms
Why can't I pretend  it does me no harm
But people call me crazy  people say I'm stoned
I'm just getting used to being on my own
And people call me crazy  but baby they don't know
I'm just getting used to being on my own
Watching the birds flying free
Watching the clouds walk
And watching the rain become the sea
Hearing my love talk
In every breath she ever breathes
Like it was always supposed to be like that
And she went west and I went east
A little too soon if you're asking me
But I've heard that she loves him
A little bit more than she'll ever love me
And it was always supposed to be like that
How many falls until I fly?
How many wrongs until I'm right?
I know it's tough now

How many wrongs until I'm right?
