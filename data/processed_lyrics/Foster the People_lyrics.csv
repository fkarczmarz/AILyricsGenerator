"But I will try
For you and I  for you and I
I won't find out all the dirty little things that you've done
But I will try
I  I
I'm coming for you giants and you liars and your chariots of fire
You charmers with your anecdotes have started to show your true colors
And now I'm staring at the moon wondering why the bottom fell out
Been searching for answers and there's questions I've found
Open your eyes and share this burden somehow
Are you ready to drink or are you waiting to drown?
I would break you before I let you fall into the blind
For you and I  for you and I
I will breathe in all the truth I can stomach
If it keeps you alive
I  I
We've changed the dreamers and the preachers and the wise men on the hill
To concrete stepping smilers terrified to lose their power and control
Yeah  we've been crying for a leader to speak like the old prophets
The blood of the forgotten wasn't spilled without a purpose  or was it?

And now I'm staring at the moon wondering why the bottom fell out
Been searching for answers and there's questions I've found
Open your eyes and share this burden somehow
Are you ready to drink or are you waiting to drown?
Until you lose control
And think freely to smash the wall of apathy
Stop your self-importance and lift the weight off somebody else
Until you lose control
And stop drinking the wine that's been dripping
From lips of the gluttons and envying their bloody teeth
 a fine lady from Belize said You got the spirit of Fela
 the young one dripping make-up lift her hands up to holla
 I gave her what I got but couldn't handle her broken heart
 will rip apart the marrow from the bone of the liars
 yeah
 are you what you want to be?
 I told her what she's got should be protected in the arms of love
 will rip apart the marrow from the bone of the liars
 yeah
 are you what you want to be?
 are you what you want to be?
Never needed the proof  just followed the rules
Well  I pick up all the paces and move my feet as fast as I can
I'm always falling behind  just float in the lines
And you want more and ambition's taken its toll on you
If you say that dreamers always get what they desire
Is this the life you've been waiting for?
Are you hoping that you'll be where you want with a little more?
You're coughing blood again
I know 'cause I clean up the mess every now and then
Just fold the line along the seam
Force a smile and never say what you mean
You're in the promised land in someone else's dream
If you want more and you'll get there
Throw a quarter in the well
If you say that dreamers always get what they desire
Is this the life you've been waiting for?
Are you hoping that you'll be where you want with a little more?

You do everything you can 'cause you're never gonna let it get 'em down
(When you find it all around)
Feelings sleeping in the field again
It dries up
I've been a rabid force and let it flow out from within
Sometimes it feels like I only dream in black and white
(When your best friend's all strung out)
You do everything you can 'cause you're never gonna let it get 'em down
(When you find it all around)
You say it's what you need and hide your eyes when you're close to me

Sometimes you have to wait until it passes by
Like a satellite or star
No matter where you are

Yeah  yeah

I've broken every law
All the words come out my broken jaw
I don't know anything
But then I act like I know everything
Don't wanna talk about it
What do you see when you dream about it?
Well  I have been broke down from my enemies
I'm drifting farther from my memories
And then you take it away
Every day  I'm fighting 'cause I can't leave it
Then I feel the weight and then I come back down
I watch from the sides and try to reach out
Just a little bit closer and then I come back down
Yeah  yeah

Well  I have been broke down from my enemies
Just holding a piece of what's been left of me
And then you take it away
Every day  I'm fighting 'cause I can't leave it
And then I feel the weight and then I come back down
I watch from the sides and try to reach out
Just a little bit closer and then I come back down
Just a little bit higher and then I come back down
I'm climbing on people 'cause I've been blinded
And I'm waiting  I'm waiting around
Sometimes  you find yourself waiting
Waiting for someone to come around
And it's hopeless  hoping to be found
And I  I know why
I know why  I know why

What you find and heal my broken jaw  yeah
Call it what you want  eh  eh  eh
Call it what you want
Yeah  we're locked up in ideas
We like to label everything
Well  I'm just gonna do here what I gotta do here
'Cause I gotta keep myself free
You're ducking and moving just to hide your bruises
From all your enemies
And I'm in the crossfire dodging bullets
From your expectancies  yeah  yeah
Ooh  we got nothing to lose
You better run and hide  yeah  you crossed the line
I got a knife behind my back  just sayin'
Ooh  we got nothing to prove

Round six  I smoked a nebula and leveled up
Just ring the bell  knocked him from the heavens into Hell

Eyes opened up like Christmas
Kicking fits and foaming at the mouth  just like a drunken Orson Welles
(You big sucka  I got you now)
The new Moses parting rooms full of laughter
I rock a black tie like a 1960s massacre
I ain't got no quarrel with them Viet Cong
Yeah  I called the bluff on all you racist mother-what! (And I won)

Float like a butterfly  sting like an army
Got all of my papers out and read them
Seems that I've been wandering for a little too long
Yeah  the desert can be hard if you're wasted
Took a stab in the dark and missed again  I believe
The hardest part is not seeing what I used to see
My faith grew to a top  but worry does all it can
To whisper in both my ears make-believe stories
Where are my friends now?
They're not around when I need them
I cannot pretend
Yeah  I find myself against all the odds again
Well  I like to think I'm strong and then I'm proven wrong
Grab the keys to my car and go to work again
Got some thoughts in my chest  they're playing games with my head
Ten hours of sleep  I'm in my bed again
How am I gonna move on from this circumstance?

And you got those crying eyes
Makes me wanna surrender and wrap you in my arms
You know I try to live without regrets
I'm always moving forward and not looking back
But I tend to leave a trail of dead while I'm moving ahead
And so I'm steppin' away
'Cause I got nothin' to say
Feels like  feels like it's comin'
It feels like  feels like a coming of age (It's like a coming of age)
Feels like  feels like it's comin'
Feels like  feels like a coming of age
And when my fear pulls me out to sea
And the stars are hidden by my pride and my enemies
I seem to hurt the people that care the most
Just like an animal  I protect my pride
When I'm too bruised to fight
And even when I'm wrong  I tend to think I'm right

If you wanna grab a sack  go ahead and do it
My fear of death was set in place by a lie
I glorified youth as the only way of life  yeah
My teeth were shakin'  slowly  surely dissipating
Yeah  the wrinkles on my face  they weren't from my old age
I try to understand you throwin' it away
All your talent down the drain  man  it just makes perfect sense
When I look you in the eyes  it takes me right back
Yeah  your future helps me move on from my dark past
Don't give in
It's not real
You're dead by choice
Choose to feel
Your words insane  man  only if I was left-brained
I could understand all your funny logic
I was indifferent  I saw the first time
Come on back  come on back  come on back to gain your life
Yeah  man  it's hard when that loco keeps on moving
Got some money and some change just to wait for my train
I try to stop me  now I'm locked and engaged
Come on back  come on back  come on back and leave your pain

Yeah  we found you laying in your hotel room
With your arm all tied up 'cause you were actin' a fool
We started shaking you all in your bed
Doing everything we could just hoping that you're not dead
We dragged you out and threw you into our car
Pushed the pedal to the floor  drove to the hospital yard
They brought you in and told us both to wait
I was praying to myself it's not too late
Yeah
(Leave your bed of concrete)
There are consequences for your actions
There are consequences in real life
(Living hand to mouth)
There are consequences  you can't escape from 'em
There are consequences
(Leave your bed of concrete)
Don't hide behind your reasons
Real life is full of feeling
(Living hand to mouth)
Things come and go in seasons
Truth should transcend our feelings
(Leave your bed of concrete)
Don't hide behind your reasons
Real life is full of feeling
(Living hand to mouth)
Things come and go in seasons
 lifting them when they fall
 my heart pumps out old red paint
 save yourself
 save yourself
 I've been waiting for you
 my heart pumps out old red paint
 save yourself
Never found my way out  I was filled with indifference
The animals  they were getting tired
So I sang them a song
'Cause they promised not to take too long
Well  I can't find my way back home
I'll listen to you if you want me to
But you have to share a smoke
Yeah  I've been running against the wind
And I can hear the angels calling
The madness has been pulling me right
Back out of my stride
I feel the change in the rising tide
Blood is in the room
I buried all my wrongs there with my youth
(Don't give up on me now)
I'm on the outside
(Don't give up on me now)
And I'm falling apart
Whoo  yeah

I've been bitten by an enemy that's pretended to be my friend
No  I never wanted to be like them
I thought I was just too clever
To be brought down to their level
Of misfortuned chagrin
I don't care now what it's worth
But if you lift this burden off my back
I'll follow you to the bloody end
I've lived my life the way I want
But no one can tell me they're not afraid
Of the freedom of deliverance
Well  I take it all in stride
I feel the change in the rising tide
And someone's in the room
I buried all my guilt there with my youth
(Don't give up on me now)
I'm on the outside
(Don't give up on me now)
And it's warm on the outside
(Don't give up on me now)
That's a lie
I don't want to fall apart
I clawed and I fought like hell
The darkest days upon you
My blood was turning to sand
The darkest days upon you
The numbness was getting closer
The feverish days upon you
Yeah
Whoo
Whoo
Whoo
We were made for another time
Let's drift away in fits of pleasure
You're a beautiful design
All street and gold dust
Caught up in the flux
Tell me when I've crossed the line
(Say my name and I'll appear)
Trap's caught me tripping out
I've been gone too long
I'll fall into you
When you give in to me
You can be my only when we lose control
I won't hold back
Are you living the truth of chasing the dream?
Just killed the lone wolf

All street and gold dust
I'll fall into you
When you give in to me
You can be my only when we lose control
I won't hold back
Are you living the truth of chasing the dream?
Just killed the lone wolf
Just say that you'll be there
Just say that you'll be there
I'll fall into you
Just give in to me
This'll be my only
I'll fall into you
Just give in to me
Giving up control
This'll be my only
Pulls you down before you know it
It's gone and you're dead again
I've been in places and I won't pretend
That I'd make it out just to fall on my head
Wake up strange and take the walk downstairs
Hit the pawn up on the corner and pay for my rent
You know that I could not believe my own truth
I tie my hands up to a chair so I don't fall that way
I took a sip of something poison  but I'll hold on tight
You know those days when you wanna just choose
To not get out of bed  you're lost in your head again
You play the game  but you kind of cut
'Cause you're coming down hard  your joints are all stuck
I've tried to say that it's not the only way
I never knew if I could face myself to change
You were pacing  I was insecure

Oh  what you want? What you need? What'd you come here for?
Well  an eye for an eye and an 'F' for fight
They're taking me down as the prisoners riot
Eh  yeah
(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
Got shackles on  my words are tied
(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
Fear can make you compromise
(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
With the lights turned up  it's hard to hide
Sometimes I want to disappear
When I feel kinda bad and don't want to stress
I just pass it off on ability

Then they can't get what they want to steal
Can't get what they want to steal
Then they can't get what they want to steal
But I'm just stuck here in this parking lot
These pixelated dreams are blowing up my pocket
I'll find some action  we'll cut the scene
I'm on a merry-go-round  I'm in a washing machine
Just spinning
All of my friends  they don't do any favors
Unless they're partyin'  then they got all of 'em
All of my friends  they blow all of the paycheck
They got no money because they're dumb and reckless
But I love my friends  I love my friends
We got each other  don't need no others
All of my friends  I love my friends
Well  I've been caught up in the action
Eating fire and smoke
It's so breezy 'til we're crashin' and I'm all alone
But let's take it to my house 'cause I know we want more  mmm

We got each other  don't need no others

Well  I believe the hearts that drink from the stars stay satisfied
To live in a safer place veiled in a peaceful paradise
All of my friends  I love my friends

 I won't turn away

Knowing it might be the last time
The spaces in between our breaths
They're singing to the infinite
Sudden changes make the air uncomfortable
I'll hold you so you're not alone
When I'm quiet on the other side
Is keep loving you
I keep laughing to myself
Is keep loving you
The silence is a lonely thing
Waiting for a sound to fall
A lullaby to calm our sleep
The promise of another world

To love you without being afraid
When I'm quiet on the other side
Is keep loving you
I keep laughing to myself
Is keep loving you
Yet again  I'm hustling  hustling  hustling
Yet again  I'm hustling  hustling  hustling
But I can't seem to catch a dime
Take a little hit and I lose the time
I took the man and his horse and ran before he looked up
I said the light's gonna change but I'm calm and feeling warm
Now I'm sticking out my hands
And feeling weightless again
You got to push  got to shove
Got to eat before they eat me
Got the crown and the cup
Got to write to my family
And say  I'm calm and feeling warm
I'm not quite there  but I'm close
And it's a world of a difference
Yet again  I'm hustling  hustling  hustling
Yet again  I'm hustling  hustling  hustling
Yet again  I'm hustling  hustling  hustling
But I can't seem to catch a dime

I've been right  I've been wrong
My smokes have come and gone
I've been crazy  been fed enough to not wind up dead
And I'm lonely  my eyes have been closed to the world
'Cause the world's got nothing for me
Yet again  I'm hustling  hustling  hustling
Yet again  I'm hustling  hustling  hustling
Yet again  I'm hustling  hustling  hustling

You smile with a sparkler drink and stumble in your lipstick mess
But you keep hanging on with a vacant look
Just waiting around for someone to take you home
And I know you know I'm not the one
I'm sorry I was late  I didn't wanna come
(Ah)
(Ooh)
And dance around the room in our scattered point of views
I wish that I could blink and turn all your words
Into ice cubes so I could fill my drink
And I know you know I'm not the one
I'm sorry I was late  next time I just won't come

I'm always runnin' and a-jumpin' like a fool would do
Something  it's excitin'  want to run away
But I don't move  I stay  I talk to her and say
Y-y-y-you were meant for me  oh  I can't speak

Love  love  love
It can be a wonderful thing

On the hunt for the runts that look under twenty-two years
Got her head up high  high heels that match her thighs

Got experience to give  all the life you never lived
But all the boys just run  she never has her fun
'Cause she's hopeful for love

Yeah  you're walking in stilettos but your nose is bleeding out
I've been running from the devil but the devil's on my back
I'm decreasing  took a leave of absence from the war
If the wall is coming down  then we got to press the pedal
Got my hands up in the air  I'm saying I can't breathe
I got my hands up in the air  I'm saying
Hey man  get away from me
Yeah
Hey man  get away from me
Uh
Yeah  oh
Never ask for any favors  there's nothing I want from you
I've been looking for an answer to keep me from fallin' through
And I'm waiting for the voice to speak 'cause I can't see
I hope we'll hear the sound eventually

Growling mouths with rabies and loyal like Sid and Nancy

Tried a million things  but my heart's been shot

And did your best to fight the war and break it off
But if I follow my name
I will calm you in the storm
And breathe you in when you are worn

Would it take a shooting star?
To show you life can bloom when something breaks

I had a reoccurring dream really teasing my mind
A search for a better purpose to be perfectly in line
A serpent is walking  a surface is swerving  it's spewing lies
I swung high off the sky  from a tree to the vine
To land on my feet  devious but dealing with pride
I need a...
I need a breather to catch up on my second wind and speed up
Running from Hell  a speed demon
I've been praying for things money could never buy
Like live and die as a man  a coward dies a thousand times

And when it's raining
We're sailing (At war)

We're sailing
I'm off the leash
I go to war for peace

I'm the opposite of a carper with carpal tunnel
Ain't never took a handout  no tunnel vision to it got my planned route
