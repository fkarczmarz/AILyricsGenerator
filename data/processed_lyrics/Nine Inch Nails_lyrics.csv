lyrics
"Maybe I'll disappear
Tracks will fade in the snow
You won't find me here
Ice is starting to form
Ending what had begun
I am locked in my head
With what I've done
I know you tried to rescue me
Didn't let anyone get in
Left with a trace of all that was
And all that could have been
Please
Take this
And run far away
Far away from me
I am tainted
The two of us
Were never meant to be
All these pieces (Pieces)
And promises
And left-behinds
If only I could see
In my nothing
You meant everything
Everything to me
You might also like
Everything
And all that
Could have been
Please
Take this
And run far away (Far away)
Far as you can see
I am tainted (Tainted)
And happiness
And peace of mind
Were never meant for me
All these pieces (Pieces)
And promises
And left-behinds
If only I could see
In my nothing
You meant everything
And I've got a big gun
Got me a big ol' dick and I
I like to have fun
Held against your forehead
And I'll make you suck it
Maybe I'll put a hole in your head  you know
Just for the fuck of it
Well  I can reduce you if I want
Well  I can devour
I'm hard as fucking steel
I've got the power
I'm every inch a man
And I'll show you somehow
Me and my fucking gun
Nothing can stop me now
(Shoot shoot shoot shoot shoot)
I'm gonna come all over you
(Shoot shoot shoot shoot shoot)
I'm gonna come all over you
(Shoot shoot shoot shoot shoot)
I'm gonna come all over you
(Shoot shoot shoot shoot shoot)
I'm gonna come all over you

He pushed a button and it dropped a bomb
You pushed a button and could watch it on the television
I'm sick of hearing about the haves and the have-nots
Have some personal accountability
The biggest problem with the way that we've been doing things is
Now I'm on my hands and knees
Traded in my God for this one
And he signs his name with a capital G
Don't give a shit about the temperature in Guatemala
Don't really see what all the fuss is about
Ain't gonna worry 'bout no future generations and uh
I'm sure somebody gonna figure it out
Don't try to tell me how some power can corrupt a person
You haven't had enough to know what it's like
You're only angry 'cause you wish you were in my position

You let me desecrate you
You let me penetrate you
You let me complicate you
(Help me) I broke apart my insides
(Help me) I've got no soul to sell
(Help me) The only thing that works for me
Help me get away from myself
I wanna fuck you like an animal
I wanna feel you from the inside
I wanna fuck you like an animal
My whole existence is flawed
You get me closer to God
You can have my isolation
You can have the hate that it brings
You can have my absence of faith
You can have my everything
(Help me) You tear down my reason
(Help me) It's your sex I can smell
(Help me) You make me perfect
Help me become somebody else

I drink the honey
Inside your hive
You are the reason
Everything I say has come before
Assembled into something into something into something
I don't know for certain anymore
I am just a shadow of a shadow of a shadow
Always trying to catch up with myself
I am just an echo of an echo of an echo
Listening to someone's cry for help
Look what you had to start
Why all the change of heart?
You need to play your part
A copy of a copy of a
Now look what you've gone and done
Well that doesn't sound like fun

(Now I'm down in it)
And I was feeling some feelings you wouldn't believe
Sometimes I don't believe them myself
And I decided I was never coming down
But I watched it way too long
It was pulling me down
I was up above it (Oh! O-o)
I was up above it (Oh! O-o) Now I'm down in it
I was up above it (Oh! O-o)
I was up above it (Oh! O-o)
Now I'm down in it
Shut up! So what? What does it matter now?
And everything I never liked about you
Is kind of seeping into me
Try to laugh about it now
But isn't it funny how everything works out?

I used to be so big and strong
I used to know my right from wrong
I used to never be afraid
I used to be somebody!
I used to have something inside
Now just this hole that's open wide
I used to want it all
I used to be somebody
But the needle's already in my eye
And all the world's weight is on my back
And I don't even know why
And what I used to think was me
Is just a fading memory
I looked him right in the eye
And said goodbye
I was up above it (Oh! O-o)

'Cause I repeat the same routine
I think I used to have a purpose
I think I used to have a voice
Now I never make a sound
I just do what I've been told
Every day is exactly the same
Every day is exactly the same
There is no love here and there is no pain
Every day is exactly the same
I can feel their eyes are watching
In case I lose myself again
Sometimes I think I'm happy here (Sometimes)
I can't remember how this got started
Every day is exactly the same
Every day is exactly the same
There is no love here and there is no pain
Every day is exactly the same

Forgot how it feels  well almost
No one to blame  always the same
It took you to make me realize
It took you to make me realize
It took you to make me realize
It took you to make me see the light
Smashed up my sanity
Smashed up integrity
Smashed up what I believed in
Smashed up what's left of me
Smashed up my everything
Smashed up all that was true
Gonna smash myself to pieces
I don't know what else to do
Covered in hope and Vaseline
Still cannot fix this broken machine
Watching the hole  it used to be mine
Just watching it burn in my steady systematic decline
Of the trust I will betray
Give it to me  I throw it away
After everything I've done  I hate myself for what I've become

We are a treacherous people
As night falls down again
In this house of dust
The shades are drawn in

We sleep hypnotized from the center
Yes in this new place we call home
Is there anybody but you sitting in the dark
Wondering if you'll remove my skin
Not so different after all
Remove the pain or push it back in
Maybe not so different after all
That kind of thing just doesn’t happen here
I didn’t think that could happen around here
I didn’t think that could happen to me
Can you see what is happening
I’m not from this world not anymore
Not me and I’ve come to believe that’s OK
I know who I am yes

(Slave screams) He hears but doesn't want to listen
(Slave screams) He's being beat into submission
The devils of truth steal the souls of the free
I have found you can find happiness in slavery
Happiness in slavery
(Slave screams) He spends his life learning conformity
(Slave screams) He claims he has his own identity
(Slave screams) He's going to cause the system to fall
(Slave screams) But he's glad to be chained to that wall
The blind have been blessed with security
I have found you can find happiness in slavery
Happiness in slavery
Happiness in slavery
Happiness in slavery

He tries to tell me what I put inside of me
He's got the answers to ease my curiosity
He dreamed a god up and called it Christianity
He flexed his muscles to keep his flock of sheep in line
He made a virus that would kill off all the swine

Will you die for this?

To see if I still feel
I focus on the pain
The only thing that's real
The needle tears a hole
The old familiar sting
Try to kill it all away
But I remember everything
What have I become?
My sweetest friend
Everyone I know
Goes away in the end
You could have it all
My empire of dirt
I will let you down
I will make you hurt
I wear this crown of shit
Upon my liar's chair
Full of broken thoughts
I cannot repair
Beneath the stains of time
The feelings disappear
You are someone else
I am still right here

 you know how this world can beat you down
 bamboo puncturing this skin
 maybe I could leave this place

Tried to overcome the complications and the catches

Map touné le ciel
Et map touné la mer
Et la mer va embrassé moi
Et délivré moi lakay
An rien peut arrêter moi konin la
Et quand le jour arrivé
Je retournerai au ciel
Et je retournerai à la mer
Et la mer va m'embrasser
Et me délivrer chez moi
Rien ne peut m'arrêter maintenant
And when the day arrives
I'll become the sky
And I'll become the sea
And the sea will come to kiss me
For I am going home
Worn out from giving it up  but my soul I pissed it all away
Still stings these shattered nerves
Pigs we get what pigs deserve
I'm going all the way down  I'm leaving today
Still feel it all slipping away but it doesn't matter anymore
Everybody's still chipping away but it doesn't matter anymore
Look through these blackened eyes
You'll see ten thousand lies
My lips may promise but my heart is a whore

She has the blood of reptile just underneath her skin

Angels bleed from the tainted touch of my caress

I am so impure

New world
New times
Mutation
Feels all right
I tried a bit then I tried some more
I left her on the bathroom floor
I think I knew when it crossed the line
I think I knew the whole goddamned time
Hey look what’s staring back at you
Caught reflecting in your eyes
I’m becoming something new (else)
It’s getting hard to recognize

You give me control
I gave you my purity
My purity you stole
Did you think I wouldn't recognize this compromise?
Am I just too stupid to realize?
It comes down to this
The extent of my sin
You give me the anger
You give me the nerve
Carry out my sentence
While I get what I deserve
Your need for me has been replaced
And if I can't have everything

It comes down to this
The extent of my sin
Echoing your voice just like the ringing in my ears
My favorite dreams of you still wash ashore
Scraping through my head 'til I don't wanna sleep anymore
I just want something
I just want something I can never have
You always were the one to show me how
Back then I couldn't do the things that I can do now
This thing is slowly taking me apart
I just want something
I just want something I can never have

In this place it seems like such a shame
I just want something

Flew too high and burnt the wing
Lost my faith in everything
Lick around divine debris
Taste the wealth of hate in me
This machine is obsolete
Made the choice to go away
Drink the fountain of decay
Fuck the rest and stab it dead
Too fucked up to care anymore
Poisoned to my rotten core
Too fucked up to care anymore
Too fucked up to care anymore
Poisoned to my rotten core
Too fucked up to care anymore
Everything that swore it wouldn't change is different now
Then my head fell apart and where were you?
Everything you swore would never change is different now
My god comes in a wrapper of cellophane
My god pouts on the cover of the magazine
My god's a shallow little bitch trying to make the scene
I have arrived and this time you should believe the hype
I'll be there for you as long as it works for me

What am I supposed to do?
I never dared to look inside
Just like you told me to
I'm going into you again
I know you saw it too
And I will keep myself awake
I know what’s coming
I feel it reaching through
There is no moving past
There is no better place
There is no future point in time
We will not get away
The world is bleeding out
It folds itself in two
Behind the background world
Is always bleeding through

 he had some second thoughts
 he is broken and sore
 he doesn't come around much
 of my circuitry
 my new consciousness
 he used to have feelings
 I'm so far away
 but I've strapped myself in
 but it's all too clear
 hold a little tighter
 it wants me dead
 it wants me dead
 it wants me dead
 it wants me dead
 it wants me dead

But in his voice I heard decay
The plastic face forced to portray
All the insides left cold and gray
There is a place that still remains
The sweetest price he'll have to pay
The day the whole world went away
Na na nah

He put the gun into his face
Bang!
So much blood from such a tiny little hole
A lifetime of fucking things up fixed
In one determined flash
Everything's blue
Everything's blue in this world
The deepest shade of mushroom blue
She matters when everything is meaningless
She tries to get away
Sometimes it's just that nothing seems worth saving
I can't watch her slip away
I won't let you fall apart
I won't let you fall apart
I won't let you fall apart
I won't let you fall apart
She reads the minds of all the people as they pass her by
Hoping someone can see
If I could fix myself I'd—

Is there hope for me
After all is said and done?
Anything at any price
All of this for you
All the spoils of a wasted life
All of this for you
All the world has closed her eyes
For all we could have done
And all that could have been
Ocean pulls me close
And whispers in my ear
The destiny I've chose
All becoming clear
The currents have their say
The time is drawing near
Washes me away
Makes me disappear
And I descend from grace
In arms of undertow
I will take my place
In the great below

Got your chin held high and you feel just fine
'Cause you do what you're told
Just how deep do you believe?
Will you bite the hand that feeds?
Will you chew until it bleeds?
Can you get up off your knees?
Are you brave enough to see?
Do you wanna change it?
What if this whole crusade's a charade
And behind it all there's a price to be paid
For the blood which we dine
Justified in the name of the holy and the divine

I’ve slipped out of time again
Leaving all of you behind
And I’m free
To return to the place where I already am
And have always been
If I just really looked and allowed myself
To see
The confusion is seducing me warm perfect flowing
Wide his eyes
Summer
Hypnotize they see inside of me
Hot swollen skin want me take me perfect embrace
Black and bloody
Rotten and perfect
The center has moved on and all that’s left is free
Finally
Finally
Everyone seems to be asleep but me
Take me
Into the arms of the lovers
Free
Take me
Into the arms of the lovers

Maybe I could stop it (if I wanted to)

Take me
Into the arms of the lovers
Free me
Into the arms of the lovers
Into the arms of the lovers

I am free
And right now I'm so in love with you
And I don't wanna think too much about what we
Should or shouldn't do
Lay my hands on Heaven and the sun and the moon and the stars
While the devil wants to fuck me in the back of his car
Nothing quite like the feel of something new
This is the only time I really feel alive
I swear
I just found everything I need
Are listening to me
My moral standing is lying down
Nothing quite like the feel of something new

Oh
No! No! Woah-oh-oh-oh!

Can't keep control  can't keep track of where it's traveling
I got my heart  but my heart's no good
And you're the only one that's understood
I come along  but I don't know where you're taking me
Turn off the sun  pull the stars from the sky
The more I give to you  the more I die
And I want you
And I want you

All used and beaten up
Watching fate as it flows
Down the path we have chose
You and me
We're in this together now
None of them can stop us now
We will make it through somehow
You and me
If the world should break in two
Until the very end of me

You're the queen and I'm the king
 now I take it apart
 now fall down real far
 I just threw it away
 on my way to hell
 I hate everyone
 but I can't turn back
 but I can't turn back
(I tried to sneak myself through  tried to get to the other side)
I had to patch up the cracks and the holes that I have to hide
For a little bit of time even made it work okay
Just long enough to really make it hurt
When they figured me out and it all just rotted away
Don't you fucking know what you are?
Don't you fucking know what you are?

Go on  get back to where you belong
With every bit of my heart I've tried to believe in it
You can dress it all up  you can try to pretend

But you can't change anything
You can't change anything  in the end
