lyrics
"I just know that I'm harder to console
I don't see who I'm trying to be instead of me
But the key is a question of control
Can you say what you're trying to play anyway?
I just pay while you're breaking all the rules
All the signs that I find have been underlined
Devils thrive on the drive that is fueled
Just give me a pain that I'm used to
I don't need to believe all the dreams you conceive
You just need to achieve something that rings true
There's a hole in your soul like an animal
With no conscience repentance unknown
Devils feed on the seeds that are sown
You might also like
On a note full of hope not despair
Just give me a pain that I'm used to
I don't need to believe all the dreams you conceive
You just need to achieve something that rings true
Just give me a pain that I'm used to
I don't need to believe all the dreams you conceive
Be gentle with me  I'd never willingly do you harm
Apologies are all you seem to get from me
But just like a child  you make me smile when you care for me
And you know
It's a question of lust  it's a question of trust
It's a question of not letting what we've built up crumble to dust
It is all of these things and more
That keep us together
Independence is still important for us though
(We realise)
It's easy to make the stupid mistake of letting go
(Do you know what I mean?)
My weaknesses  you know each and every one
(It frightens me)
But I need to drink more than you seem to think before I'm anyone's
And you know
It's a question of lust  it's a question of trust
It's a question of not letting what we've built up crumble to dust
It is all of these things and more
That keep us together

Kiss me goodbye when I'm on my own
But you know that I'd rather be home
It's a question of lust  it's a question of trust
It's a question of not letting what we've built up crumble to dust
It is all of these things and more
That keep us together
It's a question of lust  it's a question of trust
It's a question of not letting what we've built up crumble to dust
It is all of these things and more
That keep us together
It's a question of lust  it's a question of trust
It's a question of not letting what we've built up crumble to dust
It is all of these things and more
That keep us together
It's a question of lust  it's a question of trust
It's a question of not letting what we've built up crumble to dust
It is all of these things and more
Before they do
It's just a question of time
Before they lay their hands on you
And make you just like the rest
I've got to get to you first
It's just a question of time
And you look good
I'll take you under my wing
Somebody should
They've persuasive ways
And you'll believe what they say
It's just a question of time
And it's running out for you
It won't be long until you'll do
Exactly what they want you to
I can see them now
Hanging around
To mess you up
To strip you down
And have their fun
With my little one

It's just a question of time

Exactly what they want you to
Sometimes I don't blame them
For wanting you
You look good
And they need something to do
Until I look at you
And then I condemn them
I know my kind
What goes on in our minds
It's just a question of time
It's just a question of time
It's just a question of time (It should be better)
It's just a question of time (It should be better with you)
It's just a question of time (It should be better)
It's just a question of time (It should be better with you)
It's just a question of time (It should be better)
It's just a question of time (It should be better with you)
Set upon weary feet
Who looks in need of sleep
That doesn't come?
This bed of sinfulness
Who's longing for some rest
And feeling numb
What do you expect of me?
What is it you want?
Whatever you've planned for me
I'm not the one
A vicious appetite
Visits me each night
And won't be satisfied
Won't be denied
You might also like
An unbearable pain
A beating in my brain
That leaves the mark of Cain
Right here inside
What am I supposed to do
When everything that I've done
Is leading me to conclude
I'm not the one?
Whatever I've done
I've been staring down the barrel of a gun
Whatever I've done
I've been staring down the barrel of a gun
Is there something you need from me?
Are you having your fun?
I never agreed to be
Your holy one
Whatever I've done
I've been staring down the barrel of a gun
I've been staring down the barrel of a gun
 you and I alone?
 you're not on my side
 between you and I
 then we fall down
 before we drown
 standing on the shore
 nothing else no more
 then we fall down
 before we drown
 then we fall down
Do what you want  I don't care
Tonight I'm in the hands of fate
I hand myself over on a plate now
I'd rather not be the one behind the wheel
Come  pull my strings
Sweet little girl  I prefer
You behind the wheel and me the passenger
Drive  I'm yours to keep
Do what you want  I'm going cheap tonight
You're behind the wheel tonight
You're behind the wheel tonight
You're behind the wheel tonight
You're behind the wheel tonight
Black celebration
Tonight
To celebrate the fact
That we've seen the back
Of another black day
Your optimistic eyes seem like paradise
To someone like me
I want to take you in my arms
Forgetting all I couldn't do today
Black celebration

Tonight
To celebrate the fact
That we've seen the back
Of another black day

Slashed her wrists  bored with life
Didn't succeed  thank the Lord
For small mercies
Fighting back the tears  mother reads the note again
Sixteen candles burn in her mind
She takes the blame  it's always the same
She goes down on her knees and prays
I don't want to start any blasphemous rumours
But I think that God's got a sick sense of humour
And when I die  I expect to find him laughing
I don't want to start any blasphemous rumours
But I think that God's got a sick sense of humour
And when I die  I expect to find him laughing
Girl of eighteen  fell in love with everything
Found new life in Jesus Christ
Hit by a car  ended up
On a life support machine

Birds were singing in the summer sky
Then came the rain and once again
A tear fell from her mother's eye
I don't want to start any blasphemous rumours

And when I die  I expect to find him laughing
I don't want to start any blasphemous rumours
But I think that God's got a sick sense of humour
And when I die  I expect to find him laughing
I don't want to start any blasphemous rumours
But I think that God's got a sick sense of humour
And when I die  I expect to find him laughing
I don't want to start any blasphemous rumours

(fade)
 the one that I prefer
 please don't question why
 I can feel so much
 I don't need to touch
 here before my eyes
It's filling me up with new life
The stars in the sky bring tears to my eyes
They're lighting my way tonight
And I haven't felt so alive
In years
Just for a day on a day like today
I'll get away from this constant debauchery
The wind in my hair makes me so aware
How good it is to live tonight
And I haven't felt so alive
In years
The moon is shining in the sky
Reminding me of so many other nights
But they're not like tonight
Oh God  it's raining and I'm not containing
My pleasure at being so wet
Here on my own  all on my own
How good it feels to be alone tonight

When my eyes had been so red

With hope as our faith
We look to the stars
Caroline's monkey is crying again
There's no satisfaction
On Caroline's train
Caroline leaks through holes in her skin
Her promise of sweetness
Forgiveness and everything
Caroline's monkey coos in her ear
Drives like a demon
Through Caroline's tears
Caroline feels the ice in her veins
The minutes and hours
The naming of days
Caroline said her drеam never ends
For Carolinе's monkey
And Caroline's friends
Fading's better than failing
Falling's better than feeling
Folding's better than losing
Fixing's better than healing

Caroline's monkey claws at her back
Colder than winter
Darker than black
Caroline's monkey is hungry again
Running with scissors
On needles and pins
Caroline's monkey lives where she lays
Sleeps like a thief
And steals through the days
Caroline's monkey makes up all the fun
Leaves chaos and ruin
On Caroline's tongue
Caroline knows how fragile we are
With hope as our faith
We look to the stars
Caroline's monkey is crying again
There's no satisfaction
On Caroline's train
Fading's better than failing
Falling's better than feeling
Folding's better than losing
Fixing's better than healing
I've been up all night
I can feel it coming
The morning light
The air is so cold here
It's so hard to breathe
We better take cover
Will you cover me?
Way up here with the Northern lights
Beyond you and me
I dreamt of us in another life
One we've never reached
You know we're sinking
We could fade away
I'm not going down
Not today
The air is so cold here
Too cold to see
We have to take cover
Cover me

I pictured us in another life
Where we're all super stars
I'll be the corpse
You'll be the thriller
If you play the sinner
I'll play the stain
If you play the winner
I'll be your permanent pain
I'll be the boredom
I'll be the catcalls
And you'll be the sound of the choir
I'll be the scream
You'll be the promise
And I'll be the end of your drеams
So don't say you love me
'Cause you'll nеver love me
You'll be the flowers
That some lover sent
I'll be the goodbye
Note that is hiding in them
You are the singer
I am the song
The tune that will linger
The bitter taste left on your tongue

So don't say you love me
How could you love me?
Your flowers and your make-believe
The secrets and the notes you keep
The promises left on the sheets
You'll never love me
Make amends and alibis
In the end you can't disguise
That you'll never love me
You'll be the killer
I'll be the corpse
You'll be the laughter
Come crashing in into my little world
All I ever wanted
All I ever needed is here in my arms
Words are very unnecessary
They can only do harm

Words are meaningless and forgettable

Broken meanings
Time is fleeting
See what it brings
Lost in sleepless lullabies
Heaven's dreaming

Are you counting all the casualties?
We are not there yet
Where we need to be
We are still in debt
To our insanities
We're going backwards
Turning back our history

Piling on the misery
We can track it all with satellites
See it all in plain sight
Watch men die in real time

With senses that have been dulled
Because there's nothing inside
We feel nothing inside

Because there's nothing inside
Like shackles on your feet
Like a halo in reverse
I can feel
The discomfort in your seat
There's a pain
A famine in your heart
An aching to be free
Can't you see?
All love's luxuries
Are here for you and me
And when our worlds they fall apart
When the walls come tumbling in
Though we may deserve it
It will be worth it

Where I'm bound to the ground by the loneliest sound
That pounds from within and is pinning me down
Here is a page from the emptiest stage
A cage or the heaviest cross ever made
A gauge of the deadliest trap ever laid
And I thank you for bringing me here
The heat and the sickliest sweet-smelling sheets
That cling to the backs of my knees and my feet
And I thank you for bringing me here
Feels like home
I should have known
From my first breath

And pretend that I'll make amends the next time
Befriend the glorious end of the line

You take me to and lead me through Babylon
This is the morning of our love
It's just the dawning of our love
I feel you  your heart it sings
I feel you  the joy it brings
Where heaven waits  those golden gates and back again

Take him up to the highest high
Take him up to the top where the mountains stop
Let him tell his book of lies
John the Revelator  he's a smooth operator
It's time we cut him down to size
Take him by the hand and put him on the stand
Let us hear his alibis
By claiming God as his holy right
He's stealing a god from the Israelites
Stealing a god from the Muslim  too
There is only one god through and through
Seven lies  multiplied by seven
Multiplied by seven again
Seven angels with seven trumpets
Send them home on the morning train
Well  who's that shouting? John the Revelator!
All he ever gives us is pain
Well  who's that shouting? John the Revelator!
He should bow his head in shame

Why take the smooth with the rough
When things run smooth?
It's already more than enough
She knows your mind

Do you understand?
Do you know what she means?
As time goes by
And when you've seen what she's seen
You will

Yeah I'm sure of it
I knew right from the start
From the moment we met
You know we have to break up
You'll always be alone
You know you've never ever been a friend
Now we're closer to the edge
There's poison in your mind
Yeah I'm sure of it
You've never been that kind
With all due respect
You know it's time to break up
You'll always be alone
You know you've never ever been a friend
Now we're closer to the end

We've been walking far too long this icy road
My broken heart is colder than a stone
I know you've never ever been a friend
Now you've pushed me to the end
 shouldn't you?
Need special handling
We always tried to share
The tenderest of care
Now look what we have put you through
I thought we'd manage
But words left unspoken left us so brittle
There was so little left to give
Angels with silver wings
Shouldn't know suffering
I wish I could take the pain for you
If God has a master plan
That only He understands
I hope it's your eyes He's seeing through
I thought we'd manage
But words left unspoken left us so brittle
There was so little left to give

I pray you learn to trust
Have faith in both of us
And keep room in your hearts for two

Hey scum  hey scum

And there's nowhere left to run
And you're weeping

Pull the trigger
Hey scum  hey scum
What have you ever done for anyone

Can't you see it's misery and torture for me?
When I'm misunderstood
Try as hard as you can  I've tried as hard as I could
To make you see
How important it is for me
Here is a plea from my heart to you
Nobody knows me as well as you do
You know how hard it is for me to shake the disease
That takes hold of my tongue in situations like these
Understand me  understand me
Understand me  understand me
Some people have to be permanently together
Lovers devoted to each other forever
Now I've got things to do
And I've said before that I know you have too
When I'm not there
In spirit  I'll be there

There's disclosure
I must make
There is so much love in me
I can't run
I have tried
There's a thorn
In my side
There is something
I can't hide
There is so much love in me
You can forsake me
Try to break me
But you can't shake me
No
You can despise me
Demonise me
It satisfies me
So

Share my innermost thoughts  know my intimate details
Someone who'll stand by my side and give me support
And in return  she'll get my support
She will listen to me when I want to speak
About the world we live in and life in general
Though my views may be wrong  they may even be perverted
She'll hear me out and won't easily be converted
But at the end of it all  she will understand me
I want somebody who cares for me passionately
With every thought and with every breath
Someone who'll help me see things in a different light
All the things I detest I will almost like
I don't want to be tied to anyone's strings
I'm carefully trying to steer clear of those things
But when I'm asleep I want somebody
Who will put their arms around me and kiss me tenderly
Though things like this make me sick
Leaving my problems
And the world's disasters
I'm heading for the open sky
I see the beauty
As the leaves start falling
Follow the light
Towards the voices calling
I'm going where the angels fly
And I'm taking my soul with me
And I'm taking my soul with me
I'm ready for the final pages
Kiss goodbye to all my earthly cages
I'm climbing up the golden stairs
Go sing it from the highest tower
From the morning
Till the midnight hour
I'm going where there are no cares

I heard you call my name
Lying  on the bathroom floor
No one here to blame
There's a message I know can be found
Speak to me  in a language
That I can understand
Tell me  that you're listening
Give me some kind of plan
Give me something  you'd be my drug of choice
I will disappoint you
I will let you down
I need to know
You're here with me
Turn it all around
I'd be grateful  I'd follow you around
Will seem almost unforgivable
I give in to sin
Because you have to make this life livable
But when you think I've had enough from your sea of love
I'll take more than another riverful
I'll make your heart smile
Will you take the pain I will give to you
Again and again and will you return it?
There'll be days when I'll stray
I may appear to be constantly out of reach
I give in to sin
Because I like to practice what I preach
I'm not trying to say I'll have it all my way
I'm always willing to learn when you've got something to teach
I'll make your heart smile

We'll lay on the grass and let the hours pass
Let's get away just for one day
Let me see you stripped down to the bone
Let me see you stripped down to the bone
Metropolis has nothing on this
Where everything's ours for a few hours
Let me see you stripped down to the bone
Let me see you stripped down to the bone
Let me hear you make decisions without your television
Let me hear you speaking just for me

To call my own
The slightest correction
Couldn't finely hone
The sweetest infection
Of body and mind
Sweetest injection
Of any kind
I stop and I stare too much
Afraid that I care too much
And I hardly dare to touch
For fear that the spell may be broken
When I need a drug in me
And it brings out the thug in me
Feel something tugging me
The sweetest perfection
To call my own
The slightest correction
Couldn't finely hone
The sweetest infection

An assorted collection
But I wouldn't trade

You will have to join us
Everyone's going to be there
We're setting up the truss
Once there were solutions
Now we have no excuses
They got lost in confusion
So we're preparing the nooses
And oh we had so much time
How could we commit the worst crime?
Blame misinformation
Misguided leaders
Apathetic hesitation
Uneducated readers
For whatever reason
We now find ourselves in this
We are all charged with treason
There is no one left to hiss
And oh we had so much time
How could we commit the worst crime?

How could we commit the worst crime?
And oh we had so much time
It's beginning to hurt
Time you made up your mind
Just what is it all worth?
All my useless advice
All my hanging around
All your cutting down to size
All my bringing you down
Watch the clock on the wall
Feel the slowing of time
Hear a voice in the hall
Echoing in my mind
All your stupid ideals
You've got your head in the clouds
You should see how it feels
With your feet on the ground
You might also like
Here I stand the accused
With your fist in my face
Feeling tired and bruised
With the bitterest taste
All my useless advice
All my hanging around
All your cutting down to size
All my bringing you down
All your stupid ideals
You've got your head in the clouds
You should see how it feels
With your words or wagging tongue
With your long tall tales of sorrow
Your song yet to be sung
I won't be offended
If I'm left across the great divide
Just to watch another angel die
Watch another angel die
You won't do well to darken me
With your secrets and your lies
With your piercing code of silence
I'll meet you by the river
Or maybе on the other side
You'll find it hard to swallow
Whеn you watch another angel die
Watch another angel die

I know that it will save us all
When everything's dark
Keeps us from the stark reality
I'm waiting for the night to fall
When everything is bearable
And there in the still
All that you feel is tranquillity
There is a star in the sky
Guiding my way with its light
And in the glow of the moon
Know my deliverance will come soon
I'm waiting for the night to fall
I know that it will save us all
When everything's dark
Keeps us from the stark reality

There is a sound in the calm

I press my hands to my ears
It's easier here just to forget fear
And when I squinted
The world seemed rose-tinted
And angels appeared to descend
To my surprise
With half-closed eyes
Things looked even better than when they were opened
Been waiting for the night to fall
I knew that it will save us all
Now everything's dark
Keeps us from the stark reality
Been waiting for the night to fall
Now everything is bearable
And here in the still
The pain I've been subjected to
But the Lord himself would blush
The countless feasts laid at my feet
Forbidden fruits for me to eat
But I think your pulse would start to rush
Now I'm not looking for absolution
Forgiveness for the things I do
But before you come to any conclusions
Try walking in my shoes
Try walking in my shoes
You'll stumble in my footsteps
Keep the same appointments I kept
If you try walking in my shoes
If you try walking in my shoes
Morality would frown upon
Decency look down upon
The scapegoat fate's made of me
My intentions couldn't have been purer
My case is easy to see

You've been lied to
You've been fed truths
Who's making your decisions?
You or your religion
You patriotic junkies
Where's the revolution?
You're letting me down
Where's the revolution?
You're letting me down

Your views refused
They manipulate and threaten
With terror as a weapon

Wear you down until you're on their side
