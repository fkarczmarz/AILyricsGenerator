Why you always trippin' bitch? You must look up to Ella (Ella)
It's only the first night and she keep tryna snuggle (Snuggle)
I slept on my back just so I ain't have to cuddle (Cuddle)
Nothing 'bout me average  hit her with a Fendi rubber (Straight up)
Feel like a magician  all these bitches that I juggle (Straight up)

 when I'm gone  carve my name in the cement
 they play games with the semen
 I face them
 I jump out and chase them
 nigga  I'll never Mace them
 nigga  I'll never Mase them
