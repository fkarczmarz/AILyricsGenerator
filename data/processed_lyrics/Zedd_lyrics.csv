lyrics
"Love has taken us as far as we can reach
But I can't leave
We are  we are imagined ecstasy
Holding on to what we used to be
Addicted to a memory
Holding on to what we used to be
Addicted to a memory
A memory
We are  we are in love enemies
We are sentimental slaves on broken knees
We're on empty
We were  we were one identity
Now the trouble is remembering
We're beautiful now (Together)
We're beautiful now (Together)
We're beautiful now (Together)
We're beautiful now (Together)
We're beautiful now (Together)
We're beautiful now (Together)
We're beautiful now (Together)
We're beautiful
We're beautiful
Let's live tonight like fireflies
And one by one light up the sky
We disappear and pass the crown
We're beautiful now
We're beautiful now
We're beautiful now
We're beautiful now
We're beautiful now
We're beautiful now
We're beautiful now
We're beautiful now

Fight fear for the selfish pain
It was worth it every time
Hold still right before we crash
'Cause we both know how this ends
Our clock ticks till it breaks your glass
And I drown in you again
'Cause you are the piece of me
I wish I didn't need
Chasing relentlessly
Still fight and I don't know why
If our love is tragedy
Why are you my remedy?
If our love's insanity
Why are you my clarity?

 Daisy  you got me
 always walking down the wrong streets
 Daisy  you got me
 I won't give your heart away
 running when you got it right here?
 I would love you if you let me
 always dancing to the same beat
 Daisy  you got me
 don't you know that you're amazing?
 Daisy
 I won't give your heart away
 running when you got it right here?
 I would love you if you let me
 I won't give your heart away
 running when you got it right here?
 I would love you if you let me
Are you done with love so they can't hurt you tomorrow?
You don't wanna keep on swimming in the ocean you've cried
But I won't let you drown  I'll pull you back to the shallow
'Cause all I ever really wanted
In this short life was you
Tell me who took your heart away
And do you know it breaks mine when I hear you say
That you're done with love?
Oh  you were done with love
Give me one night to mend the pain
Because the second we touch  you'll forget the day
You were done with love
Oh  you were done with love
If you're done with love...
Give me one night to mend the pain
Because the second we touch  you'll forget the day

Into echoes you can feel
And rehearse the way you heal

I'll build a city that dreams for two

We're fireworks with a wet fuse
Flying planes with paper wheels
To the same achilles heels

The target's tattooed between our eyes
Stand and fight
Under the lights on the high stage

With Once upon a time like all those lullabies
You were my shining knight from all those stories

Show me a place I can realize love  not your illusion

You were my shining knight from all those stories
This love is your illusion  this love is your illusion
Take me to a place with real-life love
I need a break from this broken-down fantasy
I had nothing but pieces of thoughts of the hope
That you would see me
I was a stone's throw away from land
But thousands and thousands of miles away
From reaching your hand
The waves that crashed upon
The rocks that you were trying to walk along
And in my head I heard them play a song for you and me

Where they will never find us
Got stars at night to guide us

As I turned up the collar on my favorite winter coat
This wind is blowin' my mind
And a one man's soul
'Cause they got nowhere to go
That's why I want you to know
I'm starting with the man in the mirror
I'm asking him to change his ways
And no message could have been any clearer
If you wanna make the world a better place
Take a look at yourself and then make a change
I've been a victim of a selfish kinda love
It's time that I realize
Could it be really me pretending that they're not alone
And a washed out dream
'Cause they got no place to be

It was dark and I was over
Until you kissed my lips and you saved me
But my knees were far too weak
To stand in your arms
Without falling to your feet
But I set fire to the rain
Watched it pour as I touched your face
Let it burn while I cry
When laying with you
But I set fire to the rain
Watched it pour as I touched your face
Let it burn while I cried
I set fire to the rain
And I threw us into the flames
That was the last time
Sometimes I wake up by the door
As if that heart you caught is still waiting for you
Even now when it's already over
I can't help myself from looking for you
I set fire to the rain
Watched it pour as I touched your face
Let it burn while I cried
Fire to the rain
And I threw us into the flames
Where I felt something die
Let it burn
Shave
Shave it up
Shit!
Don't slam the fucking door
Shit!
That includes me
Don't anybody yelling?
We get anybody yelling around here anymore today and then the shit is going to hit the fan
Why are... I just... lose stuff! Why can't I remember it?
Don't slam the fucking door
Don't slam the fucking door

Every time the stars come
So hold your tongue and hear me out
I know that we were made to break
So what? I don't mind
Don't dull the sparkle in your eyes
I know that we were made to break
So what? I don't mind
Are you gonna stay the night?
Are you gonna stay the night?
Why're you gonna stay the night?
Are you gonna stay the night?
Doesn't mean we're bound for life
So-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Are you gonna stay the night?
Come pour yourself all over me
We'll let this place go down in flames
Only one more time

 it just sounded the same in my mind

Higher than I see  is there something there for me?
Pulling back the reins  letting go again
I'm not afraid  I'm not
All my life  one page at a time
I'll show you my  my true colors
No no no  I won't apologize for the fire in my eyes
Let me show you my  my true colors
It ain't no rainbow
A promise with a lie is broken by design
What I thought I knew
Has been swallowed by the truth
It's time to light the flame
Right before it rains
I'm not afraid  I'm not
All my life  one page at a time
I'll show you my  my true colors
No no no  I won't apologize for the fire in my eyes

Something tells me I know nothing at all
We've escaped our capture
Yet we have our masters
And somehow it's like I've waited

I'll show you my  my true colors

Get Low
Chained to a love
But that don't mean much
I don't care if we get too loud
Bet I could take you there
Whispering in your ear
What do you wanna feel?
Let's just enjoy the thrill
I'll take over the wheel
And give you the touch you're missing

Stay
Waiting for the time to pass you by
Hope the winds of change will change your mind
I could give a thousand reasons why
We can stay forever young
Underneath the rising sun
I could give a thousand reasons why
All you have to do is stay a minute
Just take your time
All you have to do is wait a second
Your hands on mine
All you have to do is
All you have to do is stay
Stay
Find You
Silent love is calling faith
To shatter me through your hallways
Into echoes you can feel
And rehearse the way you heal
Cause you make me move
(I'll run away with your footsteps
I'll build a city that dreams for two
(I will find you)
Cause you make me move
Spectrum
Breathing you in when I want you out
Finding our truth in a hope of doubt
Lying inside our quiet drama
We'll run where lights won't chase us
Hide where love can save us
I will never let you go
We'll run where lights won't chase us
Hide where love can save us
I will never let you go
We'll run
We'll run where lights won't chase us
Hide where love can save us
I will never let you go
I Want You to Know
I want you to know that it's our time
You and me bleed the same light
I want you to know that I'm all yours
You and me run the same course
Stay the Night
I know that we are up-side-down
So hold your tongue and hear me out
I know
That we were made to break
So what? I don't mind
Don't dull the sparkle in your eyes
I know that we were made to break
So what? I don't mind
Are you gonna stay the night?
Are you gonna stay the night?
Why're you gonna stay the night?

Clarity
Hot dive into frozen waves where the past comes back to life
Hold still right before we crash cause we both know how this ends
Our clock ticks 'til it breaks your glass and I drown in you again
Cause you are the piece of me I wish I didn't need
Why are you my remedy?
Why are you my clarity?
Beautiful now
We're beautiful now
We're beautiful now
We're beautiful
We're beautiful

Addicted to a Memory
Love has taken us as far as we can reach
But I can't leave
Holding on to what we used to be
Addicted to a memory
Holding on to what we used to be
Addicted to a memory"
