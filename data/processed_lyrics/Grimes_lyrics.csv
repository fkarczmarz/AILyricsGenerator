lyrics
"I'll defeat you by the moonlight
Witness your own tragedy
I look like a flower  but I'm a serpent underneath
A hundred percent tragedy
A hundred percent tragedy
Fallen angel  fallen angel
No forgiveness for betrayal
I could have you on your knees
I look like a flower  but I'm a serpent underneath
We dance now  insane like
The fire in my mind
I fight you 'til daylight
I'll haunt you 'cause you're mine
A hundred percent tragedy
A hundred percent tragedy

You and me
My love  forever
My tragedy  my love
A hundred percent tragedy

I wrote your constellation
Into the sky
S-s-s-s-s-sa
Suns at night
I'm out late at 4 AM
I never doubt it at 4 AM
I'm out late at 4 AM
I never doubt it at 4 AM
Falling down again
Unraveling

Nothing I'd rather do
Think I love you  but I know that I will never do
Everything I love becomes everything I do
You're my darling girl  tell me what's on your mind
Tell me anything  anything you feel like
Anything you feel like
Je comprends
Je l'ai dit
C'est la vie
Oh Montréal  pull apart (I don't mind)
Running every red light  you were right
Oh Montréal  don’t break my heart
I think I love you

Angel baby  you got me feeling kinda blue
Think I need you and you know the things that I would do
Everything I love is consolation after you

Ooh  what peace of mind
What a night  what a sight

I close my eyes until I see
I don't need hands to touch me

I can make it feel so wet
I'm a little bit in love with you
I can take your picture  baby
This is the sound of the end of the world
Dance me to the end of the night  be my girl
Truth and the lack thereof
There are many ways in
But there's only one way out
There's only one way out
There's so many ways in
But there's only one way out

I  I could leave the world today
Everybody dies  we anoint their eyes and we dance like angels do
Writing out your name  little shapes that feign some knowledge of you
And you'll never get sad and you'll never get sick
And you'll never get weak
We're deep
In the belly of the beat  yeah!
I  I could leave the world today
Everybody dies  we cut out their eyes and we dance like angels do
Making our name in a world that feigns some knowledge of you
And you'll never get sad and you'll never get sick
And you'll never get weak
We're deep
Get it wrong  get loud
Write a song  get down
And everyone will know
And everyone will know
And everyone can go
Take his shit  maybe not
Listen good  he's gone
Everything you know
And everyone should go
Oh-oh-oh-oh
I don't need to know
So  do you want to?
Am I just right? (Is it just right?)
Can you see the enemy just isn't me tonight?
Oh  it is perfect
You could be anything out there
Butterflies flying in the air
Higher than an aeroplane
Don't know this song
Sweeter than a sugar cane
Why you looking for a harmony?
There is harmony in everything
It’s a butterfly whose wings span the world

So fly away
If you're looking for a dream girl
I'll never be your dream girl
Living in the real world

Don't know this song
Sweeter than a sugar cane
Why you looking for a harmony?
There is harmony in everything
It’s a butterfly whose wings span the world
So fly away
If you're looking for a dream girl
It sounds just like my soul
But I'm not ready to win
Oh Lord  cause I don't wanna know what they say
'Cause I get carried away
Commodifying all the pain
The things they see in me  I cannot see myself
When you get bored of me  I'll be back on the shelf
And when the ocean rises up above the ground
Maybe I'll drown in–
Ca-ah-ah-ah  California
You only like me when you think I'm looking sad
Ca-ah-ah-ah  California
I didn't think you'd end up treating me so bad
Oh (Ah-ah-ah)

Broken my own heart again
Chasing something beautiful

There's something glowing and my blood is bubbling
Lately  I just turn 'em into demons
Flew into the sun  fucking heroin
Lately  I just turn 'em into reasons and excuses
Always down when I'm not up  guess it's just my rotten luck
To fill my time with permanent blue
But I can't see above it  guess I fucking love it
I see everything  I see everything
Don't you tell me now that I don't want it
But I did everything  I did everything
More lines on the mirror than a sonnet (Woo)
Funny how they think us naive when we're on the brink
Innocence was fleeting like a season
Cannot comprehend  lost so many men
Lately  all their ghosts turn into reasons and excuses
Always down when I'm not up  guess it's just my rotten luck
To fill my time with permanent blue
But I can't see above it  guess I fucking love it

I sleep in the day and dance in the night
I sleep in the day and dance in the night
I sleep in the day and dance in the night
It's my point of view
'Cause someone could break your neck
Coming up behind you
Always coming and you'd never have a clue
I never look behind all the time
I will wait forever
Always looking straight
See you on a dark night (La-la-la-la-la)
See you on a dark night
See you on a dark night (La-la-la-la-la)
See you on a dark night
I would ask if you could help me out
It's hard to understand
'Cause when you're running by yourself
It's hard to find someone to hold your hand
You know it's good to be tough like me
But I would wait forever
I need someone else
To look into my eyes and tell me

Blood on your knees
But did that ever make you happy?
I think you were my best friend
Gentle do not reprehend
I know it hasn't been a dream
Drunk in a parking lot
Just after three
Tearin' out your hair like a banshee
Lighter and a safety pin
I'll stick to you forever
Cause this scar I think is permanent
Oh
Falling off the edge with you
Oh
It was too good to be true
Too good to be true
Bite off your fingernails
Cut up your skin
Tell me that it didn't happen

Fallen couldn't see straight
I was only looking for a human to reciprocate
Baby it's a black hole
I need it to breathe
But does it really make you happy?
Kiss me with a big knife
Bloody heart of paradise
Living like a soldier
Peace of mind must be nice
Oh falling off the edge with you
Oh it was too good to be true
Too good to be true
Thought I had won
I thought I won til I lost
But for what cost?
And I see your reflection when I look at mine
Falling off the edge with you
It was too good to be true
Falling off the edge with you
It was too good to be true
Would you still love me
Out on Europa
Baby
How can I compare
To the adventure out there?
Sail away
To the cold expanse of space
Even love
Couldn't keep you in your place
But can't you love me
Like that?
Can't you need me

Your first love the way you were mine
Wish you didn't remember this feeling
But knew it the way I know it (Yeah)
Wish you were impaled
And injured with love the way I am
You would cry when you saw my tears
The way I cry when I see yours
You can control me
And I'll kill them if they try to hurt you
Got my hands dirty now

When we were young  we used to get so close to it
And you were scared and you were beautiful
I wanna peer over the edge and see in death

Oh  I fear that no life will ever be like this again
There were moments when it seemed okay
(But I go back alone)

Rosa wakes up in my bed
We are separate

I’m no longer happy in there

藏在肺裡的尖叫  藏在骨頭和肌肉裡的
沒有爆破前  毋庸置疑的 都會揪緊成病
曾經 乾燥的 都被潑濕  膨脹後彈牙 多肉 黏膩多汁
一個女人徒手拔掉滿頭黑髮 在夢境的山稜線行走
思念聚集成蚊蟲
張開沒有焦點的瞳孔 就像- 快 張開沒有欲望的大腿
我咬下去 你還是無動於衷嗎? 明明可以叫出來的呀
沿著你的脊椎走 我的手指 戳出一個冰涼的湖
四處張望 無人看守  暴露狂脫掉風衣 淚流滿面地 跳進去
Aah! (Ha-ha  ha-ha)
Aah! (Ha-ha  ha-ha)
計劃把你高潮的尖叫聲錄起 來  卻發現剛剛按錯了鍵
一去不復返  無能重複那時刻 你躺著 和逐漸冰冷的液體 撕扯著
黏膩 透明 在我的手心開出具有彈性的花
我覺得不夠 想從你身體裡擠出更多 就在這個時候電話響起
