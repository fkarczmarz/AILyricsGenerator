" check
 two
 uh
 we have time but you'll find
 yo)
 thought I took your soul
 engraved my name
 uh
Out of papers I am  not okay
I am out my mind
Outer space  that’s where I been goin'
To a place where  place where nobody knows
Floating at a pace where now you see me now and now you don’t
I do not feel the fear of fallin  I wanna fly
If it all goes well then I will
But what if I don’t?
Ill be right where I was before
But I’m not alone  you say take my hand
And we go (and we go)  and we go (and we go)
And I hope that we don’t overdose
Cause we don’t (cause we don’t)
No we don’t (no we don't)
Ever know when we have had enough
Wait...
Now my thoughts so cloudy and my hearts so crowded with hate
I am so frustrated like my souls been taken away
Broken promise of everything that I thought you were
Thought you said this would never hurt  that’s what it did that is all
You might also like
I do not feel the fear of falling
Thought I could fly
It didn’t go well but oh well
What do you know
I’m right back where I was before
But I’m not alone  you say take my hand
And we go (and we go)  and we go (and we go)
And I hope that we don’t overdose
Cause we don’t (cause we don’t)
No we don’t (no we don't)
Ever know when we have had enough
I'm a be so cold  need some more
I’ve never felt these things before
I’m a feind for sure  please don't go
How could you not need me no more?
You're the only thing that I love
You’re the only thing that I want
You’re the only reason  the only reason
I do not feel the fear of fallin'  I wanna fly
If it all goes well  then I will
But what if I don’t?
Ill be right where I was before
But I’m not alone
You had a bitch in your passenger side  I called your phone and then you just denied me
Really surprising
That wasn't like you  I thought you liked me
But now I just don't know
Where did all your feelings go?
I thought we were takin' it slowly
I thought you were waitin' on me  yeah
Just like that  you turn your back
I do everything you ask of me (Yeah)
Just like that  I take you back
And I still fuck with you so passionately
Don't act like you don't know
I don't show whenever you call (Ooh  oh)  yeah
Don't act like you don't know (No  no)
I don't go above and beyond for you
Won't hesitate to put my pride aside  admit that I lied
Know you don't like that  at least I tried to put up a fight
I thought you would fight for me  really surprising me
This isn't like you  I thought you liked me

And I still fuck with you so passionately
Don't act like you don't know (Like you don't)

And then you'd give me my space
Yeah
What I am trying to say is
That love is ours to make so we should make it
Everything else can wait
The time is ours to take so we should take it
Gotta heat the vape up

Gotta call your job tell em' you won't make it
Ain't nobody here baby lets get wasted

Cause I be working hard and I know you be on that same shit
Every other day's a different game that you just can't win

The time is ours to take so we should take it
It's not love  but it's pretty close
Hot fudge and a little smoke
I didn't mean it means nothing to you
Hands locked on my black couch with nothing to do
Can't stop on cloud 20
Buried in the drugs  but the feels keeps coming
Finally stop crying  but your nose is still running
You tell me that you wanna do it big
I love it when you say guess what? (What? What?)
Reading stories to some other nigga kid
And I wonder why I'm all messed up (up up up up)
Cause we gotta be responsible sometimes
Being a class act nevermind my alumni
I don't wanna be around a baby so dumb high
That I don't see the beauty of a momma on insides
Curled up with my head on your chest
It's the best remedy for the pain and the stress
If the world doesn't change then we'll never get dressed
It will be like this to the kiss of the death
No joke  who laughs?
Just us (Just us  just us)
Okay  got this OJ and Jose
Mixed it up with that Rose
We gon' do this our own way
Alright  okay
What is it that you're smoking?
Piece it up with this peace and love
And this peace and love like the old days
What I am trying to say is
(What I am trying to say is)
That love is ours to make so we should make it

Everything else can wait

We should stay right here
We should lay right here
Cause everything is okay right here
You should stay right here
We should lay right here

Switch up the flow-oh-oh

They be the main ones be acting like bitches and hoes
Off the top of the dome
Better than any bitch that came before me

Say they love you  when you know they don’t

Okay  fuck it
It was Dominik  David  Braden
All of them did the same to you
Marquis and Sean and Brian
All of them had they way with you
Ever so often you get lost and miss out on everything
Shout-out to Krissy
That’s my bitch ’cause she tells me everything
And I was not the only one
I was not the only one to you…
So I was the only lonely one…
Really  we had the perfect end…
That night we shared at the Comfort Inn…
We made love like the world would have ended…
If either of us had admitted..
We were in love…
So I was the only one…

And I should’ve never fucked you on a boat on your birthday
And I never would’ve came into your house in the first place
If I would’ve known that you would hurt me like in the worst way
‘Cause that night turned into every weekend and
Every weekend turned to every evening
You took me out and left me in the deep end then
Quis found out and then I had to leave him
‘Cus I couldn’t be the one to hurt him
Plus I thought you were the one so it was worth it
But really we should’ve just ended it
That day I was at your crib when...
Your baby mama just burst in damn
I was weak then and you knew it
I was so weak then and you proved it
‘Cus my brother was dying
And you gave me a shoulder to cry on
Then why’d you...
Then why’d you call it love?
Oh oh
And I was not only one who was hurting
And you were not the only one with the burdens
Why would you call this love when you knew that it wasn’t?
Why would you call it love when you knew that it wasn’t?
If this was not love then please tell me what was it
If this was not love then please tell me what was it
‘Cause when I met you at my favorite store
He always told me slow up
But I never really gave a fuck
We haven't spoke in three years
I wish that he could be here
I'm tryna fight through these tears
But I'mma call him anyway and tell him
Chorus:
I know you still think about the times we had
I said fuck this shit that I was on before
Like then I didn't know but now I'm for sure
I'm just sayin' I'll do whatever
Tell me have I said that ever?
Without you here I cannot do better
Without you here I cannot do better (Ohhh)
And I just been sittin here going crazy
Been thinking about the baby that we almost had
Thought I moved on but I didn't
Shit it's all been bad
Remember Marvin when he threw a party
We went to his room and shit got retarted
Hate that I used no protection I'm sorry
I think that something was slipped in my drink
I know you're thinking how dumb can I be
That night was my first time trying cocaine
I've been caught up living in the fast lane
It's been two months and I'm scared cause I'm late
Emotions are mixed up
I am just a crazy girl
I'm lucky that you picked up
Lucky that you stayed on
I need someone to be my savior
Could it be you?
It only gets better with you
And I am only better with you
It's true
Whatever I gotta prove
I'll do it
Way too much and way too often
 but I am not scared with you
 I am only real with you
 but tonight I am yours
 mess
 yes
 oh yeah yea yea
 do you have anything stronger
 oh yeah yea yea
 oh yeah
 I've lived well
 the more that I know
 I can only recall
 good things

 Ladera Heights

So hard for me to understand when doctors they cannot cure this
I hope that you can hear this!
I just want you to hear this! Don't give up on us!
And when I was two you were four
And now I'm just sitting here reminiscing
I just want you to hear this! Don't give up on us!
'Til forever ends and that's never
And I won't stop loving you ever
Do you understand?
'Til forever ends and that's never
Please just hear this!

If anyone should try and find me
Just know I'm where I wanna be
I left the house all clean and tidy
Don't come searchin'  please
I've made my way down to the forest
Way down to the sea of trees (the sea of trees)
The ego grows  it gets enormous
And then it has to bleed
All the way out  all the way out
On my way out  I found a way out
Up in a tree  up in a tree
Could you believe it?
Wouldn't you believe  hell is not a place
Hell is not a certain evil  hell is other people
Or the lack thereof  and their lack of love
And their lack of love
I tried  but my feet kept touchin' the ground (touch the ground)
If I died  would it even make a sound in the sea of trees? (sea of trees)
No need to bother lookin' for me
(Don't come  don't come  don't come searchin' for me)
You don't get to die until you get it right  you said
I envy the dead  yeah
I'm way out  I'm way out
I'm way down in the sea of trees  I'm way out
What is that I see? Starin' back at me
Okay now  I'm okay now
Alive  alive
Made it out alive  made it out alive
Surprise  surprise  surprise  surprise
I'm out alive
Made it out alive  made it out alive

Are you okay?
And your guards fall down from a rifle to the heart
And most women are motivated so I act accordingly
But this is so refreshing that it means a little more to me
Dedicating time when I really can’t afford to be
I provide protection if you open up the door for me
Couple I think that we’re readys
Couple I think that we should waits
Are we actin' like a couple? I’m just tryna get it straight
Cause I’m over here convinced that it’s too early for mistakes
And then
Now there’s only cloudy days
Can’t stand the rain in July
But now it’s getting colder
Leaves are turning color
The one and only reason
Our summer turned into fall

I followed the rules and told you everything you had to know
I’m confused tell me where we go wrong
I was sure that I would be with you for so long
I was planning on this on being something worth mentioning
Energy invested in someone I saw potential in
Who killed chivalry? They need to get their sentencin'
Meanwhile we arguing and I can’t get a sentence in
And just as I predicted here we go again
They always say the hottest love has the coldest end
Now there’s only cloudy days
Can’t stand the rain in July
But now it’s getting colder
Leaves are turning color
The one and only reason
Our summer turned into fall
See it's funny cause I never thought this would end
But then the season changed
Oh yeah
And I will turn into a butterfly
I will spread my wings and fly
And I’m too fly for this shit
Oh-a wooh
You must have just read my mind
If we skipped the small talk
Want you now
But  I don't have to stay til mornin'
I don't have to  I don't have to pack no clothes
I am really not that lonely
We finished  we finished and I will go
It's whatever you want
I wanna please you most
Whatever  whatever turns you on  oh
Just let me know
You are so creative
The way that you're makin'
Love to me  you do me
Like no one's ever done it
That is why I want it all the time
I don't want your heart

Go around breaking hearts just to see what is inside
Go around stealing them  feeding them to your pride
Did you ever stop and think that I might really need that
To stay alive?
I'm starting to believe that you don't really see that
I had given you my life  oh yeah

Your two lips should come in a vase  you rode my face
I realize you look as good as you taste  hmm (Yeah)

We find ourselves sexting 'til that connection is restored
Then I wish you good luck on the seats thats inside this Porsche
Look at what you've done to me
You put a gun to me
Then you brought the sun to me
Shine like blood diamonds
Learning to have patience only cause you are timeless
The universe energy doesn't lie
And this chemistry is infinity at a million times
I wrote a million rhymes describing your star power

Please don't rain on my parade
The fallin' from the sky just remind of the days
When you was cryin' for attention
I ignored it as a phase
Until you couldn't take the tension
Now I wish you would have stayed
Walkin' through the smoke and mirrors
Burdened  you burning bridges
Memories fading faded it help you not to remember
The trials and tribulations  eyes red from cryin'
The perfect way to disguise it you was blinded by our fate
Please don't rain on my parade 'cause this float was built for you
Kinda hard to chase you down when you floatin' through the room
All you wanted was the truth and all I wanted was my way
Regardless how I word the phrase all you hear me say is...

I know that I always get big mad
I cannot believe I did that
Nobody gets me so fired up
Nobody gets me so fired up
I tried little 'till I thought I died inside
'Cause when I get mad I get big mad
'Bout to feel the wrath of a menace
You need to stay out my way
You need to stay out of my way (Mm)
You need to stay out of my way (Yeah)
An angel walked up to my door
Opened the windows to my soul
Told me he thinks that I should know
There's no slowing down
As the globe spins 'round and 'round
You gotta keep going
If there's one thing that I learned
While in those county lines
It's that everything takes time
You have gotta lose your pride
You have gotta lose your mind
Just to find your peace of mind
You have got to trust the signs
Everything will turn out fine
So why aren't you smiling? Why aren't you smiling?
Life can get wild when you're caught in the whirlwind
Lost in the world when you're chasing the win
You gotta understand

At forty-four minutes to four
An angel walked up to my door
Opened the windows to my soul
Told me he thinks that I should know
That's why I keep going
Gotta keep going
I gotta show them that I can keep going
I gotta keep going
Why aren't you smiling? Why aren't you smiling?
Life can get wild when you're caught in the whirlwind
Lost in the world when you're chasing the win
You gotta understand
Cause nothing really is and everything really isn't
 I know
 don’t do it
 don’t do it
You're fine  but besides that
I see through to your heart
You lie  I don't mind it
That's just the kind of guy that you are
It's the sweet little nothings  that's all I need to keep me here
If you want me like you say you want me
Then you'll do whatever  yeah
Love me like you say you love me
We'll be down forever
Don't lose me  don't lose me
Don't choose me then use me
Just stay right beside me  oh
Don't you dare deny my love
It's those sweet little nothings  that's all I need to keep me here
If you want me like you say you want me
Then you'll do whatever  yeah
Love me like you say you love me
Then we'll be forever
And never knew
Never knew a love so good
Never knew
Never knew a love so good
Never knew a love so good
Never knew
Never knew a love so good
Never knew
Never knew a love so good
Never knew
What's wrong?
Don't hurt me  okay?
Alright
Come on  sit down. Hit this
It's nice  right?
Mmm  I like this
That right there  that's some sativa
Sativa
I think we should do something crazy
Like say  Fuck everyone
And just run away from the daily routine
Yeah  you know what I mean
I'm tellin' everybody you're mine and I like it
And I really hope you don't mind  I can't fight it
No  you know I cannot hide it 'cause I am so excited
That I finally decided on you
'Cause it's been another perfect day with ya
Wanna lay with ya
Spend the night with ya
Then spend my life with ya  alright
Alright  alright
Yeah  you heard me right
I'll go everywhere you go
(I'll go everywhere you go)
You know I'll go  I'll go
Everywhere you go

Everywhere you go
(I'll go everywhere you go
You know I'll go  I'll go)

You know I'll go  I'll go)

Baby  while we're young
We should rush and do something dumb
We should just say Fuck everyone
Where's the rabbit? He is late again
Goodness gracious  I can't wait for him
Who has got the time?
Round and round and round and round we go
It's just like the same scenario
Good for nothing feels like somethin' ain't right
I might
I might've got way too high
What's the difference in pretending and living a real lie?
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha
Everything is spinnin' now
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha
Have you seen the ground?
I might
I might've got way too high
(Break it down  roll it up)
Mountains and valleys  seashells from Sally
Ego removed but still in tune exactly
Pride set aside  third eye winking at me
I glimpse with a squint but I can see a whole grip
My retinas red  my vision is crystal
Didn't use pencil but it's true I led
My way to this sedated state of mind I always tread
My daddy did it this is the state of mind I always had
I'm mad he died before we got to have a man to man
I got two packs of sweet aromatics and 14 grams
Pardon my paranoia  I'm just a product of my past
I show you how to let your soul sail
Sparking lala  talking to Allah
(Might of got way too high)

Keeps me wanting you
Missing you  just to picture you
Is what gets me through
Fit for you  I was meant for you
What I was sent to do  meant to do
Wasn't meant for you
Hope I set the ship right
'Cause if I never had you
Then I could never lose you
Do you know what might happen
If I decide to choose you?
Then the world may just stop spinning
It may just well be the ending
Talking all about existence  who knows?
But I cannot see tomorrow
If you're not in my tomorrow  uh-oh
I'm tryna save the world
How can I when
You belong to me  I belong to them?
Who do I give me to? Who do I let win?
You or the world?
You or the world?

We'll only survive if we fight it  don't fight it
Your light shines so bright it's like two stars colliding
'Cause if I really have to
Then you know I would choose you
Do you know what would happen
If I ever lose you?
Then my heart would just stop beating
And my mind would just stop thinking
And my strengths would turn to weakness  you know
That I cannot see tomorrow
If you're not in my tomorrow  uh-oh
I gotta save the world
How can I when
You belong to me but I belong to them?
Who do I give me to? Who do I let win?
You or the world?"
