"Give me all that you got now
Make you want me cause I'm hot now
I'm gone  so faded I'm on one
Bang bang  pop off like a long gun
If you a lame nigga you ain't making no noise
Get faded  turn up with the big boys
Live fast  die young that's my choice
Get money  get money like an invoice
We can mob all in the whip
Make the money make a grip
I be stuntin' with my clique
Getting faded 'til we trip (oh)
Man  I love to get on
I love to get 2 on
When the drink be too strong
When the tree be way too strong
Pour it on up 'til I can't even think no more
Get ratchet  go dumb then go more dumb then
We can keep it lit  let's roll
I love to get 2 on
Let-let... let's roll
I love to get 2 on  I love to
Let-let-let's roll
Let-let-let's roll

Get money  get money like an invoice
We can mob all in the whip
Make the money make a grip

Pussy in my mouth  pussy on my pinky ring
Nasty  baby me do it in the backseat
Swear this marijuana keep it cracking
Draped up and dripped out  keep the trees passing
Days of our lives so clap  clap that cake
Just give me the trees and we can smoke it ya
Just give me the drink and we can pour it ya
And my enemies  they see me living now
Man  I love to get on

When the drink be too strong
When the tree be way too strong
Pour it on up 'til I can't even think no more
Get ratchet  go dumb then go more dumb then
We can keep it lit  let's roll
I love to get 2 on
Let-let... let's roll
I love to get 2 on  I love to
Let-let-let's roll

Wanna change  the first step is the hardest
A brand new age has finally begun right now
This life right here won't hold me down
Getting so hard to see the stars

What if I told you that it was all in vain?
Would it still hurt you?
Would you still feel the same?
So impossible
But you're still waiting on the moment
Breath is bated
Tell you all my secrets
I'm too faded
Praying that tomorrow I'll be braver
Living in a piece of ever after
Forever after
Living in the piece of ever after
If you will have me
I'll make you happy
Need someone to whom I can belong
Here's my confession
Saving it special
Hoped it would be you all along
All along
All along

If you could promise to be worth the wait
Hoping that you think about us
All I want is to feel like the old me
Fade away a little slower
I go over every word you told me
I'm in heaven when you hold me
Still feels like I could fall to pieces when I hear your name
I could find another lover easily and you know it
Tell me
Did you notice I've been doing just fine?
It's like you're never here and the tears have all dried
Did you notice I've been doing okay?
Don't even think about you every single day

Now I'm dancing solo (Solo)
Slowly disappearing
It still hurts when I see you with her
Just save room for us
Just save room for us
We'll fall in love again
Just save room for us
And it may not be today
True love will find a way
Just save a space for me
Just save room for us
Walking in the snow filled me up with joy
Ice in my hair 'cause I'm coldish
Why you turn me to a monster?
Why you faded at my concerts?
Why don't you just let me love you?
Make me feel like underwater
Even when the sky turns cold
On the pedestal is a diamond
Couple of miles to the depot
Walking in the snow filled me up with joy
Ice in my hair 'cause I'm coldish

(I'm so cold)
Left me layin' on the table with the letter open
Only feelin' solid nowadays 'cause my heart frozen
My heart
Why you turn me to a monster?
Why you faded at my concerts?
Why don't you just let me love you?
Make me feel like under water
I'm alone makin' clouds in my room
C-couple of miles to the depot
Walking in the snow filled me up with joy (What?)
Ice in my hair 'cause I'm coldish
Stuck in a world where we could be perfect
Sick of the heartache under the benefit
Simple as it could be
Too good to have it be true
Too good to have it be true
Simple as it could be
Too good to have it be true
Couple of miles to the depot
Couple of miles to the depot
Walking in the snow filled me up with joy
Ice in my hair 'cause I'm coldish
Think about me when you're lonely
You're so crazy  how you came to me
Windows tinted cause we lowkey
We ain't fucking with the police
We're so shady  you're forever
I swear it's never felt like this before
I swear it's never felt like this before
(Never like this before  never like this before)
Underneath the sapphire sky
Lost a little piece of my mind
Caught up in the moment  I
I'm floating somewhere off in spacetime
Bottle of Rosé on cold
I like swimming when the moon's in full
Mike Phelps in it going gold
Wear  wear it out like new clothes
We ain't fucking with the games
Been let down  I ain't going there again
That's why I love you when it end
One time down  you ain't going in again

Now we're together  we're fucking 'round forever
You always feel me when you're laying with somebody else
You never tried it yet  just 'cause it feels so good
And every time reminds you of the first night
Underneath the sapphire sky
Lost a little piece of my mind
Caught up in the moment  I
I'm floating somewhere off in spacetime
Peeped it on Instagram
Careful  you're more than that
Eat your heart out today
Serve it up on a plate
I'll be your lover  babe
Late night  I'm open
You want more
You come back
You get more
I'm all for it
(How could anyone be so)
And I really do mean it
You're something I believe in
Wait all night 'til you see me
'Cause I see God when you eat it
Got some top 33  lit
Blow it out for you  baby
I knock that ass out so crazy
(How could anyone be so)
Go for gold
Glitter gold
You're the champion (oh)
(Lit up in the dark like whoa)
Go for gold
Glitter gold
You're the champion  champion
Peeped it on Instagram
Careful  you're more than that

Late night  I'm open
You want more

I'm all for it
Underneath the sapphire sky
Lost a little piece of my mind
Caught up in the moment  I
Need to come down  it's been fun
Got sunburn in my eyes  I've been looking up
Trying to hold on to this feeling
Is this where you run?
Is this where you left me?
Is this where you leave me all alone  hmm?
My tongue has turned to gold
When I tried to tell you
I got paper cuts in my cheeks now
I'm seeing pink 'cause I've been looking at the brightside
I ain't letting nobody cloud up all my blue sky
I'm seeing pink 'cause I've been looking at the brightside
I ain't letting nobody cloud up all my blue sky
(Blue sky  blue sky)
I ain't letting nobody cloud up all my blue sky
I'm seeing pink 'cause I've been looking at the brightside
I ain't letting nobody cloud up all my blue sky
There's a picture frame of us in the corner just gathering dust
Funny how time doesn't move quite the same
Sunburn in my eyes I've been looking up
I feel no pain
This is where you're wrong
This ain't what you're used to
This is like that rose in the thorn bush
My tongue has turned to gold
Baby  can you help me
If I can turn my fear into beauty
That's what I'll do
