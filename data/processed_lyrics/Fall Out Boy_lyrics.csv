lyrics
" go out and preach on Manic Street?
 please let me in (Please let me in)
 singing vows before we exchange smoke rings
 call me Mr. Benzedrine
 I wanna blow off steam and
 but no clarity
 the man who would be king
 the same war his dad rehearsed
 please take me back (Please take me back)
 please let me in (Please let me in)
 singing vows before we exchange smoke rings
 call me Mr. Benzedrine
 I wanna blow off steam and
 my my my Benzedrine
 ahh
 bla bla bla Benzedrine
 ahh
 the rest
 on the
 I wanna blow off steam and
 it's you
 it's the taxidermy of you and me
 to the glue factory
 I like being all alone
 and the kids are snoring
I can't remember  I can't remember
And I want it so bad I'd shoot the sunshine into my veins
I can't remember the good old days
And it's kind of funny
The way we're wearing anchors on our shirts
When being anchored aboard
Just feels like a curse
My mind is a safe  and if I keep it in we all get rich
My body is an orphanage  we take everyone in
Doing lines of dust and sweat off last night's stage
Just to feel like you
The m-m-milligrams in my head burning tobacco in the wind
Chasing the direction  chasing the direction you went
You shine in the sky  you shine in the sky
And are all the good times getting gone?
I've got a lot of friends who are stars
But some are just black holes

Just to feel like you
Dropping I'm sorry like you're still around
And I know you dressed up
And you're just the girl all the boys wanna dance with
And I'm just the boy who's had too many chances
I'm sleepin' on your folks' porch again  dreamin'
I don't blame you for bein' you
But you can't blame me for hating it
I set my clocks early 'cause I know I'm always late
Write me off  give up on me
'Cause darling  what did you expect?
I'm just off  a lost cause
A long shot  don't even take this bet
You can make all the moves  you can aim all the spotlights
Get all the sighs and the moans just right

It was the fourth of July
That went off too soon
And I miss you in the June gloom too

I said I'd never miss you
But I guess you never know
May the bridges I have burned
Light my way back home on the fourth of July

If you get me

Love from the other side of the apocalypse
And I just about snapped  don't look back
Every lover's got a little dagger in their hand
Generation sleep  I'm falling in and out of love
I'm getting that tilted feeling out here
What would you trade the pain for?
I'm not sure
Nowhere left for us to go but Heaven
Summer falling through our fingers again
And you were the sunshine of my lifetime
What would you trade the pain for?

But there's no way off the hamster wheel on this rat race
Sending my love from the other side of the apocalypse
And I just about snapped  don't look back
Every lover's got a little dagger in their hand
Love from the other side of the apocalypse
And I just about snapped  don't look back
Every lover's got a little dagger in their hand
I saw you in a bright clear field  hurricane heat in my head
The kind of pain you feel to get good in the end  good in the end
Inscribed like stone and faded by the rain: Give up what you love
Give up what you love before it does you in…
Sending my love from the other side of the apocalypse
And I just about snapped  don't look back
Every lover's got a little dagger in their hand
Love from the other side of the apocalypse
And I just about snapped  don't look back
Every lover's got a little dagger in their hand
Sending my love
I know I'm the one you want to forget
Cue all the love to leave my heart
It's time for me to fall apart
Now you're gone  but I'll be okay
Your hot whiskey eyes have fanned the flame
Maybe I'll burn a little brighter tonight
Let the fire breathe me back to life
Baby  you were my picket fence  I miss missing you now and then
Chlorine kissed summer skin  I miss missing you now and then
Sometimes before it gets better  the darkness gets bigger
The person that you'd take a bullet for is behind the trigger
Oh  we're fading fast  I miss missing you now and then
Making eyes at this husk around my heart
I see through you when we're sitting in the dark
So give me your filth  make it rough
Let me  let me trash your love
I will sing to you every day
If it will take away the pain
Oh  and I've heard you got it  got it so bad
'Cause I am the best you'll never have

Through a constellation of tears on your lashes

In the end everything collides  my childhood
Spat back out the monster that you see

Maybe I bit off more than I could chew
Overhead of the aqua blue
Fall to your knees bring on the rapture
Blessed be the boys time can't capture
On film or between the sheets
I always fall from your window to the pitch black street
And with the black banners raised
As the crooked smiles fade
Former heroes who quit too late
Who just wanna fill up the trophy case again
And in the end
I'd do it all again
I think you're my best friend
I'll be yours
When it rains it pours
Stay thirsty like before
I'm not passive but aggressive
Empty your sadness like you're dumping your purse
On my bedroom floor
We put your curse in reverse
And it's our time now if you want it to be
Maul the world like the carnival bear set free
And your love is anemic and I can't believe
That you couldn't see it coming from me
And I still feel that rush in my veins

Woke up on the wrong side of reality
And there's a madness that's just coursing right through me
Not sure I'm there yet but I'm certain I've arrived
And send a message: I was young and a menace

Young and a menace
I'm just here flying off the deep end
I'm just here to become the best yet
I'm just here for the psych assessment
I'm just here for the... For the...
Fall!
Young and a menace
 free of the Colosseums
 we are anti-venom
 the foxes hunt the hounds
 the foxes hunt the hounds
Of an old one's head
When all the others were just stirrin' awake
I'm gonna leave you
How we're all alone
Let me in (let me in)
Knowing how heartwarming it is inside
Your skin

Mmmmm
Does he sing on a stage? Does he sing on a stage?
We waste it all in the back of a long dark car
And I'm a sunshine machine
I'll always be waiting in the back room
I'm boring  but overcompensate with
Headlines and flash  flash  flash photography
But don't pretend you ever forgot about me
Don't pretend you ever forgot about me
Wouldn't you rather be a widow than a divorcee?
Style your wake for fashion magazines
Widow or a divorcee?
Don't pretend  d-d-d-don't pretend
We don't fight fair  we don't fight fair
They say your head can be a prison
Then these are just conjugal visits
People will dissect us till
This doesn't mean a thing anymore
Don't pretend you ever forgot about me
Don't pretend you ever forgot about me

We do it in the dark with smiles on our faces
We're trapped and well concealed in secret places  oh-woah

We don't fight fair  we don't fight fair  we don't fight fair
