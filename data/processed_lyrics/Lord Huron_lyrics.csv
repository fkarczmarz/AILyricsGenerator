lyrics
"I came to have my fortune told
Can't imagine what she saw
While gazing in her crystal ball
Far out past the astral plane
I cast you back from whence you came
Cosmic ash and blackened brain
And call you by your ancient names
I gotta get away from here
I gotta get away from her
What the fortune teller said is
I'm alive for now but good as dead
She claimed she'd seen it all
While she was gazing in her crystal ball
I can't evade my fate
Then I won't sit around and wait
A fallen star will be thy bane
And call you by your ancient names

I gotta get away from here
(I'll never see another sunrise)
I gotta get away from her
(Oh  if I leave this place alive)
I gotta get away from here
(I'll never see another sunrise)
Oh I gotta get away from her
I gotta get away from here
I gotta get away from her
I gotta get away from here
I gotta get away from her
I gotta get away from here
If I live to see the next sunrise
I gotta get away from her
 we've all had enough
 we've all had enough
 then somehow I survived
 but I know I’m alive
 but I just wouldn’t die
 I came back from the edge
 brother?
 thousands of years
 chasing our fear?
 don't know what
 brother
 brother
 you've been my friend
 we must die  all things must end
 brother?
 one last fight?
 don't tell me that we're not the same
 brothers till the end
 but not today
 don't tell me that we're not the same
 brothers till the end
 but not today
 don't tell me that we're not the same
 brothers till the end
 but not today
 don't tell me that we're not the same
 brothers till the end
 but not today
Is hollering her name
And the sirens wail as we ran like hell
Down a strange trail
I wanna know her game
I wanna learn her wits
And how she plays her tricks
Lots of booze and her kiss
These are drugs that do not mix
I was under her spell
But who knew love would be like this?
Don't know what I'm gonna do
But I guess I gotta see it through
'Cause I don't know how to walk out of this deal
The spell she cast on me is real
Don't know how to right the wrongs I've done
She bends the wills of men for fun
Don't know how to take my own life back
Everything she touches turns to black
Don't know how to fight what I can't see
That girl has laid a curse on me

I gotta find me a cure
I gotta clear my name
There's gotta be some way
I hope it's not too late
To break the spell
Yeah
I want to get her alone
I want to ask her why
And look into those eyes
And see the endless night
Staring back
What kind of magic is this?
I was doomed by our first kiss
Just a pawn in her game
I've done things that have no name
And she'll make me do worse
If the law doesn't get me first
She has turned my heart black
And I know I can't turn back
They appear when she walks in
I am bound by her spell
I am chained to do her will
Who knew love was gonna be like this?
She has cloaked me in black
And there ain't no turning back
I don't know how to walk out of this deal
The spell she cast on me is real
I don't know how to right the wrongs I've done
She bends the wills of men for fun
I don't know how to take my own life back
Everything she touches turns to black
I don't know how to fight what I can't see
That girl has laid a curse on me
 I was heading back out west
 he was dead as they come
 I thought I'd bury him
 I don't know how to die
 my friend
 he walked through the sand
 haunting the desert
And I doubt that I ever will find someone else
Lonely days fall like drops in the lake of our love
I just want it to be like it was
And I want you to be as you were long ago
I go down to the edge of the lake
Where I wait through the night for the dawn light to break
Memories of old crash like waves on the shore of my mind
And I pray that the stars will align
I just want us to be who we were long ago
I just want what was
How I yearn for the yеars we were young and in lovе
I get by  but it's hard to forget
In the smoke of denial and the fog of regret
Dismal and darksome like clouds in the sky of my soul
And I hear thunder roll
I look up at the uncaring sky
With a prayer on my lips and a tear in my eye
Oh  how the heart burns like fire in the light of the moon
I just hope you'll be comin' back soon

You're my long-lost love
In the light of the emerald star
I’ve come for you  my love
Through a window in the dark
Don’t you know you’re my everything?
If I lost you  I think I would die
Was everything you said just a lie?
You never loved me
I came all the way through time and space
To take you away and out of this place
With the moonlight in your eyes
You’re the brightest star in all of the sky
I’ll cry and I’ll cry if your light ever dies

Way up north to where the tall trees stand
Before I commence my ride
I'm askin' Lily to be my bride
I know there's another man
But he ain't gonna delay my plans
I know she gonna be my wife
Ain't afraid of him 'cause I'm a fool for love

With the moonlight as my guide
I go wander through the pines
And make my way to nature's shrines
And I look up to the sky
And I know you're still alive
But I wonder where you are
I call your name into the dark
And I don't know where I've been
All alone on a mountainside
And huddled in the wind
And it feels like I've been away for an era
But nothing has changed at all
And it feels like I've been with you
On the night you disappeared
But the strange light in the sky
Was shining right into my eyes
There was no one else in sight
Just the endless frozen pines
But I wonder how they know

On the other side of the frozen pines
I'm gonna find a way through

I will be waiting for you
On the other side of the frozen pines
I'm gonna find a way through
'Cause you hold your life when you hold that flame
I get a kick outta thunder and lightnin'
And tearing through the night hollerin' your name
I get a laugh outta starin' at darkness
And wondering why people live in the light
I don't feel alive if I ain't in the fight

Blind without her source of light

On a great cloud of dust carried by the wind
And he asked her to come run away with him
He saw a pretty young girl who was ready to run
And she saw just the chance she'd been looking for
But he was not the man that she took him for

And he promised her she was the only one

And all those days and all those nights
And all those days and all those nights (forever together  forever alive)
And all those days and all those nights (forever together  forever alive)
And all those days and all those nights (forever together  forever alive)
And the desert can't hear my cries
The moon doesn't mind that I'm left all alone
(Ooh  ooh  ooh)

I am not the only traveler
Who has not repaid his debt
I've been searching for a trail to follow again
Take me back to the night we met
And then I can tell myself
What the hell I'm supposed to do
And then I can tell myself
Not to ride along with you
I had all and then most of you
Some and now none of you
Take me back to the night we met
I don't know what I'm supposed to do
Haunted by the ghost of you
Oh  take me back to the night we met
When the night was full of terrors
And your eyes were filled with tears
When you had not touched me yet
Oh  take me back to the night we met

I don't know what I'm supposed to do
Haunted by the ghost of you
Came out of the ocean like you came out of a dream
Your voice  it sounds familiar but you are not what you seem
All words of comfort can not take away my doubt
I've decided if it kills me I'll find out what you're about
I can't trust anyone or anything these days
But I know what you want and why
Of all the strangers you're the strangest that I've seen
I'm not afraid to die
I can't trust anyone or anything these days
You are not the one you say you are
You are not the one you say you are
I can't trust anyone or anything these days
If you are who you say you are  then show me your face
Know enough to say you are not what you claim to be
I've kept close watch upon you and I don't like what I see
Can't escape the feeling that you'll get me in the night
I'll sleep with one eye open  and I'm not afraid to fight
I can't trust anyone or anything these days
But I know what you want and why

I was the man that I wanted to be
I had a place where I lay my head  but
They burnt it to the ground  and the sky turned red
I had a life and a place in the world
I had a sweet-talkin' wife and a beautiful girl
I know I'm never gonna see 'em again
Gonna tear the world up until I have my revenge
They took my life
But it isn't the end
They put me in the ground
But I'm back from the dead
Baby

You'll hear me howl by the light of the moon
That's how you'll know that I'm coming for you
Gonna find you alone in the dark of night
I'll never bleed  and I won't ever age
I'll never feel the embrace of the grave
The fair and the brave and the good must die
I seen the other side of living  I know heaven's a lie
I'll tear through the night
And I'll raise some hell
Cause I'm the World Ender  baby
And I'm back from the dead
Lord knows I should be pushing up daisies
I was six feet down  but something raised me up
Sent back for to lift my curse
I'm gonna get me a taste of some chaos first
Untied  gonna get little wild
Go screaming through the dark like a demon child
Close your eyes now  the light is fading
And the noise in the night is gonna get a little louder  baby
Baby
They can run for their lives  but they cannot be saved
They put me in the ground  but I'm back from the dead
They can run for their lives  but they cannot be saved
They put me in the ground  but I'm back from the dead
They can run for their lives  but they cannot be saved
I speak to birds and tell them where to fly
I sing the songs that you hear on the breeze
I write the names of the rocks and the trees
I tried to warn you when you were a child
I told you not to get lost in the wild
I sent you omens and all kinds of signs
(You will open the yawning grave)
They'll string me up for all that I've done
I'm going soon
I'm gonna leave tonight by the light of the moon
I did it all for you
What's a man to say?
I've no regrets
I will not ask for your forgiveness
Lower your defense
I did it all for you
Don't spurn me after all I've gone through
No time to rest

Run away for you
I'm gonna count the days till you make it through
I did it all for you
My time is spent
But the booze just makes me slow
But I guess maybe I'll just go
There’s a method to my madness
There’s a secret to this town
There’s a reason why I’m still living here
Though I can’t think of it right now
I made a promise when I left for the coast
Twenty long years ago
I made a life out of chasing a ghost
But it took everything I had
I gotta find a way out of this mess
I have a thought or two to sharе with you
But the dope tends to cloud my mind
I destroyed my health searching for myself
But there ain't nothing there to find
There's a debt or two I owe you
But the gambling left me poor
I put up my name in the sacred game
And forgot what I was playing for

 and time was bending
 don't close your eyes
 and time was bending
Whisper my name without making a noise
Tears of sorrow or tears of joy
Drops in my cup as my mind is destroyed
So what if I'm living out past the edge?
So what if I never come back again?
Many evils have I enjoyed
Prowling the night raising hell with the boys
I am only an aimless soul

 I'm just a man
 I will leave this world behind
 can I touch the sky?
I've been running through life and cruising toward death
I belong bodily to the earth
I'm just wearing old bones from those that came first
There are many more flames when mine is gone
They will build me no shrines and sing me no songs
I'm a long way from the one that I loved
Drifting in a land that time forgot
I belong bodily to the earth
I'm just wearing old bones from those that came first
I been unraveling since my birth
Gonna wander out there and see what I'm worth
Follow me way out there
There's no road that will lead us back
When you follow the strange trails
They will take you to who knows where
If I found a way to stay with you tonight
It would only make me late for a date I can't escape

 I was blind
 I thought I'd never die
 though I should have been sleeping
 I wasn't hard of feeling
 we went wild  we never closed our eyes
 but I was wrong
 I felt like I could die
I've been lonely long enough
Will I find you when the night is over?
Tell me where did you go?
I've been searching high and low
I have only 'til the night is over
Your reflection in the glass
Makes me wonder if my mind is going
Shadows shifting in the rain
Slowly driving me insane
I have only 'til the night is over
I feel the weather change
I hear the river say your name
I watch the birds fly by
I see an emerald in the sky
Now the trail has gone cold
I don't know where else to go
When the ocean drinks the sky
And the city winks its eye
Will I hold you when the night is over?

May you laugh and sing your life full
May you learn the reasons why

You don't get to be the one
Who's young and wild and in love

I don't need to hear you say
You'll never go wrong again because I know you will
I don't need the reasons why
You've done the things you did because it's over with

I won't shed another tear
I've nothing left to feel and now I've said enough

I'll leave you in another life
