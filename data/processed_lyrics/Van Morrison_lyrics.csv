lyrics
" yes after before
 in the presence of the flame
 didn't I come to bring you a sense of wonder?
 didn't I come to lift your fiery vision bright?
 Gransha and the Ballystockart Road
 I said I would describe the leaves for Samuel and Felicity
 didn't I come to bring you a sense of wonder?
 didn't I come to lift your fiery vision bright?
 through the winter of our discontent
 but I call my love Philosophy
 didn't I come to bring you a sense of wonder?
 didn't I come to lift your fiery vision bright?
 didn't I come to bring you a sense of wonder?
 didn't I come to lift your fiery vision bright?
 child
 child
And the rain came pourin' down
Me and Billy standin' there
With a silver half a crown
Hands are full of a fishin' rod
And the tackle on our backs
We just stood there gettin' wet
With our backs against the fence
Hope it don't rain all day
And it stoned me to my soul
Stoned me just like Jelly Roll
And it stoned me
And it stoned me to my soul
Stoned me just like goin' home
And it stoned me
And the rain let up
And the sun came up
And we were gettin' dry
Almost let a pick-up truck
Nearly pass us by
So we jumped right in
And the driver grinned
And he dropped us up the road
And we looked at the swim
And we jumped right in
Not to mention fishing poles

Let it run all over me
And it stoned me to my soul
Stoned me just like Jelly Roll
And it stoned me
And it stoned me to my soul
Stoned me just like goin' home
And it stoned me
On the way back home
We sang a song
But our throats were getting dry
Then we saw the man
From across the road
With the sunshine in his eyes
In his own little home
With a great big gallon jar
There were bottles too
One for me and you
And he said Hey! There you are
Get it myself from the mountain stream
And it stoned me to my soul
Stoned me just like Jelly Roll
And it stoned me
And it stoned me to my soul
Stoned me just like goin' home
And it stoned me
Stoned on me just like Jelly Roll
And it stoned me
Well. it stoned me to my soul
Stoned me just like goin' home
And we'll walk down the avenue again
And we'll sing all the songs from way back when (Yeah)
And we'll walk down the avenue again
And the healing has begun
And we'll walk down the avenue in style
And we'll walk down the avenue and we'll smile
And we'll say baby ain't it all worthwhile
When the healing has begun
I want you to put on your pretty summer dress
You can wear your Easter bonnet and all the rest
And I wanna make love to you yes  yes  yes
When the healing has begun
Alright  when the healing has begun

Oh baby  now you just let me ease on a little bit
Dig this backstreet jellyroll
And the healing  and the healing has begun
And  and the healing has begun
Between the viaducts of your dream
Where immobile steel rims crack
And the ditch in the back roads stop
Could you find me?
Would you kiss-a my eyes?
And lay me down
In silence easy
To be born again
To be born again?
From the far side of the ocean
If I put the wheels in motion
And I stand with my arms behind me
And I pushed another door
Could you find me?
Would you kiss-a my eyes?
Lay me down
In silence easy
To be born again
To be born again?

With your arms behind you
And your eyes before

Takin' good care of your boy
Seein' that he's got clean clothes
Puttin' on his little red shoes

Standing in your sad arrest
Trying to do my very best
Lookin' straight at you

Right on time

That’s why Broken Arrow
Waved his finger down the road so dark and narrow in the evening
Just before the Sunday six-bell chime
Six bells chime
And all the dogs are barking
Way on down the diamond-studded highway where you wander
And you roam from your retreating view
And way over on the railroad
Tomorrow while the tipping trucks roll out all together
Every scrapbook stuck with glue
And I’ll stand beside you
Beside you
To never never never wonder why at all

The dynamo of your smile caressed the barefoot virgin child to wander
Past your window with the lantern lit
You held it in the doorway and you cast against the pointed island breeze
Past the brazen footlits of the silence easy

Wrapped up in your magic shroud as ecstasy surrounds you
This time it's found you
You turn around

And lights my life with love
And it seems like and it feels like
A brand new day
I was lost and double crossed

Shoved out on the railroad track
And I didn't have nowhere to run
But I stood and looked
And my eyes got hooked

Hiding behind a rainbow's wall

So at the end of the day
We should give thanks and pray to the One

You fill my heart with gladness

Come aboard
After a summer shower when I saw you standin'
Standin' in the garden
In the garden wet with rain
You wiped the teardrops from your eye in sorrow
As we watched the petals fall down to the ground
And as I sat beside you I felt the
Great sadness that day in the garden
And then one day you came back home
You were a creature all in rapture
You had your key to your soul
And you did open that day you came back to the garden
The olden summer breeze was blowin' against your face
(Alright)
The light of the Lord's shinin' on your countenance divine
And you were a violet colour as you
Sat beside your father and your mother in the garden
The summer breeze was blowin' on your face
Within your violet you treasure your summery words
And as the shiver from my neck down to my spine
Ignited me in daylight and nature in the garden

And we heard lil' bells within the church

And felt the presence of the youth of
Eternal summers in the garden
(Alright)
And as it touched your cheeks so lightly
Born again you were and blushed
And we touched each other lightly
And we felt the presence of the Christ
Within our hearts in the garden
And I turned to you and I said
Just you and I and nature
And the Father in the garden

 born in the back street jelly roll

 even my best friends they don't know
 when you hear that engine drone
Seems like my heart is breaking in two
My head says no but my soul demands it
Everything I do reminds me of you
I miss you so much in this house full of shadows
While the rain keeps pouring down my window too
When will the pain recede to the darkness
From whence it has come and I'm feeling so blue
Ain't goin' down no more to the well
Sometimes it feels like I'm going to hell
Sometimes I'm knocking on your front door
But I don't have nothing to sell no more
Seems like the spirit is pushing me onwards
I'm able to see where I tripped and went wrong
I'll just have to guess where my soul will find comfort
And I miss you so much when I'm singing my song

Cross the street from Cathedral Notre Dame
Meanwhile back in San Francisco
We're trying hard to make this whole thing blend
As we sit upon this jagged
Story block with you my friend
And it's a long way to Buffalo
It's a long way to Belfast city too
And I'm hoping the joist won't blow the hoist
'Cause this time they bit off more than they can chew
