lyrics
"Honesty hurts when you're gettin' older
Why you ain't say you was gettin' bored?
Why you ain't say I was fallin' short?
How you lead me out so far away?
How could it be? Twenty-something
But God bless these twenty-somethings
Hopin' my twenty-somethings won't end
Hopin' to keep the rest of my friends
Weird
Took us so long to separate
(How could it be?)

How could it be? Twenty-something
But God bless these twenty-somethings
Hopin' my twenty-somethings won't end
Hopin' to keep the rest of my friends
 Should I come through?
 can I come kick with you?
 all in the mirror
 lookin' at me like you love me
 you come on time
 do it again
 Come and see me for once
 yeah
 why you never come?
 no?
 no?
 it's your turn
 how you lie like that
 I hear you loud and clear
 blowin' my fuse out
 yeah
 why you never come?
 no?
 no?
 you again)
 baby
 bad as I want you)
 it's 2 AM again
 I might be thirsty for you
 I might play circus for you
 Houdini
Maybe I'll be perfect in a new dimension
Maybe I should pray a little harder
Or work a little smarter
You could take me anywhere
You could take me anywhere
Keepin' up is hard to do
I feel you comin' down like money
Maybe I should pray a little harder
Or work a little smarter

You could take me anywhere
You could take me anywhere
Do you know I'm alive?
Crucify  cru-cru
I can't recall the last time I took  advice from anyone
Shaped like a figure eight  who trusts pretty girls anyway?
And I can't recall the last time I took advice from anyone
I'm sure I'll be the death of me
And I can't recall the last time I took love from anyone
I called daddy  who's got one anyway? Not me
Are you hating yourself? Do you really hate me?
Are you hating yourself?
Was it worth it? Would you do it again?
Aren't you tired (of) always making amends? Oh
I know you hate me now (Here)
I bet you hate me now (Here)
Bring on the thorny crown (Here)
Cru—
Cross my heart then I hope to die
With a peace of mind (A peace of mind)
Piece together my brain
Soon as this beat rewind (Beat rewind)
Nitrogen and propane
I spike your drink at times (Turn up  turn up)
I make it hard to swallow this game
You throw up every line (Every line)
I notice people got Napoleon complexes
That's my confession (Yeah  that)
You said that we're equal but I know you're beyond guessing
That I'm beyond desperate (Yeah  that)
6AM on a Friday morning  my darkest hours
Them heartless hours  my apartment is lost in a coffin
I'm dead to the world like I popped me a couple downers
Down & Out on my luck
Salt water all on my tux and I call  she don't pick up
Then I fall when summer is ending
I mean  there's no pretending
I'm stuck in my ways and you're offended  that's life
I belong somewhere on ice
I'm cold  and my new blood type?
Even colder  cold shoulder
Born Sinner  you know? Cole showed us!
I have nothing to lose
My dark side been well in-tuned
A Gemini gon' show them faces
And this here just one of my moods  Babylon

Forrest Gump had a lot goin' for him
Never without pussy

You are now watching MADtv
Pussy is calculatin' and good pussy is rather dangerous
And the screw face when the bae look
Won't get you no pussy
You overcompensate too much for the pussy
You like to throw all kinda shade for the pussy

How many sentiments you make before runnin' pussy away?
How many times she gotta tell you that dick is disposable?

I'm in a funk  so I bought a bouquet of roses
And cut 'em up at your doorstep  your new neighborhood is gorgeous
I paid a lotta money for the fragrances you wore when we were dating
And I sold some lemonade just to afford them
I know it's not a really good occasion to be bargin' in
I couldn't help but watch you kiss her by the kitchen sink
I swung the door open  tippy-toed farther in
I wasn't cryin'  I was starin' and forgot to blink
She saw me standin' by the TV and she wouldn't stop screamin'
So I tried to be discreet and told her  Calm your tits
She grabbed the kitchen knife  so I pulled out the blick
Ain't got it all the time  thank God I did for this
'Cause she was seein' red  and all I saw was you
It happened in a flash when she charged at me
Y'all criss-crossed  saw her fall to the floor
Then you paused there in horror  that shot wasn't for her
I might (Was it?)
I might kill my ex  not the best idea
His new girlfriend's next  how'd I get here?

You could come home today
I am shooting stars  don't you see me?
Watching over your every mistake
Digging out of graves is never easy
Handing you my shovel here to take
Always playing catch-me-if-you-can
Gingerbread—you heard I'm sweet to taste
Close your eyes  let go  and count to ten
I'll keep track of every moment wasted

Warm winds on a space ride (space ride)
When I call your phone on a late night (late night)
I recall your soul had a taste like (taste like)
Gardens  flowers  Warm Winds
The clouds below your feet
Quit clipping on your wings
Sometimes you hate to leave somebody
What's happening to we?
Warm winds on a space ride
When I call your phone on a late night
I recall your soul had a taste like
Gardens  flowers  Warm Winds
The clouds below your feet
Quit clipping on your wings
Sometimes you hate to leave somebody
What's happening to we?
Warm winds on a space ride
Sometimes I call your name out loud
Just to make sure it's you
Sometimes I crack my veins open
Just to see if it's blue
You clean me up
The clouds below your feet
Clean
Quit clipping on your wings
Our wings  yeah
Sometimes you hate to leave somebody
You'll see

Gardens  flowers  warm winds
The clouds below your feet
Quit clipping on your wings
Sometimes you hate to leave somebody

Warm winds on a space ride
Sometimes I bite my lips and close my eyes
Just to pretend it's you
Long live lonely thoughts on Thursday nights
That's when I think of you
We were all thirteen once (once)
Long live tramp stamps and Pepper Ann (Pepper Ann)
You will never judge me for that (Uh-uh)
You will always love me for that (Uh-huh)
Quit clipping on your wings

Gardens  flowers
Sayin' tomorrow I'll do the dishes  never come
Easy bake  easy wake  oven
Just give as much as you take
Forgive as much as you hate
Or get the fuck out
I've been in the dugout (Dugout)
Lookin' for a way out (Way out)
Now I'm feelin' worn out (Worn out)
Lookin' for a way out (Way out)
I was wavy
I've been waitin' for you  boy
And I was drownin' (Ooh)
I went crazy
I've been goin' crazy  boy
And I found out  this the way out (Ooh)
Now I'm wavy
Now I'm wavy
