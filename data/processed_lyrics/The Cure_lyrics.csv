lyrics
"And the tap drips under the strip light
And I'm sitting in the kitchen sink
And the tap drips
Waiting for the telephone to ring
And I'm wondering where she's been
And I'm crying for yesterday
And the tap drips
See into the trees
Find the girl
While you can
Come closer and see
See into the dark
Just follow your eyes
Just follow your eyes
I hear her voice
Calling my name
The sound is deep
In the dark
I hear her voice
And start to run
Into the trees
Into the trees
Into the trees
Suddenly I stop
But I know it's too late
I'm lost in a forest
All alone
The girl was never there
It's always the same
I'm running towards nothing
Again and again and again and again
And again and again and again and again
And again and again and again and again
And again and again and again and again
And again and again and again and again
And again
I just can't stay here every yesterday
Like keep on acting out the same the way we act out
Every way to smile  forget
And make-believe we never needed
Any more than this
Any more than this
Oh  Elise it doesn't matter what you do
I know I'll never really get inside of you
To make your eyes catch fire the way they should
The way the blue could pull me in
If they only would  if they only would
At least I'd lose this sense of sensing
Something else that hides away
From me and you  there're worlds to part
With aching looks and breaking hearts
And all the prayers your hands can make
Oh  I just take as much as you can throw
And then throw it all away
Oh  I'll throw it all away
Like throwing faces at the sky  like throwing arms round yesterday
I stood and stared wide-eyed in front of you
And the face I saw looked back the way I wanted to
But I just can't hold my tears away the way you do
Elise  believe I never wanted this
I thought this time I'd keep all of my promises
I thought you were the girl I always dreamed about
But I let the dream go
And the promises broke and make-believe ran out
You might also like
So  Elise it doesn't matter what you say
I just can't stay here every yesterday
Like keep on acting out the same the way we act out
Every way to smile  forget
And make-believe we never needed
Any more than this
Any more than this
And every time I try to pick it up
Like falling sand
As fast as I pick it up
It runs away through my clutching hands
But there's nothing else I can really do
There's nothing else I can really do
There's nothing else I can really do
If it's the last thing we ever do
You never looked as lost as this
Sometimes it doesn't even look like you
Please stay
But I watch you like I'm made of stone
As you walk away
I'm coming to find you if it takes me all night
A witch hunt for another girl
For always and ever is always for you
Say hello on a day like today
Say it every time you move
The way that you look at me now
Makes me wish I was you
This touch
And the smile and the shake of your head
And the smile and the shake of your head

I’m coming to find you if it takes me all night
Can’t stand here like this anymore
For always and ever is always for you
I want it to be perfect like before
I’m coming to find you if it takes me all night
Can’t stand here like this anymore
For always and ever is always for you
I want it to be perfect like before
Cold as it hits the bleeding ground
He lived and died  catch sight  cover me with earth
Draped in black  static white sound
A day without substance  a change of thought
An atmosphere that rots with time
Colours that flicker in water  a short term effect
Scream as she tries to push him over
Helpless and sick
Sideways across the desert  a charcoal face bites my hand
Time is sweet  derange and disengage everything
A day without substance  a change of thought
The atmosphere rots with time
Colours that flicker in water  a short term effect
A short term effect
An echo and a stranger's hand  a short term effect
The blind man kissing my hands
As he plays on his knees
(As he plays on his knees)
And the sand and the sea grows
I close my eyes
Move slowly through drowning waves
Going away on a strange day
And I laugh as I drift in the wind
Blind dancing on a beach of stone
Cherish the faces as they wait for the end
Sudden hush across the water
And we're here again
And the sand and the sea grows
I close my eyes
Move slowly through drowning waves
Going away on a strange day
You might also like
My head falls back and the walls crash down
And the sky and the impossible explode
An impression of sound
Then everything is gone forever
(A strange day)
In bed amongst the stones
The columns are all men begging to crush me
No shapes sail on the dark deep lakes
And no flags wave me home
For however far away
You will remember me tonight
Promise you'll be with me in the end
Say we'll be together and you won’t forget
For however far away
You will remember me in time
And slide down close beside me
In the silence of a heartbeat
You'll wrap your arms around me
In a murmured lullaby
Is the memory of the first time
In the stillness of a teardrop
I'll hold you for the last time
In the dying of the life
For my world has grown old
And nothing is forever
My world has grown old
But it really doesn't matter
If you say we'll be together
You might also likeIf you promise you'll be with me in the end

But it really doesn't matter
If you say we’ll be together
If you promise you’ll be with me in the end
Promise you'll be with me in the end
Slide down close beside me
If I thought that it would change your mind
But I know that this time
I tried to laugh about it
Cover it all up with lies
I tried to laugh about it
Hiding the tears in my eyes
'Cause boys don't cry
Boys don't cry
I would break down at your feet
But I know that it's too late
And now there's nothing I can do
So I try to laugh about it
Cover it all up with lies
I try to laugh about it
Hiding the tears in my eyes
'Cause boys don't cry
Boys don't cry

I would tell you that I loved you
If I thought that you would stay
But I know that it's no use
And you've already gone away
Misjudged your limits
Pushed you too far
Took you for granted
Now I would do 'most anything
To get you back by my side
But I just keep on laughing
Hiding the tears in my eyes
'Cause boys don't cry
Boys don't cry
Whispering me away from you
Don't wake at night to watch her sleep
You know that you will always lose
This trembling  adored
Tousled  birdmad girl
But every night I burn  every night I call your name
Every night I burn  every night I fall again
Oh  don't talk of love  the shadows purr
Murmuring me away from you
Don't talk of worlds that never were
The end is all that's ever true
There's nothing you can ever say
Nothing you can ever do
Still every night I burn  every night I scream your name
Every night I burn  every night the dream's the same
Every night I burn  waiting for my only friend
Every night I burn  waiting for the world to end
You might also like
Just paint your face  the shadows smile
Slipping me away from you
Oh  it doesn't matter how you hide
Find you if they're wanting to
So slide back down and close your eyes
Sleep a while  you must be tired
But every night I burn  every night I call your name
Every night I burn  every night I fall again
Every night I burn  scream the animal scream
Every night I burn  dream the crow black dream
Every night I burn  scream the animal scream
Every night I burn  dream the crow black dream
Dream the crow black dream
Dream the crow black dream
Dream the crow black dream
A girl I think I used to know
Yes  I'd see her when the day got colder
On those days when it felt like snow
You know I even think that she stared like you
She used to just stand there and stare
And roll her eyes right up to heaven
And make like I just wasn't there
And she used to fall down a lot
That girl was always falling again and again
And I used to sometimes try to catch her
But I never even caught her name
And sometimes we would spend the night
Just rolling about on a floor
And I remember even though it felt soft at the time
I always used to wake up sore
You know I even think that she smiled like you
She used to just stand there and smile
And her eyes would go all sorts of far away
And stay like that for quite a while

And I remember she used to fall down a lot
That girl was always falling again and again
And I used to sometimes try to catch her
But never even caught her name
Yes  I sometimes even tried to catch her
Change to one face  change to one voice
Prepare yourself for bed
The light seems bright and glares on white walls
All the sounds of Charlotte Sometimes
Into the night with Charlotte Sometimes
Night after night  she lay alone in bed
(Something's strange with Charlotte Sometimes)
Her eyes so open to the dark  the streets all looked so strange
(Something's strange with Charlotte Sometimes)
They seemed so far away  but Charlotte did not cry
(Something's strange with Charlotte Sometimes)
The people seemed so close to playing expressionless games
The people seemed so close  so many other names
Sometimes I'm dreaming  where all the other people dance
(Something's strange with Charlotte Sometimes)
Sometimes I'm dreaming  Charlotte Sometimes
(Something's strange with Charlotte Sometimes)
Sometimes I'm dreaming

Expressionless the trance  sometimes I'm dreaming

So many different names
Sometimes I'm dreaming  the sounds all stay the same
Sometimes I'm dreaming
She hopes to open shadowed eyes on a different world
Come to me scared princess  Charlotte sometimes
On that bleak track  see the sun has gone again
(Something's strange with Charlotte Sometimes)
The tears were pouring down her face
(Something's strange with Charlotte Sometimes)
She was crying and crying for a girl
Who died so many years before
(Something's strange with Charlotte Sometimes)
Sometimes I dream where all the other people dance
Sometimes I dream
Charlotte sometimes
Sometimes I dream  the sounds all stay the same
Sometimes I'm dreaming
There are so many different names
Sometimes I dream  sometimes I dream
Charlotte Sometimes  crying for herself (Charlotte Sometimes)
(Charlotte Sometimes)
Charlotte Sometimes dreams a wall around herself
(Charlotte Sometimes  Charlotte Sometimes)
But it's always with love  with so much love (Charlotte Sometimes)
It looks like everything else (Charlotte Sometimes)
Of Charlotte Sometimes  so far away (Charlotte Sometimes)
Glass sealed and pretty  Charlotte Sometimes
I wish I'd stayed asleep today
I never thought this day would end
I never thought tonight could ever be this close to me
Just try to see in the dark  just try to make it work
To feel the fear before you're here
I make the shapes come much too close
I pull my eyes out  hold my breath and wait until I shake
But if I had your faith
Then I could make it safe and clean
Oh  if only I was sure
That my head on the door was a dream
I've waited hours for this  I've made myself so sick
I wish I'd stayed asleep today
I never thought this day would end
I never thought tonight could ever be this close to me
But if I had your faith
Then I could make it safe and clean
Oh  if only I was sure
I'm out of step and closing down
And never sleep for wanting hours
The empty hours of greed
And uselessly always the need
To feel again the real belief
Of something more than mockery
Take another face  you will be kissed again
I was cold as l mouthed the words and crawled across the mirror
And wait  await the next breath
Your name like ice into my heart
A shallow grave  a monument to the ruined age
Ice in my eyes and eyes like ice don't move
Screaming at the moon  another past time
Your name like ice into my heart
Everything as cold as life (Can no one save you?)
Everything as cold as silence (And you will never say a word)
Your name like ice into my heart
The shameless kiss of vanity
The soft and the black and the velvety
Up tight against the side of me
And mouth and eyes and heart all bleed
And run in thickening streams of greed
As bit by bit it starts the need
To just let go my party piece
I miss the kiss of treachery
The aching kiss before I feed
The stench of a love for a younger meat
And the sound that it makes when it cuts in deep
The holding up on bended knees
The addiction of duplicities
As bit by bit it starts the need
To just let go my party piece
But I never said I would stay to the end
So I leave you with babies and hoping for frequency
Screaming like this in the hope of the secrecy
Screaming me over and over and over
I leave you with photographs  pictures of trickery
Stains on the carpet and stains on the scenery
Songs about happiness murmured in dreams
When we both of us knew how the ending would be
You might also like
So it's all come back round to breaking apart again
Breaking apart like I'm made up of glass again
Making it up behind my back again
Holding my breath for the fear of sleep again
Holding it up behind my head again
Cut in the deep to the heart of the bone again
Round and round and round and it's coming apart again
Over and over and over
And now that I know that I'm breaking to pieces
I'll pull out my heart and I'll feed it to anyone
I'm crying for sympathy  crocodiles cry
For the love of the crowd
And the three cheers from everyone
Dropping through sky
Through the glass of the roof
Through the roof of your mouth
Through the mouth of your eye
Through the eye of the needle
It's easier for me to get closer to Heaven
Than ever feel whole again
But I never said I would stay to the end
I knew I would leave you with babies and everything
Screaming like this in the hole of sincerity
Screaming it over and over and over
I leave you with photographs  pictures of trickery
And stains on the carpet and stains on the memory
And songs about happiness murmured in dreams
When we both of us knew how the end always is
How the end always is
How the end always is
How the end always is
How the end always is
How the end always is
Always is
Staring at the blood red moon
Remembering the hopes and dreams I had
All I had to do
And wondering what became of that boy
And the world he called his own
And I'm outside in the dark
Wondering how I got so old
Nothing left of all I loved
It all feels wrong
AI don’t belong here anymore
I will lose myself in time
It won’t be long
Left alone with nothing at the end of every song
Left alone with nothing at the end of every song
Left alone with nothing
Nothing
Nothing
I can't just carry on this way
And every time I turn away
I lose another blind game
The idea of perfection holds me
Suddenly  I see you change
Everything at once the same
But the mountain never moves
Rape me like a child  christened in blood
Painted like an unknown saint
There's nothing left but hope
Your voice is dead and old and always empty
Trust in me through closing years
Perfect moments wait
If only we could stay
Please say the right words
We cry like the stone white clown and stand
Lost forever in a happy crowd
No one lifts their hands  no one lifts their eyes
Justified with empty words
The party just gets better and better

With nothing left but faith

With nothing left but faith  with nothing left but faith
With nothing left but faith  with nothing left but faith

So let's cut the conversation and get out for a bit
Because I feel it all fading and paling  and I'm begging
To drag you down with me to kick the last nail in
Yeah  I like you in that like I like you to scream
But if you open your mouth  then I can't be responsible
For quite what goes in or to care what comes out
So just pull on your hair  just pull on your pout
And let's move to the beat like we know that it's over
If you slip going under  slip over my shoulder
So just pull on your face  just pull on your feet
And let's hit opening time down on Fascination Street
So pull on your hair  pull on your pout
Cut the conversation  just open your mouth
Pull on your face  pull on your feet
And let's hit opening time down on Fascination Street
Down on Fascination Street
Down on Fascination Street
Down on Fascination Street
Catch the dying sun  the night-time follows
Silence and black mirror pool
Mirrors a lonely place where I meet you
See your head in the fading light
And through the dark your eyes shine bright
And burn like fire  burn like fire in Cairo
And burn like fire  burn like fire in Cairo
Shifting crimson veil  silken hips
Slide under my hand  sullen lips
Whisper my name and I yearn
You take me in your arms  start to burn
F-I-R-E I-N C-A-I-R-O
F-I-R-E I-N C-A-I-R-O
F-I-R-E I-N C-A-I-R-O

And Sunday always comes too late
To see your shoes and your spirits rise
Throw out your frown and just smile at the sound
To see you eat in the middle of the night
I don't care if Monday's blue
Tuesday's grey and Wednesday too
Thursday doesn't even start
Wave after wave after wave  it's all for her
I know this can't be wrong  I say
And I'll lie to keep her happy as long as I know that you know
That today I belong right here with you
Right here with you
And so we watch the sun come up from the edge of the deep green sea
And she listens like her head's on fire like she wants to believe in me
So I try  put your hands in the sky
Surrender  remember
We'll be here forever and we'll never say goodbye
I've never been so colourfully see through head before
(I've never been) I've never been so wonderfully me you want some more
Not just for today
Hold me like this for a hundred thousand million days
But suddenly she slows and looks down at my breaking face
Why do you cry? What did I say?
But it's just rain  I smile brushing my tears away
You might also like
I wish I could just stop
I know another moment will break my heart
Too many tears  too many times
Too many years I've cried over you
Over you
Over you
How much more can we use it up?
Drink it dry? Take this drug?
Looking for something forever gone
But something we will always want
I feel you pulling back  I feel you changing shape
And just as I'm breaking free  she hangs herself in front of me
Slips her dress like a flag to the floor
And hands in the sky  surrenders it all
I wish I could just stop
I know another moment will break my heart
Too many tears  too many times
Too many years I've cried for you
It's always the same  wake up in the rain
Head in pain  hung in shame
And miles and miles and miles and miles and miles
 I can't get that high
 the way you burst the clouds
 I can't lick that far
 the way you shout out loud
 I say
 do-do-do-do
 do-do-do-do
 do-do-do-do
 do-do-do-do
 do-do-do-do
 the how you purr
 I know
Just one more and I'll walk away
All the everything you win turns to nothing today
And I forget how to move when my mouth is this dry
And my eyes are bursting hearts in a blood-stained sky
Oh it was sweet  it was wild
Cling to me
So just one more  just one more go
Inspire in me the desire in me to never go home
Ah  just one more and I'll walk away
All the everything you win turns to nothing today
So just one more  just one more go
Inspire in me the desire in me to never go home
To never go home
Do-dum
Remember that day in Paris when we wandered through the rain
And promised to each other that we'd always think the same
And dreamed that dream to be two souls as one
And stopped just as the sun set and waited for the night
Outside a glittering building of glittering glass and burning light
And in the road before us stood a weary  greyish man
Who held a child upon his back  a small boy by the hand
The three of them were dressed in rags and thinner than the air
And all six eyes stared fixedly on you
The father's eyes said Beautiful  how beautiful you are!
The boy's eyes said How beautiful  she shimmers like a star!
The child's eyes uttered nothing but a mute and utter joy
And filled my heart with shame for us at the way we are
At the way we are
I turned to look at you  to read my thoughts upon your face
And gazed so deep into your eyes so beautiful and strange
Until you spoke and showed me understanding is a dream
I hate these people staring  make them go away from me!

The father's eyes said Beautiful  how beautiful you are!
The boy's eyes said How beautiful  she glitters like a star!
The child's eyes uttered nothing but a quiet and utter joy
And stilled my heart with sadness for the way we are
For the way we are
And this is why I hate you  and how I understand
That no one ever knows or loves another
I felt like I could die
Yesterday I got so old
It made me want to cry
And I know I was wrong when I said it was true
That it couldn't be me and be her in between
Without you
Without you
Yesterday I got so scared
I shivered like a child
It froze me deep inside

If you walk in the crowd  you won't leave any trace
It's always the same
You're jumping someone else's train
It won't take you long to learn the new smile
You'll have to adapt or you'll be out of style
It's always the same
You're jumping someone else's train
If you pick up on it quick
You can say you were there
Again and again and again
You're jumping someone else's train
It's the latest wave that you've been craving for
The old ideal was getting such a bore
Now you're back in line
Going not quite as far but in half the time
Everyone's happy  they're finally all the same
'Cause everyone's jumping everybody else's train

The one that makes me scream  she said
The one that makes me laugh  she said
Threw her arms around my neck
Show me how you do it  and I promise you
I promise that I'll run away with you
I'll run away with you
Spinning on that dizzy edge
Kissed her face and kissed her head
Dreamed of all the different ways I had to make her glow
Why are you so far away? she said
Why won't you ever know that I'm in love with you?
That I'm in love with you?
You  soft and only
You  lost and lonely
You  strange as angels
Dancing in the deepest oceans
Twisting in the water
You're just like a dream
You're just like a dream

Daylight licked me into shape
I must have been asleep for days
And moving lips to breathe her name
I opened up my eyes
And found myself alone  alone
Alone above a raging sea
That stole the only girl I loved
And drowned her deep inside of me
You  soft and only
You  lost and lonely
 staring at the sand
 but I hear no sound
 staring at the sun
 it amounts to the same
 smooth in my hand
 staring at the sand
To see how we're ending our last dance together
I really believe that this time it's forever
And the fur and the mouth and the innocence turned
To hair and contentment that hangs in abasement
A woman now standing where once there was only a girl
Walking through walls in the heart of December
But I really believed that this time was forever
But Christmas falls late now  flatter and colder
And never as bright as when we used to fall
All this in an instant before I can kiss you
A woman now standing where once there was only a girl
(Your name like ice into my heart)
I'm so glad you came  I'm so glad you remembered
To see how we're ending our last dance together
I really believe that this time it's forever
But Christmas falls late now  flatter and colder
And never as bright as when we used to fall
And even if we drink  I don't think we will kiss
Doo doo doo doo
Doo doo doo doo
Doo doo doo
Fires outside in the sky look as perfect as cats
But I don't care if you don't
And I don't feel if you don't
And I don't want it if you don't
And I won't say it if you won't say it first

You wonder if it's real because it couldn't be rain
Through the right doorway and into the white room
It used to be the dust that would lay here when I came here alone
But I don't care if you don't

And I don't want it if you don't
And I won't play it if you won't play it first

Let's go to bed
Let's go to bed
You make me feel like I am home again
Whenever I'm alone with you
You make me feel like I am whole again
Whenever I'm alone with you
You make me feel like I am young again
Whenever I'm alone with you
You make me feel like I am fun again
However far away
I will always love you
However long I stay
I will always love you
Whatever words I say
I will always love you
I will always love you

Whatever words I say
I will always love you
Something beginning with S
On candy-stripe legs the spiderman comes
Softly through the shadow of the evening sun
Stealing past the windows of the blissfully dead
Looking for the victim shivering in bed
Searching out fear in the gathering gloom
And suddenly a movement in the corner of the room
And there is nothing I can do when I realise with fright
That the spiderman is having me for dinner tonight
Quietly he laughs and shaking his head
And softer than shadow and quicker than flies
His arms are all around me and his tongue in my eyes
Don't struggle like that or I will only love you more
For it's much too late to get away or turn on the light
The spiderman is having you for dinner tonight
And I feel like I'm being eaten
And I know that in the morning
I will wake up in the shivering cold
And the spiderman is always hungry

Sing me a line from your favourite song
Twist and turn but you're trapped in the light
All the directions were wrong
You'll fall in love with somebody else tonight
Help yourself
But tell me the words before you fade away
You reveal all the secrets to remember the end
And escape someday
You'll fall in love with somebody else again tonight
Take a step
You move in time but it's always back
Ambition in the back of a black car
In a high building there is so much to do
Something small falls out of your mouth and we laugh
A prayer for something better
A prayer for something better
Please love me
Creeping up the stairs in the dark
Waiting for the death blow
Waiting for the death blow
Waiting for the death blow
Stroking your hair as the patriots are shot
Fighting for freedom on the television
Sharing the world with slaughtered pigs
Have we got everything?
She struggles to get away
Pushing her white face into the mirror
Aching inside me and turn me 'round
Just like the old days
Just like the old days
Just like the old days
Just like the old days

Caressing an old man and painting a lifeless face
Just a piece of new meat in a clean room
The soldiers close in under a yellow moon
All shadows and deliverance under a black flag
The ribbon tightens round my throat
I open my mouth and my head bursts open
A sound like a tiger thrashing in the water
Thrashing in the water
One after the other
One after the other
One after the other
One after the other
It feels like a hundred years
A hundred years
A hundred years
A hundred years
I really think I should've gone to bed tonight
But just one drink and there are some people to meet you
Now why don't I just get you another
While you just say hello
Just say hello
And my mouth and the smiles moving up as I stand up
Too close and too wide and the smiles are too bright
And I breathe in too deep and my head's getting light
But the air is getting heavier and it's closer
I'm starting to sway
And the hands all on my shoulders don't have names
And won't go away
So here I go
Here I go again
Falling into strangers and it's only just eleven
I'm staring like a child until someone slips me Heaven
Take it on my knees just like a thousand times before
And I'm just looking at the floor
Just looking at the floor

I'm starting to laugh like an animal in pain
The first shot of retch leaves me gasping for more
I stagger over screaming on my way to the floor
And I'm back on my back
With the lights and the lies in my eyes
And the colour and the music's too loud
And my head's all the wrong size
And I can't seem to think where this is
And the way the rain comes down hard
That's the way I feel inside
This is it like I get when my life's going numb
And all the smiles that I wear and all the games that I play
And all the drinks that I mix and I drink until I'm sick
And all the faces I make and all the shapes that I throw
And all the people I meet and all the words that I know
And the rain comes down hard
That's how I feel inside
And the rain comes down hard
That's how I feel inside
And the rain comes down hard
That I almost believe that they're real
I've been living so long with my pictures of you
That I almost believe that the pictures are all I can feel
Remembering you standing quiet in the rain
As I ran to your heart to be near
How I always held close in your fear
Remembering you running soft through the night
You were bigger and brighter and wider than snow
And you finally found all your courage to let it all go
Remembering you fallen into my arms
Crying for the death of your heart
You were always so lost in the dark

Hold for the last time then slip away quietly
If only I'd thought of the right words
I could have held on to your heart
If only I'd thought of the right words
I wouldn't be breaking apart
All my pictures of you
Looking so long at these pictures of you
But I never hold on to your heart
Looking so long for the words to be true
And always just breaking apart
My pictures of you
There was nothing in the world
That I ever wanted more
Than to feel you deep in my heart
There was nothing in the world
That I ever wanted more
Than to never feel the breaking apart
“And the wind is blowing like it's the end of the world ” you said
“And it's so cold  it's like the cold if you were dead”
And then you smiled for a second
“I think I'm old  and I'm feeling pain ” you said
“And it's all running out like it's the end of the world ” you said
“It's so cold  it's like the cold if you were dead”
And then you smiled for a second
Sometimes you make me feel
Like I'm living at the edge of the world
Like I'm living at the edge of the world
“It's just the way I smile ” you said
It's just the way I feel that matters
It's not a case of share and share alike
I take what I require
You expect me to act like a lover
Consider my moves and deserve the reward
And wait for something to happen
It's not a case of telling the truth
Some lines just fit the situation
It's not a case of aiming to please
You know you're always crying
Yeah  a green sedan. No  the licence plates were covered with mud. They took tyres and gas. (Tell him they took all the cash.) They robbed the cash register too. I got word that the police had them bottled up... but they slipped through again. (I wonder if the baby is born yet.) Poor Joan. They're being blamed for every crime committed in the country
A hand in my mouth  a life spills into the flowers
We all look so perfect as we all fall down
In an electric glare  the old man cracks with age
She found his last picture in the ashes of the fire
An image of the queen echoes round the sweating bed
Sour yellow sounds inside my head
In books and films and in life and in heaven
The sound of slaughter as your body turns
But it's too late
But it's too late
One more day like today and I'll kill you
A desire for flesh and real blood
And I'll watch you drown in the shower
Pushing my life through your open eyes
You might also like
I must fight this sickness
Find a cure
A hold on me so dull it kills
You stifle me  infectious sense
Of hopelessness and prayers for rain
I suffocate  I breathe in dirt
And nowhere shines but desolate and drab
The hours all spent on killing time again
All waiting for the rain
You fracture me  your hands on me
A touch so plain  so stale it kills
You strangle me  entangle me
In hopelessness and prayers for rain
I deteriorate  I live in dirt
And nowhere glows but drearily and tired
The hours all spent on killing time again
All waiting for the rain
You fracture me  your hands on me
A touch so plain  so stale it kills
You strangle me  entangle me
In hopelessness and prayers for rain

 the world disappeared
 is it always like this?
 the first kiss
 Siamese twins
 it falls apart
 slowly up the stairs
 is it always like this?
 in the morning I cried
 you won't remember my voice
 we never smile
 you're nothing
 we all die
 is it always like this?
Six different ways inside my heart
And every one I'll keep tonight
Six different ways go deep inside
I'll tell them anything at all
I know I'll give them more and more
I'll tell them anything at all
I know I'll give the world and more
They think I'm on my hands and head
This time they're much too slow
Six sides to every lie I say
It's that American voice again
It was never quite like this before
Not one of you is the same
Doo doo doo doo
This is stranger than I ever thought
Six different ways inside my heart
And every one I'll keep tonight

It was never quite like this before
And sleeping less every night
As the days become heavier and weighted
Waiting in the cold light
A noise  a scream tears my clothes as the figurines tighten
With spiders inside them
And dust on the lips of a vision of hell
I laughed in the mirror for the first time in a year
A hundred other words blind me with your purity
Like an old painted doll in the throes of dance
I think about tomorrow  please let me sleep
As I slip down the window  freshly squashed fly
You mean nothing
You mean nothing
I can lose myself in Chinese art and American girls
Run into the night  I will lose myself tomorrow
Crimson pain  my heart explodes
My memory in a fire  and someone will listen
At least for a short while

I will never be clean again
I touched her eyes  pressed my stained face
I will never be clean again
Touched her eyes  pressed my stained face
I will never be clean again
I will never be clean again
Shapeless in the dark again
(In the hanging garden)
(In the hanging garden)
Catching halos on the moon
Gives my hands the shapes of angels
In the heat of the night walking into a dream
Cover my face as the animals cry
(In the hanging garden)

We couldn't get closer than this
We slip through the streets while everyone sleeps
Getting bigger and sleeker and wider and brighter
We bite and scratch and scream all night
Let's go and throw all the songs we know
All the years and no one heard
We missed you hissed the love cats
We missed you hissed the love cats
We should have each other with cream
Then curl up in the fire and sleep for awhile

We missed you hissed the love cats

How could we miss
Can't you see I try?
Swimming the same deep water as you is hard
The shallow drowned lose less than we  you breathe
The strangest twist upon your lips
And we shall be together
We shall be together
And face pushed deep  reflections meet
The strangest twist upon your lips
And disappear  the ripples clear
And laughing  break against your feet
And laughing  break the mirror sweet
So we shall be together
So we shall be together
Kiss me goodbye  pushing out before I sleep
It's lower now  and slower now
The strangest twist upon your lips
But I don't see  and I don't feel
But tightly hold up silently
My hands  before my fading eyes
And in my eyes your smile
The very last thing before I go
The very last thing before I go
The very last thing before I go

When the sun would fill the sky
Remember how we used to feel
Those days would never end

Remember how it used to be
When the stars would fill the sky
Remember how we used to dream
Those nights would never end
Those nights would never end
It was the sweetness of your skin
It was the hope of all we might have been
That filled me with the hope to wish impossible things
To wish impossible things
To wish impossible things
But now the sun shines cold
And all the sky is grey
The stars are dimmed by clouds and tears

Down on my knees and my hands in the air again
Pushing my face in the memory of you again
But I never know if it's real
Never know how I wanted to feel
Never quite said what I wanted to say to you
Never quite managed the words to explain to you
Never quite knew how to make them believable
And now the time has gone
Another time undone
Never quite said what I wanted to say to you
Never quite managed the words to explain to you
Never quite knew how to make them believable
And now the time has gone
Another time undone
Hopelessly fighting the devil futility
Feeling the monster climb deeper inside of me
Feeling him gnawing my heart away hungrily
I'll never lose this pain
I'll kiss you from your feet to where your head begins
Everything you do is irresistible
Everything you do is simply kissable
Why can't I be you?
I'll run around in circles until I run out of breath
I'll eat you all up or I'll just hug you to death
Everything you do is simply delicate
Everything you do is quite angelicate
Why can't I be you?
Why can't I be you?
You turn my head when you turn around
You turn the whole world upside down

Everything you do is simply dreamy
