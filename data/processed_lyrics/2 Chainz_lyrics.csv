"M-M-M-Murda
Yeah  yeah
Damn right  bro
4 AM  I'm just gettin' started
For my birthday I threw me a surprise party
Reminiscin' 'bout the trap  playin' the first Carter
My life changed when I had my first daughter
Got my first quarter flippin' 50 dollar slabs
Your nigga's lookin' at the bills  askin' you for half
Cut from a different cloth  take pride in results
Anytime she wanna dip I'm providin' the sauce
You on side of the boss  so you kind of the boss
You keep playin' with me  I end up signing your boss
Drop an EP on a nigga for the free-free on a nigga
Yeah you ZZ on a nigga  king like BB on you niggas
Rock with Champagne P
If it wasn't for the struggle then I wouldn't be me
Call me Deuce or Dos  anything but broke
Got my aim from the scope  got the game by the throat  damn!
Okay  you popped up on me by surprise (Yeah  yeah)
You see I never took you for the poppin' type (Straight up)
Damn  it's 4 AM so please believe the hype (It's lit)
Hit the lights (Yeah)  I'm way over top
Pop it  flick it
Drop a pin  send a location (Skrrt  skrrt)
I'ma pull up in that bullet-coupe spaceship (Skrrt  skrrt)
Drop off a bag of some dangerous (Yeah)
I'ma hit you  4 AM  see if you make it (Yeah)

I dropped ColleGrove out the sky  ooh
In a group with the best rapper that's alive  ooh
Never turn my back on my slime  ooh
I ain't wanna fuck the bitch but she was fine  ooh
Hold up baby  let me take my time  ooh
Hard to get some head and try to drive  ooh
Jumpin' out the cake and that's surprisin'  ooh
Pickin' up the duffel bag like exercisin'  ooh
Bought mama new house 'cause she deserve it  ooh
Practice makes perfect but nobody's perfect  ooh
Escobar is not open for service  ooh
Send you to Dr. Miami for your surgery  ooh
Okay  you popped up on me by surprise (Yeah  yeah)
You see I never took you for the poppin' type (Straight up)
Damn  it's 4 AM so please believe the hype (It's lit)
Hit the lights (Yeah)  I'm way over top
Pop it  flick it
Drop a pin  send a location (Skrrt  skrrt)
I'ma pull up in that bullet-coupe spaceship (Skrrt  skrrt)
Drop off a bag of some dangerous (Yeah)
I'ma hit you  4 AM  see if you make it (Yeah)
Ooh  Riccardo Tisci on the crewneck
Ooh  on a killin' rapper spree and nigga  you next
Ooh  I used to trap and watch bootlegs
Ooh  I'm on my wave like a durag
Ooh  I see your boo  now where your crew at?
Ooh  talkin' tequila for the pipe-up
Ooh  I hope you got a clean vagina  yeah
Drench god  drench god  really
Tec got the Rollie  now I get it
I used to sell drugs for a living
Got me a job sellin' records
Had to use my jeweler for a reference
Might buy a charm with the extras
Might use her legs for a necklace
Okay  you popped up on me by surprise (Yeah  yeah)
You see I never took you for the poppin' type (Straight up)
Damn  it's 4 AM so please believe the hype (It's lit)
Hit the lights (Yeah)  I'm way over top
Pop it  flick it
Drop a pin  send a location (Skrrt  skrrt)
I'ma pull up in that bullet-coupe spaceship (Skrrt  skrrt)
Drop off a bag of some dangerous (Yeah)

Blue cheese in my Off Whites

Got your bitch out her DM  put her on a flight
I don't understand nothin' but them dollar signs
My side chick got pregnant by her main dude and I'm offended
I'm in all black like a ninja  chain got influenza
Walk in the traphouse  use my Cartiers for credentials (God damn!)
I'm going wildebeest  all on my enemies
Negative energy  I could do anything  I got the guillotine
Off with they head
Known to pull off and get head
Drippin so much sauce on your bitch look like she wettin' the bed
I could do more than just say it  strip club veteran head uh uh!
I am still gettin' this bread  bought her a Birkin bag uh uh!
Everyone look at the tag  I do the digital dash uh uh!
I can do more than just brag  I can back it up UH UH!
50 000 on me  I'm a walkin' lick
She fuck with the squad  she gon' grip the stick

Get on top  she act a dog with it
I'm on this drink need to slow down
Racks in back it won't slow down
You had a sack but it's gone now
Safari diamond  money long now
Better wake up  smell the coffee
Black man with a lot of money  got the white man wanna off me
You was my mans but you lost me
Poppin xans  I'm exhausted
Cookie smellin like a mosh pit
Pop a perk  kinda nauseous
50 pointer  shit colossus
Hey  With this money I could stay up and survive
We go live  smoke this dope and ride
We too fly  bad bitches in the archive
Oh so high  money make me so high
50 000 on me  I'm a walkin' lick

I'm havin blue cheese
And I'ma get it by any means
Flexing on niggas like Hercules
Fucking on bitches with double D's
I met the plug  got 100 keys
Give me that block and I gotta seize
These niggas sick of me  wanna get rid of me
I'm at the top and they under me
I hit the lot and don't ask for the tag
Racks in my pockets  they lookin like kneepads
Flex in my Off Whites with Benjamin Franklin
Put the rest of that blue cheese in the bag
My life I'm livin it fast
One thing I cannot do is go out sad
They know me but don't know my past
And if you know me you know I'm about my cash
The Nawfside  call it Baghdad  make a nigga 40 yard dash
The Nawfside  where the bags at  I was breakin my wrist in the glass (Whippin it!)
Smoking on Barry Bonds in the Huracan  spinning work like I'm Taz
Migos and Chainz in the city  go to your girl car
Had to bring out that bag
50 000 on me  I'm a walkin' lick
She fuck with the squad  she gon' grip the stick
Came from the rags to riches  now we got bags and bitches

Boy  my uncle 12 shawty
I had to take my uncle to school this morning shawty
And he got suspended
Caught up in my bullshit  put your head on backwards
And skate off after  engage in laughter 'bout what just happened
Fingers in napkins get sent to mammies  is that too graphic?
Catch you in traffic  you sitting Daffy like stealing candy
All of us bastards  our mothers queens and our women dancers
I bit some matches then sipped some gas and went kiss a dragon
What’s really happnin’? Verbal attackin’  I’m showing passion
Know what I mean  see I’m the king like I’m from Akron
I’m going overboard  somebody call the captain
And when it come to getting checks  I always want the fat ones
I’m so high I can sing to a chandelier
My flow a glass of Ace of Spade and yours a can of beer
My weed sticky like acupuncture and magnets  honey
Knock on the side door three times and have your money
Or get to steppin' like Kappas stompin'  I'll slap a junkie
I’m having lunch with Italian Sonny  don’t ask the subject
It’s gon' be trouble  we come through and catch you while you cuddle
Them shotgun barrels like tunnels nigga  don't even mumble

I’m back to ballin'  I'm in the back full of magnums only
Pull on the scene and I fuck your queen playing Pastor Troy
Our weed ready  turkey spaghetti and caster oil
That's codeine  turn your guillotine to a fashion show
In four minutes I'll turn this into forensics
In a foreign car with a foreign broad that’s long winded
Paper long and you taking long  you just don't get it
Hung the phone up on Satan  told me he want a song with me
Hotter than Mississippi in summer of 1950s
In a van full of some niggas and white bitches
I can make it bounce by myself
I can make it bounce by myself
I can make it bounce by myself
I can make it bounce by myself
I can make it bounce by myself
I can make it bounce by myself
I can make it bounce by myself
I can make it bounce by myself
So high dancing with the stars to the Star Spangled Banner
I bang your madam  she get on top and I shake the ladder
I make her straddle then gather and calculate the data
I listen up for the snakes or the baby rattle
I’m on the chronic all day like it’s my favorite album
If I don’t get the car first  I’ll have a temper tantrum
I don’t care if you owe me a nick  nigga you need to pay me
I kiss ya lady  eat her pussy then kiss the baby
Get situated  get keys off table then leave her 80
Won’t wrestle niggas  I spatula all you action figures
I’m so high the blunt feel like a dumbbell
These niggas tiny like a spider on a Spud Webb
I got some upscale cocaine on my thumbnail
I feed it to my fun girls  they say fuck yeah
I’m doing this shit like whatever
When I go I’mma leave for the better
I told her you dig like a shovel
I want a Ferrari in yellow
Just so I can match all my yellow bitches
I been a playa since elementary
I got more bars than a penitentiary
I got a clip that hang several inches
I can make it bounce by myself
I can make it bounce by myself
I can make it bounce by myself
I can make it bounce by myself
I can make it bounce by myself
I can make it bounce by myself
I can make it bounce by myself

Former Posturepedic I was slept on
So many chains on it look like my neck gone

Before canned goods it was Similac
