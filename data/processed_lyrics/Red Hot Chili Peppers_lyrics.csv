"I like pleasure spiked with pain
And music is my aeroplane
It's my aeroplane
Songbird sweet and sour Jane
And music is my aeroplane
It's my aeroplane
Pleasure spiked with pain
That motherfucker's always spiked with pain
I can't find the love I want
Someone better slap me
Before I start to rust
Before I start to decompose
Looking in my rear-view mirror
Looking in my rear-view mirror
I can make it disappear

I like pleasure spiked with pain
And music is my aeroplane
It's my aeroplane
Songbird sweet and sour Jane
And music is my aeroplane
It's my aeroplane
Pleasure spiked with pain
That motherfucker's always spiked with pain
I'm turning into dust again
My melancholy baby
The star of Mazzy must
Push her voice inside of me
I'm overcoming gravity
I'm overcoming gravity
It's easy when you're sad to be
I like pleasure spiked with pain
And music is my aeroplane
It's my aeroplane
Songbird sweet and sour Jane
And music is my aeroplane
It's my aeroplane
Pleasure spiked with pain
Just one note could make me float
Could make me float away
One note from the song she wrote
Could fuck me where I lay
Just one note could make me choke
Just one note could cut my throat
One note could make me die
I like pleasure spiked with pain
And music is my aeroplane
It's my aeroplane
Songbird sweet and sour Jane
And music is my aeroplane
It's my aeroplane
Pleasure spiked with pain
(It's my aeroplane)
(It's my aeroplane)
(It's my aeroplane)
(It's my aeroplane)
It's my aeroplane
It's my aeroplane
It's my aeroplane
It's my aeroplane

 we could make time
 but I must warn ya
 I know for sure
 I know it's you
 back from Bombay
 pie in your face
 it's a lake she's kissin' me
 I know for sure
 I know it's you
 I saw God and I saw the fountains
 I feel dutiful
 I know for sure
 I know it's you
 I know it's you
Cremation takes its piece of your supply
The night is dressed like noon  a sailor spoke too soon
And China's on the dark side of the moon
(Hit me now)
Platypus are a few  the secret life of Roo
A personality I never knew (Get it on)
My Greta weighs a ton  the archers on the run
And no one stands alone behind the sun
It's been a long time since I made a new friend
Waitin' on anothеr black summer to end
It's been a long time and you nеver know when
Waitin' on another black summer to end
Crack the flaming whip  a-sailin' on a censorship
Riding on a headless horse to make the trip
Been a long time since I made a new friend
Waitin' on another black summer to end
It's been a long time and you never know when
Waitin' on another black summer to end

How many pieces do you wish
Step into a heaven where I keep it on the soul side
Every woman has a piece of Aphrodite
Copulate to create a state of sexual light
Glorious euphoria is my must
Erotic shock is a function of lust

Fill a space in which two bodies float

She took the short cut to being fully grown
She's got that mood ring  a little sister rose
The smell of Springsteen  a pair of pantyhose
This talking picture show is leaking from a silhouette
Your hustle's busted when you can't afford a cigarette
The last I heard from you  you were screaming “Handle it!”
Knock the world  right off its feet and straight onto its head
The book of love will long be laughing after you are dead
Fascinated by the look of you and what was said
Make a play for all the brightest minds  and light will shed
I heard some P-Funk out on the road again
To get your head shrunk  is what I recommend
It's in your bloodline  a perfect Frankenstein
Out on that lone pine  I'm going to make you mine
It's understood  you wrapped your voodoo right around my neck
You've got some glitter on your kitty at the discotheque
I put my loving in your oven not a head to check

Good God no  that would be treason
Believe me  Eve  she gave good reason
Booty looking too good not to be squeezin'
Creamy beaver hotter than a fever
I'm a givin' cause she's the receiver

She said get out and spread your legs
And then she tried to cop a feel
That cop she was all dressed in blue
Was she pretty? Boy I'm tellin' you
She stuck my butt with her big black stick
I said What's up? Now suck my dick
Like a ram getting ready to jam the lamb
She whimpered just a little when she felt my hand
On her crotch  so very warm
I could feel her getting wet through her uniform
Proppin' her up on the black and white
Unzipped and slipped  Ooh  that's tight
I swatted her like no swat team can
Turned a cherry pie right into jam

Hello young woman that I love
Pretty punk rock mamma that I'm thinking of
Hold me naked if you will
In your arms  in your legs  in your pussy  I'd kill
To be with you  to kiss with you  I do miss you
I love you
Lay me down  lay me down  lay me down  lay me down
Lay me down  lay me down  lay me down  lay me down
Descending waves of graceful pleasure
For your love  there is no measure
Her curves they bend with subtle splendor
Now I lay me down to sleep
I pray the funk will make me freak
If I should die before I waked
Allow me Lord to rock out naked
Bored by the ordinary time to take a trip
Calling up a little girl with a bull whip
Lickety split go snap snap
Girl gettin' off all in my lap
The tallest tree the sweetest sap
Blowin' my ass right off the map
Ooh and it's nice out here
I think I'll stay for a while
Waking up dead  inside of my head
Would never  never do  there is no med
No medicine to take
I've had a chance to be insane
Asylum from the falling rain
I've had a chance to break
It’s so bad  it’s got to be good
Mysterious girl misunderstood
Dressed like a wedding cake
Any other day and I might play
A funeral march for Bonnie Brae
Why try and run away?

Looks like it's on today
