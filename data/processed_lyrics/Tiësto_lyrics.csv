lyrics
"Sèist: Ò hì shiùbhlainn leat
Hì ri bhò hò ru bhì
Hì ri bhò hò rinn o ho
Translation
How sorrowful I am
Early in the morning rising
Hì ri bhò hò ru bhì
Hì ri bhò hò rinn o ho
And your heartache is a tidal wave
When euphoria's a hit and run
And you're drowning in a heatless sun
So let's wash away the night
Into a neon sea of lights
Away we'll drive
Into a town called paradise
Into a town called paradise
When you're buried in the world's eclipse
And there's nobody to help you left
When you're running out of dreams to catch
And every morning is an hourglass

When your sanity's a hurricane
A hurricane
Pull me under
So let's wash away the night

You have a light  let it shine once again

 many mountains we have climbed
 calling the wind to save me

And let you see where greed leads to
And you need to
Inspire the love inside your people
No more hellfires and please no more gunfire

And what we're building will persevere long
After the wicked men disappear
And the and the youth we have will start this year

You must look in the mirror
And make sense of what you can see

Is the first step
That you take when you want to be real
And flying on planes to exotic locations

That you are who you are
And nothing can change that belief

There’s no rehearsal and our stage is an open book
So let go even when it kills you
Breakout from everything that built you
Set yourself free
And let the light through
Set yourself free
From what’ll blind you
Set yourself free
Let every breath you lose
Uncover you
Set yourself free
From what arrests you
Set yourself free
Let every breath you lose
Let every breath you lose
Uncover you
Indecision is the heart’s worst enemy
The tunnel vision to a true identity
It’s a land mine that everyone’s afraid to land
To land

The big bang made the foundations for the first atoms
The foundation of the world
Our world went on to develop gradually in the years that followed
It progressed from the evolution of organisms
To the evolution of life and indeed human kind
As the human race developed
And of course a wide range of technology
These developments succeeded each other
At an even faster pace year after year
Technology began to evolve more aggressively
This evolution has created a world in which people
Are growing apart rather than coming together
This path does not lead us to the true meaning of our existence
So we have to traverse the force
And make our way back to the essence of life

Would you love me till it hurts?
