" damn
 tell me
 that's your type
 oh
 shine for you
 we just actin' like it
 it's somethin' new
 holla at me oh
 we just actin' like it
 it's somethin' new
 holla at me
 I think I got it
 we just actin' like it
 it's somethin' new
 holla at me oh
 we just actin' like it
 it's somethin' new
 holla at me
 I think I got it
And y'all go through way more arguments than we did
Y’all go through way more arguments than needed
You better give him the same fuckin' treatment
I know it's just the intro and this shit get deep but
I’ve got my reasons
My stresses turned you to the person for somebody else
I made you worth it for somebody else
I endured all of your flaws 'til I broke through all the walls of your guard
Now you're perfect for somebody else
She’s out with a guy who push a pretty penny
There goes my ego
This shit is weak though
My shit is Shaq at the free-throw
Tryna get you back with all these cheap hoes
And you don't even peep though
I let you take ’til there was nothing left of me
I seen it all 'til there was nothing left to see
You wasn’t there when I was selling CDs
I stopped wearin' Chrome Hearts and AMIRI jeans
Gettin' too much money and it's bustin' out the seams
I only slept on you because you started sellin' dreams

She been fuckin' rich niggas since nineteen (Since nineteen)
Seems like money's got you doing anything
Fuck me good and then you tellin' me all kinda things
It's like money's got you doing different type of things
It hurts to know that that's some different shit I taught you
You left me for someone that was icy
And she knows them other guys in the double-R ain't like us
They ain't doing it like us
Movie is playin' and they ain't queuing it like us
You went and found yourself another option
Sip until I get depressed in this bitch
Then I'ma call you right up on the flip
Fifty reasons why your nigga ain't shit
Fuck them niggas if I'm not at the top
DM your nigga and blow up your spot
Fuck up the relationship that you've got
Fucked it up and now I'm calling you mine
There's no real intention of making you mine
I just don't wanna see you with no one else
Like I'm the only one allowed to move on
(I told you)
Took advantage of the fact you got to
You-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
You-ooh-ooh-ooh
Why don't you return my calls?
But you don't come and see me
Got it on smash
Alright cool
OG Parker
Jumped in the 'What-the-fuck-is-that'
Took a shot of Henny out the back
Girl you know it's real  I ain't tryna brag
I just wanna take you to the back while you let a nigga
Bust it  down  oh yeah
Wait  in the trap with the top and the cash  ayy
I won't tolerate a bitch talkin' back  ayy
'Less she lookin' at me  throwin' that shit back  ayy
20 motherfuckin' racks on a bad day
Jumped in the 'What-the-fuck-is-that'
Drunk and it ain't no comin' back
Pussy nigga don't get hit up with the .30
Sendin' bullets lookin' all across the map  ayy
T.O niggas don't know how to act

Jumped in the 'What-the-fuck-is-that'

Bought her Uber here but I didn't buy it back
Fuck a 'lac  all of this is facts

2006  these niggas hated
But I told them I would make it from the bottom
Looked at it like this
I-I-I gotta stack it and flip
Yeah  this my Fargo shit man
I go  I go missin' for a month and this is what you do
Before the old school  before the Maybach
Whoever came back
And put the  Maple Leaf on the Jays hat
I was on court chillin' with my niggas
On the corner fuckin' with the felons
Wishin' for the Honda Civic
Pacin'  smokin' outta staircases in the ceilin'
Dawg  I just want a new job
Want my old girl to get a boob job
Want my new girl to get a new job
Two Glocks strapped all up on my waist
For any nigga trippin' around my way
Mini Mac  strapped for haters in the back
In this mini black JanSport backpack
Rollin' blunts with my nigga Rocky
I remember nights  uh
Livin' check to check to check to check
Fuckin' hoes neck to neck to neck to neck to neck to neck to neck to neck  wait

Wasn't workin' night to night to day for it
Had to wait for it  had to spend a couple extra days for it
Couple bitches that go hand in head
Hoe and hoe and hoe and hoe and hoe
I heard so-and-so is in your new car
Two friends for my two dawgs
See I love a bitch that got a few flaws
Show my old bitches to my new broads
I got old bitches  I got new hoes
Bentley whip  Ferrari doors
I'm Ari Gold in Entourage
I'm fuckin' hoes that's on your squad  uh
Fargo  call me Argentina
Hate to be the reason
Why your dream bitches never get to see ya
Hell yeah  niggas jealous of us
Got an elevator in my Hella Yela
Women love me like I'm on the Ellen show
Hella bars for my felon flow
Niggas hella hard hearin' blind to 'em
Gotta hit 'em with that Helen Keller flow
I fucked a lot of bitches  Lord forgive me
Father God  know I did a lot of sinnin'
Now  I'm watchin' every one of my decisions
'Cause I know the fact that even though I’m livin’
Nigga livin’ under 'only God conditions'
So in my position
Gotta mob on the competition
Gotta squab on the opposition
Audemaur got me fuckin’ every damn bitch in there like
Subtractin’ all you weak hoes
I  I don't be stressin' these hoes
I just pour liquor for niggas  that's it
I do not fuck with you though
You shitted on me
And I can't wait to blow on you
I can't wait to blow on you
I can't wait to blow

Ayy  fuck that bitch  my face wasn't in it
Damn  bitch do scams on bitty
Bands in my hands look pretty
Hit another band on the 'gram  I'm litty
Homie  I don't dance  I jiggy
Weed is so strong  I feel like I'm Popeye off the spinach
I cut the corner and bend it
Bitch  I'm a menace like Dennis
Don't sell me pussy  I need a percentage
If you gon' fuck me  this shit is expensive

For all of the times when I was a mess
And you tried to flex on me too

Money on me lookin' like it went and got a facelift
You still in my kitchen  arguin' about the same shit
Who and what and why and why I don't call you my main bitch
Everything is changin'
Friends turn to strangers  friends turn to dangers
Friends ain't your friends if they givin' ultimatums
I done been through all these stages
You just act so different now  ain't nothin' that amazes
Me when you be trippin'  how you speak when you be trippin'
Got me through when all these niggas hated
You started takin' me too serious and that's when all this desolated (Damn)
You yourself don't even know the full story
Why you lettin' people escalate it?
And I know you got them people in yo' ear
But we both know the situation  niggas hate it
Fuck all that for now  we'll talk about it when it's time
It feel like my lil' baby been confiscated
Taken away from me  I was makin' a way for us
We was trippin' off them couples  tryna do it how they do it
We was up and she was up and I was up  we PJ flew it
It was fluent  had us movin' like it's water to the fluid
Out of mind and out of sight  I been gettin' right
I slid with the crodies  I been on the flight
Nine bands in my pocket  .19 on my right
I been outta pocket  I had to get right
Lord  please give me patience when I see them lie
I hope one day me and you see eye to eye
I hope one day me and you see eye to—

We both know what happened (We)
What happened to passion
Doin' the most and you know that it's takin' me back in
Hidin' emotions and stories  but you know it don't work
A couple things won't ever change
The common propaganda around my name is never strange
But when does it get strange?
When you start lyin' to your best friend 'bout us doin' things
And hopin' she ain't entertain?
Or is it strange when the lovin' come with secrets and the games?
When the world unveil your curtains and all they laughin' at's your pain
But does it change when we both reveal that both our mothers died?
And we still dealin' with some pain and need someone to entertain
Or does it change when you break down in my arms and start cryin'?
And feelin' like you alone and I tell you  Everything's okay
And I know I ain't runnin' game  even Munchie know my aims
But will you ever know my name and not just Tory from this fame?
Will we ever talk about this? Will we ever console again?
Or will we keep on actin' like I put you in danger and some pain?
And when you hop back in the car with me  you knew everything was safe
Pshht  please don't let these niggas make you change
We both know what happened that night and what I did
But it ain't what they sayin'
But when the feeling's change  the pain start oozin' from the heart
And start cruisin' through the vein
Start leakin' out your mouth when you hop on the live and talk live
It's oozin' through your brain  listen
We watched them animes  still granted from my player phase
Potentials of bein' Bey and Jay  just watchin' for my fan base
I'm just tryna get back to the days when you would hop back on the jet
Land in Miami for a span of days and stay with me
Or back when I would do the same  Atlanta plane from A to Z
And pull up in your driveway in the AMG
When 4oe would run up out the door and you would come outside  lookin' gracefully
And I'd step out the car and see your two arms embracin' me
We both playin' games with money  powers and fames
But just tell me how it changed  have your feelings rearranged?
Or deep down  are they the same? 'Cause I just wanna reconcile with ya
After Kellen do your hair  you send a wild picture
Then you callin' me to come step out with ya
Type of shit I like to do  type of ways I like to move
Tonight I'm goin' hard for ya
Fargo
I wanna get them draws from ya
Speedin' from the law for ya
We fuck like friends with benefits
I wanna get them draws from ya
Tonight I'm goin' hard for ya

I can't just let you go

Wish I could just rewind
While I was gone you left
Gone away for good
Least you could've done was let me know
Guess I misunderstood
This time I waited too long
This time the feeling's too strong
Anticipated too long
There's only one thing I want

All my niggas was plugs  all my bitches was dubs
Left me out when I was tryna make it did what it does
Can't forget about the drought when they put six in my plug
Only thing I gotta do is get my mom out the mud
Only thing I gotta do is get it poppin' and blow it
Only thing I gotta do is hit my wrist with the soda
Niggas thought it was over  but bitch I live by the slogan
I told you
Hop in another one  nigga
Get back in another one  nigga
Hop in another one  nigga
We back with another one  nigga
I told  I told you all

I told  I told you all (Fargo)
I know  I know
It's a 70/30 chance I won't fuck with you niggas
It's a 70/30 chance I might fuck up them digits
In the bottom where them niggas they ain't fuck with you  nigga
Now you're up and they feel like they should be up with you  nigga
I remember nights when I was starving and hungry and ballin' and bummy
And busted cause my car wasn't running and woah
Doggy  all I want is a onion
The game it was callin' me audibly like someone confronted  but no
Niggas never gave a nigga nothing
Fuck I look like giving niggas something?
Made 100K this week  that's on my dead mama
Spend a 117 and I ain't even know it
Dawg I swear my coldest nights it wasn't even snowing
Mama told me since a youngin' I would be a soldier
I played the watch out on the block you used to see me scopin'
Respect the shooters that said Youngin' go  we about to blow this
Hop in another one  nigga
Then hop out another one  nigga
Hop in another one  nigga
We back with another one  nigga
I told  I told you all
I know I'ma get mine
I told  I told you all
I know  I know
It's the year 2009 and I done found myself a crib
I ain't got no dough  but I done found myself a bitch
Dollars and success is what my niggas tryna get
Young as fuck but fake ID gon' get me in the VIP
I done said fuck school  fuck the teachers and the public
I'd rather count this money with the thuggers and the junkies
The teachers used to tell me Boy you ain't gon' 'mount to nothin'
The only love I felt was from the dealers and the hustlers
We gon' do the most  so tell them niggas GABOS
Seen my nigga Harvey  he went and copped him a Ghost
Through the windshield  the centerfold on the door
Ten below on you hoes  getting dough on you folks
Getting dough on these fours  gettin' money it show
These checks are looking silly  I'm gettin' funny on hoes
Funny how I'm stuntin' in somethin' flooded in stones
Put them hunnids on hold  put them runners on go

Grills in my mouth and I fucked her with Bathing Ape on
Holla at a real nigga shawty 'cause I know you need somebody

Singing ass nigga not the one to leave your hoe around

Word to my niggas in Heaven I'm 'bout to send em away

Tryna ask this pussy ass nigga who the fuck want smoke
But the lightskin niggas in ya crew too spooked to join in
I'm 'bout kill da man and da man that done backed these niggas
And blam any man that'll try to dap you niggas
And clap any stan fan that attract you niggas
See ya daddy was a musician that never made  it
'Cause when you was born nigga it was you or him
Shattered knowing he would never make it as an artist

All I got is a failed music career and
My revenge is giving that shit to my son
Nigga I'ma flossy nigga
They try to toss me nigga

Be smart like a Harvard nigga don't start with niggas
And he got a problem with us
This is my son
Hates to face it
Here's what he's thinking right now
Tory Lanez coming back what am I gonna do this time?
They ain't like none of my diss lines

But this time they ain’t really letting me get by
Fuck I'm finna do with this shit now?
Damn I know this nigga finna be wild
Knowin' this nigga bout to kill me on it OD now
Don't nobody ever wanna book me for a show
I ain't got no songs when I go I spit freestyles
Try to make songs 'bout depression
But nobody ever get it
So I take it out on popping niggas beats now
I ain't never ever trapped
I ain't never slung a gat
I know something wrong with him
I got a hundred bunch o' bullets 'bout to put 'em all in him
Nigga walked in with a hundred rounds in him
And he's seen a nigga chicken I was comin' down in it
Glock nine nigga gotta run around with it
Backpack niggas ain't sellin' no records
Better dumb it down with it when you come around with it

It's so appealing  the feeling of killing a nigga that pose
Get Milli Vanillied with those
Turn a beef plate to a cheesesteak
Bitch  I be really in Philly with those
Neck rocky as a blizzard  a nigga flex gotten bigger
My wrist is so chilly  it froze
Really I'm colder than ever  my niggas goin' for whatever
Niggas gripped up  fifth tucked in the snow storm or the weather
Sandstorm or the desert  hands drawn on a Dessy
Leave his whole body bloody

See  the charm on already
'Cause all of our mans gone-gone already

Is he really that bad that I gotta hit him with a bigger gat?
Matter fact  riddle me that
I'm literally at the spot that he said he'd be at  but where is he at?
Like  really nigga? Is you really tellin' me that?
Like I ain't prepared to hit him with a felony act?
Have a nigga lookin' like he tryna fight in Smash Bros
When a nigga put a whole shell in his back
Fuck niggas yelling it back
Niggas get high and start hating on a real nigga
It's like a nigga smokin' on a jealousy pack
I got the remedy  I got the shooters with hidden identities
Fuck who you send at me
I got a stack on me long as a ruler and centipede
I got the Genovese  I got the energy
I go to business
I'm asking these niggas for 60 percent of the entity
No one defending me
Niggas is talking  but no one offending me
Niggas know what the result of the end'll be
Niggas won't know how to find where they men'll be
I'm a way different nigga on Hennessy

Guard where your head and ya chest'll be

I used to paint pictures on how we could gain riches together
Instead of listen  she kinda just blew me off
Paid it no mind but it kind of just threw me off
I guess I figured everybody want riches and of course
But she just wanted a better family because her parents divorced
Early  her papa  he was taken by the force
Mother on crack and she never had time to bathe her
'Stead she gave her to her uncle  her brother who played the savior
'Til the day he started datin' this chick
That had put him up on mad pills and fuckin' up mad bills
She told me that one night he had got so fucked up
He fell asleep on his sofa  then woke up a new persona
And walked inside of her room and told her remove her clothing
And forcefully started chokin' her and tellin' her not to move
'Fore she could even finish  she broke out in tears and did it
Told me that for years  this night was a repetition  a feeling of fear
That she couldn't seem to exit or quit it  the feeling was there
Started talkin' lower as she told me come here
She said she had to make choices
So she got involved with niggas that make noise with them thangs  you feel
Ran off in her uncle's spot with the stainless steel
Put the burner to his face with this aim to kill
And said  she don't fuck with niggas 'cause niggas is the reason
She got herself inside of this situation in the first place
Figured that this intimidation was the worst case
She sat back and blew six in that boy face *gun shots*
Shot  him  dead

Said I want you on my head
No  I won't leave you lonely
You hold your head up high
I won't let go
'Cause I can't leave you lonely
Can't leave you lonely
Can't leave you lonely
Can't leave you lonely
He don't fuck with niggas 'cause niggas is the reason
He got himself inside of this situation in the first place
He had no father figure  he told me that his papa got shot in the face
And he can't wait to find out who his killer
He dedicated his life and now wants to know this
To find out who had a motive to kill his only father
He felt  it had to be somebody close
It couldn't be somebody far away that didn't know him  but take this part in
When he was younger  he used to roll with his cousin
A woman that used to show him the ropes
She used to tell him
Don't ever let no nigga or woman touch you
And if somebody do then all they would hear was the baka-baka-baka-baka
One day  he was on the block rollin'
Then  this crack fiend woman came to him  told him
That she was his mother  man  that shit had him frozen
He ain't want to believe her 'til she said  Boy  you got a birthmark above your scrotum
A scar up on your eye came from when you was four
When you fell off in the road
At that point  he looked at her face and he froze
She told him hold on  it's something she gotta show him
She says to him  I was gon' wait until you got older
But something was on my mind  was pressin'  I had to show you
The whole block know me and the whole block know you
The whole block been knew this story but they ain't told you
His mom says to him  I hope you know your pop was a good man
But he just had some nonsense to him
Huh  well  one night  he's fucked up on the pills
I'm tryna tell him stop but everything I'm sayin' fails
You see  your lil' cousin in Brooklyn where we would leave ya  uh
I know she love you but the story's more deeper  uh
You see  your father used to be a creeper
He used to fuck her  used to touch her  used to beat her
Used to leave her so confused she would lace her own coke and reefer
Wait  I know you wanna interrupt but this get deeper
You've been livin' this mission  you tryna figure who's the nigga
Or the perpetrator of killin' your pops  nigga? When your cousin is the reason he got shot  nigga
She put six shots in him out the Glock  nigga
His anger was dwellin' all on his mind
He didn't know what to do  he started grippin' his .9
And uh  before he knew it  he aimed it up at his mom
And uh  huh- *gun shots* -he shot her right in the spine
He said  This is why my life has been full of lies
Don't nobody care for me  fuck it  what's the use in tryin'?
This Glock on my side  if I put it to my mind
I know that I'ma die but in Heaven  I'll be alive *gun shot*
Adrenaline pumpin'  heart pacing racing  altercations  we lit
Blood drip stain the ground  boy get down  you hit
Same hood  different day  same whip  different clip
Lettin' off  somehow we end up in the same shit
Stunt  get jumped on  slashed or dumped on
Same block you pump on is the spot you get slumped on
Tory told me the story  it sounded a little crazy
A little Nas  a little 2Pac  Brenda's havin' a baby
How much pressure can you take 'fore you snap or break? Love turn to hate?
Fuck shit or fake  your next move may raise the murder rate
From average to savage  to semi-automatics
It's tragic how the static'll have us goin' at it *gun shot*
Said I want you on my head
No  I won't leave you lonely
You hold your head up high
I won't let go
'Cause I can't leave you lonely
Can't leave you lonely
Can't leave you lonely
You and me will always be tight
Family every single day and night
Even when you starts acting like a fool
You know I'm loving every single thing you do
Fuckin' you made me proud of me
'Cause I know that you doubted me
Even told me I would never get wit' ya
Told me I could never get wit' ya
But this pride in me
Wouldn't let you slide by me
That's when I came back 'round
Shoulda never came 'round
You let me in and I let you down
My pride was the cause of it all
You and me... always be tight
Family every single day and... uh
And even when I starts actin' like a fool
Somehow I always can fall back on you
It's hurtin' you more than anybody else
Is let my pride get between me and you

With this .5 on my side and my .40
You moved on but you still are my shawty
I don't wanna lie because I'm right wit' ya
You and me... always be tight
Family every single day and... uh
And even when I starts actin' like a fool
Somehow I always can fall back on you
It's hurtin' you more than anybody else

But made this whole plan to fry me?
Since the event  you never called me but you can't deny me
If you got shot from behind  how can you identify me?

If that's the type of shit you teachin' Khari  then you should sit in a pen'

Caught you slippin' in LIV and sippin' bubbly
The way you lookin' is like a thousand dollars
I really hope you never get to love me
Not even a thought of you in my mind
Visions of you went blind
Part of that reason why I always try to tell you
I figured they was hatin' on us and it was jealousy
But I should've listened to the shit they was tellin' me
Now I'm caught up in this situation where L-O-V got the best of me

It's either leave it or pimp it if she be fucking niggas
I keep a oven to open over these suckas
I ain't fucking with these niggas
Ain't no time for cosigns
Still in the cut for niggas think I'm givin' a fuck
That niggas could never meddle with
We are not the same that's why we could never settle it
I don’t wanna fuck with niggas I know I'm better than
So I think you niggas better just
Give me just a little bit longer
Give me just a little bit stronger
Give me just a little big longer
Give me just one more try
All I had to do was
All I had to do was
Come up in that coupe
Come up in that coupe (I pull up inside)
Come up in that coupe (I pull up inside)
Came into my house  I had to bust it like a whole pie
I know she the bomb  she hit bong like a smoka
Hop inside that foreign whip on Ocean  hit the whole drive
I would say you ballin' but I see you in that O-5
I pull couple bands from that stash  she get more fire
Hard to see these other niggas in here  they in Lo-Fi
Don't come to my crib if you ain't fuckin'
Shawty  that's that shit I don't like
Open up my IG  bitches tellin' more lies
See them out in real life  niggas don't get no guap
All my guys  I just came with
Bunch of girls on me  it look like I just came in
Oh my gosh  whip's foreign

Yeah  who needs love? Ayy
When I got these diamond VVS's on my neckpiece
Big pointers all in my bezel  call it my bestie
I spent a hundred and thou' and all countin'
Money make me happy every time I count it
Who needs love  when I come around flexin'?
I don't need no lovin' from any one of my exes
Who needs love? Ayy
Baby  who needs love? Ayy
I got 20/20 vision when I see her
Pulled up in the Lamb'  should've pulled up in the BM
Rippers in my denim 'cause a young nigga was flexin'
I even had to stop  answerin' your calls
A nigga had you trappin' with the scammers and the dawgs
Drivin' over border with the hammers in the car
When the cops pulled me over  would've hand it to my dawgs
I mean  who needs love with these hammers in my fists?
And she gon' fuck me over  give a damn about a bitch
Don't wanna take her back  she did the damage in this bitch
Tell me  who needs love?

I said  I was doin' wrong back when you was livin' right
Cool a couple milli' sittin' with me on the flight  ayy
Tryna get me back and fuckin' niggas out of spite
And you sittin' on that nigga dick when it don't sit right with ya
Had to tell her  look here though
Don't you ever try to play me like a rookie  though
Big  big dreams got you sittin' in a mansion
Laid up in my covers while you thinkin' 'bout expansion
Can't believe you even fucked that nigga  he a random
Had me embarrassed to tell the story to the mandem
The Cullinan seats orange  'cause it's drippin' Hermès
'Cause when I got these diamond VVS' on my neckpiece
Big pointers all in my bezel  call it my bestie
I spent a hundred and thou' and all countin'
Money make me happy every time I count it
Who needs love  when I come around flexin'?
I don't need no lovin' from any one of my exes

I’ll leave it at that
C-Sick
Feel like I can’t even call you my ex
All of the shit that you did just to flex
How you gon’ shit on the kid just to flex?
How you gon’ shit on the kid when you know I used to love you?
(Gimme a sec)
Wildin’ out for respect
Have you lookin’ like you still love me
Why can’t you love me?
You got somebody
You cannot trust me
I cannot trust me

When you used to love me?
And do you still love me?
Why can’t you love?
Why don’t you love me?
Why don’t you love me?
Why don’t you love me?
You flew away and came back to a nigga
I loved myself when I was in the trap
I loved myself when I was in the trenches
I love my love for people when I used to see 'em walk beside me sleeping on them benches
But one day you saw me and you held me down
Kept it real and shawty you held it down
Wasn’t nothin’ niggas could tell me now
Wasn’t nothin’ that I couldn’t sell out
I just had to get the money and get it
With my niggas in the trenches
I can’t go back to your place
It bring me back to the days
Back in the day
How the fuck you let him kiss on your face?
How you had him all up back in your place?
Had another nigga sit in my space"
