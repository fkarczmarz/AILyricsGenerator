lyrics
"While I watch them ride with my dreams away
To the summer sunset on a holy night
Sixteen carriages drivin' away
While I watch them ride with my dreams away
To the summer sunset on a holy night
Had to leave my home at an early age
On the back of the bus in a bunk with the band
Undеrpaid and overwhelmed
Only God knows

Sixteen carriages drivin' away
While I watch them ride with my fears away
To the summer sunset on a holy night
Sixteen carriages drivin' away
While I watch them ride with my fears away
To the summer sunset on a holy night
I got love to create on this holy night
On the back of the bus in a bunk with the band
Overworked and overwhelmed
Only God knows
Sixteen carriages driving away
While I watch them ride with my fears away
To the summer sunset on a holy night
Sixteen carriages driving away
While I watch them ride with my fears away
To the summer sunset on a holy night
Oh
Had to take care of home at an early age
Had to sacrifice and leave my fears behind
You'll remember me 'cause we got somethin' to prove
Still see our faces when you close your eyes
Sixteen carriages drivin' away
She walked in the club like nobody's business
Goddamn
She murdered everybody and I was her witness
Pesos out of Mexico (De uno)
Commas and them decimals
She mixing up that Ace with that Hennessy
Rushing through her veins like it's ecstasy (Oh no)
Six inch heels
She walked in the club like nobody's business
Goddamn
She murdered everybody and I was her witness
From the start to the finish
And she worth every minute

Stars in her eyes
She grinds day and night
She grinds from Monday to Friday
She gon' slang
She too smart to crave material things
She pushing herself day and night
She grinds from Monday to Friday
Stars in her eyes
She fights and she sweats those sleepless nights
She grinds from Monday to Friday
She gon' slang
Too smart to crave material things
She grinds from Monday to Friday
Works from Friday to Sunday
Six inch heels
She walked in the club like nobody's business
Goddamn
She murdered everybody and I was her witness
(Know just what to do to make you love me)
From the start to the finish
And she worth every minute
You'll always come back to me

I really tried to stay cool
But your arrogance disturbed my solitude
Now I ripped your dress and you're all black and blue
Look what you made me do
They keep sayin' that I ain't nothin' like my father
But I'm the furthest thing from choir boys and altars
I am colder than Titanic water
They ain't ever been safe ones
I don't fellowship with these fakе ones
So let's travel to whitе chapels and sing hymns
From this marijuana smoke smell in my hair
I sashayed my dress
Did my best impression of a damsel in distress
This alcohol and smell of regret
Allured my catch
Outfit too small to hide my scars
Feelin' bottled up like bottle service broads
How long can he hold his breath before his death?

Code on me  drive on me
Open correctional gates in higher desert (Yeah)
Open our mind as we cast away oppression (Yeah)
Open the streets and watch our beliefs
And when they carve my name inside the concrete
I pray it forever reads
Freedom! Freedom! I can't move
Freedom  cut me loose!

And I've been driftin' off on knowledge
I could sing a psalm for a Solomon or Salamander
We took a flight at midnight and now my mind can't help but wonder  How come?

To the song here in my heart
A melody I start
But can't complete
Listen
To the sound from deep within
It's only beginning
To find release
They will not be pushed aside and turned
I'm not at home in my own home
And I've tried and tried to say what's on my mind
Now I'm done believin' you
You don't know what I'm feelin'
I'm more than what you made of me
I followed the voice you gave to me
But now I've gotta find my own
You might also like
You should have listened
There was someone here inside
Someone I thought had died
So long ago
They will not be pushed aside or worked
I'm not at home in my own home
And I've tried and tried to say what's on my mind
Now I'm done believin' you
You don't know what I'm feelin'
I'm more than what you made of me
I followed the voice you gave to me
But now I've gotta find my own
I don't know where I belong
But I'll be moving on
If you don't
If you won't
Listen to the song here in my heart
A melody I start
Now I'm done believin' you
You don't know what I'm feelin'
I'm more than what you made of me
I followed the voice you think you gave to me
But now I've gotta find my own
But nine times out of ten  I know you're trying
So I'm trying to be fair
And you're trying to be there and to care
And you're caught up in your permanent emotions
And all the loving I've been giving goes unnoticed
It's just floating in the air  lookie there
Are you aware
You're my lifeline  are you tryna kill me?
If I wasn't me  would you still feel me?
Like on my worst day? Or am I not thirsty enough?
I don't care about the lights or the beams
Spend my life in the dark for the sake of you and me
Nine times out of ten  I'm in my feelings
But ten times out of nine  I'm only human
Tell me  what did I do wrong?
Feel like that question has been posed  I'm movin' on
I always been committed  I been focused
I always paid attention  been devoted
Tell me  what did I do wrong?

Now everybody asks me
Why I'm smilin' out from ear to ear (They say love hurts)
But I know (It's gonna take a little work)

Silly of me to dream of one day havin' your kids
Love is so blind  it feels right when it's wrong
I can't believe I fell for your schemes  I'm smarter than that
So dumb and naive to believe that  with me  you're a changed man
Foolish of me to compete when you cheat with loose women
It took me some time  but now  I moved on
Because I realized I've got
Me  myself and I
That's all I got in the end  that's what I found out
And it ain't no need to cry
I took a vow that  from now on  I'm gon' be my own best friend

All up in your face? Yeah

That's why you're my equivalent
So sexy
We're so much more than pointless fixtures
Wanna rock that ching-ching-ching
Home is where the heart is
And you're comfortable in my skin
