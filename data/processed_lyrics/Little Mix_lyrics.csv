lyrics
"Hey!
I saw you holding hands on New Bond Street
She in the same cute tee that you bought me
And you know I'd be lyin'
I've been tryna be the bigger person
But it's hard when I've been feelin' so small
And nobody knows
'Cause love's looking good on you
You might also like
A bad taste in my mouth 'cause you're over me (Oh)
She seems so sweet and I'm tryna be cool
And you know I'd be lyin'
Ain't got time for being emotional
And nobody knows
'Cause love's looking good on you
Check-check myself when I see you walkin' by
Check-check myself when I see you walkin' by
'Cause love's looking good on you
All day I dream about (Shh) with you (You  ooh-ooh  ooh)
They say that it's overrated  well  they ain't doing it right (Ahh)
All day I dream about (Shh) with you (You  ooh-ooh  ooh)
Since I met you I been thinking all day
I been Googling ways to keep you entertained
It's been three weeks since we started to play
Now it's serious  babe  'cause what you do is crazy
I never had somebody who
You're gonna get it tonight (Oh)
All day I dream about (Shh) with you (You  ooh-ooh  ooh)
All day I dream about (Shh) with you (You  ooh-ooh  ooh)
They say that it's overrated  well  they ain't doing it right (No)
All day I dream about (Shh) with you (You  ooh-ooh  ooh)
Slavin' in the kitchen  iced you a cake
Then I served you a plate  but that ain't what you ate  no
We've been busy doing all Fifty Shades
While we listen to Drake  we on that hot love and emotion

In a whole 'nother life  there was this boy that I knew
He made me feel like a woman  we were young and silly fools

High heels and my jewellery dripping
Insecure but I'm working with it
