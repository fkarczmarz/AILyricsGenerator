Hot in the kitchen like a thousand degrees

Temperature risin' when I look at you  look at you
Subliminal sex
Drippin' in sweat

2 Chainz!
Everything hot like it's fresh off the grill
Million dollar grill look fresh on the hill
Plus I'm 6'5  she need to step in some heels
'Fore she step up in here  you need to step up your gear
Wish a Lamborghini had four doors (Four doors)
From the corner store to the corridor (Corridor)
Me and my homie on the dance floor
White girl in the middle  looking like an Oreo (I'm burnin' up)
Roof on fire  we can burn up
Motherf***er must ain't learn nothin'
Back in the day used to down with a burn coat (I'm burnin' up)
Light got the Lord on the top floor
In a Ford  wearin' Tom Ford
Walk in the club and her ass start clappin'
Tell shawty I want an encore (Ooh)
Come  put me out
Come and put me out
(I'm burnin' up  up)
Come  put me out
Come and put me out (Ayy)
Come  put me out
I'm burnin' up
Come  put me out

Come  put me out
Come and put me out (I'm  I'm burnin' up)
I'm burnin' up
Come  put me out
I'm burnin' up
Come  put me out
 I know that we can change some of the things that are beyond our control
 but use your heart to see
 but hold on and wait
 if by chance I fall
 a casualty of love
 without being hurt
 let me be your soldier
 take my hand
 but hold on and wait
 if by chance I fall
 and I'll get back up wanting more
 that's the price I'll pay
 casualty
 a casualty of love
Sound like Marvin Gaye when you sing to me
I'm in Hollywood but I wanna go downtown to you
We talk music
I want to feel your love inside
Your silence drives me crazy
Talking with your hands gets me naked
You are dangerous
So dangerous

I pray up  I stay up
What is life with all the clues?
Sometimes I don't know what to do and that's alright
I make money  share my time
I need something to be mine
I'm impatient  give me space
Always working far away
Please don't be so hard
So hard on my heart
I'm a delicate flower tryna grow inside your arms
Please don't be so cold
Be patient while I grow
I wanna try  I won't always get it right but I need you to know
To go easy on me
Go easy  go easy on me
Go easy

Ours is a different kind of love
It used to be saving us
Now it's just breaking us
It's not about just giving up
We know we're not safe enough
Do I stay 'cause you say you need me?

It won't fix 'cause I say I love you
I need to show you but I don't know how to
How am I supposed to grow? (Mm)

I will stand and fight
Gotta do what's right

He believes his game to say
Lead the innocence to the grave

Memories can bleed in my open heart
Grown-up life is to learn not to fall apart
And I'm closer to high vibrations
Learning of the sweeter and deeper waves
And what I can do to make it
To be at peace and be true to me in every way
I know I'll be alright
I know that I'll survive
I know I'll rise above it
'Cause I believe in love
And even when it's hard
Livin' with my scars
It never mounts to nothing
'Cause I believe in love
I just gotta know
Sometimes the right road is by taking the broken path

You need to listen
Don't let her disappear
I'll give her my forever
If it meant for a day she could really be okay

Take this open road
And I wanna get it right
We can't win if we don't try
And I'm scared  I can't deny

Oh  they pull my hair
They took away my chair
I'd keep it in and pretend that I didn't care
Hey Jessica  you're so funny!
You've got teeth just like Bugs Bunny!
Oh  so you think you know me now
Have you forgotten how you would make me feel
When you dragged my spirit down?
But thank you for the pain
It made me raise my game
And I'm still rising  I'm still rising
Yeah  yeah
So make your jokes  go for broke
Blow your smoke  you're not alone
But who's laughing now?
But who's laughing now?
So raise the bar  hit me hard
Play your cards  be a star
But who's laughing now?
But who's laughing now?

'Cause I'm in LA
You think I've made my fame
FB makes us friends when you only really know my name
Oh Jessie  we knew you could make it!
I've got a track and I'd love you to take it!
So now because I'm signed
You think my pockets lined
Four years now  and I'm still waiting in the line
Oh Jessie  I saw you on YouTube!
I tagged old photos from when we was at school!
Oh  so you think you know me now
Have you forgotten how you would make me feel
When you dragged my spirit down?
But thank you for the pain
It made me raise my game
And I'm still rising  I'm still rising
Yeah  yeah

Swallowed your pride  you got that ego cough
Let the haters hate
You're like  way too late
Hola! I'm proud of you!

Play the right cards  I-I ain't afraid to work it
Brush 'em right off  when they say I don't deserve it
Ooh  it feels so crazy when you scream my name
Love it when you rock me over everyday
When I think about it  I could go insane
If this is a dream  won't open my eyes
Am I asleep? No  I'm alive
I just can't believe that this is my life
In my fantasy  we're running wild
If this is a dream  won't open my eyes
Am I asleep? No  I'm alive
I just can't believe that this is my life
In my fantasy  we're running wild
When it gets rough and the rain starts pouring
I turn up the heat 'cause the drama ain't important
Let 'em all talk-talk  I'mma just ignore it
Ooh  it feels so crazy when you scream my name

B.I.G. Sean Don  okay
Today I woke up feeling like the Mayor (Uh)
I spent about an hour looking in the mirror
As I should  as much as I've been through
It's a wonder I look this damn good
Could probably make it out any situation that you try to put me into
If I swim with the piranhas  guarantee that I'ma probably have a fish dinner (Yeah)
I met a young girl with a sexy shape
Look like Jessie J  we escapade where it's extra shade (Swerve)
She make me wanna give in  not take in like collection plates
And I could lose it all tonight just to show the world I could do it twice
This my life
If this is a dream  won't open my eyes
Am I asleep? No  I'm alive (Jessie J)
I just can't believe that this is my life
In my fantasy  we're running wild
If this is a dream  won't open my eyes
Am I asleep? No  I'm alive
I just can't believe that this is my life
In my fantasy  we're running wild
D-D-D-D-Dizzee
Rascala  double the dollar
I'm a jet-settin' bredda  more hits than a white collar
But I can't be boxed  flow tight like Bob Marley's locks
I can't be dropped  I'm at the peak and I can't be topped
Opposite of calmly  I bet I’ll get the party hot
I can't be blocked  10 years plus running the game
You breddas just come in the game  but now I'm coming again
To get the people going dumb and insane
Hundred thousand people going bonkers in the mud and the rain
I'm all in their brain  why would I complain?
I thought I was the Boy in da Corner
But I'm in a penthouse  now your boy is a baller
I'm living
If this is a dream  won't open my eyes
Am I asleep? No  I'm alive
I just can't believe that this is my life
In my fantasy  we're running wild
If this is a dream  won't open my eyes
Am I asleep? No  I'm alive
I just can't believe that this is my life
In my fantasy  we're running wild
Woah  oh
J-J-Jessie J
Woah  oh

 but she hopes for your hand

 I'm not really bein' me"
