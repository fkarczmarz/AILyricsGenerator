lyrics
"Like an ice cold beer after hard work
Like a hot cup of coffee on your way to town
Like an underdog last second touchdown
Like the feeling that you get when you get a bite
Like the power of a throttle when it's open wide
When the sand runs out of that hourglass
Always gonna love you
When the sun burns out and the cows come home
From now 'til forever something you can count on is
Love them freckles that you get in the summertime
And the way you get giddy off a glass of wine
Even the way you take forever and you never on time

Always gonna love you
When the sun burns out and the cows come home
From now 'til forever something you can count on is
Always gonna love you
When the sun burns out and the cows come home
From now 'til forever something you can count on is
‘Bout to get a little boondock crazy
You're gonna wanna turn this one up
Feels good  don't it?
Big stars breakin' out through the indigo
Chevy wind comin' in in stereo
Taillights disappear in 'bout a mile or so
Down the county road
Phone blowin' up Where you is?
Rocket in a bottle with the fuse lit
'Bout to lift it off  I'm 'bout to twist it off
Lime on the rim of that dixie silver
Smokin' up a faded out 4x4
Girls headin' off to the river  yeah
Victoria's Secret ain't a secret no more
I brought the songs and who brought the party
Only one way to do it up right
Everybody goes where everybody knows
That anything goes on a Friday night
Get your party right  it's a Friday night
Get your party right  it's a Friday night

Gettin' all locked in with all my friends
Lime on the rim of that dixie silver

Alabama on the boombox  baby
You always saw the blue skies past the rain clouds in my eyes
There's music in your laughter from the floor up to the rafters
You're that happy ever after I've been after my whole life
Who knows where I'd be without you?
No  I just couldn't be without you
I'll just say Amen
I can't count 'em on one hand
But honey  look there on your finger
I'd say I'm a lucky man
God made two lovers out of strangers
A little house on a little land
A little creek  a little Jeep
Same old moon everybody sees
It sure ain't hard to count your blessings
Yesterday we celebrated our first year together
And together still feels better than that first night we met
I never dreamed that you could be so perfectly created  girl
He made a perfect angel
And he made you just for me

It sure ain't hard to count your blessings
No  I can't count 'em on both hands
But honey  look here at this picture
I'd say we're a lucky fam
I'm thankful to be with you
A little house on a little land
Couple kids  two or three
Same old song that we'll always sing
It sure ain't hard to count your blessings
Slap you on that custom Gucci suit and ditch that camo hat
You can move from the boondocks to Beverly Hills
Drop a little hip-hop in the boombox but still
You can't hide red
Don’t you know you were born this way?
You can't hide red
You can see it in everything
It's the down-home way we raised

A gas station biscuit
I end every day about the same way
Clock out and go fish just to crack a few
Chicken in a bread pan
Pickin' out gulls and cull with some ten pound tail
It might be hillbilly to a lot of folks
But Lord knows I couldn't care less
You can say I'm a redneck
You can say you don't like my truck
You can say that I talk and I dress all funny
You can say I drink too many longnecks
And my edges are a little too rough
You can call me a sinner 'cause I cuss on Sunday

You can't say I ain't country (No you can't)
I got friends from Tennessee
So I got something in a bottle
And I got something from a seed
Since you said you didn't love me
Since you hung me out to dry
I've been drunk up in the Smokies
On a Rocky Mountain high
Nothing sweet 'bout a paid-for honeymoon
Million dollar view to see but she won't
Since I do turned right into I don't
So I'm chillin' in a cabin at the tip-top
Lookin' at a holler full of hemlocks
And just when you think I'm all alone
I got friends from Colorado
I got friends from Tennessee
So I got something in a bottle
And I got something from a seed
Since you said you didn't love me

I've been drunk up in the Smokies

I've been drunk up in the Smokies
On a Rocky Mountain high (Ooh)
Jack's still on the hill 'cause Jill ran away
Gravel dust behind the wheels
Driftin' like my mind into the rearview
Jet trails cuttin' cross the sky
I'm rollin' through the open wide
Searchin' for a song to drink a beer to
And tryin' to find a place to disappear to
I light up the night and let it burn
Lean back and watch a sundown fade
Do what I do when life's a little sideways
I take a sip and say a prayer
Wait for a shootin' star and stare
Off at the headlights on the highway
That guy in the windshield lookin' back looks just like me
But there's a crack in the reflection
Right hand on a cold one confession
Embers in the ashtray glow like memories that won't let go
I'm out here tryin' to get 'em untangled
In the darkness on the edge of town
Waitin' on a call from an angel

What you say we get up out the city? (Yup)
Let's roll on some blacked-out rims
Go 'til the blacktop ends
Street lights in the red dust (Red dust)
Take it out where it's just us
Let's move to the countryside
Park this truck in the pale moonlight
Sweet little honeysuckle lips on mine
Tangled up tighter than a kudzu vine
Don't need no neon nights
Got a pine tree paradise
Way out in the countryside
Pour a little whiskey in a Dixie cup
Hand-rolled smoke to get you giddy up

And there ain't a Bible verse  y'all  I ain't heard a preacher preach
Mom and dad up in the bleachers  screaming while I pitch
Beating deep on the speakers  finally riding around the town
With my best friends  ain't life like a whirlwind?
One second I'm playing checkers with Grandma  then my world ends
I used to hear my granddaddy say  before it's too late
You gotta dig your roots 'fore the sun goes down
Show some love back to your hometown
Fall in love  plant some seeds
Carve some names in the family tree
Raise your kids  love your wife
Put God first  just to live your life
Hey  I think I'm gonna go and get a little more dirt on my boots
You gotta dig your roots
You dig  you love  you gotta put 'em in the ground for someone

Elm shade  red rust clay you grew up on
That plowed up ground  that your dad damned his luck on
That post game party field you circle up on
And when it rains you get stuck on
Drift a cloud back behind county roads that you run up
And mud on her jeans that she peeled off and hung up
Her blue-eyed summertime smile looks so good that it hurts
Makes you wanna build a 10 percent down white picket fence house on this dirt

He's a ragged on the edge  she's keeping him holding out hope
She's a front pew hallelujah  drop another 20 in the plate
He's on the back row a little hung over  bout 20 minutes late
She's a good girl  sky blue turquoise
Fallin' for a bad boy  drivin' that Detroit
Big block  cruisin' up the black top
Comin' for a good girl  countin' down the sun set
Never been broke heart  racin' like a Corvette
Got a little wildfire burnin' in her angel eyes
Probably ain't never been lost after midnight
Tryin' to be a good girl  but fallin' for a bad boy
Tryin' to be a good girl  but fallin' for a bad boy
Well she's sundress cotton  he's grease on a Carhartt shirt
And she's a candle in the wind  he's a light it up and let it burn
And every time she's with him  all she wants to do is kiss him
Starts thinking maybe she can fix him
He's thinkin' he'd love to let her try
She's a good girl  sky blue turquoise
Fallin' for a bad boy  drivin' that Detroit
Big block  cruisin' up the black top

Yeah
Say we'll always work it out
I know it's kinda scary but it's only temporary doubt
I've done a lot of stupid things
But promise that you're gonna stay long enough
To grow old with me
We're gonna see the good times
Love each other through the bad
It's gonna hurt like hell when we lose our moms and dads
So let my shoulder hold your tears
Walk beside me through the years
Let's hold hands on your favorite beach
Fix up a house that we found in the city limits
Tangled up in a satin sheet
And get a little loud when we've had too much to drink
And learn to love from a church pew
Laugh about all the times we counted pennies
Buy some land with a good view to start family
Baby grow old with me

Strong enough to stand up through the rain
We'll make some love on your favorite beach
Add to the house that we found in the city limits
Talk our babies through the bad dreams
When they get a little older we'll tell them not to drink
Book a church when she finds a groom
Laugh about all the times they'll count the pennies
Give em land with a good view to start a family
And baby you know we might
Take a turn on a bad road
Back and forth on a porch swing
Hard not to smile thinkin' how it don't get much better
Our baby's baby's turnin' 18
Baby grow old with me
Baby grow old with me
Baby grow old with me
Tell me that you love me
And the sky fall to only bring the rain
I sat in darkness
All broken-hearted
I couldn't find a day I didn't feel alone
You broke through and saved me
'Cause you're the first thing I know I can believe in
I'm high on lovin' you
High on lovin' you
I'm high on lovin' you
High on lovin' you
You made the brightest days from the darkest nights
You're the river bank where I was baptized
Cleansed from the demons
That were killin' my freedom

You're the healin' hands where it used to hurt
I might've learned a thing or two
On a Friday night joyride
Out there on the county line
Drag racin' 'til the blue lights chase us
And we scattered like sparks from a Black Cat fuse
Train bridge where we spray paint Skynard
And the gold flakes glimmered in the cinnamon booze
We were livin' every minute of the night
Like there might never be another
We were runnin' all the caution lights
We were learnin' to fly with a little tail gunner
If there was somethin' to burn  we were burnin' it
Anything with a curve  we were turnin' it
Just wildfires out there under
The hell raisin' heat of the summer
Alabama on the Alpine
Bust a cap on a deer sign
A little back seat butterfly
Homegrown angel that'll get you high
That'll get you high

Yeah man  we had some damn good times
And I sure hope everybody's doin' good
We were livin' every minute of the night
Like there might never be another
We were runnin' all the caution lights

Anything with a curve  we were turnin' it
Just wildfires out there under
The hell raisin' heat of the summer
The hell raisin' heat of the summer
Lean it back slow  get your feel good on
Cut 'em off short  roll it up tight
Let it unwind tonight
Drop down the top down on the Pontiac
Wherever you wind up is where the party’s at
Break out the bottle of Bacardi Black
And don’t look back ’cause
Here's to the good times  here’s to the sunshine
Here's to the ice you float your beer in
To the tops that pop and the tan lines disappearin'
Oh my  my
She’s a little bit tipsy
Leans in for a kiss  she's stealin' your heart just like a gypsy
Here’s to the good times
While there’s still time
We'll lay it all out  spray it on sweet
Carve it in oak and permanent ink
Park it way back  fog it on up
Singin' whoa  whoa
Radio spillin' from a single cab
She looks so good with her silver tabs
Hangin' on a branch by the river
That's a memory that'll get you when you look back

How the good Lord intended it
Yes  he did
I love my country  I love my country
Six strings and fiddles  whiskey from Kentucky
We keep it funky we like how it sounds
Up loud and proud  rollin' into town
Hanging out the window like a Bluetick hound
Ain't sorry  ain't nothin' to be sorry about
I love my country  I love my country up loud
That pedal steel  she straight slidin' over here to me
She do that Alabama Shake  like you ain't ever seen

And going out downtown when I'm with her
Like driving too fast down a four-lane road
But damn sure nowhere close to the way that
I love my country  I love my country
Six strings and fiddles  whiskey from Kentucky
We keep it funky  we like how it sounds
Up loud and proud  rollin' into town

That's a country ass lyric right there  boy
It's crazy here  this crowd tonight's so loud in here you can hardly think
But everything's fading babe  cause you're all I see
It's like we're alone in here baby
We might as well be on an island  we might as well be on the moon
The way you're looking at me baby  can't take my eyes off you
Feels like the world is disappearing every time we touch
We're so caught up in each other  it's just the two of us
We might as well be on an island  we might as well be on an island
It's just me and you  back corner booth  we're sitting on the same seat
Got my hands all over you and  yeah girl  you're all over me
Like nobody's watching us baby  let them all see
Still that ain't stopping us baby
We might as well be on an island  we might as well be on the moon
The way you're looking at me baby  can't take my eyes off you

With the windows down and your feet up on my dash
Got your rays on and my hat’s back and we're feeling cool as cash
You go slidin' through the static trying to find that song you love
Smoke rolling up and you showin' up like a dime piece in the dust
You had diamonds in your eyes when you were smiling
Even pretty when you're cryin'
If I said I wasn't missing you I'd be lyin'
I still go riding around town
With the windows down and your feet up on my dash
Got your rays on and my hats back and we're feeling cool as cash

Can't walk down a street and smile at a stranger
Heart on your sleeve and love thy neighbor

Or the corner booths I called home
One foot out the door  always stoppin' short
Just before the fork in the road
Couldn't jump into the deep end
I was always overthinkin'
Since I met you  I
I ain't spent one second guessin'
I made up my mind
I never knew  I
Just had to find my direction
Gettin' lost in your eyes
Because I've turned days into nights
And spent all of my life askin' questions

Opened up my eyes to a world that I'd never seen

This is where we burn our summer nights
Moonlit lipstick kisses on the hood of that Tacoma
Sparks were flying every time I smelled smoke
I'm sittin' by a bonfire watchin' her swayin'
Me and my buddies and the guitar playin'
Sipping on forties on a Saturday night
Buzzing through a chorus of 'Dixieland Delight'
High as the stars in the Milky Way
Those summer days drifted away
But she'll always float
Back through my mind like smoke
Southern skin and blue jean flashes
Strike a match and light a memory
