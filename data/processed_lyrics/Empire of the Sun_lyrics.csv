lyrics
"World slows down as it goes
Goodbye to last night
Lost my eyesight
Can't you help me see?
(They won’t get right)
Waking in the snow
Tracing steps with you
Swimming through the smoke
Wrapped in velvet gold
Can't you help me see?
(They won’t get right)

Can you describe to me
All the world that you see?
Freedom is within you
Giving makes us feel good
Hello to our people
Say hello to the future
Freedom is within you
Giving makes us feel good
Hello to our people
Say hello to the future
 baby do you bleed?
 the eternal flame
 crystal creation
 let's be like the ocean
 crystal creation
 let's be like the ocean
 know where I'm done
 bluer ocean
 know where I'm done
An effigy  shadow play
Harmonize  no escape
Pressurize  everybody now 'til they say
Sound it out
Sound it out
Sound it out
Sound it out
She's gone crazy
For real  or just me?
She's addressed  but can she sing?
Where's the truth - in the tongue?
Pressurize  everybody now 'til they say
Sound it out
Sound it out
Sound it out
Sound it out
She's gone crazy

Held each other to till breaking day
I’ve opened up like I never planned
Showed me how to love again
You carved a path to my heartland
You sailed along a foreignwave
All the winds are changing our flavour
Cross the ocean way
We celebrate our love
We celebrate our love
Drawing the pictures of our lives
Watch and wonder as they come alive
The characters become my friends
As the empire begins to rise
Something gains its place now
After floods have washed away
Just love someone more than yourself
Give yourself away

This marigold run
So far away  I won’t be coming back
Just a little too much
Just thought that they would find me
Dig me out
Spiders and flies coming up inside
I’m rebirthing
And we all rise
Each and everyone
It’s gonna be alright if we stick together for all time
This is a good time  I’ve heard about my life
Deepest of dreams ahead
Just a little too much
Just thought that they would find me
Dig me out
Alright  I’m having a good time

I wish it was new
Down in a new river
I just want the fire
In my heart above it
And I wanna see

‘Cause then I know I'll be by your side
With you tonight
I don't wanna go

‘Cause then I know I'll be by your side
With you tonight
I believe in this world that I created
I did it for you
I wish to be your love and save you

You were the one I always run to

She's saying that I've been gone too long
Says she's witnessed hundreds of hours
People they all just wander around
I'll get higher tonight when I know that you're here
Feel the digital life keeping me young
This digital life don't keep me warm
Give me iron for bones so I could be strong
Time is ticking down to zero
She's praying that it won't work out
She says we've lost our sense of nature
People they all just wander around

River ran past the rocks to a waterfall
Piece of love like they can

Back in spring of '79
There were no rules to feel sublime
Let's trek down the path
We slept to the radio
Gentle as my heart beats now
Turn up the fuse all over again  my friend
(Just to take me away)
Rewind  we were DNA
Don't wanna fade away
Rewind  there's no yesterday
It's our discovery
Dreamtime  it's a special place
Let's keep each other awake
Our hearts  now they beat the same
There is a thread that runs along
The seam of all the paths we've crossed
A colour wheel that spins around
Weave all into one
The price of getting setting suns
We're running to the beat of the drum
We are the creatures  rays and larks
Relax

Take me away
So far away
No-one will find us
On our own island
Just out of choice
The dreamer fought the battleship away
It's over the horizon
Voices inside of us to guide us on
Guiding us on
Can't you hear us calling you
Can't you hear us calling you
Can't you hear us calling you
Rewind  we were DNA
Don't wanna fade away
Rewind  there's no yesterday
It's our discovery
Dreamtime  it's a special place
Let's keep each other awake
Light as air
Cherish the thought
Making more
It's like I've been here before
There's something more
Heart is racing a million miles tonight
When you're closer baby I change the time
You've given me the rhythm to run

I watch you disappear
Before my eyes saw through solid air
They said you're fine
That I shouldn't even care
But I got wise
Sought to find you there
Sliding doors and the thirteenth floor
It shifts and I don't wind up
Dimensions rising out of my head
And you never looked this good
Never looked this good
No one ever said that you'd be right here
Now I gotta be scared of my friend
No one ever said that you'd be right here
Now I gotta be scared of my friend
Way down the crime
The second that you left
Score some spice
And tap another share
Pay back the ride
And I couldn't shake the fear
While they climb high
Look what's really there

It's hard to find my way home
When my heart has lost count of that stone
Like it's an emergency
I wanna live in your arms
And there I'll be safe from harm
I don't want to live a life alone

Lead me to your door

No seals come back

My dust made of gold
We're spread across the world
Time has come to show the lonely folk with the globes
And dust made out of gold
We're spread across with joy
Come on!
We move against the galaxy on the elephants
Laser pause the chimes
Like a string of pearls
That goes on and on
Underneath a canopy so green with a flash
Dust made out of gold
Lead us on our way

There's things I just can't hate forever

But it's not as bleak as it seems
The tears have stained all the pages
It is all a romance to be
But I reach out and you go forth
My ears have gone in phases
It is all a romance to me
Romance to me
But only to those who knows me
Replaced by the sadness and longing
Is the romance you'd given to me
I still hear the bells when I walk
But the movie has changed its key
I'm touched by your breath as I sleep
It is all a romance to me
Romance to me
Romance to me

Without with without you say at home at home
How hard do you make it go?

We are on the same team
We are so unusual
Really  there is no need to be kind
This letter holds the whole piece
There's no need to choose sides
I think I said goodbye to my soul tonight
I think I lost the touch of us behind
I think I said goodbye to my soul tonight
And I'm flying  and I'm flying
Really  there's no need to choose sides
We are on the same team

But baby don’t you cry
Be too cool to ever be
With a tiger by your side
Money talks a single side
Paid my dues to move the tide
Caught the moonlight in my shoe
With a tiger by my side
Trekking through an open mind
I got a window in my spine
Felt the miracle in my stride over
Making music in my mind
I’m blending colours for the blind
Melt the pinnacle your times not over
Rabbit trips can take their time
But fun is fun and that’s alright
Diving deep as whales sleep
Counting heroes on my feet
Widow in a falling star
Healing scars with my guitar
Sirens speak to apple tree
And the tiger plays a part

Seen about a million roads

Culture shocking walkways to the shore

Just what happened
Can't I come around and talk to you
I feel better when we are together
I know it's simple but I don't care
I tried to say the things to make up for the mess I've caused
Take this journey
Don't reject me
I'll do whatever you ask of me
Heart beats in time
Power to streetlights
Eyes like I've never seen so beautiful
I feel better when we are together
I know it's simple but I don't care
I tried to say the things to make up for the mess I've caused

 baby
 c'mon move your feet
 carried away
 baby
 get carried away
Stop running away
Now
So much to say
No one to say it to
No one to hold on
Now
In far away
So long to go
Nothing breaks like a
Heart
I'll leave the light on
I'll keep a look out
Such harm of my life
Girl
I sleep again
My dreams are had
Meet me there then
We know we do
We reach for love
It meets us on the headway
Blind to the upcoming eye
Caught in the fuss above
Right in the prime of your life
Struck by the force of us
And all because we trust two vines
Slowly growing right into your ears
Show me all the life
Lead us in your wind tonight
Two vines
Two vines
We're going out
We'll wake the dawn
Not replaying memories
Fly to the sky up above
Caught into all of us
Right in the prime of our lives
Struck by the course of love

Two vines
Two vines
I wonder what it's like
Slowly growing right into your ears
There's only one way tonight
I wonder every time
Why go to a place that no one's ever been before?
There's only one ocean that can hold the door
All the universe is humming with me
And all because we trust two vines
Slowly growing right into your ears
Show me all the life
Lead us in your wind tonight
Two vines
Slowly growing right into your ears
Show me all the life
Lead us in your wind tonight
Walking on a dream
Walking on a dream
Walking on a dream
How can I explain
Talking to myself
Will I see again
We are always running for the thrill of it thrill of it
Always pushing up the hill searching for the thrill of it
On and on and on we are calling out and out again
Never looking down I'm just in awe of what's in front of me
Is it real now
When two people become one
I can feel it
When two people become one
Thought I'd never see
The love you found in me
Now it's changing all the time
Living in a rhythm where the minutes working overtime
We are always running for the thrill of it thrill of it
Always pushing up the hill searching for the thrill of it
On and on and on we are calling out and out again
Never looking down I'm just in awe of what's in front of me

What I see in you
I remember too
Never stopped
Looking now at you
What I really do
I will still call you
To lead me now
Don't you know when you crossed my path
Felt like fate
Don't give up what we are
Fate don't fade
Walk with me into the past
Retrieve everything
Know that the Sun is here to stay
I'll be the one to tell to you
Cause you walk the line
Between sugar and divine
My sweet diamond

I'm afraid of hope
I may discover
If I look too long
Hide myself
Staying on the move
In another town
All the traces of
You haunt me now
Know that the Sun is here to stay
I'll be the one to tell you
Cause you walk the line
Between sugar and divine
My sweet diamond
 x2
Never forget that avenue
Summer wept in love with you (Never Forget)
Since you caught my heat on you
Feel the streets that led me to (Never Forget)
Am I past the road
I'm straight arrow
I'mma feel right now
Falling crown
In just a while
I'll be back in style
Way beyond the dunes
Towards the sun
Know that the Sun is here to stay
I'll be the one to tell you
Cause you walk the line
Between sugar and divine
My sweet diamond
 x4
Never forget that avenue
Summer wept  in love with you (Never Forget)
Since you caught my heat on you
Are you ready for
A revolution to show the way
Seven more weeks until the day
Because heartbreak's coming to bend us the wrong way
This is where we get carried away enough to start again
While hearts beat
It's nothing like before
Dreaming is the home of the brave
Future is the healing of pain
Because heartbreak's coming to bend us the wrong way
This is where we get carried away enough to start again
This is where we get carried away enough to start again

Heading for the city lights
In nineteen seventy five
We share in each other
Nearer than farther
The scent of a lemon
Drips from your eyes
We are the people that rule the world
A force running in every boy and girl
All rejoicing in the world
We lived an adventure
Love in the summer
Followed the sun till night
Reminiscing other times of life
For each every other
The feeling was stronger
The shock hit eleven
Got lost in your eyes
I can't do well when I think
Are you gonna leave me now?
Can't you be believing now?

It's running on empty
It's running on nothing
You could be my love
All the things we've tried
If you loved me back
I'll never go home grim
I'll never be lonely
Start of something great
I know we lit a feeling in my veins
Never gonna be the one you hate
'Cause I know how to stay away from pain
I could offer life throughout the sense
I can see this girl in my life
Making everything so emotional
I feel the pleasure and pain for you
Welcome to my life
I know that I want you
It's all that I can do
You complete my life
The moment I met you
The love I confess to
All those stars that shine
There's so many out there
Brighter than distant
We are too unfirm
The purer electric
Who would've guessed it?

No energy or heat
No troughs there are no peaks
No hangover from last night
No shame in first light
No time there'll be no change
No colours to rearrange
And I
I get that feeling
I get the teaching that I can't be without you
Without you babe
Without you
No future there is no past
No slow there is no fast
No grace with which to admire
No face there is no desire
No symmetry or peace
No sirens or police
No cameras and no phones
No photographs and no tones
And I
I get that feeling
I get the teaching that I can't be without you

Where secrets serve no one
Come a little bit closer now
No need to say it out loud
On the day you brought the sound
In the way you turned me up
On the roads I belong
Like nothing could go wrong
Oh  tonight I stepped out
The starlight shining through
Angels calling us
We don't have too far to go
Rely on this now
Today I felt alone
Didn't wanna let you go
All we have is love to show
Did a little on the darker side
In the jungle on the city block
We are just running high
Then I lift the fallen sky

To be one lie

Angels calling us

Rely on this now
Today I felt alone
Didn't wanna let you go"
