lyrics
"She's always worried 'bout things like that
Well  she said  It's all gonna end and it might as well be my fault
And she only sleeps when it's rainin'
And she screams and her voice is strainin'
And she says  Baby
It's 3 AM  I must be lonely
When she says  Baby
Well  I can't help but be scared of it all sometimes
And the rain's gonna wash away  I believe it
And in her color portrait world  she believes that she's got it all  oh
She swears the Moon don't hang quite as high as it used to
And she only sleeps when it's rainin'
And she screams (And she screams) and her voice is strainin'
And she says  Baby
When it's 3 AM  I must be lonely
Well  I can't help but be scared of it all sometimes
And the rain's gonna wash away  I believe  yes

Well  she believes that life isn't made up of all that you're used to
And the clock on the wall has been stuck at three for days and days
She thinks that happiness is a mat that sits on her doorway  yeah
But outside  it's stopped rainin'
Yeah  but she says  Baby
Well  it's 3 AM  I must be lonely
Well  I can't help but be scared of it all sometimes
And the rain's gonna wash away  I believe this
Well  it's 3 AM  I must be lonely (I must be lonely)
 and sometimes
 like the heart don't lie
 yeah
 well
 yeah
 well
 yeah
 yeah
Out from behind the bitter ache
You're hangin' on the memory
You need most
You still want love
But not without affection
And instead of wishin' that it would get better
And it's good that I'm not angry
I'm not angry
Anymore
Cry when you cry
Run when you run
Love when you love
That you leave behind

So instead of wishin' that the road had shoulder
And you're blind
And it's good that I'm not angry
I'm not angry
I'm not angry and it's never been enough
It gets inside and it tears you up
And it's good that I'm not angry
I'm not angry
I'm not angry
He says anything to keep her by him
She takes  what she gets
And she never did flinch
With any mind would think that's all she gets
If you want you can get to know me well
We get along so we shouldn't argue
All these feelings  cloud up my reasoning
Yeah  they cloud up my reasoning
I know  but I still
Believe in ignorance as my best defense
So go on  wreck me
Funny how I carry on  and not be taken over
Will not roll over on anyone
'Cause anyone would stand up on my side

No  you never get nothing at all
Then she tells you that it's over
Boy  don't you hate it when it's over
I guess something just got lost
And it deeply saddens me

All these feelings  they cloud up my reasoning
We get along so we shouldn't argue  yeah
We get along so we shouldn't argue  yeah
 no
 I could say so much
 I was thinkin' if you were lonely
 it's best if we all keep this under our heads
 I couldn't tell
 no
 but things worked out just like you wanted to
 you don't know me
 try and give me some room
 no
 everyone here
 but we don't know how
 no
 everyone here
 I don't know how
 no
So toss me out  and turn in
And there'll be no rest for these tired eyes
I'm marking it down to learnin'  I am
I don't think that I could take another empty moment
I don't think that I could fake another hollow smile
Well  it's not enough just to be lonely
I don't think that I could take another talk about it
And just like me  you've got needs
And they're only a whisper away
And we've softly surrendered
To these lives that we have tendered away
But I would not sleep in this bed of lies
So toss me out  and turn in
And there'll be no rest for these tired eyes
I'm marking it down to learnin'
I'm marking it down to learnin'  'cause I can
I don't want to be the one who turns the whole thing over
I don't want to be somewhere where I just don't belong
Where it's not enough just to be sorry
Don't you know I feel the darkness closing in?

And there'll be no rest for these tired eyes
I'm marking it down to learnin'
Pick me up and dust me off
And if I get too tired to make it
Be my breath so I can walk
Give me more than I can stand
And when my smile gets old and faded
Shouldn't be so complicated
Just hold me and then
Can you help me I'm bent?
I'm so scared that I'll never
Get put back together
Keep breaking me in
And this is how we will end
With you and me bent
Could you paint me better off?

Everybody has those days
Where one soft sweet song's
Just enough to clear my head
Fall on real life
Is anybody left there sane?
And we slide on over and accept fate
Then it's bound to be a powerful thing
It's gettin' so damn creepy just nursin' this
And the technicolor dreams of black and white people
He thinks that livin' here's just plain
He's pushed down so hard
You can hear him start to sink
And it's one last round of petty conversation

She knows the party makes me nervous
In this stage we can't get hurt
Don't try to understand me
We're too cool to be alone
I found out one life just ain't enough
I need another soul to feed on
I'm wholly understated
I found silence in this place
An on and off again attraction
I need such amazing grace

I strap on one horse and prayed for luck
I dug another hole to bleed

I don't need you crowding up my space

Don't wear my heart on your sleeve
Like a high school letter
They've never been the people who we are
Don't mistake something more for something better

(Jesus is knocking on the door of your heart today)
I dreamed that the buildings all fell down
We sat on my back porch and watched it
Yeah well I dreamed that the world was crumbling down
We sat on my back porch and watched
In my head I heard the sound
Like fifteen strangers dancing
But oh how I want you to know me
Oh how I want you to know me
Oh how I wish you could own me

Without you I'd be gone
Don’t get me wrong  don't get me wrong
I got a past  but it's present tense
I keep it covered like it's rubber cement
I got a side that you ain’t seen yet
I know I'm looking dry  but I'm feeling soaking wet
I'm a razor  walking on a tight thread
A contradiction stranger than the fiction
Don't run away  I still need you

A problem with knowing the answer
In the absence of those who agree
I've  got access to information
That's very hard to find
So you must forgive me
For taking up your time
A lesson should be taught

And how sometimes it slides away
Time  sliding through the dead of night
Shaking 'till you start to cry

And falling apart is the only way

 I think I'm lonely now
 I think the hurt sets in
 I think I'm lonely now
 I think I just caved in
Like everything else that was
This too shall pass
And all of the words we said
We can't take back
Now every fool in town
Would've left by now
I can't replace
All of the wasted days
The memory of your face
I can't help thinkin'
Maybe if we ever coulda kept it all together
Where would we be?
A thousand lost forevers
And the promises you never were givin' me
Here's what I'm thinkin':
It won't be the first heart that you break
The one that you wrecked won't take you back
If you were the last beautiful girl in the world
(Last beautiful girl)

How you're sorry about
The way this all went down
You needed to find your space
You needed to still be friends
You needed me to-

You'd comfort me
You'd tell me 'bout forever
And the promises I never should have believed
Here's what I'm thinkin':
It won't be the first heart that you break

It's over now and I've gone without
'Cause you're everyone else's girl

This will all fall down
Like everything in the world
This too must end

Don't wanna be your pain
Don't wanna hold your sorrow
All in my hands
Don't wanna sell you something
I could never be
I know it feels like that
'Cause it's always dying hearts

Shooting stars with nowhere to go

All the laws of hope and dreams
What is lost or meant to be

And I  I would give anything
But for the grace of God  I'm here and still aware
We know the end is overrated
We've become the walls we raise

Standing on the edge without a prayer

Sleepwalkin' through the summer rain
In the tired spaces you could hear her name
When she was warm and tender and you
Held her arms around you
There was nothin' but her love and affection
She was crazy for you
Now she's part of somethin' that you lost
The difference between what you need
And what you wanna be
Night swimmin' in her diamond dress
Making small circles move across the surface
Stand watchin' from the steady shore
Feelin' wide open and waitin' for
Somethin' warm and tender

Light swimmin' right across your face and you think
The difference between what you need

Knowing that ever crash is bleeding the hourglass
And taking the strife from all our lives
