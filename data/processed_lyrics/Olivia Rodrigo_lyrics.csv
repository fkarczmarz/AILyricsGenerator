lyrics
"Just to ask you how you were
All I did was speak normally
Never doubted myself so much
I hate that I give you power over that kinda stuff
'Cause it's always one step forward and three steps back
I'm the love of your life until I make you mad
It's always one step forward and three steps back
And maybe in some masochistic way
I kind of find it all exciting
Will you walk me to the door or send me home crying?
It's one step forward and three steps back
I'm the love of your life until I make you mad
It's always one step forward and three steps back

It's one step forward and three steps back
Nobody knows her  but everybody wants to
That's what I see
Europe trips  kissing the dream boy's lips
Successful with a smile
She's everything that I'll never be
Twenty-first century girls are perfect
And I know it isn't real  it's all so stupid
But digital love  it still feels real to me
She looks like an angel  it's what they'll believe
Twenty-first century girls are flawless
And I say I didn't care  but if I am honest
It's hard not to feel like I'm never enough
He held the door  held my hand in the dark
And he's perfect on paper  but he's lying to my face
Does he think that I'm the kinda girl who needs to be saved?
And there's one more boy  he's from my past
We fell in love  but it didn't last
'Cause the second I figure it out  he pushes me away
And I won't fight for love if you won't meet me halfway
And I say that I'm through  but this song's still for you
All I want is love that lasts
Is all I want too much to ask?
Is it something wrong with me?
All I want is a good guy
Are my expectations far too high?
Try my best  but what can I say?
All I have is myself at the end of the day
But shouldn't that be enough for me?
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh  ooh-ooh
And I miss the days when I was young and naive
I thought the perfect guy would come and find me
Now happy ever after  it don't come so easily

You think he thinks you're pretty  I can guarantee he does not
I know you see me  do you think that you can win this game?
Yeah  you must think you're so attractive when you're playing dumb
The only thing you're showing him is how desperate you've become
I hope you trip over the boundaries that you've stepped right over
But go ahead and shoot your shot
Baby  let me know how it goes
Know him better than you thought
And I think you should know
You're his apocalyptic crush
He'd like you only if there was
No one left on Earth
Babe  I'm sorry if that hurts
But he's mine until then
You're his apocalyptic crush
If we all died  you'd be the one
Who'd get to kiss him in the ashes
So hey  what are the chances of World War III?
There's writing all over the wall
Shadows of us are still dancin'
In every room and every hall
There's snow fallin' over the city
You thought that it would wash away
The bitter taste of my fury
And all of the messes you made
My footsteps on the ground
You'll see my face in every place
But you can't catch me now
You'll feel it all around
But you can't catch me now
Bet you thought I'd never do it
Thought it'd go over my head
I bet you figured I'd pass with the winter
Be somethin' easy to forget

I'm comin' like a storm into your town
I'm higher than the hopes that you brought down
I'm comin' like a storm into your town
I'm higher than the hopes that you brought down
I'm comin' like a storm into your town
There's blood on the side of the mountain
It's turning a new shade of red
Don't burn the way you'd expect
Oh God  you're everything I hate and everything I adore
You said you like this one songwriter
Now I'm tryna write this song like her
And no one's gonna love you like I do  know that much I know
I'll be your morning cup of coffee  the light guiding you home
Oh  you're my medicine  my vice
You keep me up at night
So tell me  baby
Am I crazy in love or just crazy?
Wakin' up to everything around me turned cold (Mm-hmm-mm)
Don't wanna go back to second-guessin' my world
But all I've left behind has got me feelin' so torn (Mm-hmm-mm)
Am I takin' it for granted?
Everything that I've been granted
I keep lyin' awake with these dreams in the dead of the night
'Cause somethin' don't feel right
Will I take it all for granted?
And be leavin' empty-handed?
It feels so dramatic how erratic I think
Chasin' everything but lеave the ones that chasе me (Ah-ah-ah)

I wonder what I'd say if I knew back then
That the brown-eyed boy'd be my best friend
Now everything reminds me of you
Your pictures framed all over my room
As long as I'm your darling angel
I don't need anything in the world
'Cause I feel like the luckiest every second that I'm your girl
I wanna do everything with you
Is it me or does it feel more than high school love?
I love when you complain about things like traffic

'Cause I feel like the luckiest every second that I'm your girl

In the time that the Earth has traveled 'round the Sun
We've been together  hand-in-hand through it all
From the minute we kissed and my heart skipped a beat
To the night that we danced  I was swept off my feet
Sure as every year has to come to an end
I'd go spinnin' 'round the Sun with you
Again and again and again and again
I think I kinda  you know
I think I kinda  you know
Like the way that we flow
Like the way that we go
And I love
I think I kinda  you know
I can't help dreamin' of you
Guess I'm sayin' I don't not love you
You bought me coffee just to spill it on yourself
But you never take things seriously
It's kinda why I like you so much  honestly
And I wrote a note and left it folded in your pocket
You taped it to your wall in your New York apartment
Kissing in the taxi cab
'Til the driver gives us dirty looks back
You're crazy  but it's not in a bad way
Dancing on the highway
You make me feel older than seventeen
I honestly don't know why
I should ever leave your side
 but she looks a little older
 the cool vintage style
 and I don't blame you for it
 she's whole where I am broken
I don't fit in with these familiar faces
And the games they play don't mean a thing to me
I know there's so much more
Maybe I could be someone different
More than a yearbook memory
Am I on the right road?
Would my wildest dreams feel like home?
If no one knew my name
Would my wildest dreams feel like home?
Out of the old

Would my wildest dreams feel like home?
If no one knew my name
 is there any way I can help with it?
 but at the end of the day
Strange  strange  strange
Oh no  your voice through the phone
Tells me way more than I've ever wanted to know
You say that you need your space
And letting me go was the hardest thing you could do
'Cause you're crazy for me
And I'm the best that you ever had  hmm

Wind blowin' through our hair on the 405
You cradle me in your arms in the dark in the back
And your parents can probably see from the window
'Cause they say young love's a loss or it's a lesson
Radio is up and so is your guard
You don't know what to say
You're fakin' a smile  you say that you're fine
And maybe it'll all work out in time
You've always been good that way
Feel like I've done this before
You're fighting your tears as I open the door
And you deserve much more
Seems like I always hurt the ones I love
And I watch you cry  'cause I wasn't enough
Watch you disappearin' down the road
Seems like I always hurt the ones I love the most
Ones I love the most
Seems like I always hurt the ones I love the most
You told me your past
You hated your dad
And when you left college  couldn't wait to go back
'Cause you really trusted me
And what did I do? What did I do?
I built you up  abandoned you
And I'm too proud to say sorry

You tell me that I'm beautiful  but I think that's an understatement
'Cause I am more than what I am to you

I don't know who I would be
If I wasn't your baby
I built my life on your attention
On being an object of your affection
'Cause I'm with you but I miss me
Wish somebody had told me what I know now
I pay attention to things that most people ignore
And I'm alright with the movies
That make jokes 'bout senseless cruelty  that's for sure
And I am built like a mother and a total machine
I feel for your every little issue  I know just what you mean
And I make light of the darkness
I've got sun in my motherfuckin' pocket  best believe

Wait  is this the song with the drums?
I met a guy in the summer  and I left him in the spring
He argued with me about everything
He had an ego and a temper and a wandering eye
But he was so much fun  and he had such weird friends
And he would take us out to parties  and the night would never end
And when hе said something wrong  he'd just fly me to Francе
So I miss him some nights when I'm feeling depressed
'Til I remember every time he made a pass on my friend
Do I love him? Do I hate him? I guess it's up and down

I wanna get him back
I wanna make him really jealous  wanna make him feel bad

My middle school friend grew up alone
She raised her brothers on hеr own
Her parents hated who shе loved
She couldn't wait to go to college
She was tired 'cause she was brought into a world
Where family was merely blood
Does she know how proud I am she was created
With the courage to unlearn all of their hatred?
I miss you and I hope that you're okay
Address the letters to the holes in my butterfly wings
And when the clouds won't iron out
And the monsters creep into your house
And every door is hard to close

With the courage to unlearn all of their hatred
'Cause I love you
'Cause all I see are girls too good to be true
With paper-white teeth and perfect bodies
Wish I didn't care
I know their beauty's not my lack
But it feels like that weight is on my back
And I can't let it go
Com-comparison is killin' me slowly

'Bout kids who don't know me

Aren't you the sweetest thing on this side of Hell?
Dear angel Lacy  eyes white as daisies
Did I ever tell you that I’m not doin' well?
Like perfume that you wear  I linger all the time
Watching  hidden in plain sight
But it takes over my life  I see you everywhere
The sweetest torture one could bear
Smart  sexy Lacy  I'm losin’ it lately
I feel your compliments likе bullets on skin
Dazzling starlet  Bardot reincarnatе
Well  aren't you the greatest thing to ever exist?
Like ribbons in your hair  my stomach's all in knots
You got the one thing that I want
Try to rationalize  people are people
But it's like you're made of angel dust

Another thing I ruined I used to do for fun
Another piece of plastic I could just throw away
Another conversation with nothing good to say
I thought it  so I said it  took it 'cause I can
Another day pretendin' I'm older than I am
Another perfect moment that doesn't feel like mine
Another thing I forced to be a sign
Well  sometimes I feel like I don't wanna be where I am
Gettin' drunk at a club with my fair-weather friends
Push away all the people who know me the best
But it's me who's been makin' the bed
I'm so tired of bein' the girl that I am
Every good thing has turned into somethin' I dread
And I'm playin' the victim so well in my head
But it's me who's been makin' the bed
Me who's been makin' the bed
Pull the sheets over my head  yeah
Makin' the bed
And every night  I wake up from this one recurrin' dream
Where I'm drivin' through the city and the brakes go out on me
I can't stop at the red light  I can't swerve off the road
I read somewhere it's 'cause my life feels so out of control
And I tell someone I love them just as a distraction
They tell me that they love me like I'm some tourist attraction
They're changin' my machinery  and I just let it happen
I got the things I wanted  it's just not what I imagined
