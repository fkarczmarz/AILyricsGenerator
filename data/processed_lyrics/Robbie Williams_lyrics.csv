lyrics
"A poor man's made outta muscle an' blood
Muscle an' blood an' skin an' bones
A mind that's weak and a back that's strong
You loaded sixteen tons an' whaddya get?
Another day older an' deeper in debt
Saint Peter doncha call me cause I can't go
I owe my soul to the company store
I was born one mornin' when the sun didn't shine
Picked up the shovel and I walked to the mine
I loaded sixteen tons of number nine coal
You loaded sixteen tons an' whaddya get?
Another day older an' deeper in debt
Saint Peter doncha call me cause I can't go
I owe my soul to the company store
Fightin' and trouble are my middle names
Raised in the canebrake by an' ol' mama lion
Can't no high-tone woman make me walk the line

You loaded sixteen tons an' whaddya get?
Another day older an' deeper in debt
Saint Peter doncha call me cause I can't go
I owe my soul to the company store
If the right one don't getcha then the left one will
You loaded sixteen tons an' whaddya get?
Another day older an' deeper in debt
Saint Peter doncha call me cause I can't go
 a hit with the ladies
 his service is secret
 safe and sound
 so alone
 so alone
 saving Norfolk broads
 it's so elementary
 you'll know how it goes
 a pro's pro
 don't be jealous
 with an automatic
 safe and sound
 so alone
 so alone
 safe and sound
 so alone

 so alone
What was in your heart
When it stopped going
The whole world shook
A storm was blowing through you
Waiting for God to stop this
And up to your neck in darkness
Everyone around you was corrupted
Saying something
There's no dignity in death
To sell the world your last breath
We're still fighting over
Everything you left
I saw you standing at the gates
When Marlon Brando passed away
You had that look upon your face
Advertising space
No one learned from your mistakes
We let our prophets go to waste
All that's left in any case
Is advertising space

Through your eyes the world was burning
You seemed to say as you kept turning up
They poisoned you with compromise
At what point did you realize
Everybody loves your life but you?
A special agent for the man
Through Watergate and Vietnam
No one really gave a damn
Did you think the CIA did?
I saw you standing at the gates
When Marlon Brando passed away
You had that look upon your face
Advertising space
No one learned from your mistake
We let our prophets go to waste
All that's left in any case
Is advertising space
No one learned from your mistakes
We let our prophets go to waste
All that's left in any case

I've seen your daughter
I was scared but I wanted to
Does an angel contemplate my fate?
And do they know the places where we go
When we're grey and old?
'Cause I've been told
That salvation lets their wings unfold
So when I'm lying in my bed
Thoughts running through my head
And I feel that love is dead
I'm lovin' angels instead
And through it all
She offers me protection
A lot of love and affection
Whether I'm right or wrong
And down the waterfall
Wherever it may take me
I know that life won't break me
When I come to call
She won't forsake me
I'm lovin' angels instead
When I'm feeling weak
And my pain walks down a one-way street
I look above
And I know I'll always be blessed with love
And as the feeling grows
She breathes flesh to my bones
And when love is dead
I'm lovin' angels instead

And all sing-along
It's the time of the year where we all
The real festive cheer
The money disappears
You're not gonna win the human race
Put on your glad rags
Go get off your face
Grab bad Sharon from the office
Just in time for Auld Lang Syne
(Can't believe it's Christmas)
There's still a few crackers left to pull
(Can't believe it's Christmas again)
You know the score
Be one more
As sure as your face hits the floor
A hand jives not out of place
Put on your glad rags
Go get off your face
Grab bad Sharon from the office
Just in time for Auld Lang Syne
(Can’t believe it's Christmas)
There’s still a few crackers left to pull

Keep me safe from harm  in pouring rain
Feel I'm getting old before my time
As my soul heals the shame
I will grow through this pain
Lord  I'm doing all I can
To be a better man
Go easy on my conscience  'cause it's not my fault
I know I've been taught to take the blame
Rest assured my angels will catch my tears
Walk me out of here  I'm in pain
As my soul heals the shame
I will grow through this pain
Lord  I'm doing all I can
To be a better man
Once you've found that lover  you're homeward bound
Love is all around  love is all around
I know some have fallen on stony ground
But love is all around

Papa was king of the Congo
Deep down in the jungle
I started bangin' my first bongo
Every monkey'd like to be
In my place instead of me
I'm the king of bongo bong
I went to the big town
Where there is a lot of sound
From the jungle to the city
Looking for a bigger crown
I play my boogie
For the people of big city
But they don't go crazy
When I'm bangin' on my boogie
I'm the King of the bongo

Candice's inner business
She wants the boys to notice
Her rainbows and her ponies
She was educated
But could not count to ten
Now she got lots of different horses
By lots of different men
You can get some when they give it
Either a little too high or a little too low
Got no self-esteem and vertigo
'Cause she thinks she's made of candy
Either a little too loud or a little too close
Got a hurricane at the back of her throat

And if it don't feel good
What are you doing it for?
Now tell me

Sadly some friends disappeared
It's never been like this before
It feels like we're at war
So I wonder who's gonna decide
If we can do the Auld Lang Syne
I wish that I could do what I like
With this family of mine
We're going out of our minds
So what are we to do
About your FaceTimes and Zooms?
There's a room inside my mind
And it's always here for you
Nothing's gonna stop Christmas...
No chance
You can't take away our season
Like you can't take away the wine

Are yours the last eyes that I'll ever see
Staring into me?
Was I just because
A mistake in love
Two people who stop trying enough
Don't want a brand new life
This one's just right
Why would I throw it all away?
Won't you hold me now?
Just before I stop breathing
I know I promised I wouldn't leave here without you
Please  don't let me go
While they play the last song ever
The last chance to hold each other forever
Hold me now  I've still got words worth hearing
I just wanna be a human being
Hold me now  we all know what I'm fearing
I think I see the light  am I disappearing?

Except for one or two
Some of them are angry
Some of them are mean
Most of them are twisted
Few of them are clean

There’s only one of me
Single handedly raising the economy
Ain’t no chance of the record company dropping me
Press be asking do I care for sodomy
I’ve been looking for serial monogamy
Not some bird that looks like Billy Connolly
But for now I’m down with ornithology
Like a beat ya
Starting out
There's nothing left for you to fear
Shake your ass come over here
Now scream
I'm a burning effigy
Of everything I used to be
Let me entertain you
Life's too short for you to die
So grab yourself an alibi
Separate your right from wrongs
Come and sing a different song
Let me entertain you
Look me up in the yellow pages
I will be your rock of ages

And finally
And with his dungarees and roller blades smoking filter tips
Reclining in the passenger seat of my super-charged jet black Chevrolet
He had the soft-top down (he liked the wind in his face)
He said 'that's where we're gonna go - you need a change of pace'
And we hit the strip with all the wedding chapels and the neon signs
He said 'I left my wallet in El Segundo' and proceeded to take two grand of mine
We made tracks to The Mandalay Bay Hotel
Asked the bell boy if he'd take me and my monkey as well?
He looked in the passenger seat of my car and with a smile he said
Me and my monkey
With a dream and a gun
I'm hoping my monkey don't point that gun at anyone
Me and my monkey
Like Butch and the Sundance Kid
Trying to understand why he did what he did
Why he did what he did
We had a room up top with the panoramic views like nothing you'd ever seen before
He went to sleep in the bidet and when he awoke
He ran his little monkey fingers through yellow pages
Called up some escort services and ordered some okey doke
Forty minutes later there came a knock at the door
In walked this big bad ass baboon into my bedroom with three monkey whores
'Hi! My name is Sunshine - these are my girls
So I watched pay-per-view and polished my shoes and my gun
Was diggin' old Kurt Cobain singing 'bout lithium
There came a knock at the door and in walked Sunshine
Time!'

Said it was a burning ambition to see her before he died
Sheena was a blast baby but my monkey was ill
Couldn't help but notice this Mexican just staring at me
Or was it my monkey? I couldn't be sure
It's not like you'd never seen a monkey in rollerblades and dungarees before
Now don't test my patience cause we're not about to run
That's a bad ass monkey boy and he's packing a gun
Me and my monkey
Drove in search of the sun
Now me and my monkey
We don't wanna kill no mexican
But we've got ten itchy fingers
And one thing to declare
When the monkey is high
You do not stare...
Looks like we've got ourselves a mexican standoff here boy
Huh...
And I ain't about to run
Huh huh...
And we're praying it's not too late
Millennium
Some say that we are players
Some say that we are pawns
But we've been making money
Since the day that we were born
Got to slow down
'Cause we're low down
Run around in circles
Live a life of solitude
Till we find ourselves a partner
Someone to relate to
Then we'll slow down
Before we fall down
We've got stars directing our fate
And we're praying it's not too late
'Cause we know we're falling from grace

And detox for your rent
Overdose at Christmas

Refuse to keep the faith

Love the way they smiled at me
Held their face for eternity
Now let them all fly off
When it comes down
It all comes down
And you will not be found
Even if I make a sound
I'll be misunderstood
By the beautiful and good in this city
None of it was planned
Take me by the hand
Just don't try and understand

Just a product of my childhood
And still I find myself outside

After a long and sleepless night
How many stars would you give to the moon?
Do you see those stars from where you are?
Shine on the lost and loneliest
The ones who can't get over it
And you always wanted more than life
But now you don't have the appetite
In a message to the troubadour
The world don't love you anymore
Tell me how do you rate the morning sun
Stuck inside the rainbow years
And you could happen to me
'Cause I've been close to where you are
I drove to places you have seen
It all seems so familiar
Like they'd been sent to kill ya
It doesn't take an astronaut
To float into space is just a thought
The morning brings a mystery
The evening makes it history

If you are the starlet in the sun
Don't go wasting your time
'Cause there is no finish line
And you don't see anything
The night could take the man from you
A sense of wonder overdue
The morning brings a mystery
The evening makes it history

Why you feel weird

 not in a shy way

Where we all change
And we'd live our lives together
And not estranged
I didn't lose my mind
It was mine to give away
Couldn't stay to watch me cry
You didn't have the time
So I softly slip away
Sing me a love song (Sing me a love song)
Drop me a line (Drop me a line)
Suppose it's just a point of view
But they tell me I'm doing fine
I know from the outside (When they all stare)

And love is getting too cynical
Passion's just physical these days
You analyse everyone you meet

And cry yourself blind

May you find that love that won't leave you

And the past that cast the unsuitable
Instead of some kind of beautiful

(It'll come your way) Some kind of beautiful
(It'll come your way) Some kind of beautiful
(It'll come your way)
All your friends think you're satisfied
Forgot the time feeling petrified
When they lived alone
If you can't wake up in the morning
'Cause your bed lies vacant at night
May you find that love that won't leave you
May you find it by the end of the day
Something beautiful will come your way
And when I'm drunk I dance like me Dad
I've started to dress a bit like him
And early morning when I wake up
I look like KISS but without the makeup
And that's a good line to take it to the bridge
And you know and you know
'Cause my life's a mess
And I'm trying to grow
So before I'm old I'll confess
You think that I'm strong
My bed's full of takeaways
And fantasies of easy lays
The pause button's broke on my video
And is this real cause I feel fake
Teach me things I don't need to know

And you know and you know
'Cause my life's a mess
And it's starting to show
So before I'm old I'll confess
You think that I'm strong
If I did it all again I'd be a nun
The rain was never cold when I was young
Life's too short to be afraid
Step inside the sun
And you know and you know
Cause my life's a mess
And I'm trying to grow
You think that I'm strong
You think that I'm strong
Life's too short to be afraid
So take a pill to numb the pain
You don't have to take the blame
Life's too short to be afraid
So take a pill to numb the pain
You don't have to take the blame
Life's too short to be afraid
So take a pill to numb the pain
All the lonely hearts in London
Caught a plane and flew away
And all the best women are married
All the handsome men are gay
You feel deprived
Yeah  are you questioning your size?
Is there a tumour in your humour?
Are there bags under your eyes?
Do you leave dents where you sit?
Are you getting on a bit?
Will you survive?
You must survive
When there's no love in town
This new century keeps bringing you down
All the places you have been
Trying to find a love supreme
A love supreme
Oh  what are you really looking for?
Another partner in your life
To abuse and to adore?
Is it lovey dovey stuff?
Do you need a bit of rough?
Get on your knees
Yeah  turn down the love songs that you hear
'Cause you can't avoid the sentiment
That echoes in your ear
Saying love will stop the pain
Saying love will kill the fear
Do you believe?
You must believe

When there's no love in town
This new century keeps bringing you down
All the places you have been
Trying to find a love supreme
A love supreme
I spy with my little eye
Something beginning with (Ah)
Got my back up
And now she's screaming
So I've got to turn the track up
Sit back and watch the royalties stack up
I know this girl  she likes to switch teams
And I'm a fiend but I'm living for a love supreme

You'll get covered in dog doo
I'm gonna get off the sea saw
Say goodbye to your mama
Pop Rock and Coke
I'll blow your sock off
Teach how to laugh at daddy's dirty jokes
If you want to get ahead in Tinsel Town
Turn that smile upside down
Happy people don't have sex
And singers with everything they need
Everybody swings both ways
Shall we dance?
I'm getting hot on the pavement
Can you find me some grass?
I have a certain arrangement
Up the Khyber Pass
Fruit cake and tea
And after I've done her
Well you can do me

Just follow me you enormous clown
Clever people don't have sex
And singers with everything they need
Everybody swings both ways
Face it Robbie
Uh huh?
Beat me up on the beach
What a lovely holiday
There's nothing funny left to say
This sombre song would drain the sun
But it won't shine until it's sung
No water running in the stream
The saddest place we've ever seen
Everything I touched was golden
Everything I loved got broken
On the road to Mandalay
Every mistake I've ever made
Has been rehashed and then replayed
As I got lost along the way
Bom bom bom ba da dup bom bom
Bom bom bom ba da dup bom bom
Bom bom bom ba da dup bom bom
Bom badom
There's nothing left for you to give
The truth is all that you're left with
Twenty paces then at dawn
We will die and be reborn
I like to sleep beneath the trees
Have the universe at one with me
Look down the barrel of a gun
And feel the moon replace the sun

There's nothing funny left to say
For once in your life  let it be
Why don’t you hand it all over?
And sing it out loudly with me?
Soon we will all be forgotten
But while we’re all still here on Earth
Sing about love and forget about loss
And shout for whatever you’re worth
(Christmas time)
C’mon  spread the word
(Christmas time)
Doesn’t everyone hurt?
Do you remember the good old days
When all the children would cheer?
Santa’s nearly here
And a happy new year
The time for change is here

Mum’s got a lot to get together
And dad  he provides what he can
They’ve been saving up forever and ever and ever
Just to do it all over again

Do you remember the good old days

Santa’s nearly here

A time for change is here
A time for a change
Must be here
So send all your loving out into the world
It’s your gift
Do you remember the good old days
When all the children would cheer?
Santa’s nearly here
And a happy new year
Then laugh at you and hate you
Then they fight you  then you win
When the truth dies  very bad things happen
They're being heartless again
I know it's coming  there's gonna be violence (Want you to love me)
I've taken as much as I'm willing to take (Want you to be)
Why do you think we should suffer in silence? (The heavens above me)
When a heart is broken  there's nothing to break (Eternally)
You've been mixing with some very heavy faces
The boys have done a bit of bird
They don't kill their own and they all love their mothers
I know it's coming  there's gonna be violence (Want you to love me)
I've taken as much as I'm willing to take (Want you to be)
Why do you think we should suffer in silence? (The heavens above me)
The heart is broken  there's nothing to break (Eternally)

Dreaming of the sun she warms
You should see me in the afterlife
Picking up the sons of dust

What you think is worthless I'm adoring
You don't want the truth  truth is boring
I've got this fever  need to
Leave the house  leave the car
Leave the bad men where they are
I'll leave a few shells in my gun
And stop me staring at the Sun

Then to only breed in captivity is pointless
I've been doing what I like
Only you know me
What a waste of war this peace
Baby steps and two more sleeps
Till I get to say sorry
I get hysterical historicals of love
It's just chemicals
Give us something to stop me
Only you know me
Since you went away
My heart breaks everyday
You don't know 'cause you're not there
You simply found the words to make
All modern feelings fade away
Only you know me
